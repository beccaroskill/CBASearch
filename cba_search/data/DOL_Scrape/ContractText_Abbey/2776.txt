16.	Nothing in this Article shall be construed to give the University the right to violate applicable laws or direct employees to violate applicable laws.
ARTICLE 3
PROFESSIONAL NURSING
17.	The University has the authority, responsibility, and obligation to make available high quality nursing care for patients and to provide and maintain a safe and suitable environment for the practice of nursing by the employees covered by this Agreement. The University provides employees time and support services to complete their performance expectations. When, following discussion with the employee, the supervisor agrees that sufficient time or support services have not been provided to meet an expectation, that expectation will be changed or deleted, or a plan will be developed to provide sufficient time or support services. Performance expectations may be amended as job requirements change. Staff will not be demoted if inability to meet role expectations is due to lack of coverage alone. An employee who believes that he/she is being held accountable for meeting an expectation without being provided sufficient time or support services may appeal to the Nursing Director.
17A. Nurses employed in areas not reporting directly to Nursing will be assigned to a nursing director most closely associated with the department or clinical area the nurse works in for the purpose of responding to concerns related to nursing practice or implementation of the Agreement. When nursing care is provided, it is understood that the utilization of multidisciplinary teams include the
3
registered nurse to ensure continuity of care across the healthcare continuum and self-care efficacy.
Professional accountability, the utilization of evidence based practice, respectful and effective communication, and the commitment to safety are important attributes of nursing practices. We acknowledge that continuous learning is essential and continuous evaluation and improvements are necessary to maximize patient care outcomes. To this extent, registered nurses closest to the work, will be included in unit/departmental areas decision-making processes as it relates to the application of direct nursing care related activities.
18.	The University recognizes employees covered by this Agreement are licensed Registered Nurses who are authorized to practice nursing by the State of Michigan and who have the responsibility and obligation to provide high quality nursing care for patients within the resources and environment provided by the employer.
If an employee believes that an assignment will compromise patient care and safety, he/she will notify the manager or designee through the usual chain of command for prompt problem solving. Notice of the concern will be promptly given to the charge nurse or supervisor. The RN will continue with that assignment, and may do so under protest. The supervisor will address the situation and provide resolution promptly.
19.	Employees and the University share the responsibility for providing nursing care, which is consistent with the needs and goals of the patient using the facilities provided by the University.
19A. The design and building of new facilities or the expansion or revision of existing facilities will involve the consideration of work flow, new technology and structure utilization for registered nurses. Committees formed to address these matters will include employees from the affected area and will include at least one representative selected by.the UMPNC.
SECTION A. CLINICAL AUTHORITY
20.	Professional Registered Nurses govern nursing practice and are a provider and coordinator of direct patient care services as part of the multidisciplinary team. The University recognizes that employees are members of the Nursing profession and, as such, are employed to assume the responsibilities for assessment, planning, implementing and evaluating nursing care including patient education and discharge planning. The “Practice of Nursing” as defined by the Public Health Code, means the systematic application of substantial specialized knowledge and skill, derived from the biological, physical, and behavioral sciences, to the care, treatment, counsel, and health teaching of individuals who are experiencing changes in the normal health processes or who require assistance in the maintenance of health and the prevention or
4
management of illness, injury, or disability. (Part 172 sec 333.17201 Public Health Code). However, in this regard, these functions are practiced with the patients for whom employees are given responsibility within the resources and environment provided by the University.
20A.	It is the nursing profession that determines the scope of nursing practice and it is
the registered nurse who is responsible and accountable for the provision of nursing care. The Association and the Employer recognize the contributions of assistive personnel in providing patient care. Unlicensed assistive personnel shall provide support to registered nurses’ practice. For any given patient assignment, the registered nurse utilizes professional judgment and assessment skills to evaluate the qualifications of the person to whom she/he delegates. The registered nurse evaluates the patient’s needs, the complexity of the task, and the environment in which the task must be performed. For any given patient assignment, the registered nurse supervises and determines the appropriate utilization of assistive personnel, including but not limited to LPNs and Paramedics, involved in the provision of direct patient care. If the work of the assistive personnel is not delegated by the RN, it is not the responsibility of the RN to supervise, monitor, evaluate or provide guidelines for this work. To this end, Registered Nurses will be provided job descriptions of the assistive personnel, including any specialized training, which has been provided for these assistive personnel. Additionally, Registered Nurses may have input in the development of any unit specific training and/or competencies. The RN, through his/her professional judgment, has the right and the responsibility to question patient care orders/directives that are potentially harmful to the patient. The RN will utilize the established medical chain of command to question patient care orders/directives that are potentially harmful to the patient 4.
21.	We recognize the principle that clinical nursing skills are most effectively evaluated by a registered nurse. Therefore, wherever practicable, as determined by the University, an employee’s clinical nursing skills will be evaluated by a Registered Nurse. In those areas where there is also a nurse manager, the nurse manager will be involved in the evaluation to some degree. The employee will have the option of having an individual meeting with the nurse manager, and/or the option of requesting that the nurse manager be present during the evaluation meeting. An employee, who receives a written clinical evaluation by a nonnurse, may file a written request for a review of the evaluation, provided the written request is filed within 15 calendar days of receipt of the written evaluation. In the event that the employee files for such a review, the review will be conducted by a registered nurse5.
22.	Employees are responsible for coordinating the work and teaching, and contributing to the evaluation of clinical nursing skills of designated nursing personnel. In addition, coordination of services is an integral part of nursing care and employees have the responsibility to facilitate and collaborate in
4 See Intent Note for Paragraph 20A
5 See Intent Notes for Paragraph 22
5
providing this care. There will be adequate Registered Nurse staff to provide training to assistive personnel to support completion of the competency assessment. Registered Nurse input will be included in the annual competency assessment and performance evaluation of assistive personnel.
22A. To this end, utilizing the principles of interest based problem solving, concerns regarding the scope of nursing practice and the utilization of assistive personnel may be addressed as a first step at the unit level. The issue will be addressed at the next appropriate workload review committee meeting and all interested unit staff will be invited to participate in the discussion. Problem solving in ambulatory care units will also include representation of nursing, administration and medical leadership. If consensus is not reached by the workload review committee members, the Director of Nursing and the Association leadership will be invited to attend a special workload review meeting. In this event, the Association leadership will participate in discussions with the Director of Nursing prior to a decision being made and communicated.
SECTION B. MAINTAINING AND UPGRADING NURSING PRACTICE
23.	It is the responsibility and obligation of each employee to maintain and upgrade his/her knowledge and skill affecting the quality of patient care. In this regard, it is the responsibility and obligation of the University, within available resources, to assist employees by establishing programs and/or providing resources for orientation and staff development. Employees are also encouraged to contribute to upgrading nursing practice by proposing nursing research opportunities and developing, conducting and participating in those opportunities, which are made available. Nothing herein should be construed to prevent assignment of these duties. It is understood that programs or education required by the institution will occur on paid time.
24.	The University supports nursing research. This support may take the form of time, money, support services and nurse consultation, all within available resources. The University also provides educational opportunities for development of research skills, including program management and budgeting, within available resources.
SECTION C. POLICIES, PROCEDURES, PRACTICE AND NEW INITIATIVES
25.	Policies, procedures and new initiatives affecting nursing care will be developed with input from employee end-users, or by employees affected by such policies and procedures. The parties agree that high quality patient care can best be accomplished through a joint effort between employees and management. The parties further agree that active and early participation by employees in regard to program planning, facility design, new technology and program development, and the impact of budget changes on patient care will
6
promote such high quality care. Where involvement does not occur the Association and the University will meet to rectify the omission before the initiative is completed. To this end, designated committees, which address Professional Nursing, will be populated as follows:
1)	Committees whose membership is elected will have one (1) of the UMPNC members on that committee appointed by the Association.
2)	For Committees whose membership is appointed, the Association will appoint 50% of the total UMPNC member appointed slots on that committee, within the roles identified by the University.
3)	In this regard, this paragraph is limited to standing committees and excludes time limited task force, forums and other work groups that report back to standing committees.
Any initiative which directly affects nursing workload will be brought to the Workload Review Committee and end users for evaluation.
These employees will suffer no loss of pay as a result of such participation6.
SECTION D. PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES
26.	High quality patient care requires the combined, coordinated and interdisciplinary efforts and services of a variety of personnel and the specific identification and assignment of tasks required for proper patient care to certain categories of personnel, to the exclusion of other categories is not practical nor in the best interest of quality patient care. It is understood, therefore, that employees covered by this Agreement have a primary responsibility of providing nursing care, which does not require them to function as a clerk, messenger, transporter, custodian, maintenance employee or dietetics worker for substantial periods of time except in rare and unusual circumstances.
27.	Questions arising under Paragraphs 21, 25 and the question of whether an
individual employee is being required to function as a clerk, messenger, transporter, custodian, maintenance employee or dietetics worker for substantial periods of time except in rare and unusual circumstances, and whether the University has taken reasonable steps to ensure the safety of employees under paragraph 17, may be proper subjects of Article 46 and 47, the Dispute Resolution, Mediation and Arbitration Procedures. Any other questions arising under this Article may be referred to Conferences under Article 48, but are not subject to the Dispute Resolution, Mediation and Arbitration Procedures.
SECTION E: TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT
27A. The parties recognize that technology is intended to enhance clinical practice and judgment. The University is committed to ensuring that employees have access to appropriate training, technology and equipment to perform their duties safely and effectively. Employees will be provided with accessories
6 See Intent Note for Paragraph 25
7
necessary for individual employees to utilize technological equipment with ease. It is understood that programs, technology training, or education required by the institution will occur on paid time and patient care responsibilities will be adjusted if requested, in order to ensure time to complete these activities. The introduction of any technology will be implemented in compliance with regulations, statutes, and labor laws.
ARTICLE 4
PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND EVALUATION
28.	A performance evaluation program will be continued at the option of the
University.The Framework Renewal Process and evaluation will occur simultaneously on the employee’s anniversary date. If continued, the performance evaluation program will incorporate the following factors:
28A. The principle of informing employees about their performance through supervisory evaluation and/or other methods as determined by the supervisor.7
28B.	A yearly performance plan will be prepared. At the option of the supervisor, the plan will be prepared either by the employee and a supervisor or by all employees within each classification in the unit and a supervisor. The manager and employees will jointly identify professional activities, goals and the means to achieve them.
28C. Each employee will be provided with the appropriate performance plan prior to the evaluation period and be made aware of the evaluation process and their part in the process.
28D. Performance evaluations will be made by measurements only within each classification and only within each unit, based upon performance standards established for each unit. Examples of employee strengths and weaknesses as well as a plan for performance improvement will be included in each written evaluation. These examples, either written or verbal, will be related with sufficient detail so that the employee can respond8.
28E. Only employees educated in peer review will be allowed to participate in the peer review processes. All peer review evaluations must be signed and made available to the employee being evaluated.
33.	The Association will be provided with the evaluation tool for each unit, for each classification and the performance standards established for each unit.
34.	The Association will also receive any revisions to the evaluation tool or the standards.
7 See Intent Note for Paragraph 28A
8 See Intent Note for Paragraph 28D ; See Paragraph 333P.3-6; See PTO Guidelines, Addendum B, #13)

ARTICLE 5 NO-INTERFERENCE AND NO-LOCK OUT GUARANTEE
SECTION A. NO-INTERFERENCE
35.	The Association and its officials, its employees, its members, its affiliates, or members of the bargaining unit will not cause, support, encourage or condone, nor shall any employee or employees concertedly take part in, any action against or any interference with the operations of the University during the term of this Agreement.
36.	In the event of any such action or interference and on notice from the University, the Association, without any delay, shall take whatever affirmative steps are necessary in an attempt or attempts to prevent and bring about the termination of such action or interference. Such affirmative steps shall include the immediate disavowal and refusal to recognize any such action of interference and the Association immediately shall instruct any and all individuals to cease their action and inform employees that their action is a violation of the Agreement subjecting them to disciplinary action, including suspension of all benefits under this Agreement and discharge.
37.	In addition, the Association shall, within twenty-four (24) hours of notice to the Association by the University of any such action or interference, deliver the following notice to the University:

ARTICLE 13
STAFFING AND SCHEDULING
SECTION A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
88.	The parties agree that a process to determine staffing levels to provide nursing care for the projected nursing workload in the patient care units is necessary. Further, the University, in those areas where a patient classification system determined by the University to be valid and reliable is available, will utilize this system as one of the management tools to assist in determining staffing needs based on measured workload. In those areas, which do not currently utilize such a classification system, the University will continue to improve internal means to determine staffing, including evaluating classification systems when such systems may be useful. A joint meeting, with the Association and the University, will be held every 3-6 months with the Directors from Ambulatory Care, to discuss and share data on workload, for the purpose of monitoring and measuring activity for projecting growth. All benchmarks used to set staffing in Ambulatory Care are shared with staff and UMPNC annually. The actual staffing levels or the inclusion of other management tools is not subject to the Arbitration procedure. The budgeted staffing will include an allowance for paid time off. The University and the UMPNC will meet to evaluate existing workload/acuity models and make recommendations for capital purchase.
88A. A joint meeting, with the Association and the University, will be held prior to any hospital-wide full time equivalent (FTE) reduction, concerning the effect on patient care, workload, staff mix, appropriate delegation, safety and work redesign.
89.	Whenever an employee's workload concerns have not been satisfactorily addressed, they may be referred to the unit workload review committee referenced in Article 14, "Workload Review".
90.	The parties further agree that scheduling employees to cover a twenty-four (24) hour/seven (7) day a week hospital operation is complex and thus requires the cooperation of all employees and supervisors in approaching this task12.
90A. Each 24/7 unit will designate a percentage of the staffing component as Monday through Friday with at least one employee assigned to work no weekends13.
91.	Sequence for development of unit schedule14:
1)	Unit employees scheduled to meet appointment fraction.
2)	Dual unit employees.
12 See Intent Note for Paragraph 90
13 See Intent Note for paragraph 90A
14 See Intent Notes for Paragraphs 91, 185, 185B; see Addendum A, Per Diem Guidelines
17
3)	Unit employees requesting to be scheduled over appointment to provide coverage for an absence due to short-term disability or FMLA15.
4)	Honor standing requests from part-time employees requesting to be scheduled over appointment15 16.
5)	Regular float employee, as available, to consistently replace an employee on anticipated absence.
6)	Regular available float employee.
7)	Unit part-time employees requesting to be scheduled for additional nonovertime hours for the current schedule17.
8)	Per Diem employees.
9)	Employees who are offered and accept an extra holiday off during schedule development will be scheduled for their full appointment fraction during the holiday week.
10)Employees requesting to be scheduled their full appointment during a holiday week when they have the holiday off.
11)Part-time employees requesting to be scheduled over appointment during a holiday week when they have the holiday off.
SHIFT ROTATION
92.	The University shall endeavor to schedule employees in the Professional Development Framework (Levels A - E), in the same rotating shift assignment in the same unit for approximately the same number of non-day shifts, prorated for appointment fraction, with a variance of no more than three (3) non-day shifts worked between any two employees in the same unit and rotating shift assignment over a period of one (1) four (4) week schedule, excluding those employees who express a preference for more frequent non-day shifts. Employees in RSAM and pay grade N-4 working on the same unit and in the same shift rotation will work no more off-shifts than the highest number worked by an employee in the Professional Development Framework, prorated for appointment fraction.
SCHEDULING OF CONSECUTIVE CALENDAR DAYS
93.	The University shall not schedule employees to work more than seven (7) consecutive calendar days except in an emergency or at the employee's request. If an employee is scheduled to work in an emergency, the employee will be paid a premium of two dollars ($2.00) per hour for all consecutive calendar days worked in excess of seven (7) calendar days. This premium shall not apply to employees requesting to work more than seven (7) consecutive calendar days18.
NIGHT SHIFT
94.	The University shall consider the night shift to be the first shift of the day no matter how much time into the previous calendar day the shift begins.
15 See paragraph 185P
16See Paragraphs 163E.3, 163I.3, 163M.3, 163Q.5, 163U.1

STAFFING AND SCHEDULING GUIDELINES
95.	In this connection, the University will provide the Association with a copy of Staffing and Scheduling guidelines developed for each Director of Nursing area at University of Michigan Hospitals. Those areas where guidelines do not presently exist will endeavor to develop and implement them six (6) months from the date of the execution of this Agreement, but not later than one (1) year from this date. Some or all employees in the area will be provided opportunity to comment on the Guidelines before implementation. Changes in the Guidelines will also be provided to the Association.
95A. A unit’s schedule is developed based on that unit’s Staffing Model. The Staffing Model and any changes to the Model will be made by the manager and are driven by patient care needs and based on a number of variables including, but not limited to: HPPD or other relevant metrics, acuity, professional association standards, average census, staff mix, average admission, discharges and data trends. Any changes to the Staffing Model will be presented to the staff and WRC for feedback prior to implementation.
Once the schedule is developed, there will be a process created by the unit that will be utilized to adjust daily staffing to meet the immediate needs of the unit to provide patient care and other work to be done.
Some of the variables to be considered by the charge nurse will include but not limited to:
•	acuity
•	staff/skill mix
•	census
•	admissions
•	discharges
•	transfers
•	meetings and other non-direct care work
•	specialty patients
•	procedures
•	and coordination activities.
REST PERIOD
96.	There will be a rest period, which may be taken at a time and place and in a manner, which does not interfere with patient care. The rest period will be with pay and will not exceed fifteen (15) minutes for each four (4) hours of work. The rest period is intended to be a recess to be preceded and followed by a work period. Consequently, it may not be used to cover a staff member's late arrival to work or early departure, nor may it be regarded as cumulative if not taken. Rest periods and lunch breaks are necessary to promote health and well-being of nurses, patients and their families.
96A. All employees will be provided an opportunity for an uninterrupted lunch break of at least 30 minutes, without pay, to be taken in a place that does not interfere with patient care. Lunch breaks will be scheduled based on the unit WRC guidelines. Employees fulfilling work obligations in lieu of lunch shall be paid overtime accordingly.
19
SCHEDULING LIMITATIONS
97.	The parties agree that limitations on schedule rotation, working beyond appointment hours and required weekends are desirable objectives. In this connection, the University shall:
ROTATING SHIFT ASSIGNMENT AND SHIFT PREMIUM
98.	Schedule employees on a rotating shift assignment to work no more than two (2) shifts of eight (8) or more hours with only one change in one scheduled calendar week. As such, if an employee is scheduled to work in excess of this principle, that employee will receive a premium of seventy-five cents ($.75) per hour for all hours worked in that calendar week. This premium applies only to those employees scheduled to work more than two shifts with one change in one calendar week and does not apply to employees who express a preference for such schedules. Starting times, which do not vary from earliest to latest by more than three (3) hours, shall not be considered a different shift.
99.	It is understood that nothing herein shall preclude assigning an employee to any shift because of employee absences and variations in the workload of the unit. However, employees will not normally be assigned to work more than two (2) different shifts, except at the employee's request19.
WEEKEND ASSIGNMENT AND BONUS
100.	The University shall endeavor to schedule employees to work no more than two (2) out of four (4) weekends for employees who are scheduled in four (4) week blocks with the following exceptions:
1)	Employees who have a Monday through Friday schedule will not work weekends20.
2)	Employees who transfer or who are hired into positions, which were posted to include assignment to every weekend, will be scheduled to work more than two out of four weekends;
3)	Individual employees who express a preference for weekend work schedules may be scheduled to work additional weekends21.
4)	An employee who receives Paid Time Off for one or more weekend shifts will not be required to work on a weekend previously scheduled off to make up for the time lost due to unscheduled absences. Further, an employee will not be required to work on a weekend at the beginning, end or in the middle of a continuous period of Paid Time Off (PTO) contiguous with the weekends.
5)	If an employee is scheduled to work in excess of the principle regarding weekend work, that employee will receive a premium of four dollars and fifty cents($4.50) per hour beginning with the first hour of the fifth weekend shift worked in a four (4) week schedule.
6)	In this regard, employees who request to work split weekend shifts will not be eligible for the weekend premium, except in the situation where the
19 See Intent Note for Paragraph 99
20 See Paragraph 90A
21 See Intent Notes for Paragraph 100
20
employee has not requested to work split weekends but has been scheduled in this manner. Such employee will then be eligible for the premium starting with the first hour of the third weekend.
7)	After granting two (2) out of four (4) weekends off, if additional weekends off are available, they shall be distributed as equitably as practicable.
8)	If the weekend hours worked to qualify for the above bonus is paid at the overtime rate, the weekend bonus will be paid at the overtime rate.

100B. Weekend shifts that are assigned off for an employee who is regularly scheduled to work every weekend will be considered worked for the purpose of qualifying for the weekend bonus. If the employee who works every weekend volunteers or requests to take a weekend shift off, that shift is not credited as a weekend shift worked for purposes of the weekend bonus22.
101.	For purposes of this Article, the definition of a weekend shall be the forty-eight
(48)	hour period between the first shift of Saturday (nights) and the third shift of Sunday (evenings). A weekend shift worked to qualify for the bonus is defined as working at least one shift of at least eight hours during this time frame.
GENERAL SCHEDULING PROVISION
102.	The University shall endeavor to schedule employees to work hours consistent with their appointment hours as provided in Article 15, Overtime.
103.	Ambulatory Care nurses working at multiple sites will be notified of the specific work location when the schedule is posted.
104.	Employees will be notified of their work schedule, including shift length, as part of the scheduling process at least two (2) weeks in advance. Once a schedule is posted, the manager will not cancel a portion of a shift in exchange for hours elsewhere in the schedule, unless the employee voluntarily agrees to the change.
105.	Units, which intend to schedule employees in such a manner as to avail themselves of the Provision of Section B. of Article 15, (Overtime) will do so only with the concurrence of enough employees so as to make such scheduling feasible.
106.	Whenever scheduling is done in four-week blocks, these four-week periods will coincide with the Memorandum of Understanding on Weekends23.

130.	In all cases where more than one (1) employee has requested a shift change to an available regular job opening on the unit, assignment shall be on the basis of seniority, most to least.
131.	Shift selection for an employee transferring into the bargaining unit and/or a unit shall be based on length of service from the date of such transfer for six (6) months; thereafter, such an employee's seniority becomes effective26.
Shift Reassignment
131A. When work hours need to be reallocated, employees and managers will meet to jointly identify and construct new individual schedules, and then these schedules will be selected using the following process27.
1)	Unit employees will be informed of the need for reassignment and the shift(s) and/or rotation(s) from which the reassignment could be made. (Reassignment means changing of an employee's straight shift, shift rotation and/or shift length to a different straight shift, shift rotation and/or shift length). Volunteers will be sought for this reassignment and will be reassigned in seniority order provided that the reassignment:
a)	Does not require the use of overtime;
b)	Does not require other employees to change their shift assignments; and
c)	Does not increase other employees' off shift rotations above the unit maximum.
26 See Intent Note for Paragraph 131
27 See Intent Note for Paragraph 131A
24
2)	If there are no volunteers for the reassignment, the Unit Workload Review Committee will meet to consider the following options:
a)	Increase off shift rotations up to the unit maximum;
b)	Reassign the least senior employee who is able to do the work;
c)	If option (b) would require multiple other reassignments or off shift rotations above the unit maximum, then reassign the employee with the least seniority who can be reassigned without requiring multiple or other reassignments;
d)	Have all employees take turns covering the shift. (This would be voluntary and would be used only if the coverage required would be infrequent).
3)	If the Unit Workload Review Committee chooses an option, other than those described in Step 2 above, this option will be presented to the Chairperson of the Association, the Director of Nursing, and the Director of University of Michigan Health System Human Resources Department, or their designees, for approval.
131B. An employee who is reassigned will have his/her original shift assignment restored in seniority order when the need for reassignment ends, provided that s/he indicated the desire to return to his/her prior shift or rotation.
131C. In order to restore reassigned employees to their original shift assignments, any positions posted for the unit will be for the shift to which employees were reassigned.
SECTION C. NON-DIRECT PATIENT CARE ACTIVITIES
132A. It is understood that nurses will be involved in both direct and non-direct patient care activities. To this end, time for non-direct patient care activities will be allocated as unit workload allows or as the Role Specific Advancement Model requires28.
132A.1 When implementing new initiatives involving non-direct patient care activities, planning will include compensated time necessary to carry out the initiatives29.
132A.2 Recognized unit and department committees will meet on a regular basis. It is not an expectation that employees participate on committees without pay. To that end, a variety of measures will be utilized on each unit to insure participation with pay30.
132B. Employees will make arrangements for non-direct patient care activities with their manager. The allocation of time will be mutually agreed to and based upon each individual's performance plan.
28 See Paragraph 17; see Intent Note for Paragraph 132A
29
See Paragraph 17
30
See Paragraph 17
25
132C. The agreed upon division of time will be reviewed annually at the time the performance plan is created and at the request of either party with the understanding that short-term fluctuations may be negotiated.
132D. It is understood that the needs of the unit may necessitate re-scheduling an employee to perform direct patient care on a day that was originally set aside for the performance of non-direct patient care activities. In this event, alternative time will be scheduled. In addition, if there are specific days, for which the employee cannot be available for staffing; these days shall be negotiated with the manager.
ARTICLE 14 WORKLOAD REVIEW
133.	When a problem of excessive workload arises, it must be addressed to ensure the long-term viability of the unit, including quality of patient care and employee satisfaction31.
Unit Workload Review Committee
134.	In this connection, and at the discretion of the Association, unit workload review committees will be established on each unit as follows:
a)	The nursing supervisor will serve on the committee and equal numbers of unit employees shall be selected by the University and the Association such that there will be at least four (4), but no more than six (6) employees on the committee.
b)	In Ambulatory Care units, there will be two (2) to six (6) employees and the nurse manager. The office manager may participate but will not be a voting member and will not replace the nursing supervisor.
c)	One half (1/2) of the membership (those selected by the Association and the University) will rotate off the committee annually. Members will serve for two years and, if reappointed, will serve an additional two-year term. New members shall be identified by December 31, each year with appointments beginning on February 1. Association members may be replaced by the Association when determined appropriate.
d)	Each committee will designate monthly meeting times, or more often at their discretion, to address workload concerns and formulate plans of action. The unit will plan core staffing to assure release time for committee members. Patient care needs may require a change in the release time. Attendance at committee meetings while on over appointment or overtime is at employee discretion with supervisor approval.
e)	Each committee shall elect a chairperson other than the nurse manager32.
31 See Intent Note for Paragraph 18 and Refer to NP-MOU
26
f)	Any concern related to the Workload Review Committee by members, University or the Association, will be handled in special conference. The concern will be jointly reviewed by the WRC, the University (manager and nursing director) and Association designee and an action plan established.
g)	A workload review committee will be convened in focus areas in Ambulatory Care. The attendees will include ACNRP and Decentralized float area staff representation. The meetings will occur at least quarterly and will have an agenda that includes the coordination of staffing and scheduling.
Workload Review Committee Resources
135.	Members of unit workload review committees and the Association will be provided with education and information related to staffing and scheduling procedures, methodologies, considerations and tools, including available objective data.
135A. This information will include, if applicable, but is not limited to, fiscal considerations; tools, including patient classification system data and staffing data; other factors which may influence staffing and scheduling, such as road trips, delegation, training and mentoring responsibilities; the responsibilities of workload review committees, including relevant empowerment presentation; and the committee process.

Workload Review Committee Responsibilities
136.	Following a review of data, or whenever a workload concern is identified, the committee will review a number of possible actions, including, but not limited to, temporary modification of task expectations, obtaining additional personnel, resources and modification of the workload. When expanding services, the University will engage in joint discussions with the workload review committees of the units affected by the change to solicit committee input into staffing scenarios. Where there is no WRC, the UMPNC will designate representatives. In any given situation, the actions most appropriate to implement will depend on a number of factors. These include, but are not limited to, the experience and skill level of the staff, the extent and expected duration of the problem, the nature of the work to be done, the availability of personnel, resources and time saving equipment. An analysis of available objective data, such as patient acuity and workload index data will be included in the review.
136A. Workload review committees on 24/7 units will review the unit data on a monthly basis and submit a corrective action plan to the Association and the University whenever designated thresholds are exceeded. Staffing/Workload Monthly Reports will be reviewed at each workload meeting and a collaborative action plan based on the reports will be developed if indicated. 1) Workload review committee minutes and the Staffing/Workload Monthly Report will be available to the unit staff.
28
2)	In the event that a Workload review committee meeting is canceled, the manager and the Workload review committee chairperson are required to meet and complete the Staffing/Workload Monthly Report.
3)	The monthly minutes and the Staffing/Workload Monthly Report will be submitted to the Association and to Nursing Administration. JIT will review quarterly the list of the workload meetings.
136B. The unit workload review committee will have input related to hours per patient day (HPPD) and other relevant metrics during development of the unit budget. RN Hours Per Patient Day (HPPD) will reflect actual direct patient care hours by RN’s. It is understood that HPPD or other relevant metrics are only one tool to be used in making staffing decisions. There will be a review of benchmarks (NDNQI, NACHRI, Specialty Association standards/guidelines, etc.) at the unit workload review committee at least quarterly and then annually with the Joint Implementation Team.
136C. Each Workload Review Committee will develop an acuity tool, if applicable,, based on all benchmarks and relevant metrics associated with the patient population on that unit, within sixty (60) days of ratification (Nov. 6, 2011), make recommendations related to staffing patterns for each shift to ensure adequate resources to meet patient care needs. The acuity tool will be reviewed by the unit staff for feedback and input. A copy of the tool will be provided to UMPNC and the Director of Nursing upon completion. The WRC will review the acuity tool at least annually, or sooner if new initiatives or departmental changes are introduced that impact nursing care. The acuity tool will be utilized to assist in establishing staffing guidelines in accordance with professional standards of care and safety that promote positive patient outcomes.
136D. Additional Workload Review Committee responsibilities are described in Paragraphs 22A, 89, 131A.2-3, 158, 163A.1-4, 170D.2-3, 333H.b, 601E.
136E. Every two years, or when a significant change occurs, a joint team on each unit will analyze the required behaviors of Professional Development Framework employees and make recommendations to the manager. The Professional Development Framework will be based on behavior expectations33.
Problem Solving Process Related to Workload Concerns
137.	a. Actions agreed upon, which are under the control of the supervisor, will be implemented by the supervisor.
b.	When the committee has recommended actions or resources external to the unit, which cannot be implemented by the supervisor, the supervisor will discuss the recommendations with the Director of Nursing (or designee) and Association or designee. This meeting will occur within three (3) working days following identification of the need. If the Director of Nursing agrees with the proposed solutions, implementation will begin within seven (7) calendar days.
33 See Addendum D
29
c.	If the Director of Nursing or the Association designee does not agree with the proposed solutions, she/he will meet with the workload review committee within three (3) working days to discuss the issues to arrive at a mutually agreed solution. When the unit workload review committee is unable to find resolution, the Director of Nursing, and Medical Director, as appropriate, will meet with the Workload Review Committee to develop mutually agreeable solutions.
d.	If the Director of Nursing and the unit workload review committee are unable to reach agreement, the Chief Nurse Executive (CNE) and UMPNC Chair or designee, Unit WRC and the Director of Nursing will meet within thirty (30) days to review the unresolved workload issues and mutually determine the next steps. The implementation of the action plan will begin within a mutually agreed upon timeframe.
e.	When the Director of Nursing, the Association designee and the unit workload review committee agree that temporary reduction in the workload through managing the census is appropriate; the Director of Nursing will have the authority to implement this.
f.	The workload review committee will be responsible for development of a communication tool to be posted on each unit, which will communicate how the issues of workload, census, acuity and nonproductive time are being addressed.
General Conditions
138.	The Association will be informed of the times and locations of unit workload review committee meetings, by the chairperson, not the committee and may have a representative attend when available. Each unit workload committee will be attended by either the area or district representative at least annually34.Workload committee orientation is mandatory for all new members and chairpersons annually.
138A. Meetings of all committees under this Article shall be exclusive of the Dispute Resolution Procedure and no dispute shall be considered at the meetings, nor shall negotiations for altering the terms of this Agreement be held at such meetings. The role of staff nurses on committees shall be to provide professional judgment to matters within their expertise. Discussions will include those topics related to the charge of the committee except for mandatory subjects of bargaining, which shall be reserved for the bargaining process.
139.	Any questions regarding this article may be reviewed through the second step of the dispute resolution procedure. Any unresolved questions following the second step of the dispute resolution procedure may be appealed to the Executive Director of University Hospitals who shall conduct a hearing and issue a decision within two (2) calendar weeks of any such appeal. However, no questions arising from this Article may be reviewed through Arbitration.
34 See Intent Note for Paragraph 138
30
ARTICLE 15 OVERTIME
SECTION A. DEFINITIONS
140.	For the purposes of the Article and the computation of overtime premium, the following definitions shall apply:
141.	Day" means the twenty-four (24) consecutive hour period beginning with an employee's starting time on each workday.
142.	"Calendar Week" means seven (7) consecutive calendar days beginning at midnight between Saturday and Sunday.
SECTION B. OVERTIME PREMIUM
143.	An employee assigned to a classification in the Professional Development
Framework or Role Specific Advancement Model, will be paid an overtime premium of one half (1/2) the employee's rate of pay per hour and shift premium, if applicable, dependent upon the work schedule to which assigned, for the time paid as follows:
Either
144.	In excess of eighty (80) hours in a two (2) calendar week work schedule or in excess of eight (8) hours in a day; or
145.	In excess of forty (40) hours in a one (1) calendar week work schedule or in excess of an employee's regular daily schedule of work of not less than eight (8) hours in a day; or
146.	In excess of one hundred twenty (120) hours in a three (3) calendar week work schedule or in excess of twelve (12) hours in a day. As of July 1, 2008, this paragraph applies only to classifications within the Role Specific Advancement Model.
147.	To accommodate an employee’s schedule request, the overtime premium in Paragraph 143 will be waived provided there are seven (7) hours between the end of one shift and the beginning of the next shift. In no case shall an employee delivering direct patient care be permitted to return to work following an overtime shift with less than seven (7) hours off between shifts except as noted in Paragraph 175D35.
35 See Intent Notes for Paragraph 147 and Article 13, Staffing and Scheduling
31
148.	In calculating hours to determine when the overtime premium is payable the following will be used:
1)	Time when actual work is required and is performed36.
2)	Time off for which pay is received pursuant to Article 30-Extended Sick Time, Article 32-Holidays, Article 35-Funeral Leave Pay/Bereavement, and Article 36-Jury and Witness Service will be counted. Time worked pursuant to Article 29-Paid Time Off will count unless the PTO is unscheduled or PTO that has been granted through the incremental PTO process.
149.	In addition, excused paid time during an assigned schedule of work pursuant to Article 40, (Committees), Article 46, (Dispute Resolution Procedure and Mediation Procedure), Article 47 (Arbitration Procedure), Article 48, (Conferences), Article 49, (Professional Activities and Education), Article 50, (Release Time for Association Business) will be counted in calculating hours to determine when the overtime premium is payable.
150.	Employees in pay grades N-4, N-5 and N-6 are not entitled to the overtime premium but will receive compensation, in addition to their monthly salary, at each employee's rate of pay per hour and shift premium, if applicable, for paid time in excess of the hours set forth above and calculated as provided above37.
SECTION C. PYRAMIDING
151.	Overtime premium shall not be pyramided, compounded, or paid twice for the same time paid.
SECTION D. SCHEDULING
152.	The parties agree that overtime assignments should be filled by volunteers. On those occasions when overtime is assigned, an employee will work unless the employee is excused or has fulfilled their individual overtime limit (See applicable Overtime System Paragraph 163D.1, 163H.1) The University will endeavor to give employees forty-eight (48) hours advance notice of overtime assignments. Except for extraordinary circumstances, an employee shall not work in excess of sixteen (16) hours in a twenty-four (24) hour period. Any employee who feels that overtime has been disproportionately assigned to him/her shall discuss the matter with his/her supervisor.
153.	The following process will be used to fill needs through the use of overtime, above appointment hours and the use of Central Staffing Resource including both regular and temporary employees, and Per Diem employees:
154.	Sequence for filling open shifts after the schedule is posted38:
36	See Intent Note for Paragraph 148.1
37	See Paragraph 655
38	See Intent Note for Paragraph 185
32
1)	Employees needing hours to meet their appointment fraction.
2)	Regular float employees.
3)	Per Diem or Temporary employees working straight time.
4)	Regular employees requesting overtime or over appointment hours.
155.	Volunteers for overtime/over appointment hours will have priority over
assigned overtime. When a decision must be made between two or more employees, tie-breakers will be the fewest number of overtime/over appointment hours worked in the scheduling period, and then by the date of the last occurrence, and then by seniority, highest to lowest39.
155A. Assigned overtime/over appointment will not affect employee-initiated obligations for work beyond their appointment fraction, nor will the employee-initiated obligations relieve the employee of assigned overtime/over appointment.
156.	Where there are no volunteers and unit employees must be assigned, the hours will be assigned equitably among all the employees on the unit using the applicable overtime system. When a decision must be made between two or more employees who have equal amounts of overtime/over appointment hours, the decision shall be based on the last occurrence and then on seniority, lowest to highest unless the assigned overtime would cause the employee to work beyond their individual limit40.
157.	If overtime/over appointment hours are no longer needed, the hours will be canceled in the following sequence41.
1)	An employee on overtime/over appointment who is volunteering to be canceled will be allowed to leave.
2)	If there is more than one volunteer, the employee with the greatest amount of overtime/over appointment hours worked in the scheduling period will be allowed to leave. If the volunteers have an equal number of overtime/over appointment hours, then the most senior employee will be allowed to leave.
3)	If there are no volunteers, the employee with the greatest number of overtime/over appointment hours within the scheduling period will have their hours canceled. In case of a tie, the overtime/over appointment hours of the least senior employee will be canceled.
4)	Prescheduled over appointment hours will be the last to be canceled.
Recording Systems
158.	Workload Review Committees will determine equitable recording systems to determine distribution of overtime and assigned time off. These two (2) systems will be complementary. Overtime/over appointment hours will be recorded in a
39 See Paragraph 158
40 See the applicable Overtime System Paragraphs 163D.1, 163H.1
41 See Intent Notes for Paragraphs 157 and 185
33
manner that honors the principles of equity and seniority consistent with the applicable Overtime System. Workload Review Committees will determine specific application of the recording systems42.
159.	Any regular employee who is unit based and wishes additional hours on units other than their own, will make their scheduling availability known to the CSR or ACNRP.
160.	Employees will not be required to alter their scheduled shift or their typical lunch length to avoid the payment of overtime.
SECTION E.	OVERTIME MANAGEMENT
163.	The parties agree that in the operation of a tertiary care medical facility, some overtime is unavoidable. We further agree that it is desirable to minimize these occurrences. To this end, occurrences of overtime shall be monitored and addressed according to the following procedures43 44.
Overtime Trigger
163A. When the sum of all unanticipated over appointment and overtime hours on a unit is:
1)	4%-5.5% of all hours worked on that unit within a four (4) week schedule, for a period of two consecutive months, a mandatory action plan will be developed by the WRC and submitted to UMPNC and the Nursing Director44..
2)	5.6% or greater of all hours worked on that unit in a four (4) week schedule, for a period of 4 consecutive months, a mandatory monthly meeting will occur with the WRC chair, nursing manager and Nursing Director. An action plan with timeline and next steps will be prepared.
3)	5.6% of all hours worked on that unit in a four (4) week period, for a period of 6 consecutive months or for those units at greater than 5.6% upon ratification (Nov. 6, 2011) of this agreement, an initial mandatory meeting will be held within 90 days of ratification (Nov. 6, 2011) and an action plan will be developed. In addition, mandatory monthly meetings will be held with the WRC chair, nursing manager, and Nursing Director45.
4)	For any unit that exceeds the five percent (5%) trigger as described in Paragraph 163A.1, for any six (6) of the preceding twelve (12) scheduling periods, additional regular positions will be added to the Central Staffing Resource/ACNRP cluster targeted for that unit.
42 See Intent Note Paragraph 158; Paragraphs 163C - 163K Overtime Systems, Paragraph 180D, Voluntary Float
43 See Intent Note for Paragraph 163
44 See Intent Notes for Paragraph 163A
45 See Intent Note for Paragraph 163A.3
34
Overtime Systems

4)	Central Staffing Resource (CSR) and Ambulatory Care Nursing resource Pool (ACNRP) employees will have one individual limit for over appointment/ overtime hours worked regardless of working outside of their cluster.
Exceptions to Individual Limit and Overtime incentives
163E. 1) Overtime/over appointment hours resulting from employee-initiated schedule changes, including trades or coverage related to incremental PTO access, (p. 333.P.1) coverage for employees who are absent due to extended sick time or FMLA, and “double-backs” will not be credited toward the individual limit, or the overtime incentives47;
2)	Daily overtime that does not increase the appointment fraction does not count toward the limit, but does count as an occurrence.
3)	Over appointment hours, that are scheduled prior to a schedule being posted, as a result of a part-time employee's request, will be eligible for the over-appointment incentives, but will not be credited toward the individual limit48.
4)	Employees who are scheduled off on a holiday and who request, prior to the schedule being posted, to work their full appointment fraction during
46 See Individual Limit and Premium exceptions, Paragraph 163E, see Additional Management Actions, Paragraph 163F
47 See Paragraphs 147, 185P, 355
48 See Paragraph 91
35
the holiday week will not have those hours credited toward the individual limit or the overtime incentives.
5)	For a period of six (6) months following an employee's reduction in appointment fraction, the employee must work the equivalent of his/her former appointment fraction plus the applicable individual limit to be eligible for the overtime incentives.
6)	On-call hours accumulated as a result of call systems established under paragraph 170D will be considered part of the individual limit and will be credited toward the limit at the time the commitment is made. Only hours worked will apply toward eligibility for the overtime incentives.49
7)	OR/PACU/Procedure Areas: On call and over appointment/overtime hours worked as a result of traditional holiday, weekend and off shift on-call systems are not eligible for the overtime incentives and will not be credited toward the individual limit.
8)	Incidental OA/OT that is less than one (1) hour is not applicable to the individual limit or eligible for the overtime incentives.50
Overtime Incentives
163F. 1) With the exception of Ambulatory Care, when an employee’s individual limit is met, all over appointment hours worked will be paid at 1.167 times the individual employee’s hourly rate. All hours of overtime worked will be paid at 1.75 times the individual employee’s hourly rate.
2)	Whenever a non-Ambulatory Care unit has been above the 5% overtime trigger for six consecutive periods, any over appointment hours worked will be paid at 1.5 times the individual employee’s hourly rate and all overtime hours worked will be paid at 2.25 times the individual employee’s hourly rate. This rate will continue until the unit has an overtime trigger of less than 5% for one period.
163G. Ambulatory Care Individual Limit: No employee will be required to work more than eight (8) hours of overtime/over appointment time in a four-week scheduling period on his or her home unit51.
163H. 1) Prescheduled hours resulting from a part-time employee's request for additional hours do not contribute toward the individual limit.
2)	A schedule change that results in daily overtime but does not increase the appointment fraction does not contribute toward the individual limit.
Ambulatory Care: Overtime Incentives
163I. When an employee in Ambulatory Care unit works above their individual limit for a period of three (3) scheduling periods, all hours worked will be paid $2.50/hr, retroactive to the first month of exceeding their individual limit. No scheduling period for which the $2.50 amount was paid will be included in subsequent eligibility.
49 See Intent Note for Paragraph 163E-6
50 See Intent Note 163-Oa/OT Flowchart
51 See Individual Limit exceptions, Paragraph 163H
36
163J. For areas other than those defined as a unit for the purpose of staffing and scheduling, factors affecting workload will automatically be reviewed for problem resolution by the Workload Review Committee when an employee is over the eight-hour limit. If the workload review committee is unable to resolve the issue, further review and problem resolution will occur consistent with the intent of the Collaborative Practice Model.
163K. Ambulatory Care and Michigan Visiting Nurses Alternate Schedule: A schedule may be altered at the employee's request and at the manager's discretion, within FLSA regulations, to meet patient care requirements. The total number of hours scheduled shall not exceed eighty (80) hours in a two (2) week pay period for employees who normally work eight (8) hour shifts, and forty (40) hours in one (1) calendar week for employees who normally work shifts greater than eight (8) hours52. Alternate schedule changes within the pay period or workweek may be made with manager approval. Weekly/bi-weekly timesheets must accurately reflect the hours worked.
ARTICLE 15 - A ASSIGNED TIME OFF
164A. In the event there is more staff scheduled for a shift than are required to meet the workload, it may be necessary to reduce the number of employees scheduled for that shift. When all overtime and over appointment hours have been canceled in accordance with Paragraph 157, then the following procedure shall be used to make an adjustment53.
1)	Supervisory employees will be released from direct patient care.
2)	CSR/ACNRP temporary employees will be released back to CSR/ACNRP for reassignment.
3)	Employees who have responsibilities that are non-direct will be released from direct patient care if they have work to accomplish.

164C. An employee who volunteers to be off or is assigned off may be requested to be on-call with appropriate compensation56.
164D. If a sufficient number of volunteers is not found, employees may be assigned off in seniority order, lowest to highest, including employees who have responsibilities that are non-direct who are providing direct patient care. Time assigned off will be recorded by occurrence and distributed equitably among all unit employees57. In this connection, the University will endeavor to limit the designation so that no employee will be sent home for more than sixteen (16) hours in a two (2) calendar week period58.
1)	This assigned time off procedure does not apply to Holidays59.
164E. When volunteers to float are in competition for available hours, whether CSR/ACNRP regular employees floating outside of their home cluster or employees floating from their home units, the employee assigned off will be determined by seniority and then by the last date of assigned time off, assuming that the CSR/ACNRP employee cannot be reassigned60.
164F. In addition, the employee shall have the option of using PTO time, provided the employee has sufficient accrued PTO time, or approved no pay time. This includes units, which may close prior to the completion of an employee’s shift. The employee may request or may be offered the opportunity to make up the time and return PTO to bank in the same week. Absences incurred under this Article shall not adversely affect the employment record or benefits of the employee.
164G. Employees assigned time off will have first priority to recoup hours in the pay period/week without incurring overtime.
164H. Employees may volunteer for alternate work through the Central Staffing Resource or ACNRP, which will count as equivalent to assigned time off for purposes of recording and equitable distribution. If work is available, the regular employee will have priority over any temporary or Per Diem employee for available hours on a unit, on which they are qualified to work and priority over unit employees on overtime.
164I. A regular employee who reports for work at the employee's scheduled start time when the employee has not been notified that no work is available may be assigned alternate work. If no alternate work is assigned and the employee is assigned off, the employee shall receive four (4) hours pay at the employee's hourly rate, plus shift premium, for any shift. This applies to regular, over

ARTICLE 20 VARIABLE ACTIVITY
178.	The parties agree that the appropriate deployment of employees to provide high quality nursing care for all patients in a large tertiary care medical center is a complex task. Further, marked changes in the activity of individual units within such an institution present a particular challenge to the flexibility and creativity of the staff to respond to these changes within the limitations of finite resources. In order to respond to these changes, the parties agree that a variety of methods to allow redeployment of staff, while maintaining the principles of volunteerism and equity of distribution, be made available. It is mutually desirable that responses to these changes be made without incurring overtime
SECTION A. VOLUNTARY FLOAT
Float Bonus
179.	An employee who agrees to float from their unit at times of reduced staffing needs for at least four (4) hours will be paid eight dollars ($8.00) per hour or will be credited with one (1) hour of PTO for every four (4) hours worked in float status in addition to their hourly wage. The choice will be made by the employee at the time floating occurs. This is only applicable to regular hours, not overtime or over appointment70.

Voluntary Float General Principles
180B. Employees who are floating will not be required to float more than one time during a shift. An employee may volunteer to return to the home unit if they are no longer needed on the receiving unit.
180C.	If an employee is on-call for one unit, he/she will not be required to report to
work and then float to another unit for that shift72.
180D. Credit for float occurrences will be recorded as overtime/over appointment or assigned time off in the unit recording system as established according to Paragraph 158, at the employee's direction.
70 See MOU 768 - 770
71 See Intent Note for Paragraph 180A
72 See Intent Notes for Paragraph 180C
44
181.	Orientation will include the full range of activities that the employee will be expected to perform, and will be based on existing competencies used in any new employee's orientation73.
181A. When there is mutual agreement between an employee and a manager that the employee may float to enhance professional skills, the manager will commit to providing the necessary training and the employee will commit to working an agreed upon number of shifts.
182.	An employee who is voluntarily floating has the right to refuse a particular assignment, based on competency. The supervisor and the employee will meet to resolve the issue. No discipline can be initiated against the employee who is floating until a meeting between the employee, supervisor and the Association is held to review the issues.
SECTION B. WORK ASSIGNMENT
183.	Employees will not normally be reassigned from their regular unit. In the event that the University believes it is necessary to reassign employees in response to a situation that will last for a period of time and/or is anticipated, the University will discuss the matter first with the Association. If it becomes necessary temporarily to reassign an employee to another unit, volunteers will be sought from among the employees being considered for reassignment. When an employee is reassigned, he/she will be given an orientation consistent with the duties to be performed. Orientation will include the full range of activities that the employee will be expected to perform, and will be based on existing competencies used in any new employee's orientation. A nurse who does not believe that he/she has been adequately oriented will not be reassigned. Once orientation is completed and competencies demonstrated, the employee may be reassigned. An employee who has been temporarily reassigned to another unit will not be assigned to be in charge. If an employee is temporarily reassigned, the employee will do so unless:74
183A. After discussing the matter with the employee's supervisor, the employee refuses to be reassigned because of an asserted lack of competence to perform the assignment(s); or,
183B. The employee is excused by the employee's supervisor.
183C. In the event that after discussing the matter with the employee's supervisor, the employee refuses to be reassigned because of alleged lack of competence to perform the assignment(s); and in the event that disciplinary action is contemplated, the provisions of Section D. of Article 45, (Discipline) shall be applicable even though discharge may not be contemplated. In this regard, discipline, if any, pertaining to the professional judgments regarding the
73 See Intent Note for Paragraph 18
74 See Intent Notes for Paragraphs 18 and 183; See Paragraph 605B
45

In cases where there is a need to permanently transfer employees due to variable activity, the Employer will select the most senior applicant who volunteers from each identified unit and who possesses the required qualification; desired qualifications will not be considered.
184G. For the probationary employee who is reassigned, the probationary period may be extended at the discretion of the manager as follows:
1)	For like areas as defined in Addendum D, the probationary period will be extended from the date of the work assignment, but no less than 45 days or to the end of the original 6 month probationary period, whichever is longer, but not result in a probationary period of less than 6 months in total. The maximum probationary period will be 6 months and 45 days.

ARTICLE 25 PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES
232.	An employee is a "probationary employee" for the employee's first six (6) calendar months of employment at the University or for the first six (6) calendar months following transfer into the bargaining unit. The employee will receive a written evaluation on or before the day the employee completes four (4) calendar months of employment. In the event that the employee does not receive such a written evaluation, the employee will no longer be a probationary employee. In addition, the University may discontinue an employee's probationary period at any time by written notice to the employee90.
232A. Non-probationary University employees transferring into the bargaining unit will have access, during the bargaining unit probationary period, to personal medical, family medical and childcare leaves as outlined in Article 38. Such transferring employees absent for personal illness or injury will have access to accrued PTO and, upon meeting the two-year service criteria, short-term disability (STD) as described in Article 30. Upon return to work following an
90 See Intent Note for Paragraph 232; see Paragraph 710
56
absence, the employee will resume the probationary status attained prior to the absence and will be subject to the provisions of this Article.
233.	As an alternative to termination, and at the option of the University, an employee may transfer during the probationary period, provided the transfer is arranged through the University of Michigan Health System Human Resources Department. In such an event, and at the option of the new supervisor, the probationary period may start over, and all the provisions of this article will apply. A probationary transfer may be requested by the employee, following discussion with the supervisor, or may be suggested by the supervisor when termination is being contemplated. A probationary employee will be limited to one such transfer.
234.	A "probationary employee" may be oriented to the charge nurse assignment under the direct supervision of a Nurse Manager, Nurse Supervisor/Clinical Nurse Manager or their designee who is a qualified non-probationary licensed Registered Nurse who performs the charge nurse role on a regular and recurring basis.

235.	An employee who had completed a probationary period prior to termination, and who is rehired within one year of the termination date, may be a "probationary employee" for the employee's first three (3) months of employment.
236.	No matter concerning the discipline, layoff or termination of a "probationary employee" shall be subject to the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Procedures. At the request of the Association Chairperson, the University, through a designated representative, shall discuss the termination or transfer of a probationary employee, provided the request is made within seventy-two (72) hours following the notification to the Association Chairperson of the termination or transfer.
237.	A "probationary employee" shall have no seniority, except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, until the "probationary employee" has completed the probationary period. Upon completion of the probationary period, the employee will acquire seniority from the employee's date of hire. An employee who has a continuous period of temporary employment counted towards completion of his/her probationary period as outlined below will acquire seniority from the date the employee began that continuous period of temporary employment or six (6) months prior to the regular date of hire, whichever is later. The request to change the seniority date based upon temporary work must be made within six (6) months of the date of hire in order to be timely. Initially, eligibility for insured and accrued benefits is prospective from the date of the
91 See Paragraph 605B
57
change from temporary employment to regular employment. Thereafter, accrued benefits will be based on the seniority date.
238.	An individual's temporary and /or Per Diem employment status will count toward completion of the probationary period if all of the following conditions are met:

240.	The individual performed the full range of duties of a probationary employee on the unit as assigned;
241.	The individual met the work schedule expectations as a probationary employee on the unit as assigned; and

92 See MOU 768 - 770
93 see: "unit" definition, Article 26, Reduction of the Working Force and Recall Procedures, Section A
58
Conference is to determine the appropriate unit definition, to coordinate the reduction in force and placement process once the need is identified, and to reach joint agreement on the application of this contract language to MVN/MVC nursing.
246.

248A. A joint team will meet to coordinate the Reduction-in-Force/replacement process once the need is identified. This team should include the Association chairperson or designee, CSR manager, a Human Resources representative and the Chief of Nursing or designee.
249.	A reduction of the work force shall be by and from each classification within a unit in accordance with the following procedure:

94 See Intent Note for Paragraph 247
95 See Intent Note for Paragraph 248
59
251.	Thereafter, employees in the affected classification within a unit shall be removed from the classification in order of seniority, beginning with the employee with the least seniority, provided that the employees remaining in the classification have the ability to perform the work, which remains or will remain in the unit96 97.
252.	In the event that a Per Diem employee is employed in a unit, a non-probationary employee, who is to be removed from any unit, shall have the option of replacing the Per Diem employee, contingent upon ability to perform the work available. An employee exercising this option does not become a Per Diem employee.
253.	A removed, or about to be removed, non-probationary employee shall receive priority consideration for positions in their own clinical area, including priority over all other employees, for a period of two (2) weeks from the date of notification of reduction in force. Thereafter, the employee will have priority consideration as defined in Paragraph 247 (over applicants for employment). Priority consideration for positions will occur in the following order97:
1)	Regular job openings in the same classification.
2)	Regular job openings in the same pay grade.
3)	Regular job openings in each succeeding lower pay grade.
253A. An employee with the required qualifications as defined in Article 27 will be placed in a regular job opening, if any, prior to any other applicant for employment. Prior to placing an employee in a lower pay grade, the University will attempt to place the employee in the same pay grade first98.
254.	Should a removed or about to be removed employee not be placed in a regular opening as provided in Paragraph 253, the employee will replace a probationary employee in a Professional Development Framework classification within the employee's own clinical area first and thereafter in other clinical areas of the University, provided the employee has at least two (2) years seniority and the ability to perform the work of the probationary employee.
254A. In the event an employee is not placed as described in the above paragraph, that employee with two (2) years seniority may replace the least senior employee in the University, provided that the difference in seniority between the two (2) employees is greater than one (1) year and the employee has the ability to perform the work of the employee to be replaced. Employees placed as a result of this process cannot transfer to another position for one year.
255.	Should a removed employee not be placed, the employee will be laid off.
96 See Intent Note for Paragraph 251
97 See Paragraph 247 & Intent Notes for Paragraph 253
98 See Intent Note for Paragraph 253A
60
256.	In no case will the University be required to rearrange work schedules to accommodate employees, provided however, it is understood that the application of this procedure may require work schedule changes, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 13, Staffing and Scheduling.
257.	An employee scheduled for a mandatory reduction in hours may elect to be covered by the provisions of 252, 253, 254, 254A and 255 above.
258.	Contingent upon available work, an employee who is about to be laid off may be placed by the University in the CSR or ACNRP, as a regular employee at the employee's request. Employees must meet the qualifications and be willing to float to exercise this option. Employees placed in this manner will have recall rights consistent with paragraphs 264 and 264A-E. If there are more employees than can be placed in the CSR or ACNRP in this manner, they shall be placed in seniority order, highest to lowest. In this event, that employee will have priority over any Per Diem employee or over any unit based regular employee requesting work above appointment hours on another unit through CSR/ACNRP for available hours on a unit, which they are qualified to work. An employee choosing this option will need to do so during their notification period99.
258A. Employees electing placement in CSR or ACNRP pursuant to Paragraph 258 may exercise this option for a maximum of ninety (90) days, effective the first day of work in CSR or ACNRP, unless there is joint agreement to extend the placement. In the absence of an extension, the employee may be offered a position for which he/she is qualified. Rejection of such an offer will be considered a voluntary termination100.
259.	A process to assist employees who have been subject to a reduction-in-force will be established. This will include Association representation during RIF notification when practicable and a designated Human Resource representative as a resource for the employee. The employee will be provided information on rights and responsibilities under this Agreement, and regarding the application and interview process101.
260.	An assessment of the employee's qualifications and interests will be made with the employee. The employee will have a choice among available positions for which he/she is qualified, whenever practicable.102
260A. An employee who has the ability to perform the work and does not accept whatever placement is offered at any time during the thirty (30) day or ninety (90) day notice period, that provides at least eighty percent (80%) of the employee's base rate and eighty percent (80%) of the employee's appointment
99 See Intent Note for Paragraph 258
100 See Paragraph 260A
101 See Intent Notes for Paragraph 259
102 See Intent Note for Paragraph 260
61
hours, regardless of work schedule, shall be considered a voluntary quit at the end of the thirty (30) or ninety (90) day notification period, whichever is applicable pursuant to Paragraph 248103.
261.	If an employee is laid off, additional assistance will be provided in applying for University positions in other classifications outside the bargaining unit. If there are training positions available (internship), employees on notice of lay off or who have been laid off will have priority consideration for those positions. If retraining funds are available, the employee may apply for retraining funds.
262.	If an employee accepts a training position, she/he will give a written commitment based upon the length of the training program and will forfeit recall rights104 105.
262A. A non-bargained for regular, registered nurse, removed as a consequence of a reduction- in-force, may replace the most recently hired probationary employee in their clinical area, then in other clinical areas if no positions are available.
SECTION C. TEMPORARY LAYOFFS
263.	In the event employees with seniority are to be laid off, because of a temporary discontinuance of operations, or any portion thereof, temporary adjustments in the work force can be made without application of the Reduction of the Working Force or Recall Procedures. The Association will be notified of such temporary adjustments. If such adjustments continue for more than seven (7) calendar days, the Association can request the University to apply the Reduction of the Working Force procedure and the University will do so within the following seven (7) calendar days. During a period of temporary adjustment, the provisions of reference Paragraph 331 shall not be applicable.
SECTION D. PROCEDURES FOR RECALL
264.	An employee with seniority who is on layoff for less than eighteen (18) months, contingent on ability to perform the work, will be recalled to the same position from which laid off and will be given priority consideration for other regular job openings (1) in the same classification and clinical area from which the employee was laid off (2) in the Professional Development Framework classification in the clinical area from which the employee was laid off and (3) in the Professional Development Framework classification in other clinical areas within the University. However, prior to the application of (2) and (3) the University will place the employee in a regular opening in the employee's same classification and thereafter in other regular openings in other classifications in the same pay grade and then in each next succeeding lower pay grade, provided the employee has the required qualifications as defined in Article 27105..
103 See Intent Note for Paragraph 260A
104 See Paragraphs 266, 282, 294.d & 652B.4 and Intent Notes for Paragraph 288
105 See Intent Note for Paragraph 264
62
264A. Employees who have been subject to a reduction-in-force and placed in another regular position will have the following recall rights:
264B. Within eighteen (18) months following removal from a position, an employee with seniority will be recalled to the same position if it becomes available, contingent on ability to perform the work.
264C. When implementing the recall procedures outlined in Paragraph 264, 264A and 264B, the following process will be applied to fill available positions:
1)	An employee with seniority who is on layoff for less than eighteen (18) months, contingent on ability to perform the work., will be recalled to the same position from which laid off.
2)	Then any employee, who has been on the recall list for at least ninety (90) days, if qualified, may be offered an available position, even if the employee has not applied for the position. Failure to accept a position offered that provides at least eighty percent (80%) of the employee's base rate and eighty percent (80%) of the employee's appointment hours, regardless of work schedule, shall be considered a voluntary quit at the end of two (2) calendar weeks following the date of the job offer.
264D. If the initial placement is determined to be unsatisfactory, by mutual agreement of the University, the Association and the employee within six (6) months of placement, the parties will meet to determine an appropriate resolution.
264E. Recall rights cease upon placement in the same position from which removed, or in eighteen (18) months, whichever occurs first.
SECTION D. REDUCTION OF HOURS RESTORATION
265.	An employee with seniority whose appointment has been mandatorily reduced as defined in this Article, and chooses to remain in the reduced appointment, shall have some or all of reduced hours restored, contingent on the ability to perform the work, if the hours become available for the position from which the hours were reduced.
SECTION E. PLACEMENT ORIENTATION
266.	When placement is made in a regular job opening under the provisions of this Article, a normal orientation, as defined in Section A. of Article 27, Transfers, will be available. When a position held by a probationary employee is involved, the orientation shall not include training or teaching the affected employee the basic or special skills needed for the position. An employee will work no less than thirty-two (32) hours in a week in order to facilitate
63
orientation and/or retraining in a reasonable time frame. When the manager and employee agree to an extended orientation, the employee will agree that recall rights will commence six (6) months following completion of the orientation plus one additional month for each extended week of orientation (beyond the average for that unit). This is not intended to extend the recall rights past 18 months from Reduction-in-Force notification.
SECTION F. LIABILITY
268. A dispute involving compliance with this Article shall begin at Step Two of the Dispute Resolution Procedure, provided it is submitted in writing at Step Two within the fifteen (15) calendar day period after the Association or the employee has the knowledge, or should have had knowledge, of the facts giving rise to the dispute.

application of Art. 26 (RIF and Recall) or if the position is filled from within the unit. Under this section, an Ambulatory Care clinic will be considered a unit109.
278.	The posting will note the classification, the pay grade, the unit, the appointment hours, the shift(s), and whether it is a reposting of a position. When possible, if the Employer determines straight shift positions meet the needs of the unit, the Employer will post positions as straight shift positions. When there is a desire for 8-hour shifts and the Employer determines 8-hour shifts meet the needs of the unit, the Employer will post 8-hour shift positions. In addition, the posting will indicate if the position includes assignment to every weekend and, if applicable, geographic locations. As determined by management and when consistent with the needs of the unit, the Employer will post positions at full
107 See Intent Note for Paragraph 275
108 See Paragraph 285 and Intent Note for Paragraph 275A
109 See Paragraph 343D
65
time benefit eligible appointment fractions. In addition, the posting will include a list of all required qualifications essential for consideration for that position, as well as a list of desired qualifications in priority order110.
278A. Selection criteria will be developed by the hiring supervisor for each position that is posted and will be made available to candidates upon request, along with any other information about that position including a specific job description, if available111.
278B.	General information about the internal application and interview process,
bargaining unit classification descriptions, and unit profiles will be made available to the Human Resources Department upon request. Unit profiles will include the usual qualifications for positions on that unit. There will be collaboration between the Association and the University when the required qualifications differ from the prior posted required qualifications.
279.	Employees will continue to have access to job posting information equivalent to the systems at time of ratification (Nov. 6, 2011).
280.	An employee who wishes to be assured of consideration for a transfer to a regular job opening must submit a resume to Human Resources via the University’s application system.
281.	An employee who does not provide all requested information or who has not properly completed the on-line application process prior to five (5) p.m. on the closing date, need not be considered.
282.	a) An employee need not be considered for transfer under this Section during the one (1)-year period following the employee's promotion, transfer. Any new hire with less than six months RN experience need not be considered for transfer under this section during the one-year period following the employee’s completion of probation. In this connection, it is understood that it may be advantageous for an employee to transfer before the end of the one (1) year period. The one (1) year period does not apply to employees who have been placed in a position following a reduction-in-force. During the one-year period following a transfer, promotion or hire, the current manager will determine whether an employee may be considered for transfer. If a transfer is permitted, the usual transfer language applies.
b)	Employees who accept a position in an internship or retraining program will make a commitment in writing before the transfer takes place. No commitment will be less than one (1) year or longer than two (2) years. The commitment period will begin at the time of transfer and will exclude periods covered by short-term disability or
110 See Mou 763 - 764
111 See Intent Note for Paragraph 278A
66
leave of absence112. The employee may be returned to his or her former unit regardless of whether an open position exists if the employee requests or the manager determines the employee is unsuccessful during the six months following the start of the internship.
c)	Registered Nurses who have left the bargaining unit for less than one (1) year and who have remained in a regular University position(s), will be considered for posted positions as an internal candidate and the University date of hire will apply for the purposes of selection consideration.
d)	Registered Nurses who have left the bargaining unit for longer than one (1) year, but who have remained in a regular University position(s) will be considered for posted positions as an internal candidate and the prior bargaining unit years will apply as seniority for the purposes of selection consideration.
283.	a) Employees who are to be interviewed for a position will be informed about the interview process, including the name and title of the interviewer(s) and the projected time frame prior to the interview113.
b) Employees who apply for a position will be notified of candidacy status no later than fourteen (14) calendar days following the interview or when the hiring decision occurs, whichever is first. If an employee is not to be interviewed, that employee will be notified as soon as the decision is made.
283A. An employee who is considered for a regular job opening, under the provision set forth above and is not placed in the regular job opening will be so notified in writing as to the reasons for not being placed, including the specific nature of the substantial differences in desired qualifications related to the selected candidate114, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than fourteen (14) calendar days after the decision. Employees who desire additional information about the position or their candidacy may contact the Human Resources Office or their supervisor if the opening was within the employee's unit.
283B. Within one week following notification that the employee was not selected, and at their request, a meeting with the hiring supervisor will occur. The discussion will include a review of qualifications; reasons not selected, and provide suggestions for development to qualify for future positions.
283C. At the employee's request, the Association will receive the following information related to the interview: the employee's candidacy status, reasons not selected. and the resume and qualifications of the selected candidate.
112 See Paragraphs 262, 294.d and Intent Note for Paragraph 288
113 See Intent Note for Paragraph 283
114 See Paragraph 293A
67
SECTION C. SELECTION CONSIDERATION
284.	Transfers will be made on the basis of qualifications and seniority in the following manner115:
1)	Employees and applicants must possess all required qualifications in order to be considered116;
2)	Among employees possessing the required qualifications, the most senior will be selected unless there is a substantial difference among the desired qualifications117.
3)	Among employees and applicants possessing the required qualifications, the employee will be selected unless there is a substantial difference among the desired qualifications118.
285.	In cases when a manager has reservations about a senior employee's ability to
perform the duties of a position, the selection may be made on a provisional basis per Paragraph 275A. Provisional status will be conferred for a period of six (6) months. The candidate and the Association will be provided with the performance criteria and the rationale supporting the requirements at the time of the transfer. At the end of the six (6) month period, the employee will be provided with a written evaluation. If the transfer proves to be unsuccessful, placement in a different position will be facilitated119.
SECTION D. REVIEW PROCEDURE
286.	In the event that an employee, except those excluded under paragraph 282, 6a and 6b, with a timely application on file is not selected for that regular job opening, the question of whether that employee had the required qualifications or substantially better desired qualifications than the person selected may proceed directly to Step Two of the Dispute Resolution Procedure if the involved employee has more seniority than the person selected. 120.
286A. For purposes of this article, the Step Two dispute must be filed within ten (10) calendar days of notification of the decision not to hire. The Step Two dispute will be resolved within thirty (30) calendar days of the selection decision unless there is mutual agreement otherwise.
286B. In the event consensus and/or a satisfactory answer is not reached an appeal to the Associate Director/Executive Director of the hiring area and the Director of Labor Relations in the Health System Human Resources department may be made by any of the involved parties. A meeting will be held within fourteen

68
(14) calendar days of the appeal. A written decision will be issued within fourteen (14) calendar days of the hearing.
286C. Within ten (10) calendar days following receipt of the decision of the appeal panel, and at the request of the Association, the University will submit the issue through the mediation process outlined in Article 46. Appeal to the arbitration procedure is not available.
SECTION E. GENERAL PROVISIONS
287.	An employee who is selected for transfer will be transferred not later than thirty (30) calendar days after notification to the employer of the selection, unless a longer period of time is mutually agreed upon in writing between the employee and the involved supervisors.
288.	A transferred employee will receive a normal orientation as defined in Section A of this Article and be given a reasonable period to demonstrate competent performance. If the employee fails to demonstrate competent performance the manager(s), employee and the Association Chair or designee will meet to identify a plan to promote success. If the plan is not successful, the University will place the employee in a vacancy, if any, where the employee has previously demonstrated competent performance. If there are no vacancies, the Association, the University and the affected employee will meet to determine the next steps121.
289.	Following promotion, an employee who is placed in a vacancy through the process described in Paragraph 288, will be paid at the same pay rate the employee received prior to the promotion, or at a higher pay rate if the employee would have received an increase in pay pursuant to the terms of this Agreement if the employee had not been promoted.
290.	During any period in which employees are being considered for transfer, the regular job opening may be filled by other than the provisions of this Article until the selection process is completed and placement is made. In this regard, an employee, who is specifically told in advance that the employee is temporarily assigned to fill a regular job opening prior to the final selection and placement and the position is in a classification assigned to a higher pay grade, will be compensated at the rate of five percent (5%) of their regular wage in addition to their regular wage for hours worked in that classification.
291.	No employee will be required to perform the job duties of a higher classification as a prerequisite to promotion.
292.	No employee will be involuntarily demoted without prior written notification of performance deficiencies. Prior to or at the time demotion is first contemplated,
121 See Paragraph 285 and 282,6b
69
the supervisor will initiate a meeting with the employee to discuss the performance deficiencies and develop a plan for correction with appropriate time frames. If an employee is involuntarily demoted, the employee and the Association will receive a written explanation for the demotion.
293.	The Association and University will have an agreed upon process to review posted required qualifications prior to a job offer when the qualifications are disputed.
293A. If a higher seniority candidate is not selected, these steps shall be followed prior to a job offer being made:
1)	The hiring manager will notify the Association if a higher seniority candidate is not selected, prior to a job offer being made;
2)	At the request of the Association, a meeting with the Association leadership, area representative, Director, manager and Human Resource representative will be convened within five (5) business days unless mutually agreed otherwise;
3)	If there is a lack of consensus and the job offer continues to be held pending review or dispute resolution, all candidates awaiting a decision will be informed. Any candidate may withdraw their interest in a position during the review or dispute process.
293B. If a higher seniority candidate is not selected after the process in Paragraph 293A has been completed, the hiring manager will provide simultaneous notice to the candidate and to the Association about the decision.
SECTION F. RATES OF PAY ON TRANSFER
294.	When an employee moves to a classification in a different pay grade, the employee's wage within the new range will be at the same step in the Wage Schedule as the step the employee was on in the prior classification except as provided below:
Nurse Practitioner
295.	Employees transferring into the Nurse Practitioner role will be placed per the salary model outlined in the Nurse Practitioner Memorandum of Understanding.
Advanced Practice Nurses
295A. The University will place Advanced Practice Nurses transferring into the Professional Development (PDF) or Role Specific Advancement Model (RSAM) in a like area of current or past practice as follows: a) Advanced Practice to PDF level E b) Advanced Practice to RSAM level Expert
Advanced Practice to an unlike area of current or past practice:
c)	Advanced Practice to PDF level D
d)	Advanced Practice to RSAM level Competent
70
Certified Nurse Midwife
e)	Employees who transfer into the classification of Certified Nurse Midwife will be placed on the step in the appropriate pay grade that provides at least a five per cent (5%) base wage increase plus one additional step on the N-5 wage schedule for each 12 months of applicable Nurse Midwife experience.

See Addendum D, Professional Development Framework for compensation related to internship programs as of July 1, 2006
RSAM and Framework Split Appointments
h)	Split appointments will be paid at the rates associated with each level for each unit
ARTICLE 28 WORK REDESIGN
296.	The University and the Association agree that it is appropriate to evaluate the work processes of registered nurses and to design the work in a manner that is both efficient and provides quality care and a safe work environment. We acknowledge the importance of such an evaluation, including discussion among colleagues. We further acknowledge that work processes or design could impact quality of care, employee satisfaction or the long-term viability of the unit. Therefore, concerns regarding such design require timely and appropriate resolution.
297.	To this end, the University and the Association agree that it is appropriate to conduct work redesign across in and outpatient areas in the context of how it affects patient care. Joint redesign efforts will be coordinated at the departmental and central administration level with the Association leadership. An agreed upon process will be used for work redesign. Communication of work redesign proposal decisions to others affected, through appropriate means, will be an included component of the process. Current work redesign initiatives will be reviewed for mutual endorsement and/or modification122.
298.	The parties agree to establish a process for collaborative discussions and planning regarding changes in the Registered Nurse role expectations whenever work redesign is undertaken, or at the request of either party. We agree to
122 See Paragraph 715 and Intent Note for Paragraph 297
71
utilize the principles of interest-based problem solving, and only if consensus is not achieved will the University make a data based decision.
299.	All levels of Registered Nurses may participate in the redesign process and periodic feedback from patients and families will be included as a component of the work redesign efforts. Consistent baseline assistive personnel expectations will be identified and implemented across units. Training to meet job expectations and ongoing performance requirements will be developed for assistive personnel.
300.	Future unit mergers will be taken as an opportunity for work redesign and implemented in a mutual and collaborative way. Collaboration with other departments to identify clinical activities that are being done by others that can be done by nurses more efficiently and effectively will be undertaken.
301.	To the extent that institutional work redesign occurs, which involves services, which are supportive to nursing; there will be collaboration between nursing and the affected departments in the design, implementation and evaluation of support service changes. The employees participating in this process will include those affected by any changes.
301A. When an Ambulatory Care and Home Care Services program expands to an additional location the parties will meet in special conference. The purpose will be to determine if the program expansion creates one unit in each location or separate units. The criteria for such determination include same patient population, same nursing qualifications required, similar nursing duties and responsibilities.
302.	Approximately every six to twelve (6-12) months and ongoing, following work redesign, mutually agreed upon quality assessment evaluations will be implemented.
303.	If an employee's position is eliminated due to work redesign, he/she will be placed in a position covered by this Agreement first, if available. If no available positions then he/she may be offered a position outside the bargaining unit. If a non-bargained for position is declined, or if no positions are available, the employee will be placed in reduction-in-force status. This employee will retain recall rights if placed in a non-bargained for position.
ARTICLE 29 PAID TIME OFF
SECTION A1. PRINCIPLES
324.	The Paid Time Off (PTO) system is managed based upon principles and guidelines jointly developed by the Association and the University. The guidelines are included as Addendum B to this Agreement Any changes to the
72
guidelines during the term of this Agreement will be mutually agreeable and based upon the following principles:
1)	As professionals, nurses will demonstrate accountability for patient care and respect for colleagues in the responsible utilization of Paid Time Off.
2)	Adequate access to prescheduled time off provides flexibility in planning and will result in only the exceptional unanticipated request after the schedule is posted.
3)	The privacy of professional nurses will be respected and disclosure of the reason for paid time off will not generally be required123.
4)	The continuous use of unscheduled or unanticipated time off can be construed as a failure of the system and as behavior that may require intervention.
SECTION A2. ELIGIBILITY
325.	An employee shall be eligible to receive Paid Time Off (PTO) income in accordance with the provisions of this Article124.
326.	No employee shall be eligible for Paid Time Off (PTO), or receive pay in lieu of Paid Time Off, before it accrues. Probationary employees are not eligible for scheduled time off except at the discretion of their supervisor125.

126 See Intent Note for Paragraph 328
127 See Intent Note for Paragraph 328
74
333.	PTO will be accrued, recorded and available at the end of the calendar month128.
333A. Unused PTO time will be paid to an employee, annually, on the last pay day in January, provided the employee makes a written request to his/her supervisor by December 1 each year and provided the employee maintains a minimum of forty (40) hours (pro-rated according to appointment fraction) of accrued PTO time.
333B. An increase in the rate of accrual shall be effective in the calendar month during which completion of the required years of seniority or a change in the overtime payment eligibility status occurs.

333E. 1) Retirement; or
2)	Start of a leave of absence, except that an employee who is granted a leave of absence for a period of six (6) months or less shall, upon written request, have up to forty (40) hours of accrued PTO time retained, provided the request is made to the supervisor prior to the beginning of the leave of absence; or

75
accrued PTO time scheduled and used, only by an employee who does not rotate from a shift for which the premium is payable.

Pay for PTO time shall be paid to the employee on the employee's pay day, except that an employee shall be paid for such time in advance of the employee's scheduled time off on the employee's regular pay day preceding the scheduled time off, providing the employee is scheduled for ten (10) or more consecutive PTO days and the payment in advance is requested in writing at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the pay day preceding the first day of such scheduled time off. Shift premium, as set forth in Article 16 shall be paid for the number of hours of accrued PTO scheduled and used only by an employee who does not rotate from a shift for which the premium is payable.
SECTION E.	SCHEDULING OF PTO TIME
333H. 1) Holiday scheduling takes precedence over the granting of PTO.
2)	During the annual holiday request period, employees may commit to work additional hours during holiday weeks. Based upon the hours committed, the nurse manager and the Workload Review Committee will determine the amount of PTO, if any, to be allocated during the Holiday weeks. If there are sufficient hours committed, a unit will grant at least one employee’s request for PTO during a Holiday week provided it does not negatively impact unit operations at the manager’s discretion. Additional hours committed at the time of the holiday request period that are scheduled and worked will be considered prescheduled related to paragraphs 355, 355C and 355D.
3)	PTO shall be scheduled to meet the work requirements of the University on a unit basis in accordance with the following procedure130.
333I. 1) Each unit will post, prior to December 1 of each year, and at such other times as may be established by a unit, any limitations concerning the scheduling of time off, including the election to close down any or all of the operations of the unit and schedule time off during the close down period. Unit guidelines shall allow each employee to schedule at least seventy percent (70%) of his/her annual accrual of PTO time as vacation according to the requirements specified in Paragraph 333J. If unit guidelines are established to assure a specific amount of time off for each employee during the period, December 15 through January 15, this time may be included in the calculation of seventy percent (70%) of accrual even if the time
130 See intent note paragraph 333H
76
is not actually scheduled off until posting of the unit schedule for that period131.
2)	If scheduled time off is limited to less than seventy percent (70%) of accrual, or any approved time off scheduled according to the agreed upon procedure is denied or cancelled due to unanticipated needs of the unit, the employee will not lose PTO accrual.
3)	Scheduled PTO allocation for employees will include only those hours, which are budgeted toward direct patient care.
333J. There will be one request period each year for the period of May 1, through April 30. Each unit will accept requests as follows:
1)	During the month of February, each employee will initially sign up for a maximum of two (2) weeks of PTO in seniority order, highest to lowest. Unit guidelines will not restrict scheduled PTO requests to less than two (2) weeks. At the employee's option, the two (2) weeks need not be consecutive. After all employees have opportunities, the remaining time will be requested and granted in seniority order, highest to lowest132 133.
2)	When the scheduled PTO request period ends in mid-week, that request period will be extended to encompass the full week for the purpose of granting scheduled PTO time off.
3)	The time off will be posted on April 1133..
4)	The OR/PACU/Procedure area will increase the number of PTO hours available for the request period beyond the 70% annual allocation plan during the period between the Christmas and New Year’s holidays to accommodate the decrease in patient census.
333K. Each unit will schedule time off based upon these requests, except that when it is necessary to select from among employees with the same or overlapping requests, preference will be given to those whose request results in seven (7) or more consecutive days of time off (including any paid holiday) and seniority. This preference is limited to the first round of PTO selection134.
333L. Units will provide individual written notification to employees of whether their PTO request is granted or denied.
333M. If an employee's PTO request is denied, during the annual request period or if scheduled time off is changed due to the needs of the unit, accrued PTO time will not be lost and at the request of the employee, all accrued PTO hours in excess of the maximum will be paid.
333N. An employee who transfers into a unit and has not taken previously approved scheduled time off, loses that time off preference unless the unit can
131 See Intent Note for Paragraph 333I
132 See Paragraph 333K
133 See Appendix D for complete time off and Holiday Request Times; See Intent Note for Paragraph 333J
134 See Intent Note for Paragraph 333J
77
accommodate the request made in the former unit. In such a case, the employee will be permitted to reschedule, consistent with the work requirements of the new unit. Every attempt will be made to accommodate previously agreed to PTO for an employee whose transfer is a result of reduction-in-force, as long as no higher senior employee has been denied that time off.
Interim PTO
333O. Interim PTO is defined as access to PTO after the annual request period for which employees are not required to obtain their own coverage. Interim PTO is limited to PTO hours not filled during the annual request period, for PTO hours filled during the annual request period that have been canceled or PTO hours filled by procedures noted in Paragraph 333J-N.
1)	Interim requests may be made at any time except that the request must be made no later than the schedule request period for that schedule.
2)	Except for those hours granted pursuant to 333O-6, interim requests
will be granted in order of request provided that the PTO hours remain available. In the case of a tie, the request will be granted first to the employee with the fewest number of interim PTO requests granted and, if there is a tie, then in seniority order, highest to lowest. Notice of approval or denial will be provided within fourteen days of the request or prior to the schedule being posted, whichever occurs first. A log of granted interim PTO request occurrences will be kept and reviewed by the Workload Review Committee; a new log will begin annually on May 1.
3)	These PTO hours will remain posted on the unit until filled or closed by the manager due to unit needs. The Employer will not arbitrarily close hours.
4)	If previously closed PTO hours and/or additional PTO hours above the allocated PTO hours are made available by the manager, the process in Paragraph 333O-6 will be used to approve or deny requests.
5)	In addition, the definition of a unit in Ambulatory Care will only apply to the Decentralized Float Pool.
6)	In the event PTO hours become available, prior to schedule development, such PTO hours will be posted on the unit for at least one week. Interim requests made within one week of the posting will be granted in seniority order, highest to lowest. Notice of approval or denial will be provided within fourteen days of the request or prior to the schedule being posted, whichever occurs first.
333P. When extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the employee cannot be corrected in time for the employee to meet employment obligations, PTO time may be granted for the absence, including a partial shift absence. It is expected that the employee will notify the manager or designee of the length of the expected absence whenever possible.
78
Access to Incremental PTO
333P.1 An employee may access incremental PTO, which will be considered scheduled time, provided the employee has enough PTO to cover the time and complies with the following steps;
1)	The employee will provide the manager with at least 24 hours’ notice of the need for additional time off. An incremental PTO access request cannot be for more than one or two days or a partial shift of at least two hours, at a time and this access is not intended to create significant schedule changes on an ongoing basis.
2)	The requested time off will be granted if the employee is able to obtain his or her own coverage and the time off will be considered as scheduled.
3)	The employee is responsible for obtaining a commitment from another
employee in writing.
4)	The coverage may be changed or cancelled at the discretion of the
manager. On-call may be cancelled within 24 hours without penalty.
5)	The coverage must be another employee who is oriented to the unit and may involve over appointment, overtime, on-call or a CSR/ACNRP regular or temporary staff, or a Per Diem staff working beyond their usual commitment.
6)	Overtime may be prescheduled and seniority will not be a barrier to this process.
7)	Hours committed through this process do not qualify for the unit’s overtime trigger or the 20 hour limit for temporary or Per Diem staff and do not count toward the individual overtime limit or the unit overtime trigger.
8)	Hours committed through this process do not count in the calculation of 70% annual allocation process.
9)	This process does not apply to obtaining coverage on a holiday.
10)	Employees may use this process to extend a vacation by no more than two days, provided the employee who is covering the time is not working overtime. Employees may not use this vacation extension during a holiday week.
11)	If a CSR/ACNRP or Ambulatory Care Decentralized Float Pool nurse agrees to work over appointment or overtime to provide coverage for a specific employee requesting PTO access and the hours are cancelled, the nurse will not be reassigned to another unit, unless the CSR or ACNRP/Decentralized Float Pool nurse agrees.
Problem Solving Meetings
333P.2 Discussions between an employee and manager and problem solving meetings are intended to promote a thorough understanding of lifestyle situations, which may contribute to the excessive use of unscheduled PTO. The discussions and meetings provide an opportunity for the employee to clarify their actions, to develop a mutual understanding of the employee’s issues and of the impact of the employee’s absenteeism on patient care and on the work life of other staff members. The goal is to develop a mutual plan to minimize the use of scheduled and unscheduled PTO.
79
Discussions
1)	A discussion between the employee and the manager may be initiated whenever there is concern related to the continuous use of unscheduled PTO, including the use of partial shifts and contiguous unscheduled time with scheduled time. Those anticipated unscheduled absences, which the employee proactively discusses with the manager and develops a mutually agreeable plan to address, need not be included in the PTO problem solving process. Those unanticipated, unscheduled absences, arrivals after the scheduled shift start time or partial shifts less than one hour, which the employee subsequently discusses with the manager and develops a mutually agreeable plan to address, need not be included in the PTO problem-solving process.
2)	If the employee exhausts their PTO bank and uses unapproved no pay at any time, a meeting will occur between the employee, the manager, and an Association representative. Subsequent occurrences of using unapproved no pay within nine months from the initial occurrence of unapproved no pay may result in disciplinary action. The employee will not be disciplined if the employee exhausted his/her PTO bank due to Assigned Time Off in the prior six months. In this event, a meeting with the employee, an Association representative, a Human Resource representative and the manager may be called.
Formal Problem Solving Meetings
3)	A formal problem-solving meeting must occur prior to disciplinary action. For the purpose of problem-solving meetings and disciplinary action, late arrivals and/or partial shifts of less than one hour will be treated separately from unscheduled PTO/absences.
333P.3 A problem-solving meeting for unscheduled PTO may be held with the employee, the manager and an Association representative if:
1)
(a)
(b)
(c)
a pattern of unscheduled PTO is observed, or occurrences of unscheduled absences PTO are equal to or greater than four in a six month period.
The goal of the meeting is to provide an opportunity for the employee to clarify their actions and to develop a mutual action plan.
2)	A second problem-solving meeting will be held if the employee has two (2) or more additional occurrences of unscheduled PTO within three (3) months from the date of the last occurrence or if the employee has four (4) or more unscheduled PTO within six (6) months after the date of the last occurrence. The latter will apply to those employees who have the first problem-solving meeting on or after the date of November 6, 2011.
3)	A third problem-solving meeting will be held if the same occurrence pattern continues two months after the date of the last occurrence. Employee counseling, will occur which may lead to disciplinary action.
80
4)	Note that as an outcome of these meetings, a mutually developed action plan may be developed which changes the discipline threshold for an individual employee in order to accommodate their specific situation.
5)	The employee and the Association representative will be provided with applicable attendance data at the time the meeting is scheduled. The manager will request from the Association, a representative, which will be made available for a problem-solving meeting within one week of the request. This time frame may only be extended by mutual agreement. The employee will be provided notice at the time of the meeting request that subsequent occurrences that occur prior to the problem solving meeting may count towards further steps of the process.
6)	During the annual performance evaluation process, a review of occurrences of unscheduled PTO and unexcused absences will occur. This review will not be considered part of the problem solving meeting or disciplinary process. The employee’s evaluation will not incorporate attendance related concerns if prior notice through the formal problem solving process has not occurred.
333P.3B A problem-solving meeting for arrivals after the scheduled shift start time /partial shifts of less than one hour may be held with the employee, the manager and an Association representative if:
1)	The employee has six or more arrivals after the scheduled shift start time/partial shifts of less than one hour in six (6) months. The goal of the meeting is to provide an opportunity for the employee to clarify their actions and to develop a mutual action plan.
2)	A second problem-solving meeting will be held if the employee has two additional arrivals after the scheduled start time and/or partial shifts of less than one hour, three months after the date of the last occurrence. Employee counseling, will occur which may lead to disciplinary action.
3)	Note that as an outcome of these meetings, an action plan may be developed which changes the discipline threshold for an individual employee in order to accommodate their specific situation.
4)	The employee and the Association representative will be provided with applicable attendance data at the time the meeting is scheduled. The manager will request from the Association, a representative, which will be made available for a problem-solving meeting within one week of the request. This time frame may only be extended by mutual agreement. The employee will be provided notice at the time of the meeting request that subsequent occurrences that occur prior to the problem solving meeting may count towards further steps of the process.
333Q. A unit may charge an employee’s PTO accrual and pay an employee for an absence, even though it is an unexcused absence.
81
333R. If a day observed by the University as a holiday, as provided in Article 32 (Holidays) occurs during an employee’s scheduled time off, the employee shall, if otherwise eligible for it, receive holiday pay and will not have that time off charged against accrued PTO.
SECTION F.	ACCRUAL ADJUSTMENT FOR PART-TIME EMPLOYEES
333S. An employee's appointment hours should reflect the hours an employee is regularly scheduled to work. In this regard, the following applies:
1)	If a part-time employee has worked an average of at least four (4)
non-overtime hours per week in excess of their appointment hours for eight (8) consecutive weeks or more, the University will modify the employee's PTO (Article 29), Extended Sick Time (Article 30), accruals retroactively to the beginning of the period. This modification will result in an accrual, which is directly proportionate to the maximum hours of income, and extended sick time income for which a full-time employee is eligible.
2)	Employees who are providing coverage for an extended absence related to extended sick time or FMLA.
3)	Additional PTO is not accrued or adjusted for prescheduled over appointment hours worked during a holiday week or for hours worked to provide coverage for another employee related to PTO access.
SECTION G.	HEALTH CARE APPOINTMENT
333T. An employee will be granted time off for health care appointments if requested no later than during the schedule request period. The supervisor may seek verification of the health appointment In order to be considered for time off once the schedule has been posted the employee must give the employee's immediate supervisor written notice and receive approval at least five (5) calendar days prior to the appointment. In the event that a health care professional schedules a return appointment or care, which prevents giving the required notice, as much notice as possible based on the circumstances is required.
333U. If the employee is granted time off under this Section after the schedule is posted, the supervisor may request documentation to include the date and time of the appointment and identification of the facility prior to the employee leaving the unit for the appointment.
SECTION H:	USE OF PTO FOR WORK-RELATED INJURY
333V. PTO hours will be used temporarily to cover absences as a result of a work-related injury. When Worker's Compensation coverage becomes available, the PTO hours will be returned to the employee's PTO bank.
82
ARTICLE 30 EXTENDED SICK TIME
SECTION A.	FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE
336.	A full-time employee who has at least two (2) full years of continuous service and has eighty (80) hours of continuous sickness and injury absence will be eligible for not more than one thousand fifty-six (1056) hours of Extended Sick Time income, paid at full pay and one thousand fifty-six (1056) hours of Extended Sick Time paid at one-half the employee’s pay. The Extended Sick Time hours are pro-rated to the employees appointment fraction. The pay rate includes the hourly shift differential for those employees assigned to and working a schedule of straight off shifts at onset of the injury or illness. This does not apply to the weekend differential. It is renewable on the first (1st) of the month following their seventh (7th) anniversary and every five (5) years thereafter. For those employees hired prior to February 2, 1996 the eligibility/renewal date is February 1, 1998 and every five years thereafter. Extended Sick Time hours do not renew during a leave of absence or any period of absence due to illness or injury covered by this Article. Eligibility for Extended Sick Time income hours, which would have otherwise renewed, is deferred until the employee returns to active employment. Active employment shall mean the return to the employee’s appointment fraction for no less than 30 consecutive days. 135
337.	This Extended Sick Time income will be available to an eligible employee only after continuous hours of disability absence following an original eighty (80) continuous hours of sickness or injury absence, prorated by appointment fraction. Intermittent absences may count toward the two-week qualifying period if the absences are related to the same illness or injury and with appropriate medical documentation. Thereafter, other accrued hours of PTO income may be used and paid. Each illness or injury shall be independent of any other injury or illness and require completion of the eighty 80-hour period above, except as provided in Section D. of this Article136. An employee who returns to work during the qualifying period for a work trial, recommended by the University, and is unsuccessful, will have prior related absences count toward the two-week qualifying period.
SECTION B.	PART-TIME EMPLOYEES
338.	A part-time employee appointed to work eight (8) or more hours per calendar week and who has at least two (2) full years of continuous service shall be eligible for Extended Sick Time income providing the employee meets the eligibility requirements of Section A on a pro- rata basis dependent on the employee's appointment hours which shall be directly proportionate to the
135 See Intent Note for Paragraph 336
136 See Intent Note for Paragraphs 325 and 337
83
eligibility requirements of a full-time employee. The number of hours of Extended Sick Time income payable as provided in Section A. shall be directly proportionate to the maximum hours of Extended Sick Time income for which a full-time employee is eligible.
SECTION C.	ELIGIBILITY FOR EXTENDED SICK TIME PAY
338A. The University reserves the right to request a second medical opinion and abide by that opinion when determining eligibility for Extended SickTime income. The University and the employee will mutually agree upon the physician to perform the evaluation and to abide by the second opinion. An employee, who is asked to see a physician for a second medical opinion, will be informed of their rights to contact the Association. The examination and report will be without cost to the employee. Until the second opinion is received, the employee's physician statement will prevail in determining eligibility for Extended Sick Time income. If the University requests that the employee provide any medical records from the employee's health care provider(s) or from institutions or facilities providing care, the employee may request reimbursement for the cost, if any, of copying the requested records.
338B. Arbitrary failure or refusal to follow accepted medical practice in treating a sickness or injury shall be reason for discontinuing or withholding Extended Sick Time income.
338C. Nothing in this Article requires an employee to disregard the medical care plan of the employee's physician. Eligibility for Extended Sick Time incomes will be determined as provided in Paragraph 338A.
338D. An evaluation for LTD eligibility will be completed before the EST benefit is exhausted. It is understood that not all evaluations can be initiated without some notice from the employee.
SECTION D.	ELIGIBILITY TO RETURN TO WORK
339.	An employee who is off work in accordance with the provisions of this Article shall be returned to active employment by the University either to the employee's former position or to a position consistent with the provisions of Section -J of Article 38 (Leaves of Absence), provided, however, that the notice requirements of Section J. shall not be applicable except that in the case of disability absences where the employee knows that another individual will be working in the absent employee's position, the returning employee will provide as much advance notice of return as possible, including a release from the employee's physician where applicable or required by the University137.
137 See Intent Note for Paragraph 339
84
340.	If the employee is released to return to work, but at fewer hours than the appointment fraction because of temporary medical restrictions, the employee shall be paid for actual time worked and shall be eligible to continue to receive Extended Sick Time income for the balance of their appointment hours. In this regard, a physician's verification of restrictions shall be required. In addition, a release from the employee's physician shall be required before an employee can return to their previous appointment hours.
341.	Should an employee, who returns to active employment pursuant to this Section, not return to the employee's former unit, that employee shall be given consideration prior to an employee exercising rights under Section C., Article 27 (Transfers: Promotions, Demotions, and Laterals) but after an employee exercising rights under Article 26 (Reduction of the Working Force and Recall Procedures) for regular job openings which become available in the employee's former unit provided the employee requests such consideration by notifying the former unit in writing at the time the employee returns to active employment.
SECTION E.	DISABILITY ACCOMMODATIONS1
343.	University resources will be used to facilitate return to work for employees who are unable to perform the full range of duties of their position due to a work-related or a non-occupational injury or illness. Guidelines and process related to the timely, appropriate placement of such employees have been developed by the Association and the University and are included as Addendum C to this Agreement. The guidelines and process may be evaluated over the life of this Agreement and jointly modified as necessary.
343A. A joint Association and University team of not more than four members will be convened to identify nursing positions and work areas hospital-wide that require minimal orientation that could be used for accommodating employees with disabilities. Positions will be identified for both short and long-term placement, with the expectation that a short-term placement would not exceed six (6) months, would be accompanied by progressive work hardening and would be considered a "bridge" position back to a regular position138.
343B. When placing an employee with a disability, the University will place the employee in a position covered by this Agreement, assuming ability to do the work, prior to any other position139. In the event that the employee cannot be accommodated in a bargaining unit position and has exhausted all paid time, the employee may be placed in a position outside of the bargaining unit that approximates the employee’s appointment fraction, provided the employee possesses the qualifications. Accommodation in a position outside of the bargaining unit will not exceed twelve (12) months. During this time, the employee will maintain bargaining unit membership and will be eligible for PTO accrual and other benefits under the labor Agreement, pro-rated by
138 See Intent Note for Paragraph 343A. See MOU Paragraph 726
139 See Intent Note for Paragraph 343B
85
appointment fraction. Pay will be reflective of the accommodated position. Evaluation for the level of accommodation required will occur every 4 months140.
343C. When a temporary position in the Central Staffing Resource/ACNRP is identified as a placement for an employee needing accommodation, that employee will be considered regular141.
343D. If an open position is determined to be an appropriate placement for an employee with a disability who is awaiting placement, this position need not be posted in accordance with Article 27, but may be filled by an employee with a disability, assuming ability to do the work. When there is more than one such employee, placement decisions will be made on the basis of seniority, qualifications and substantial differences142.
343E. The University will develop and maintain a centralized database of employees needing accommodation. The database will contain codes for staff working in an accommodated role and those needing placement and will be updated per scheduling period.
343E1. When the employee requires a return to work accommodation and cannot be accommodated on the home unit, the employee’s Nursing Director will endeavor to accommodate the employee within another unit under that director’s responsibility. The employee must meet the necessary qualifications and job requirement for any accommodated position.
343F. At the time the University of Michigan Health System Human Resources Department is notified that an employee may no longer qualify for long-term disability (LTD), there will be a joint meeting of the Association and the University to discuss the conditions of return to active employment and options for work trial placement.
ARTICLE 31
EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE
344.	The University and the Association agree that timely and effective identification, assistance and/or treatment of employees with mental health and/or chemical dependency can contribute to the employee’s ability to meet employment obligations, maintain standards for nursing practice and provide for the safety of the public. Early identification and assistance may result in successful rehabilitation before employment is in jeopardy. Employees will not be summarily discharged for diverting substances from the Employer. At the
140 See Addendum C
141 See Intent Note for Paragraph 343C
141 See Intent Note for Paragraph 343D
86
conclusion of the Employer’s investigation of all the facts and circumstances, the University will determine the appropriate corrective action, up to and including discharge. Following consultation with the Association, but at the discretion of the University, discharge will not be imposed when less serious discipline and appropriate treatment can enable an employee to meet the employment obligation. The University's decision to discharge an employee does not preclude the review of such a discharge through the Dispute Resolution Procedure and Mediation Procedure, Article 46 and the Arbitration Procedure, Article 47. Finally, the parties acknowledge that the ultimate responsibility in accepting, confronting and overcoming the problem is that of the employee.
345.	The University, through its Employee Assistance Program, has made available a program to provide assistance to employees.
1)	An employee who self identifies chemical dependency, seeks and completes treatment will have a return to work plan coordinated by the University through the Employee Assistance Program. The Employer will assist the employee in identifying appropriate rehabilitative treatment programs. The terms of return to work will be tailored to the individual circumstances, and if applicable, will require compliance with requirements of any professional recovery program in which the employee is participating.
2)	In seeking assistance through the University's employee assistance program, an employee may select any counselor in the program who is available on a timely basis. In cooperation with the University and the University's employee assistance program, the Association may provide a list of potential treating practitioners to whom employees may be referred. It is understood that employees are responsible for costs incurred either through their health care insurance coverage or otherwise. Employees who are placed on a leave of absence to seek treatment will have benefits provided pursuant to other provisions in this agreement.
3)	Participation in any treatment program, which may be recommended, by the University's employee assistance program will be voluntary. Release of information concerning an employee's participation in this program is confidential and can occur only with the employee's written release of information.
4)	Employees will be informed of the program during Nurse Orientation and other appropriate methods and media.
5)	An employee referred for treatment by the University's employee assistance program and participating in a program will not be disadvantaged in regard to the provisions of Article 39, Benefit Plans; Article 38, Leaves of Absence; or Article 29, Paid Time Off, due to participation in that program.
6)	No less than one designated Association representative will be a member of the University's employee assistance program advisory committee, evaluation committee, and any other joint labor/management committee(s) which may be established within the
87
University Hospitals to address issues related to programs and education on the subject of substance abuse and employees.
346.	The University, except as otherwise provided by law or regulation, will schedule a special conference with the Association no less than ninety (90) calendar days prior to implementing any policy or program which requires testing employees for substance use. The Association may reconvene the conference no less than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the implementation date to inform the University of its position regarding the proposed program.
346A. A joint workgroup will be convened to develop and implement guidelines and process for a For Cause drug Testing Policy to be implemented by the University within six (6) months of the execution date of this agreement. Guidelines will include an agreement about actions related to a positive test.
ARTICLE 32 HOLIDAYS
SECTION A.

When less than one half (1/2) of an employee's work schedule occurs on the calendar day in which the holiday is observed, even though the employee's starting time starts on the calendar day on which the holiday is observed, the twenty-four (24) hour period shall end at the employee's starting time on the calendar day in which the holiday is observed.
The holiday pay and the pay for time worked on the holiday shall be based on the twenty-four (24) hour period set forth above for those employees whose work schedule spans more than the calendar day on which the holiday is observed.
351A. For those employees whose normal schedule of work is a combination of shift lengths holidays observed on the employee's scheduled days off will be divided as equitably as practicable between shift lengths. Holidays observed on the employee's scheduled days of work will be equitably distributed between shift lengths.
351B. During a week in which a holiday falls, employees will be scheduled consistent with their appointment fraction, except during Thanksgiving week, in which one of the two (2) holiday shifts may be included in the employee's appointment fraction145.
351C. With the exception of Thanksgiving week, CRNAs may be scheduled to work their full appointment fraction during holiday weeks. Selection will be made among volunteers in seniority order during the annual holiday request period, based on available hours. The holiday will be prorated based on usual shift length and appointment fraction for weeks in which the full appointment fraction is worked.
SECTION C.	HOLIDAY OFF AND COUNTED WITHIN APPOINTMENT FRACTION
352.	Each employee normally scheduled to work eight (8) or more hours per week (see paragraph 352B) shall suffer no loss in salary, including shift premium if applicable, for the holiday, provided the employee meets the following eligibility requirements:

89
The employee works the employee's last scheduled work day prior to and the employee's first scheduled work day following the holiday unless the employee’s work both days is excused because of personal sickness or injury as provided in Article 29, (PAID TIME OFF) or (2) other extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the employee, which cannot be corrected in time for the employee to meet the individual employment obligation.
352A. For a holiday not included in appointment fraction, which falls on the employee’s scheduled day off, the employee will receive pay for the holiday determined by prorating the holiday according to the employee’s appointment fraction and normal shift length.
352B. The holiday will not be prorated for part-time employees who work on 24/7 and OR/Procedure Units who work their full appointment fraction during a holiday week.
352C. Individuals who work appointment fractions that are counted over two weeks will have their holiday week incentives calculated based on working their appointment fraction over the two weeks.
353.	For employees on fixed schedules: In the event a holiday is observed on a fulltime employee's scheduled day off, the employee will receive pay equal to their shift length or not less than eight (8) hours for the holiday. Part-time employees will receive holiday pay prorated by the employee’s appointment fraction and normal shift length when the holiday is observed on a part-time employee's scheduled day off. Employees normally scheduled to work less than eight (8) hours per calendar week shall not receive pay for the holiday.
353A For those Operating Room, Post Anesthesia Recovery/Care Units and Procedure Areas where employees are not scheduled to work holidays and holidays are only covered by call, the following applies:
Call taken on the holiday proper is considered to be a holiday worked and part of the employee's appointment fraction, not to exceed the normal shift length. Holiday pay in this situation is not prorated for part-time employees except as noted in paragraph 352C.
SECTION D.	HOLIDAY IS ASSIGNED & WORKED
354.	An employee who is assigned and works on the holiday shall receive either:

SECTION G.
359.	In the event that it is necessary to make a deduction from the salary of an employee because the employee does not meet the eligibility requirements set forth in Section C., the amount of the deduction will be the employee's hourly rate multiplied by eight (8), or whatever the employee's regular schedule of hours per day, plus shift premium for that day, if applicable.
SECTION H. HOLIDAY REQUEST PERIOD & HOLIDAY SCHEDULING
361.	There will be one holiday request period each year. (See Paragraph 374). Time off on the holidays will be granted in seniority order, highest to lowest, in order to meet staffing needs of the unit, according to the following:

363A. When an employee is required to work more than four (4) Christmas Days in a row on the same unit, a joint review process to examine resources and solutions will occur.
364.	When scheduling employees to work on a holiday in a unit, the supervisor will endeavor to find volunteers from among the employees in the classification needed. If sufficient volunteers cannot be found, employees will be assigned to work on the holiday according to the following procedure.
150 See Intent Note Paragraph 348
151 See Appendix D, Paragraph 637A, for complete Paid Time Off and Holiday Request Times
92
365.	First priority in holiday scheduling will be given to requests off in seniority order, highest to lowest.
366.	1) By February 1 of each year, each unit will post the tentative holiday schedule.
2) The unit may institute a holiday on-call system by a majority vote of the unit employees.
367.	During each May 1 through the following January, employees will be assigned so that no more than one (1) holiday variation exists between any two unit employees, unless they specifically request to do so, counting holidays taken off on the holiday as a holiday worked. If it is possible to schedule additional holidays off, all six holidays (Christmas through Thanksgiving) will be considered together and requests granted on the basis of equity within the current holiday schedule (Christmas through Thanksgiving) and seniority. Following the Thanksgiving holiday each year, the new holiday schedule will be the basis for equity for the next year.
367A.	Sequence for development of unit schedule152:
1)	Unit employees scheduled to meet appointment fraction.
2)	Dual unit employees.
3)	Unit employees requesting to be scheduled over appointment to provide coverage for an absence due to short-term disability or FMLA153 .
4)	Honor standing requests from part-time employees requesting to be scheduled over appointment154.
5)	Regular float employee, as available, to consistently replace an employee on anticipated absence.
6)	Regular available float employee.
7)	Unit part-time employees requesting to be scheduled for additional non-overtime hours for the current schedule155.
8)	Per Diem employees.
9)	Employees who are offered and accept an extra holiday off during schedule development will be scheduled for their full appointment fraction during the holiday week156.
10)	Employees requesting to be scheduled for their full appointment during a holiday week when they have the holiday off.
11)	Part-time employees requesting to be scheduled over appointment during a holiday week when they have the holiday off.
367B. The Workload Review Committee will create scheduling guidelines for all holiday weeks. The guidelines shall not violate the collective bargaining
152 See Intent Notes for Paragraphs 91, 185, 185B; see Addendum A, Per Diem Nurse Scheduling Guidelines
153 See paragraph 185.P
154 See Paragraphs 163E.3, 163I.3, 163M.3, 163Q.5, 163U.1
155 See Paragraphs 163E.3, 163I.3, 163M.3, 163Q.5, 163U.1
156 See Paragraph 355D
93
agreement. These guidelines must be approved by a majority vote of unit employees who are eligible to vote and voting in the unit. These guidelines will be reviewed annually and a copy will be provided to the Nursing Director and the UMPNC office by December 1 each year. The Workload Review Committee may determine if employees working Christmas will have the guarantee of having December 24 or December 26 off. If the manager schedules an employee on a shift other than their normal shift(s) on Christmas, the manager will have the right to schedule that employee to the same shift on December 24 and/or December 26 as scheduled on December 25th. 157
Process to Give Extra Holiday Off
368.	If more employees are available to work on the holiday than are needed, the process for making the adjustment will be as follows:
Extra Holiday Off During Schedule Development
1)	Process to release employees during schedule development:
a)	If an employee is offered and volunteers to take an extra holiday off during schedule development, the employee will be assigned to work their full appointment fraction during the holiday week, at the manager’s discretion. The employee will receive full holiday pay and Paragraph 355D applies if the full appointment fraction is worked158.
b)	If an employee is assigned to take an extra holiday off during schedule development, the employee may request to be scheduled their full appointment fraction during the holiday week. The employee will receive full holiday pay and Paragraph 355D applies if the full appointment fraction is worked159.
c)	No employee will be allowed to take a second additional holiday off until all employees have had an opportunity for one additional holiday off.
Extra Holiday Off on Day of Holiday
2)	Process to release employees on the holiday:
a)	Volunteers from employees who are working the holiday as a holiday. (seniority, highest to lowest)
b)	If there are no volunteers, then employees will be assigned in seniority order from lowest to highest in which case the employee will not be disadvantaged for the opportunity of an additional voluntary holiday off by seniority at a later time.
c)	Such assigned time off on holidays will be equitably distributed among employees on an annual basis, and will be assigned independent of any other assigned time off.
369.	If more employees request a holiday off than can be granted, employees will be
assigned to work according to inverse seniority, (lowest to highest).
157 See Intent Note for Paragraph 367B
158 see paragraph 355D
159 see paragraph 355D
94
Assignments to work in excess of one half (1/2) of the holidays will be made according to inverse seniority (lowest to highest) in rotating order.
Holiday Shift Preference Process
370.	Employees required to work on a holiday will be granted their shift preference in accordance with the following sequence:
1)	Employees assigned to a straight shift will be scheduled on their straight shift in seniority order, highest to lowest;
2)	Employees assigned to a rotating shift will be assigned to either of their shifts, in seniority order, highest to lowest;
3)	Employees not assigned in accordance with 370.1 or 370.2 above will be assigned to the remaining available shifts based on seniority, highest to lowest;
4)	Requests to work other than one's normal straight shift or rotating shift may be honored provided that they do not prevent another employee from being scheduled in accordance with 370.1, 370.2, or 370.3 above or require payment of overtime according to Article 15.
371.	Nothing in this procedure precludes an employee from volunteering to work additional holidays during the annual holiday request period or during the four-week schedule request period which includes the holiday. However, an employee who requests to be scheduled on an additional holiday shall not negatively impact other employees who request that holiday as part of their holiday obligation.
371A. Once a holiday schedule is posted, an employee who wishes to work an additional holiday will assume the shift of the most senior employee who desires the holiday off.
372.	If safe and adequate nursing care as determined by the supervisor cannot be guaranteed with these guidelines, more senior employees may be moved from their preferred shift first, and then others assigned to work a holiday they had requested off in inverse seniority order (lowest to highest). Any employee thus affected will be given an explanation by the supervisor.
373.	An employee hired or an employee who transfers into a unit after January 15
will be permitted to request holiday time off for the applicable period consistent with the staffing needs of the unit for the holiday. An attempt will be made to schedule such employees for holiday time off; however, no employee with a valid request made during January shall be disadvantaged by the attempt to accommodate the request of such a transferring employee or new hire.
374.	Once an employee is assigned to work a holiday, any request for changes in assignment shall be made to the supervisor. Such requests for changes in assignment will be granted at the discretion of the supervisor.
95
375.	For the purpose of timely resolution of disputes arising from the scheduling of holidays, the Association Chairperson and the Director of University of Michigan Health System Human Resources Department (or their designates) will meet to resolve the matter. If the matter is not resolved at this meeting, it may be subject to Article 46 (Dispute Resolution Procedure and Mediation Procedure) and Article 47 (Arbitration Procedure) beginning with step two.

ARTICLE 35
FUNERAL LEAVE PAY (BEREAVEMENT)
403.	In the event of the death of an employee's spouse or other qualified adult living in the employee's household, or the son, daughter, parent (including stepparent), grandparent, brother, sister, grandchild (or the spouse of any of them), of either the employee, other qualified adult, the employee's spouse, or any other related person, living in the employee's household, an employee who attends the funeral or service shall be granted time off work with pay plus shift premium if applicable. The amount of time off work with pay shall be only that which is required to attend the funeral or service and make necessary funeral or service arrangements, and (prior or subsequent to the funeral or service) financial, custodial, or other necessary arrangements for surviving family members. In no event shall such time off work with pay exceed three (3) workdays as defined by the employee's work schedule and not to exceed thirty-six (36) hours. If additional time off is needed, the employee may request the use of accrued paid time off.
404.	In the event that an employee is on paid time off, the provisions of this Article nevertheless shall apply.
ARTICLE 36
JURY AND WITNESS SERVICE
405.	An employee who loses time from work during the employee's normal schedule of work because of jury duty service or to testify pursuant to a subpoena shall be paid for such time lost at the employee's rate of pay plus shift premium, if applicable. Jury duty and witness fees shall be offset against such pay. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, such jury duty and witness service shall be considered time worked. The employee shall furnish the University a written statement from the court showing the days and time of jury duty or witness service and the amount of jury duty or witness fees the employee was eligible to receive for each day. The employee will report to work when released from jury duty or witness service.
96
406.	Compensation received as reimbursement for expenses incurred pursuant to jury or witness service shall not be used to reduce regular University compensation.
407.	Whenever possible and without disrupting other employees' existing work schedules, an employee while on jury duty will be assigned to the day shift and a Monday through Friday schedule provided the schedule of work change does not require payment of an overtime premium. In this regard, employees should be assigned a schedule, which eliminates or minimizes employees from being scheduled to work on non-day shifts and/or not scheduled to work on days of jury duty. It is understood that this may mean a temporary reassignment from their normal shift rotation and/or the usual hours of work (e.g., twelve (12) hour shifts changed to eight (8) hour shifts).
408.	Whenever an employee is directed by the University to testify in a case involving the University, such employee will receive pay for time lost from normal duties as if the employee were performing normal duties. If subpoenaed by the University, witness fees shall be offset against such pay. In addition, such an employee will receive expenses, if any, in accordance with University regulations.
409.	None of the above provisions will apply to time lost from work by an employee
who is a plaintiff or by an employee who testifies as an "expert witness", whether testifying pursuant to subpoena or not. Such an employee must make prior arrangements with the supervisor for either paid time off or an excused absence.
ARTICLE 37
ANNUAL MILITARY LEAVE
410.	An employee, who is a member of the armed forces reserve or National Guard and who loses time from work during the employee's normal schedule of work to participate in annual military training or for service required as a result of a civil disorder or other temporary emergency, shall be granted an excused absence from work. The employee will be paid for the time lost at the employee's hourly rate plus shift premium, if applicable, not to exceed fifteen (15) work days in any one calendar year. Armed forces reserve or National Guard base pay shall be offset against such pay. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, such service shall be considered time worked. The employee shall furnish the University with written evidence of service and the amount of base pay the employee was eligible to receive. If an employee receives PTO pay during a period of training or service, the employee shall not be eligible for the pay provided by this Article for that period of time for which the employee received PTO pay.
97
ARTICLE 38 LEAVES OF ABSENCE
FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT (FMLA)
410A. The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) refers to a Federal law which provides for benefit continuation and the ability return to work in the same position for employees with twelve (12) or more months of service who are absent for up to twelve (12) weeks due to a qualifying event. The benefit begins at the first day of paid or unpaid absence related to a qualifying event. The absence does not need to be consecutive and the benefit is limited to twelve (12) weeks in a twelve (12) month period.
410B. Qualifying events are consistent with those events, which would qualify an employee for a personal medical, childcare or family medical leave of absence, as described in this Article.
410C. In addition to FMLA coverage as outlined in Paragraph 410A, the University and the Association have agreed that health benefits will be extended for the first twelve (12) weeks of an unpaid personal medical leave or childcare leave of absence following the use of Extended Sick Time.
410D. The employee will be required to provide appropriate notice and documentation to support an FMLA qualifying absence. Written notice will be provided to an employee that an FMLA qualifying absence will be counted toward the employee’s twelve weeks of eligibility160.
410E. Medical reports and records made or obtained by the University and other medical information are confidential and shared only on a need-to-know basis. Such records are kept in a separate file and are not part of the employee personnel file.
SECTION A. PERSONAL MEDICAL
411.	An employee with seniority who (1) is unable to work because of personal sickness, injury or pregnancy and (2) has exhausted PTO under Article 29 and supplemental disability pay if applicable, under Article 30 shall be granted a leave of absence without pay upon requesting in writing and furnishing evidence of disability satisfactory to the University. Such request and evidence may be furnished by the Association or any other interested party.
411A. For those employees with twelve (12) or more months of service, the University will continue its portion of health benefit contributions during an absence related to an event qualifying for personal medical, childcare or family medical leaves not to exceed twelve (12) weeks each twelve (12) months, beginning
160 See Intent Note for paragraph 410D
98
with the first day of paid or unpaid absence related to the event. In no case will University contributions to health and dental benefits exceed twelve (12) weeks annually. The employee will continue to be responsible for paying their portion of health plan premiums. The Group Health Insurance Plan may be continued during a personal medical, family medical or childcare leave of absence beyond twelve (12) weeks provided direct payment of the total premium is made through and as prescribed by the University, except as provided by the University Disability Plan161.
412.	The leave of absence shall be for the period of continuing disability, but not to exceed twelve (12) months, unless extended by the University. In no case, however, shall a leave and extension exceed two (2) years. To continue the leave of absence, an employee must receive appropriate medical treatment and furnish satisfactory evidence of continuing disability. When necessary, physician's opinions shall be the basis used to determine the question of appropriate medical treatment or evidence of continuing disability. Arbitrary failure to follow accepted medical practice in treating a sickness or injury shall be reason for discontinuing the leave of absence. The medical leave may be taken on an intermittent or a reduced effort schedule, but only when medically necessary. When an employee requests an intermittent or reduced effort schedule, the University may require the employee to temporarily transfer to an available alternative position, or alter an existing position for which the employee is qualified and which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than does the employee's regular position. The alternative position must have equivalent pay and benefits for the first twelve (12) weeks of the paid or unpaid absence162.
SECTION B. DISABILITY
413.	Subject to, and consistent with, the University Disability Plan, as provided in this agreement under Article 39, an employee who qualifies for disability benefits will be granted a leave of absence for an indefinite period.
SECTION C. PERSONAL
414.	An employee with seniority may be granted a leave of absence without pay by the University for a period not to exceed six (6) months. The leave may be extended for additional periods, but in no case shall the leave and extensions exceed one year. An employee on personal leave of absence shall not be eligible for benefits under the Disability Plan.
SECTION D. MILITARY
161 See Intent Note for Paragraph 411A
162 See Intent Note for Paragraph 412
99
415.	An employee entering the military service as (1) an inductee through the selective service system, or (2) a voluntary enlistee while having a 1-A selective service classification, or (3) a member of the Armed Forces Reserve or National Guard, either pursuant to an order or call to active duty or active duty for training, or by volunteering during a period of national emergency, shall be granted a leave of absence without pay for the period of active duty or active duty for training, not to exceed four (4) years, plus additional time imposed by law and the period in which reinstatement must be requested as set forth in Section J and the time required for placement. An employee on military leave of absence shall not be eligible for benefits under the Disability Plan as provided under Article 39 in this agreement.
415A. An employee who meets the eligibility requirements of FMLA (i.e. a 50% appointment and 1250 hours worked during the previous 12 month period), and has a qualifying exigency that exists because the employee’s spouse, child or parent is on active duty or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty in the Armed Forces in support of a contingency operation, shall be granted a leave of absence without pay by utilizing available FMLA. This applies to members of the Reserves, National Guard and retired members of the Regular Armed Forces or Reserves. This does not apply to a member of the Regular Armed Forces. Qualifying exigencies include the following:
1)	Short-notice deployment: Issues that arise from the fact that a covered military member is called to active duty with notice of seven calendar days or less prior to deployment. Absence can be for a period of seven calendar days beginning on the date a covered military member is notified of an impending call or order to active duty in support of a contingency operation.
2)	Military events and related activities: To attend any official ceremony, program, or event sponsored by the military that is related to the active duty or call to active duty status, or to attend family support or assistance programs and informational briefings related to the call to active duty or call to active status.
3)	Childcare and school activities: To arrange for alternative childcare for a child, to provide childcare on an emergency basis, to enroll a child in school or to attend school meetings for the active duty or call to active duty.
4)	Financial and legal arrangements: To make financial or legal
arrangements to address the military member’s absence for military duty or to act as the military member’s representative for purposes of obtaining military service benefits. Absences can be taken to obtain military service benefits while the military member is away on active duty or within ninety days of termination of active duty.
5)	Counseling: To attend counseling provided by someone other than a health care provider for the employee, military member, or a child of the military member, provided the need for counseling arises from the active duty or call to active duty status.
6)	Rest and recuperation: To spend time with a military member who is on a short-term, temporary, rest and recuperation leave during the
100
period of deployment. Absence is limited to five days for each military rest and recuperation visit.
7)	Post-deployment activities: To attend arrival ceremonies, reintegration briefings and events, and any other ceremony or program sponsored by the military for a period of ninety days following the termination of the active duty status.
8)	Additional activities: To address other events that arise out of the military member’s active duty or call to active duty status provided the employer and employee agree that the absence will qualify as an exigency, and agree to both the timing and duration of the absence.
415B. Contingency Operation is a military operation that is designated by the Secretary of Defense as an operation in which members of the Armed Forces are or may become involved in military actions, operations or hostilities against an enemy of the United States or against an opposing military force or results in the call or order to, or retention on active duty of members of the Armed Forces during a war or national emergency declared by the President or Congress.
415C. An employee meets the eligibility requirements of the FMLA, and is needed to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness incurred on active duty who is a spouse, parent, child or next of kin of the employee shall be granted a leave of absence without pay for twenty six weeks or the exhaustion of the employee’s available time under the FMLA in a 12 month period that begins with the employee’s first absence to care for the covered service member. A covered service member is a member of the United Stated Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy; is in outpatient status; or is on the temporary disability retired list of a serious injury or illness. A serious illness or injury is defined as an injury or illness incurred by a covered service member in the line of duty while on active duty in the United States Armed Forces that causes the service member to be medically unfit to perform the duties of the service member’s office, grade, rank or rating. Next of kin of a covered service member is the nearest blood relative, other than the service member’s spouse, parent or child in the following order of priority:
1)	Blood relatives who have been granted legal custody of the service member by court decree or statutory provisions
2)	Siblings
3)	Grandparents
4)	Aunts and Uncles
5)	First cousins
415D. The service member may specifically designate another blood relative as his or her nearest blood relative. In this circumstance, only the designated next of kin may care for the covered service member under the FMLA.
SECTION E.	CHILDCARE
101
416. Following the birth, fostering, custody, adoption or preparation for any of the above of an employee's child, step child or legal ward under age eighteen, or eighteen years or older and incapable of self care, a non-probationary employee, upon written request, shall be granted a leave of absence without pay for not more than six (6) months. In the case of the birth of a child, the childcare leave may begin the date upon which the employee's physician releases the employee to return to work. A leave of up to six (6) months may be taken anytime within the first twelve (12) months of the event. It must be taken in a single block of time and must be completed within one (1) year following the birth, adoption, fostering or preparation for any of the above. Thereafter, extensions may be granted by the University, but in no case shall a leave and extensions exceed one (1) year from the beginning of the childcare leave.
For those employees with twelve (12) or more months of service, the University will continue its portion of health benefit contributions during an absence related to an event qualifying for personal medical, childcare or family medical leaves not to exceed twelve (12) weeks each twelve (12) months, beginning with the first day of paid or unpaid absence related to the event. For those employees on extended sick time under Article 30 prior to a childcare leave, the University will extend its portion of health benefit contributions for the first twelve (12) weeks of the leave of absence each twelve (12 months). In no case will University contributions to health and dental benefits exceed twelve (12) weeks annually. The employee will continue to be responsible for paying their portion of health plan premiums. The group Health Insurance Plan may be continued during a personal medical, family medical or childcare leave of absence beyond twelve (12) weeks, provided direct payment of the total premium is made through and as prescribed by the University, except as provided by the University Disability Plan163.
SECTION F.	FAMILY MEDICAL
416A. A non-probationary employee who is unable to work because he/she is needed to care for a seriously or chronically ill family member will be granted a leave of absence without pay for up to twelve (12) weeks per year. The family medical leave may be taken on an intermittent or a reduced effort schedule, but only when medically necessary for the family member. The University may require written medical certification of the need to care for the family member. When an employee requests an intermittent or reduced effort schedule the University may require the employee to temporarily transfer to an available alternative position or alter an existing position for which the employee is qualified and which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than does the employee's regular position. The alternative position must have equivalent pay and benefits.
For those employees with twelve (12) or more months of service, the University will continue its portion of health benefit contributions during an absence
See Intent Note for Paragraph 416
102
related to an event qualifying for personal medical, childcare or family medical leaves not to exceed twelve (12) weeks each twelve (12) months, beginning with the first day of paid or unpaid absence related to the event.

422.	An employee on an educational leave of absence shall not be eligible for benefits under the Disability Plan.
SECTION J. RETURN TO ACTIVE EMPLOYMENT
423.	Return to active employment prior to the expiration of any leave of absence, or any extension, shall be at the option of the University. The University, at its option and without cost to the employee, may require that a physician or physicians examine the employee before returning the employee to active employment. If returning from a personal medical, childcare or family medical leave within twelve (12) weeks, the designated physician may not be a University employee.
424.	In addition, and in order to be eligible to return to active employment, an employee returning from a military leave of absence must have a certificate of satisfactory service and apply for re-employment within ninety (90) calendar days after release from duty. Employees who are hospitalized and simultaneously released from the military must apply for re-employment within ninety (90) calendar days following release from the hospital.

425.	In addition, and in order to be eligible to return to active employment, an employee returning from a personal medical or childcare leave of absence must provide, at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the end of the leave, a statement from the employee's physician releasing the employee to return to work, except that this shall not apply in the case of a childcare leave of absence granted for an adoption, fostering or custody
426.	At the conclusion of a leave of absence an employee eligible to return will be placed in an available open position in the employee's former classification title, assuming the ability to perform the work available. Except as provided in Paragraph 426A, if the employee does not have the ability to perform work or if there are no available positions in the employee’s former classification, the employee will be placed on reduction-in-force and placed in accordance with Article 26166..
426A. An employee returning from a paid or unpaid absence related to an FMLA qualifying event (including extended sick time, PTO, personal medical, childcare or family medical leave of absence) not exceeding twelve (12) weeks from the first day of paid or unpaid absence will be returned to the employee's former position167.
427.	If the leave was for a fixed period of time, and the return is timely, the employee's placement will be within seven (7) calendar days after the end of the date. If the return is not timely, the employee will be terminated unless extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the employee prevented the employee from returning as scheduled, except that continuation of the reasons that the employee was granted a leave shall not be an extraordinary circumstance. If the employee was able to (1) seek a leave extension prior to the leave expiration or (2) notify the University that the return would not be timely, but did not, this exception to termination shall not apply.
SECTION K. GENERAL CONDITIONS
428.	During a leave of absence, an employee will not accrue PTO nor be eligible for any payments for time off work provided by this Agreement, except as provided in Section D. of Article 39, (Benefit Plans).

SECTION A. GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN
441.	During the term of this Agreement, managed care and fee-for-service health insurance plans that include medical and prescription drug benefits equivalent to existing coverage in effect at the execution date of this agreement will be provided and maintained subject to the provisions of this Article.

1)	The University contribution toward health insurance will remain through December 31, 2012 at an average aggregate contribution ratio of 85% contributed by the University and 15% contributed by the employee for 2012. The University contribution toward employee health insurance will achieve by 6/30/2014 an average aggregate contribution ratio of 70% contributed by the University and 30% contributed by employees. The aggregate contribution of 30 percent is inclusive of the cost of health care premiums, co-pays (for prescription drugs, office visits, emergency and urgent care visits, etc.) and deductibles. The University contribution for health insurance will be based on the two lowest-cost comprehensive plans and do so by weighting the premiums based on enrollment. Thereby any cost increases in a plan with low enrollment will not cause a greater increase than necessary for those in other health plans. The base premiums will be calculated on actual cost experience: Employee-only coverage (1x), Employee plus adult dependent (2x), Employee plus child(ren) (1.76x), Employee plus adult and child(ren) (2.76x); that results in a prioritized University contribution. The highest percentage University contribution will be made for employees, a higher percentage University contribution for child dependents, followed by a high percentage University contribution for adult dependents.

Starting January 1, 2013 thirty-three percent (33%) of the increases in employee co-premiums will occur and on January 1, 2014, an additional thirty-three percent (33%) of the increases in employee premiums will occur, and the remaining thirty-three percent (33%) of co-premium increases will occur on June 30, 2014.
5)	Part-time employees (20-31.9 hours) may be eligible to receive the same University contribution rates as full-time employees as determined by their full-time equivalent salary starting January 1, 2013.

University at, or through, an educational or training institution approved by the University; (3) intends to and does remain on the active employment roll during the entire term of the class; (4) successfully completes the course; and, (5) provides the required documentation in a timely fashion. Approvals must be authorized prior to enrollment.

The course cannot be used to further the employee's educational degree attainment beyond the Master's degree level. (Courses in professional programs in Law, Medicine, and Dentistry are specifically excluded from this program.)

For part-time employees, tuition support is calculated on a pro rata basis according to the appointment fraction on the date the request for tuition support is approved176.
477A. University of Michigan courses. Full-time employees are eligible for 75% of the cost of in-state tuition plus registration fees for up to four (4) credit hours per term. Part-time employees with a fifty per cent or greater appointment are eligible for tuition support proportional to their appointment fraction.

A staff member who meets all other requirements, but is excluded from monetary participation because of benefits such as those resulting from scholarships or military service may be granted time off from work using the same criteria as for participants receiving refunds. In no case will time off from work to attend classes be considered as working time in the computation of overtime.
479A. Part-time employees who qualify for tuition support on a pro-rated basis are not eligible to take the course during working hours and be paid for the time to attend class. It shall be at the discretion of the employee's supervisor if special scheduling can be devised to allow the part-time employee to attend the class (es).

a) successfully complete the class as defined in Paragraph 474, and b) provide the manager with an official grade report and a paid bill or receipt for tuition within sixty (60) days after the end of the term, the full amount of the advance will be deducted from the employee's paycheck in equal installments over a six-month period, as authorized by the employee's signature on the Request.
3)	If an employee leaves the University, either voluntarily or involuntarily, before successfully completing the course or before reimbursing any amounts owing under this Article, or if an employee does not register for, or stops attending, a course for which he/she has received an advance, the employee is responsible for immediate repayment of the full amount of the tuition advance.

488.	The University is committed to maintain an environment that is safe and free from violence and will not tolerate violent or threatening behavior. All University community members share the responsibility and are expected to maintain a climate of behavior that does not tolerate acts of bullying, violence, threats and aggression. We must not and will not tolerate actions that serve to target or intimidate members of our community based on race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious or political beliefs, national origin or other personal characteristics. When we learn of such incidents, we have a responsibility to address them promptly. Acts of violence and aggression include verbal or physical actions that create fear or apprehension of bodily harm or threaten the safety of an employee, supervisor, co-worker, patient, general public or the University community at large. If an employee experiences, witnesses or suspects violent behavior or acts of aggression, that employee shall seek assistance immediately from Security, the appropriate manager, supervisor, or administrator. If a situation occurs and it is necessary, the employee may leave the immediate area and go to a location of safety, after having assured patient safety to the extent possible. The employee must notify the appropriate management representative of the situation and collaboratively determine next steps. For incidents requiring immediate assistance, security or the designated local authority should be contacted, as appropriate. The University of Michigan health System aspires to be the safest health system in the country. Any member of the community can report an incident and seek assistance. It is expected that employees experiencing acts of violence or aggression will complete and submit an incident report so that the University can determine and understand the factors contributing to the occurrence of these incidences and work as a community to eliminate them. The University will investigate every incident and take the appropriate action to prevent recurrence. Within (three) (3) months of ratification (Nov. 6, 2011) of this agreement a customized mechanism will be designed and implemented by the Nursing Health and Safety Council that serves the purpose of communicating any and all safety issues and concerns experienced by the registered nurses. This may or may not utilize existing software. The Association will be provided access
180 see MOU 742 “Workload/staffing issues”
122
and information to the extent necessary to fulfill their obligation in representing members.
488A. Upon request of an employee, the University and the Department of security will provide an opportunity for the employee to receive training in non-violence crisis intervention. Any employee who makes this request will be encouraged to attend and will be scheduled to attend on work time.
488B. Any area or unit may request a physical security survey. This survey will be conducted within thirty (30) days of the request and will include a review of items such as, but not limited to lights, locks and security procedures.

Health Services or other designated locations or Emergency Services will not be paid beyond their regular schedule of work.
494.	Treatment of job-related acute or chronic illnesses and injuries affecting an employee's ability to work by the Occupational Health Services_or other designated location or Emergency Services shall be at no cost to the employee. Employees who are subsequently referred to other clinics because of a job-related illness or injury will not be required to pay for the services provided.

SECTION C. REVIEW PROCEDURE AND NOTIFICATION TO ASSOCIATION
499 and 500. Deleted
124
501.	The parties agree that discipline should be both corrective and progressive rather than punitive. In this regard, the University will follow a discipline procedure, which is corrective and progressive. In any individual situation, the extent of disciplinary action taken will depend on the facts and circumstances available at the time the decision is made. In cases of serious misconduct, steps of progressive discipline may be omitted.
501A. Six (6) months following the issuance of a disciplinary letter, and at the employee's request, the manager will write a second letter reflecting the employee's current status. In addition, letters of discipline more than two (2) years old will not be considered in transfer/promotion decisions. Such letters shall not be used in progressive discipline. For those disciplinary cases that rise to the level of disciplinary layoff or discharge, letters of discipline, which are more than two (2) years old and indicate a trend or pattern, may be used164.
502.	The University will not discharge, suspend or give a disciplinary layoff to an employee over the telephone provided that the employee agrees to return to work to meet with the supervisor.

This can be accomplished via fax or other electronic media as available.
5)	Upon notification, the Association shall have the opportunity to respond within the required time limits as set in Article 45, Discipline or Article 46, Dispute Resolution Procedure and Mediation Procedure.
504.	Deleted

507.	The Association may have not more than two (2) non-employee Association Representatives present at such a review.
SECTION D. SUSPENSION
508.	In the event that an employee is suspended from employment pending a decision as to the extent of the disciplinary action to be taken, if any, notice of such suspension will be given to the Association Chairperson or other person designated by telephone and in writing. The suspension will be no longer than is necessary to gather sufficient facts to make the decision. Once an employee has been suspended, the University will take disciplinary action, if any, within seven (7) calendar days unless mutually agreed otherwise.
SECTION E. REMOVAL FROM PREMISES
509.	When the University intends to order an employee to leave work for disciplinary reasons, the employee's Association Representative shall be notified by the University and, without loss of time or pay, be afforded the opportunity to be present and hear the reasons, and thereafter be afforded the opportunity to consult with the employee for a reasonable period of time at a place provided by the University before the employee leaves the premises. If, however, the immediate removal of the employee from University premises is necessary to prevent injury to the employee or others or disruption of the workplace, such opportunity need not be afforded. In such a case, the University shall notify the Association of the incident. It is understood that this Section does not prevent the suspension of the employee or notice to the employee of the disciplinary action taken before the arrival of the Association representative or notice to the employee that the representative has been called. When the supervisor has concluded, the Association Representative may ask questions for clarification or offer additional relevant information. It is understood that the dispute resolution procedure is the appropriate procedure to review the merits of the disciplinary action taken.
SECTION F. REVIEW OF DISCIPLINE/DISCHARGE
510.	A dispute which (1) concerns a disciplinary layoff or discharge of a non-probationary employee, and (2) alleges that no just cause in fact exists, or that the disciplinary action was taken arbitrarily and was clearly excessive,

ARTICLE 50
RELEASE TIME FOR ASSOCIATION BUSINESS
593.	The Chairperson, the Vice Chairperson and the Dispute Chairperson of the Association shall both be released from regularly assigned work at no loss of regular pay, benefits or seniority for five (5) eight (8) hour days per week for responsibilities in accordance with Article 45, Section D., Discipline; Article 46, Section E., Dispute Resolution Procedure and Mediation Procedure; and Article 47 Arbitration Procedure; Article 48, Conferences; Article 9, Association Orientation; and other joint meetings with the University.

At the conclusion of his/her term in office as chairperson or Vice Chairperson or Dispute Chairperson of the Association, he/she will return to a position within the same pay grade held prior to taking the above Association
140
positions. At the Chairperson's or Vice Chairperson’s option, he/she will return to his/her former position185.
594.	In the event, however, the Chairperson, Vice Chairperson or Dispute Chairperson ceases to perform the functions set forth in this Section or designates a representative when otherwise available (sickness, paid time off, other short term absences) or is not otherwise available as scheduled, after notice to the Association and a reasonable opportunity to remedy the situation, the pay shall cease or be reduced to coincide with availability until the situation is remedied.
595.	The Secretary or the Treasurer and the Area Representatives of the Association shall be released from regularly assigned work at no loss of regular pay, benefits, or seniority for the time allocated by the Association, for the purpose of conducting the business of the Association, which is directly related to the administration of the Agreement. All such time off shall be scheduled with the permission of the Secretary's, Treasurer's and Area Representatives supervisor(s) and shall be considered time worked for purposes of computing PTO accrual and overtime. During a short-term absence of the Chairperson, the release time of the Secretary, Treasurer and Area Representatives may be rearranged.
595A. The total annual release time provided under paragraph 593 and 595 will be equal to the total number of bargaining unit employees on July 1 of each year multiplied by two hours.
SECTION B.
596.	A non-probationary employee who is duly elected or appointed by the Association, upon the timely written request of the Chairperson of the Association, will be granted an excused absence without pay for a period of time sufficient to attend a meeting, conference or convention of the Michigan Nurses Association provided, however, that such request, in writing, is received no later than two (2) calendar months prior to the requested time off. In addition, no employee will be granted more than five (5) consecutive working days off at any one time nor may more than three (3) employees be granted release time at any one time.

ARTICLE 52
SUBCONTRACTING, TEMPORARY AND/OR "AGENCY" NURSES
601.	The parties agree that it is highly advantageous to employ regular employees, LPN’s and aides to provide patient care. However, the parties recognize that in our environment it may be necessary to employ temporary and/or "agency" nurses.
601A. If a CSR/ACNRP temporary staff works an average of twenty (20) or more hours per week for a period of six (6) months, the unit workload will be evaluated to determine the need for a regular unit or CSR/ACNRP position. If no need exists, the temporary assignment may be extended by mutual agreement186.
601B. A CSR/ACNRP temporary staff may not hold a position which requires work of an average of twenty (20) or more hours per week for longer than one (1) year without mutual agreement187.
601C. There are no limitations to the use of Central Staffing Resource or ACNRP temporary staff or Per Diem staff related to coverage for an extended absence related to Extended Sick or FMLA. In addition, hours accepted from regular employees and worked by Per Diem employees on units without CSR or ACNRP support will not count toward the limitation as described in Paragraphs 601A and 601B.
601D. Units without CSR or ACNRP support will establish specific unit expectations for utilization of Per Diem employees and submit these guidelines for joint Association and Management review.
601E. Temporary hours for the previous four-week scheduling period will be provided to the unit Workload Review Committee (WRC) on a monthly basis and included in the WRC minutes. In addition, all temporary hours will be evaluated every six months by the unit workload committee to assess the appropriate use of temporary employees.
602.	The University will provide employees charged with the responsibility for assigning work to temporary and/or "agency" nurses, any known information regarding work the temporary and/or "agency" nurse is not qualified to perform that regular employees on the unit are customarily assigned.
186 See Paragraphs 601C
187 See Paragraphs 601C
142
603.	Further, the parties agree that regular unit employees will receive priority over temporary and/or "agency" nurses when unit work schedules are being developed. The University will avoid changing, reorganizing or altering the work schedules of regular employees to accommodate the assignments of temporary and/or "agency" nurses, except by mutual agreement. To this end, after all regular employees are scheduled, the manager may then add Per Diem employees to the schedule (As outlined in the sequence of Paragraph 91)188.
604.	In the event a decision is made to have work regularly and customarily performed by employees in the bargaining unit performed on University-operated premises by a source outside the University or by University employed temporaries, no employee in the bargaining unit shall suffer a loss of base wages as a result of such a decision.
ARTICLE 53
CHARGE NURSE GUIDELINES
605.	The Hospitals' and unit specific charge nurse guidelines will be reviewed annually and revised if necessary. A reasonable number of employees whose work assignments include charge nurse responsibility will be given the opportunity to provide input to the review and revision process. Upon request, the Association will be given copies of the guidelines.
605A. Charge nurse patient assignments will be adjusted to reflect the responsibilities and expectations of the charge nurse duties189.
605B. Employees must complete a unit based charge nurse orientation prior to being assigned charge nurse responsibilities. If an employee must be assigned before the Central Charge Nurse class is taken, that employee will be scheduled for the next available Central Charge Nurse class190.
605C. Employees performing the functions of a charge nurse will not be construed by either party as excluded from the definition of employees covered by the Michigan Employment Relations Act. Accordingly, employees will not perform supervisory functions.
ARTICLE 54
SEVERABILITY
606.	If any provision of this Agreement is found invalid because it is contrary to Federal or State law by a board or court of competent jurisdiction, or if compliance with or enforcement of any provision should be permanently restrained by any such court, that provision shall be null and void, but the
188 See Intent Note for Paragraph 603 and Addendum A, Per Diem Guidelines
189See Intent Note for Paragraph 605A
190 See Paragraphs 183, 185L, 234 & Intent Note 605B
143
remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. At the request of either party, the parties shall enter into negotiations for the purpose of arriving at a mutually satisfactory and lawful provision. In such an event, the University may exercise its discretion in the matter until completion of any such negotiations.
ARTICLE 55 WAIVER
607.	The University and the Association acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and that the understanding and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. Therefore the University and the Association, except as provided in Article 56, TERM OF AGREEMENT, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right, and agrees the other shall not be obliged to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter referred to or covered in this Agreement, or with respect to any subject or matter not specifically referred to or covered in this Agreement, even though such subject or matter may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either or both parties at the time that they negotiated or signed this Agreement.
144
ARTICLE 56
TERM OF AGREEMENT
608.

APPENDIX E CALCULATION OF STRAIGHT DAY SHIFTS
637B. Calculation of straight day shifts per Paragraph 124 is as follows:
1)	Total the number of day shifts per week as though all budgeted positions are filled.
2)	Multiply the number of day shifts per week (from 1 above) by 8 to determine the total number of day shift hours required.
3)	Multiply the number of total day shift hours required (from 2 above) by 0.4 (40%) to determine the number of hours to be designated as straight day shift hours.
4)	Divide the number of hours designated as straight day shift hours (from 3 above) by 40 to determine the number of FTE (full time equivalent) to be designated as straight day shift positions.
5)	Use the following chart to determine the number of employees to be assigned to straight day shift. Use the employee's shift length and appointment fraction to determine the Day Shift Fraction for each employee. Subtract the Day Shift Fraction from the number of FTE designated as straight day shift positions (from 4 above). Continue this process until zero or less than zero is achieved.
STRAIGHT DAY SHIFT EXAMPLE
Example:
a)	Assume 50 day shifts per week
b)	50 shifts x 8 hours = 400 hours
c)	400 hours x .4 (40%) = 160.0 straight day shift hours
d)	160 day shift hours divided by 40 hours = 4 FTE to be designated as day shift positions
e)	Employees in seniority order:
Emp. A	Shift Length 8	Hours/Week 40	Day Shift Fraction 1.00	Calculation (4-1=3)
B	12	28	.47	(3-.47=2.53)
C	8/12	36	.70 (3-8's & 4-12's/2 weeks)		(2.53-7=1.83)
D	8/12	40	.80 (4-8's & 4-12's/2 weeks)		(1.83-8=1.03)
E	8	24	.60	(1.03-.6=.43)
F	12	36	.60	(.43-.6=<0)
These six employees would be assigned to straight day shifts.

Tuition Reimbursement Process of NON-U of M Class
Start with Tuition for ALL hours registered and registration fee if applicable	Nurse Mary registered for 12 NON-U of M credits, and there was not a registration fee	$4252.50
Subtract grants, scholarships (Note: Nobody can receive more than the total amount of the paid tuitions and fees)	Mary did not get any grants or scholarships.	$4252.50 -0.00 $4252.50
There is not a credit calculation for Non U of M		
Determine annual max* allowed in tuition support for Non U of M courses	Max equals 3x the current term max offered to employees not represented by a labor organization. (See SPG)	$1428.00 x3 $4284.00 (as of 8/1/09)*
Multiply by appointment fraction to get annual maximum allowed.	Mary’s appointment is 0.9	$4284.00 x0.9 $3855.60
Determine allowed tuition/fees (minus grants and scholarships) by multiplying by .75 (needed in each case to make determination based on 477b)	Para. 477b) limits the reimbursement to 75% of the cost of in-state tuition.	$4252.50 x.75 $3189.38
Finalize amount to be reimbursed based on annual max and prior tuition reimbursements/advances	Mary has not received any prior tuition reimbursements/advances in the fiscal year. Choose whichever amount is less.	In this case the $3189.38 is less than remaining annual max ($3855.60). ($666.22 remains in future annual tuition support within the fiscal year)
* New contract language (2008) allows for tuition support in an ‘annual’ vs. a ‘term’ amount for the Non-U of M courses. Now allows for the scheduling of traditional and non-traditional terms and classes. Max calculation based on the current SPG and University’s calculation for the term of Non-U of M courses.

Tuition Support Program Tuition Reimbursement Process of U of M Class
1. Start with Tuition for ALL hours registered	Nurse Mary registered for 8 U of M credits—one class	$3632
2. Divide by Total of ALL credit hours registered	Mary registered for 8 credits, so we want to know $/ credit	$3632 ^ 8= $454
3. Multiply by number of credit hours up to 4 only	Although Mary is taking 8 credits, only 4 are eligible for Tuition Reimbursement	$454 x 4 = $1816
4. Add registration fee (applicable amount only)	Eligible fees in this situation are $80.	1816.00 + 80.00 $1896.00
5. Multiply by .75 (U of M limit)	Para 477a) limits the reimbursement to .75% of the cost	$1896 x.75 $1422
6. Multiply by appointment fraction to get the amount eligible for Tuition Reimbursement	Mary’s appointment is .9	$1422 x.9 $1279.80
7. Determine total bill for All credits plus registration fees		$3632 +$80 $3712
8. Determine the Employee’s own expenses once Tuition Reimbursement is applied.	You are now determining Mary’s own expenses for the semester	$3712.00 -$1279.80 $2432.20
9. Final Step: Determine whether grant or scholarship will affect amount of tuition reimbursement: NOTE: Loans that must be paid back by the nurse are not counted in this calculation. Example where financial aids does not affect Tuition Reimbursement^ Example where financial aid does affect Tuition Reimbursement^	Deduct total grant and scholarship award from the nurse’s own expenses determined in previous step Mary’s financial aid: Grant: $593 Scholarship: $0 If the calculation above results in a positive number, then the Tuition reimbursement figure from Step 6, applies. — If the calculation results in a negative number, then this means the employee’s tuition reimbursement must be adjusted by that amount. Subtract that amount from the Tuition reimbursement figure in Step 6 to determine final amount.	$2432.20 -$593.00 $1839.20 In this case, Mary still owes $1839.20 on her own, and so the full -eimbursement applies ($1279.80). — -- If instead of $593.00 in Scholarship, Mary received a $2500 grant, $2432.20 -2500.00 -$67.80 $1279.80 -67.80 $1212.00 In this case, Mary would receive $1212.00 in Tuition Reimbursement.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING PTO DONATION PROGRAM
728.	Within thirty (30) days of the ratification (Nov. 6, 2011) of this agreement, the University and the Association agree to convene a work group to create a system for administration of a Paid Time Off (PTO) donation program for employees under this agreement. The PTO donation program will be implemented no later than January 1, 2012. Key components of the PTO donation program will include the following:
1)	PTO donation program would be open only to members of the UMPNC bargaining unit (i.e. only those in the bargaining unit are eligible to donate PTO or to receive donated PTO).
2)	Donation will be of PTO hours, not cash equivalent.
3)	Donation will be made in four-hour blocks.
4)	The donating employee must have at least 80 hours of PTO remaining in his or her PTO bank after the donated hours are deducted (this could be prorated according to donor FTE).
5)	Donation will be made to a central pool.
6)	Donations must be voluntary; recipients are not permitted to solicit coworkers for PTO donations.
7)	Donations, once made, may not be rescinded.
8)	Employees who donate PTO will not realize any income in connection with the donation, nor may the donated time be considered a “charitable gift” for income tax purposes. The donated PTO will not be considered as time paid for the donating employee. Donated leave is treated as wage income that is taxed when the recipient receives the payment, and will be paid at the recipient’s regular rate of pay.
9)	An employee who is paid from a sponsored research project (grant or contract) is ineligible to donate PTO, but is eligible to receive donated PTO as described below.
10)	Individuals who satisfy the following criteria may apply to receive donated PTO:
a)	The recipient must have a regular appointment that is eligible to accrue PTO.
b)	The recipient must have exhausted all paid leave time, including PTO and Extended Sick, before applying to receive donated PTO.
c)	The recipient must demonstrate that:
184
i.	the employee or his/her immediate family member is experiencing a serious medical hardship or catastrophic illness or injury (e.g., cancer, major surgery, serious accident, heart attack, stroke) or
ii.	the employee is experiencing a serious and significant crisis that requires immediate attention and absence from work (e.g. house fire, executor responsibilities out of state).
d)	Donated PTO may not be used to supplement disability pay or workers’ compensation payments.
e)	Donated PTO may not be used to exceed the recipient’s normally scheduled work hours per pay period.
f)	Requests to receive donated PTO made by individuals in the disciplinary process for attendance-related concerns will be considered on an exception basis only.
g)	An employee will not accrue PTO will receiving donated PTO.
11)	Decisions regarding receipt of donated PTO will be made by the PTO
Donation Committee. The PTO Donation Committee will be comprised of three members: a representative of UMHS HR, a representative appointed by Nursing Services, and a representative appointed by UMPNC. The PTO Donation Committee will review requests to receive donated PTO and requests to donate PTO for compliance with the above requirements. If the available pool of donated PTO hours is less than the number requested by one or more employees eligible to receive donated PTO, the PTO Donation Committee will allocate available donated hours consistent with the criteria above. Decisions regarding the allocation of donated PTO are not subject to the Dispute Process or Arbitration Process.
12)	A donor may express a preference for an individual to whom he or she wishes to donate, but decisions on allocation of donated PTO will be made by the PTO Donation Committee.
13)	A recipient may receive up to four (4) weeks of donated PTO (up to 160 hours, prorated based on FTE) hours of donated PTO in a twelvemonth period.
14)	The PTO donation program will be reviewed after a one year period to assess the effectiveness of the program, necessary changes to the program, etc.

HEALTH CARE COSTS - JOINT RESOLUTION
732.	The health and well being of people who work at the University of Michigan is essential to the fulfillment of the obligations of the University and the Association. Our joint efforts in this regard have been undertaken in our collective bargaining agreements over several years. Obtaining affordable quality health care has been increasingly difficult for the parties. We recognize that the issue stems from a heath care delivery and financing structure comprised of forces and interests external to our collective bargaining relationship. It is our mutual intent to influence those forces and interests through power of our combined efforts so as to ease or eliminate the pressure the structure creates for us in collective bargaining.
733.	The University and the Association each have capacities useful to the production of change in the structure. Academic and political expertise, organizational outreach, governmental and community relations are among the elements that the parties have to mount an initiative for change. We begin here with a commitment to discover and exploit opportunities where the parties can jointly engage in this work.
734.	Coordination of our efforts will be undertaken by individuals mutually acceptable to both parties. It is understood that these representatives in labor and management, reporting to a joint meeting of the University and the Association, may periodically be requested to provide consultation. Included in their role may be introductions for the purpose of obtaining access to those organizational components that would assist in the development of our common objectives. This is to share our capacities to influence those sectors of health care delivery, business, industry and government, which effect the environment where employees must meet their health care needs.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING NURSE PRACTITIONERS
745.	The University and the Association agree to the following:
Salary Setting
Each Nurse Practitioner will be assigned to one of three tiers upon hire. The tier designation is determined by the work, the complexity of the assessment and management required by the patient population, the stability of those patients and the level of technical skills that must be employed. Salary range will be adjusted each year to reflect any institutional increase provided for Advanced Practice Professionals. An annual labor market analysis will take place and will be jointly reviewed.
Tier #1	Tier #2	Tier #3
Outpatient, primary care, psych/counseling, H & Ps and management of common problems, including management of patients with chronic conditions through the medical home.	Inpatient, sub-acute care and/or outpatient management of complex problems of relatively stable patients and/or using technical interventions	Predominately critical care of patients with requirements of continuous monitoring and interventions, unstable patients and highly technical interventions. Special labor market differentials/incentives as applicable
Placement on the appropriate salary scale will be determined by:
1.	Tiers
Tier #1 = $67,250-$87,420-$107,590 (Minimum starting salary = $67,912)
Tier #2 = $73,970-$96,160-$118,350 (Minimum starting salary = $77,744)
Tier #3 = $81,370-$105,780-$130,190 (Minimum starting salary = $89,302)

Related non-RN Clinical Experience, or additional RN Experience in excess of 7 years (effective February 1, 2010) = 0.50 per year, 5 year maximum.
Total possible points for Non-NP RN Experience, related non-RN Clinical Experience and additional RN Experience remains 7.75 points.
Note: This reflects salary ranges at time of ratification (Nov. 6, 2011). Access successive salary ranges online at JIT website.

NPs hired without experience may be eligible for merit increase as appropriate.
Neonatal Nurse Practitioners________________________________________________________
An employee in the Neonatal Nurse Practitioner role who participates in air and ground patient transports will be eligible for a quarterly bonus of $1000. Bonuses shall be prorated for part-time employees. The quarterly bonus periods shall begin on January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1, as the case may be. Eligibility for a bonus payment shall be forfeited if a full-time employee is absent for any reason, except for scheduled Paid Time Off or holiday time off, in excess of one hundred twenty (120) hours in a given quarter. Part-time employees shall have absences prorated when making this calculation.
Salary Progression
Once placed at the appropriate base salary upon hire, an individual’s salary progression will occur annually, based on an annual performance review, with merit increases awarded at the discretion of the University, and consistent with the department’s salary program and/or labor market adjustments.
191
In no way, does this agreement limit the NPs from qualifying for and receiving individual or group bonus, lump sums and other salary increases. Specifically designated group incentives or bonuses provided to Advanced Practice Professional will be inclusive to the NPs within the same designated group.
Yearly following the implementation of the annual salary program, the Association, Nursing Administration and HR will jointly review the distribution of salary increases to NPs to identify any salary increase of less than the designated annual merit program and review the rationale which led to the decision. An NP receiving a salary increase of less than the designated annual merit program may employ the dispute resolution procedure.
In any year with a 0% salary program, each nurse practitioner will receive a 1.5% salary increase. In the event the salary program is given only as a lump sum payment, NP’s will receive a 1.5% increase to base salaries.
Additional Pay:
A.	Additional Hours
1)	Workload Review: NPs may be required to periodically work extra hours to meet the needs for patient care without compensation. NPs may request a workload review meeting with Nurse Manager/Clinical Director and Association Representative to review concerns of excessive workload or persistent additional hours related to patient care. The meeting will take place within seven (7) calendar days of request. Following a review of data, the Employee, Nurse Manager/Clinical Director, and Association Representative will review a number of possible actions, including but not limited to temporary modification of task expectations, obtaining additional personnel, resources and modification of work load.
The issue(s) presented and the outcomes of the meeting will be documented by the Nurse Manager/Clinical Director and provided to the Director of Nursing, Association Leadership and Human Resources within seven (7) calendar days of the meeting’s occurrence.
2)	Additional Compensation: If the excessive workload or persistent additional hours continue after a workload review meeting is held, additional compensation, if approved in advance by the Nurse Manager, Nursing Director and/or Department Administration, may be provided when additional effort is expected for an extended period of time. Reasons for additional compensation can include, but are not limited to:
a)	Staffing Shortage
b)	Work schedule does not permit flexibility
c)	Work cannot be delayed to a different time period or transferred to other staff.
Approval for additional compensation will not be unreasonably withheld.
B.	Additional Shifts:
192
NPs who work additional shifts of at least four hours that cannot be provided an equal amount of time off within three (3) months will be compensated for that time at their regular rate of pay. At the time that the work is occurring and with mutual agreement, the three (3) month time frame for providing equal time off may be extended to six (6) months.
On-Call:
$6.13 per hour for all Tiers.
Shift Differential:
$3.00 per hour for Evening and Night Shifts
Evening: Shift starting at or after noon but before 8:00 p.m.
Night: Shift starting at or after 8:00 p.m. but before 4:00 a.m.
Additionally, Departments may choose to individually fund additional pay to cover off-shifts and weekends.
Holiday:
A Nurse Practitioner working on a holiday who does not take an additional day off will receive pay at Straight time for all hours worked on the holiday in addition to their monthly pay.
Professional Development:
Each Nurse Practitioner will receive a minimum of $1500 per year prorated by appointment fraction for the purpose of professional development & continuing education (CE). The approval process related to the use of professional development funds will be determined by each unit/department. Other certifications, including but not limited to ATLS, PALS, NRP or ACLS, required by a section or department will be funded separately by each department and will not be included in the annual allocation of professional development funds for the individual nurse practitioner.
Use of professional development funds may include, but is not limited to: membership to professional organizations, funding for specialty certifications, books, online continuing education programs, and computer software designed to enhance professional growth and development.
Posting and Selection Process:
The University will post open positions in the following manner:
The position “Nurse Practitioner” will be posted in those instances in which the work involved is uniquely appropriate to be performed by a person who is qualified as a Nurse Practitioner.
A posting for an “Advanced Practice Professional” is one for which the body of work is reasonably undertaken by a Nurse Practitioner or another nonphysician professional credentialed to perform delegated medical functions
193
When the University posts a position for a non-physician professional credentialed to perform delegated medical functions, nurse practitioners may also be considered. Eligibility to apply will be indicated on the posting.
Postings for all such positions will clearly describe the required and desired qualifications that will be the selection criteria.
Hiring decisions will be made using most qualified selection criteria. If the Nurse Practitioner applicants are equally qualified, then the selection will be made on the basis of seniority, highest to lowest.
Other Provisions:
In areas in which NPs work and provide cross-coverage with other nonphysician professionals credentialed to perform delegated medical functions, scheduling of work and time off will be integrated to the extent feasible; if a Reduction-In-Force occurs, the order of reduction will begin with the staff member with the least University service (seniority), except that the University may retain employees, irrespective of service, who possess the necessary skills, knowledge, and abilities to perform the available work which are not possessed to the same degree by other employees in the same classification.
In the event an employee believes the placement on a tier and/or within a point range is not correct, the University of Michigan Health System Human Resources Department will review the matter, provided the request for review is made within the thirty (30) calendar day period following the date of execution of this Agreement.
We agree to conduct a payroll audit for Tier 1 Nurse Practitioners within 90 days of ratification (Nov. 6, 2011). The results will be jointly reviewed and pay adjusted within the point ranges of Tier 1. The review of the Tier 1 salaries will be based on initial points from 2008 implementation. Salaries will be adjusted based on numerical values within the point range. After the new salaries are established, the salary program and the market adjustments will be applied.
Unless otherwise provided by this MOU, all other terms and conditions of the existing agreement will apply.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING AMBULATORY CARE NURSE RESOURCE POOL
768.	This confirms the agreement reached between the University of Michigan, the University of Michigan Professional Nurse Council (UMPNC) and the Michigan Nurses Association (MNA) concerning the unit reconfiguration of the Ambulatory Care Central Staffing Resources (AC CSR). The AC CSR was reconfigured into multiple units, the Ambulatory Care Nursing Resource Pool (ACNRP) and a number of decentralized float areas. Those nurses in the decentralized float area(s) will have specialized skills to cover a few units and
199
are primarily used to cover the 70% guaranteed annual vacation time. The ACNRP will have general nursing skills, be oriented to multiple units, and used primarily to cover unanticipated absences.
769.	Nurses who accept positions in one of the decentralized float areas will be included with other nurses in their multi-clinic/unit “areas” for the purposes of Paid Time Off requests and Assigned Time Off. For the purpose of ReductionIn-Force, the ACNRP will be combined with the decentralized float areas to create one unit.
770.
Nurses in the ACNRP and decentralized float areas will be paid a quarterly bonus consistent with Para. 185A. Nurses who accept Dual Unit Positions will be paid the $8.00/hour float bonus if floating outside of their two assigned units. A dual unit position is one that requires the nurse to only float between two Units/Health Centers (see Para. 700). For all other purposes, the collective bargaining agreement will apply.

ADDENDUM A
PER DIEM NURSE GUIDELINES
The intent of the contract language related to scheduling of Per Diem nurses is to ensure that regular employees receive priority in scheduling. In addition, there is an interest in having Per Diem nurses share in working weekend shifts, off shifts and during holiday weeks on those units, which schedule on a 24-hour basis. The following guidelines apply to Per Diem nurses
1.	Each Per Diem employee working three or more shifts per scheduling period will be scheduled to work a minimum of two weekend shifts per scheduling period (8 hours = 1 shift). The contractual definition of a weekend applies for Per Diem employees.*
Per Diem nurses who preschedule two or fewer shifts per scheduling period do not have to meet the weekend requirements. They may add additional UNANTICIPATED SHIFTS ONLY.
2.	Each Per Diem nurse will be expected to work a portion of scheduled shifts on off shifts (recommended guide: 25%).
3.	Managers may establish additional guidelines based upon individual unit scheduling requirements. Therefore, it is recommended that managers and per diem nurses meet to discuss specific unit expectations.
4.	Each Per Diem nurse will be scheduled to work the number of shifts during holiday weeks that reflects his/her normal scheduling pattern. Per Diem nurses should be scheduled to work shifts during three out of the six holiday weeks and one of these weeks should be Christmas or New Year's week. (A week is defined as Sunday through Saturday during which the holiday falls).
Per Diem nurses are to be scheduled after all regular staff are scheduled per contract language.
*Guidelines apply to all Per Diem nurses regardless of hire date.

PTO GUIDELINES AND DEFINITIONS
PTO Guidelines were created to support the professional and responsible behavior related to the use of paid time off.
It is the intent of the PTO Guidelines, as well as the contract scheduling language, to provide sufficient access to prescheduled time off so that only the exceptional request would occur after the schedule is posted.
1.	Due to the inability to obtain coverage and the employee is not able to work, it is assumed that the decision not to work is due to emergent or unexpected circumstances other than those, which would normally be pre-scheduled. Employees should request scheduled PTO time as far in advance as possible. The use of unscheduled time creates a negative impact on patient care and upon the work schedules and subsequent job satisfaction of your colleagues.
Scheduled PTO:
•	Annual PTO Requests
•	In seniority order for remaining blocks of time that are available following the request period on the unit208 *.
•	Schedule request time during schedule development
•	Requests for access to incremental PTO after schedule development.
Unscheduled PTO:
Employee needs that arise after the schedule is posted, for which the employee does not obtain their own coverage.
2.	No justification for the use of PTO will be required with the following exceptions:
•	If PTO is used in conjunction with a holiday, see Paragraphs 352 & 358.
•	If unscheduled PTO is taken contiguous to a scheduled PTO request
(prior either to or immediately following the time off), the nurse manager may require an explanation of the absence and verification of the reason, as appropriate.
•	If PTO is used for health care appointment, the supervisor may request documentation of the appointment to include the date and time and identification of the facility209. (Disclosure of reason for absenteeism is required for accessing short-term disability (STD) and bridge bank reimbursement.
208
209
See Paragraph 333O
see Paragraphs 333T & 333U
202
3.	These guidelines are intended to promote personal and professional responsibility.
•	Employees should disclose length of time needed for PTO.
•	This will include unscheduled and scheduled time.
•	Disclosure of reason is required for accessing short-term disability (STD) or bridge bank reimbursement.
•	Maintain awareness/self-monitoring of PTO balance.
•	Consider requests in the context of what is happening on the unit.
•	Respect individual and peer needs for time off.
4.	Process to fill requests that occur after the schedule is posted but at least 24 hours in advance:
•	Submit CSR/ACNRP requests.
•	Seek volunteers for over appointment hours.
•	Seek Per Diem availability.
•	Review standing overtime requests, if applicable.
•	Seek volunteers for overtime.
5.	Staff are encouraged to assist with staffing needs related to PTO requests by volunteering to work over appointment hours, volunteering to float and seeking other options for coverage per unit guidelines.
6.	Insufficient PTO accrual for prescheduled vacation
•	If PTO accrual is completely depleted prescheduled vacation will be cancelled and the time may be offered to other staff.
•	If PTO accrual is partially depleted and is insufficient for the PTO scheduled, the manager will ask the employee which days he/she chooses to use and the remainder may be offered to other staff.
•	If the employee’s PTO is either partially or completely depleted due to
assigned (mandatory) time off or work related illness or injury, within the past year, it will be the employee’s discretion whether to take the previously scheduled vacation with no pay or to cancel it. (The year is the period from May 1 to April 30)
PROBLEM-SOLVING MEETINGS
7.	Problem solving meetings are intended to promote a thorough understanding of life situations, which may contribute to the excessive use of unscheduled PTO. The employee’s past history related to the use of PTO should be taken into account. A sudden change in PTO usage may indicate a need for special consideration for time off. An atypical life event may be experienced which could lead to a moderately lengthy and inconsistent usage of PTO. The intent is to work with the employee and to facilitate successful progress through the event. The problem-solving meeting is intended to be one method to identify these issues and to provide assistance as appropriate. The problem-solving meeting can also be utilized to promote
203
a thorough understanding of the issues and professional use of PTO.
NOTE: Every effort will be made to have an Association representative available for a problem-solving meeting within one week of a request.
8.	Unscheduled requests of less than 24 hours notice for partial shifts longer than one (1) hour create an additional burden on remaining staff if coverage is not found. Therefore,
•	Units will receive periodic reports on the workload and operational consequences of partial shift absence.
•	Employees are expected to identify their needs for partial shift absences as early as possible and to be active in assisting with obtaining coverage.
•	Employees are expected to notify the manager or designee of the length of the expected absence whenever possible.
•	Employees anticipating a need for late arrival or early departure from a scheduled shift can make alternate coverage arrangements utilizing language from Paragraph 147 ( In no case shall an employee delivering direct patient care be permitted to return to work following an overtime shift with less than seven (7) hours off between shifts except as noted in Paragraph 175D. (See Article 13, Staffing and Scheduling). When such arrangements are made, it is assumed that both employees have agreed to waive the overtime relative to Paragraph 147.
•	Employees who need a partial shift absence for health care appointments must comply with the process outlined in Paragraph 333T;
•	When there is a concern about an employee’s frequency or regularity of
partial shift absences greater than one (1) hour, a problem solving meeting may be convened with the UMPNC, the manager and the employee to review and problem solve as needed. (see #8 above)
9.	The use of unscheduled time creates a negative impact on patient care and upon the work schedules and subsequent job satisfaction of your colleagues. Therefore:
•	Unit data related to the scheduled and unscheduled percentage by period will be provided on a periodic basis.
•	Staff is reminded that it is the intent of the process for scheduled time off that only the exceptional PTO request would occur after the unit schedule is posted.
•	Employees are encouraged to utilize work life/home life resources available through the Employee Assistance Program, support groups, etc.
10.	When there is a concern about an employee’s frequency or regularity of unscheduled PTO, a problem-solving meeting may be convened with UMPNC, the manager and the employee to review and problem solve as needed. The intent of the meeting is to
204
• provide a mutual understanding of the need for unscheduled time off and to develop a plan to minimize its use. (see #8 above)
11.	It is a measure of professional accountability that employees identify time off requirements in advance as much as is possible through the use of the Paid Time Off/holiday request period and the monthly schedule request period. These processes are in place to provide a fair and equitable system for time off while maintaining adequate staffing for quality patient care. The continuous use of unscheduled time off reflects a lack of preplanning and may be interpreted as disregard for professional and personal accountability. Therefore:
•	Requests for additional time off following the posting of the unit schedule should be reserved for those events about which the employee was not aware during the usual request period.
•	The use of unscheduled PTO should be reserved for those times when the employee is unable to come to work due to urgent or emergent personal circumstances and is not to be used for vacation or leisure-type activities for the enjoyment of the employee.
•	Employees are encouraged to come forward to the manager if the need for unscheduled PTO can be predicted in the current or in a future schedule which may prevent the need for a problem solving meeting if a mutually agreed upon attendance plan is created and followed.
•	When there is a concern about an employee’s frequency or regularity of the use of unscheduled time off, a problem-solving meeting may be convened with UMPNC, the manager and the employee for the purpose of clarification of the employee’s actions and to develop a plan for advanced scheduling of time off. (see #8 above)
12.	At times, anecdotal comments are received from staff members about the absenteeism of their colleagues. While the monitoring and improvement of performance is the responsibility of the manager and the individual employee, constructive feedback is also part of our professional responsibility to our colleagues. Therefore:
•	As a courtesy, staff members are encouraged to approach their peers
about absenteeism prior to reporting this to the manager when possible.
•	Nursing staff are ordinarily encouraged to share constructive feedback
about the impact of certain behaviors as it relates to patient care and to the general work life of the unit. Such feedback is critical for clinical performance and interpersonal relationships, which are impacted by absenteeism.
•	Nursing staff are encouraged to utilize available resources to assist in
this regard.
13.	In support of the PTO process, the following is pertinent:
•	Management will continue to provide staff with information monthly about PTO accruals.
205
•	Core information will be identified to be on all annual PTO request
forms to assure agreement between staff and manager related to the amount of PTO time made available, amount requested, amount scheduled and amount denied; it will be signed by both parties.
•	Seniority governs the resolution of competing requests.
206
INCREMENTAL PTO
An employee may access incremental PTO provided the employee has enough PTO to cover the time and complies with the following steps:
Scheduled Absence
Onestaff code o
Unscheduled Absence
Onestaff code w
An employee who needs additional time off of at least two (2) hours is responsible for obtaining a commitment from another employee in writing.
Employee needs that arise with less than 24 hours notice, for which the employee does not obtain their own coverage.
At least 24 hours in advance of the needed time off, the employee will provide the manager notice of the need for time off and the written commitment from the other employee.
The employee coverage may be any of the following:
•	An even trade with another employee
•	CSR/ACNRP regular or temporary staff
•	Over appointment
•	Per Diem staff
•	Overtime
The unit process to fill requests that occur after schedule request time less than 24 hours:
•	Submit CSR/ACNRP requests
•	Seek volunteers for overappointment
hours
•	Seek Per Diem availability
•	Review standing overtime requests, if
applicable
•	Seek volunteers for overtime hours
•	Mandate if necessary
Hours committed through this process DO NOT:
•	Count toward the unit overtime trigger
•	Count toward the individual overtime limit
•	Count toward the temporary hour limit
•	Count toward the annual PTO allocation process
Hours committed through this process DO:
•	Count toward the unit overtime trigger
•	Count toward the individual overtime limit
•	Count toward the temporary hour limit
The coverage may be changed or cancelled at the discretion of the manager. On-call may be cancelled within 24 hours without penalty.
*Employees may use this process to extend a vacation by no more than two days, provided the employee who is covering the time is not working overtime. Employees may not use this vacation extension during a holiday week.
Overtime may be prescheduled and seniority will not be a barrier to this process.
207
PTO ACCRUAL PROCESSS
After completion of 5 years of service, a full-time employee receives 19.33 hrs. per month.
(part-time employees receive a proportionate amount of the 19.33 hrs.)
After completion of 5 years of service, a full-time employee receives 23.33 hrs. per month.
(part-time employees receive a proportionate amount of the 23.33 hrs.)
After completion of 10 years of service, a full-time employee receives 23.33 hrs. per month.
(part-time employees receive a
proportionate amount of the 23.33 hrs.)
i	___________________
Ways to gain Additional PTO after Orientation
Holiday Incentives
•	Preschedule & work full apt. fraction with holiday off
•	Preschedule & work hours above their apt. fraction with holiday off
•	During the schedule development, an employee who was scheduled to work, volunteers or is assigned to take an additional holiday off, and is scheduled to work their full apt. fraction.
Weekends
Employees with a 36 hour weekly apt. fraction, working 12 hour shifts, where two (2) of these shifts occur on the weekend, will accrue Paid Time Off hours equivalent to a full-time (40 hour) appointment for each quarter worked in this manner.
Volunteer OA
A part-time employee may volunteer to work a minimum of four (4) hours per week over appointment for a designated period of time to provide coverage for an extended absence related to extended sick time or FMLA. The employee will receive incremental PTO for the over appointment hours worked.
Accrual Adjustment for Part-time employees
If a part-time employee has worked an average of at least four (4) non-overtime hours per week in excess of their appointment hours for eight (8) consecutive weeks or more, the University will modify the employee’s PTO accrual retroactively to the beginning of the period.
208
ADDENDUM C
DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION GUIDELINES
1.	Access to accommodated work must be preceded by timely, sufficient medical documentation provided by the employee.
2.	An employee with a medical restriction will be accommodated on the home unit if there is work that meets the restrictions as outlined in the medical documentation.
3.	Placement on another unit for a time-limited restriction will be coordinated by the director and manager of the home unit in collaboration with CSR/ACNRP.
4.	If appropriate accommodated work is not available, the employee may not work and will be placed on the appropriate status (i.e., PTO, EST, and LOA).
5.	Work Connections will become involved in the assessment and interpretation of medical documentation as well as the coordination of work-site evaluation, employee assessment and appropriate matching of restrictions to job functions as follows:
a)	Employee with a work-related injury or illness at the time of the initial injury or illness;
b)	Employee who self-refers at any time;
c)	Employee requesting accommodated work for a long-term restriction;
d)	Employee requesting return to work from Long-Term Disability (LTD) status;

g)	Employee who requests an extension of extended sick time, or an extension of a medical leave of absence;
h)	Employee whose initial request for extended sick time or leave of
absence is not accompanied by sufficient medical documentation, or is deemed excessive by the manager;
i)	Employee who desires to pursue accommodated work opportunities at the time the initial request for extended sick time or leave of absence is presented. In this regard, the manager may initiate a discussion about accommodated work with the employee at this time, however if the employee does not agree, the issue will not be pursued during the initial absence, assuming approval of the absence by the manager.
j)	Nursing Administration, UMPNC leadership, Human Resources will work together with Work Connections to facilitate timely, appropriate placement of employees who require work accommodations as outlined in the attached flowchart.
209
k)	Placement of the addicted and/or impaired employee will be considered as a part of the disability accommodation guidelines as defined by the ADA.
Definitions:
A time-limited restriction is a temporary inability to perform the full range of duties due to a medically documented condition, which is expected to change or improve such that the employee may return to his/her usual duties within six months (or nine months for pregnancy, excluding childcare leave of absence).
A long-term restriction is an inability to perform the full range of duties due to a medically documented condition, which is not expected to change or improve within six months (or nine months for pregnancy, excluding childcare leave of absence).
An accommodation is the use of adaptive devices or aids, or the reorganization of duties or environment such that an employee with restrictions can perform the essential functions of a position.
A special schedule is a schedule designed to meet an employee's medically documented work restriction related to shift length, number of sequential workdays, number of hours in a week, time of day, or shift rotation, which is substantially different from the usual schedules of a unit employee with the same classification and seniority who does not have a work restriction.

217
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 1: RECOGNITION AND DEFINITIONS
9/10. We agree to educate managers regarding the use of temporary and Per Diem staff:
a)	Relief for regular employee scheduled PTO
b)	Not as an allowance for paid time off.
c)	Not built into 40 hour/week schedules unless filling in for leaves of absence, extended sick, unfilled posted positions (Reference Overtime System, Article 15).
d)	Limited in duration.
9A. Each unit will have the ability to utilize Per Diem employees. Units with CSR/ACNRP coverage will be defined as described in paragraph 14. Units/areas without CSR/ACNRP coverage may develop Per Diem coverage areas based on but not limited to similar skill requirements, level of care, specialty and/or patient population across established areas and units as deemed necessary.
10. The parties will evaluate the definition of a temporary employee as defined in Paragraph 10 to bring the definition into harmony with the system as outlined in Article 20, Variable Activity, Paragraph 185.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 3: PROFESSIONAL NURSING
20A. The American Nurses Association (ANA) position statement on the use of unlicensed assistive personnel will be accessible to employees on the units and included in central orientation. The delegation competencies will be mutually reviewed and then the gaps will be identified and addressed.
22.	The American Nurses Association (ANA) and the Michigan Nurses
Association (MNA) delegation guidelines will be adopted.
25. No individual or identifiable performance data will by shared with unit or clinic staff. Aggregate data will be used for problem solving and process improvement whenever it is appropriate and/or possible. Periodic updates will be provided to JIT for initiatives that affect nursing practice and/or workload.
Employee satisfaction data will be shared within ten days of receipt by the nurse manager and discussed with employees within 45 days. Purpose for such meetings will be to positively impact a unit’s culture. Action plans with concrete timelines and thresholds for improvement will be forwarded to the appropriate Director of Nursing, Recruitment & Retention, and the Association. Either party may subsequently call for a meeting to evaluate effectiveness of such plans.
218
28A. Advance Practice Nurses (APN) will be evaluated by another APN whenever possible. In addition, APN's will be evaluated using tools designed specifically for the applicable APN role. If a tool is not currently available, the APN's will be involved in the development of an evaluation tool for their roles.
28D. An employee signature on a performance evaluation does not confirm agreement with the evaluation.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 9: ASSOCIATION ORIENTATION
70. We agree that transfers into the Bargaining Unit will be scheduled for Association orientation. We will work with Educational Services for Nursing to schedule time and site, and with managers to schedule the employee so that overtime will not be incurred.
We agree that Association orientation is paid time for the orientees and that the Chair or Designee will try to conduct orientation on non-paid time. If that is not feasible, the University will try to provide thirty (30) minutes of paid release time. We also agree that the University will not attend the portion of orientation related to membership or dues.
.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 13: STAFFING AND SCHEDULING
Article 13: This article, with the exception of paragraph 88 and 88A, does not apply to APRN’s.
88. The staffing factor will be adjusted to be consistent with units' activities in the areas of road trips, transfers, admissions, discharges and variations in patient acuity.
Student nurses will not count in core staffing or be used as substitutes for assistive personnel.
Adequate resources will be provided to meet workload, including allowances for expected time off.
Develop support for managers to plan when and how much time off can be tolerated and maintained.
Any patient classification system used by the University is not the sole criteria for determining adequate staffing.
A quarterly review by JIT will occur concerning budgeted versus actual occupancy, variance and HPPD data.
90.	Coordination of schedules and resolution of any other professional or contractual concerns related to regular employees working split appointments
219
on different units will be addressed through collaboration among the employee and the unit managers
90A. Positions, which include assignment to every weekend, may be posted.
91.	The definition of a weekend for Per Diem employees will match the contractual definition of a weekend. Any Per Diem will be required to work some weekends and off shifts, and shifts during holiday weeks. The workload review committee will review equitability210.
Schedule requests for unit employees will be honored first and then Per Diem staff will be scheduled.
93.	"Emergency" means:
a)	There are no other options available to remedy the situation
b)	The unit is unable to function, and changing the schedule is of the highest degree necessary to ensure the unit's ability to function
c)	Budgetary considerations do not constitute an emergency
99.	"Not normally" means unusual, rare occurrence.
100.	We agree that an employee who transfers or is hired into a position, which is posted to include every weekend, will have priority for weekend work over an employee who requests additional weekends. However, an individual employee who requests to work additional weekend shifts cannot be denied those shifts as long as there is any other employee on the unit who wants additional weekends off provided the staff remaining have the ability to do the work. The intent is to increase weekends off for those employees who desire that schedule by allowing other employees to work additional weekend shifts by request.
We agree that the eight (8) weekend shifts shall be counted consecutively.
"Equitably as practicable" refers to employees available to have an extra weekend off. We agree there are implications related to scheduled time off: Staff will not be required to take accrued PTO in order to maintain equitability; staff on scheduled paid time off need to be taken into account.
100B. Weekend shifts worked as a result of a holiday, which falls on the weekend will count toward the weekend premium (see Paragraph 100.3).
Weekend shifts that are assigned off due to a holiday, which falls on the weekend, will count toward the weekend bonus.
210 See Addendum A: Per Diem Guidelines
220
124. Forty percent (40%) is a minimum, not a maximum. The intent is to attract employees to straight off shifts by use of the bonus in order to increase the number of straight day shifts.
The six (6) month waiting period for shift preference does not apply to employees who transfer as a result of reduction-in-force.
131.	The six (6) month waiting period for shift preference does not apply to employees who transfer as a result of reduction-in-force.
131A. "Able to do the work" in Step 2 means:
a)	not already working that shift
b)	the affected shift will have an acceptable mix of staff, e.g., not all new
graduates.
If option d) in Step 2 were used, this would not be considered a violation of Paragraph 92 of the Agreement.
132A. Opportunities for additional non-direct patient care time above that normally budgeted will be equitably distributed among employees working on well-defined non-direct patient care activities.

INTENT NOTE ARTICLE 15: OVERTIME
Article 15:	This section does not apply to APRN’s. See related MOU’s.
147. The requirement for seven (7) hours between the end of one shift and the beginning of the next shift does not preclude the employee working pursuant to call from reporting to their next scheduled shift211.
14	8.1 Employees fulfilling work obligations in lieu of lunch shall be paid overtime accordingly.
157.	A temporary or Per Diem employee may replace a regular employee who is working overtime/over appointment hours with the exception of prescheduled over appointment hours.
158.	Guidelines for Recording Systems for applicable areas related to Overtime,
Assigned Time Off, On-Call and Float:
•	Eligible overtime and over appointment will be recorded for purposes of determining payment of premiums, hours accrued toward limit, assigning overtime and release when overtime is no longer needed.
•	Overtime will be recorded in a log(s) comprised of two components: equity and scheduling
•	Hours accrued toward an individual limit will be recorded in an equity log. Hours accumulated in excess of the defined limit (hours that qualify for the over-limit premium) will not be recorded in the equity log.
•	Eligible overtime/over appointment hours worked and all other hours qualifying for the over-limit premium will be recorded in the schedule period Log.
•	Credit for eligible float occurrences will be recorded on the equity log or the assigned time off log, at the employee's direction as the date of last occurrence.
•	Details regarding the format, definition of occurrence, method for "zeroing" the logs, etc., will be determined by each unit's Workload Review Committee.
163. The University agrees to provide each Workload Review Committee and the Association with a report every four (4) weeks including, but not limited to, all hours worked by employees on the unit, all hours worked by temporary or Per Diem staff, all overtime hours, all mandatory overtime hours, all over appointment hours, all mandatory over appointment hours, all unanticipated over appointment hours, and calculations of the review triggers described in Paragraph 163A. The calculation of overtime and over appointment hours in the Outpatient and Health Center areas will be done on individual clinic/area basis.
211 See paragraph 175D
222
163A. Non-productive Level D and E and RSAM time will not be included in the overtime trigger formula. If a unit has not submitted overtime data by the time the trigger meeting is held, the information will be provided to the association within one (1) week of the date of the meeting.
163A2.The Association Chairperson will meet with the Director of Patient Care Services for the Ambulatory Care Clinics to review this trigger on a regular basis.
163A3. Overtime and over appointment hours worked as noted below will not count toward a unit’s overtime trigger:
1)	For units without holiday obligation, hours that occur as a result of paid, unworked holiday time;
2)	Hours worked as a result of an employee request for time off related to
incremental PTO access language212.
3)	Hours worked as a result of coverage for an employee on short-term disability or a FMLA related absence for which the $8.00/hour premium is paid213;
4)	Prescheduled over appointment hours, including over appointment hours during a holiday week214.
When a unit is holding a position for an employee who is on short-term disability/FMLA, those hours, which are covered by supplemental staff, Per Diem and CSR/ACNRP temporary staff, will be included in the calculation of total productive hours.
163B. UNIT CATEGORIES
24/7 Units
For purposes of the overtime system, 24/7 units are those areas where patient care is provided twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week. Included with the 24/7 units are the 8A and 5C infusion areas, Vascular Access Services and CSR employees assigned to 24/7 clusters.
Women's Hospital Birthing Center, Emergency Department, ECMO
Due to the on-call requirements related to unscheduled patient care, the Emergency Department, Women's Hospital Birthing Center and ECMO have a separate overtime system. In addition, these areas are considered unscheduled patient care areas for the purpose of Article 17, On-Call Systems and Pay only.
Procedure Areas (Unscheduled Patient Care Areas)
For the application of the overtime system, procedure areas are usually described as follows:
1)	Patient care is not scheduled on a twenty-four hour/seven day basis;
2)	On-call is required to manage unscheduled patient care;
212 see Paragraph 333P.1
213 see Paragraph 185P
214 Including holiday weeks; see Paragraph 355
223
3)	Patient care is related primarily to specific procedures and/or treatment. Based upon these criteria, procedure areas include, but are not limited to: Operating Rooms, Post Anesthesia Care/Recovery Areas, Medical Procedures Unit, Acute and Chronic Hemodialysis, Livonia Surgery Center Operating Rooms, Photopheresis, Cancer Center Infusion Areas, Cancer Center Procedure Areas B1 and B2, Radiology, Cardiac Cath Lab, EP Lab and Transfusion Apheresis Services.
For purposes of the overtime system, hire rates for external candidates, and the Ambulatory Care Collaborative Practice Model, Ambulatory Care Clinics are usually described as follows:
1)	Care is provided primarily to outpatients;
2)	Patient care is not provided twenty-four hours/seven days;
3)	The unit is where physicians hold office hours for the purpose of seeing outpatients;
Based upon these criteria Ambulatory Care Clinics include, but are not limited to:
Taubman Center clinics, Comprehensive Cancer Center clinics, Pediatric Surgery and Pediatric Cardiology clinics, Pain Clinic, Occupational Health Service, University Health Service, MOHS Clinic, Cancer Answer Line, Radiation Oncology, and on-site and off-site health centers and clinics."
Home-Med and Practice Management Services are included with the Ambulatory Care Clinics for purposes of the overtime system only.
163C. Through joint agreement, an individual unit or units may be designated for a specific time period during which the hours worked would be eligible for a premium above the applicable overtime and trigger bonus. The specific detail about the premium and the timeframe will be announced each time a joint decision is made.
163E-6. This section only referred to those areas in Para 170D (Short Term Systems on 24/7 Units). It should also include those in the WBC, ECMO and ED units. In that, the hours of on-call count toward the individual limit (excluding the ED’s explicit use of 4 hours on-call in a 4-week period: Para 163D-3). Only the hours worked pursuant to on-call apply toward eligibility for the OT incentives.(Mutual Agreement on Jan. 29, 2010)
163K. Alternate schedule changes within the pay period or workweek may be made with manager approval. Weekly/bi-weekly timesheets must accurately reflect the hours worked.

ARTICLE 15-a: ASSIGNED TIME OFF
164C. An employee who is assigned off will not be required to be on call or return to work during that employee’s shift.
164D. "Endeavor to" means:
a)	Needs of the unit which address issues related to clinical competence and ability to do the work. This may require flexibility of both the manager/employer and the employee.

ARTICLE 16:	Shift Premium
Article 16: This article does not apply to APRN’s.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 17:	ON-CALL SYSTEMS AND PAY
Article 17:	This article does not apply to APRN’s.
170A. Due to the requirement for on-call systems, the procedure areas as identified in Intent Note 163B, plus the Emergency Department, ECMO and Women's Hospital Birthing Center are considered unscheduled patient care areas for purposes of Article 17, On-Call Systems and Pay215.
171.	The parties agree that on-call pay is received even though the on-call period is contiguous with the employee's regular shift.
171D. In reference to “on-call systems in place”, it was to be directed at all OR/PACU’s and procedure areas as well as the Women’s Birth Center (WBC), ECMO and the Emergency Department (ED). (Mutual Agreement on Jan. 29, 2010)
172.	The first "practicable" means:
a)	The ability to do the work and clinical needs of the unit; or,
b)	In large units or units where employees are having difficulty scheduling themselves, it is more practicable to have the manager assign equitably and allow employees to make switches later.
The second "practicable" means:
a)	Refers to the proration causing scheduling "nightmares", where it would disadvantage full or part time employees. We agree we need objective
215 See Intent Note 163B Unit Categories
226
criteria to assess this; or,
b)	Refers to the ability to do the work and to the clinical needs of the unit and is not related to budget.
175A. Scheduled on-call on 24/7 units may be cancelled with less than twenty-four (24) hours notice at the employee's request and with the manager's approval.
175B. We agree that employees will not normally be required to work beyond the specified on-call time frame. We agree that this may occur in some situations in the unscheduled patient care areas, i.e., staying an extra one-half (1/2) hour to finish a case in the O.R. rather than calling in a new on-call team.
We agree the time should be short in duration.
We also agree that employees will not be required to work beyond the specified time frame simply to have them work the two (2) hours pay they will receive as a result of being called in.
175C.	It is agreed that areas with a high frequency call-back rate means that the
probability of working greater than twelve (12) hours on a regular basis is high.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 18:	CALL BACK PAY
Article 18: This article does not apply to APRN’s.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 20: VARIABLE ACTIVITY
Article 20: This article does not apply to APRN’s.
180A. CSR/ACNRP regular employees in need of placement will have priority over an inpatient employee seeking additional skills in the Ambulatory Care Clinics.
180C. In the Operating Rooms, cases occurring after hours (on-call) will be conducted in the location best suited to the patient's needs. This will not be considered a float occurrence.
In the operating rooms, float bonus, when applicable, will be paid through the conclusion of the case.
183. We agree that "not normally" refers to a response to a situation that is expected to last for a period of time and is anticipated. We also agree to continue to allow floating over the Christmas holiday for those units that wish to continue that practice.
We also agree that "not normally" refers to an isolated situation, which requires a response, is urgent and not ongoing, and is related to patient care.
227
We agree that a nurse who is floated will be given less complex or difficult patients unless she/he requests patients that are more complex.
We agree that in other than "not normally" situation, floating will be on a voluntary basis.
185.	The parties agree that the staffing system will be comprised of centralized and local resources and that an emphasis will be placed on providing work to regular employees to meet both anticipated and unanticipated needs. The parties will also explore the concept of establishing parameters for the release of a Central Staffing Resource (CSR) or ANRP employee from an assignment.
Changes in planned CSR/ANRP coverage will be reported to the unit charge nurse/lead nurse so that problem-solving may occur.
The University agrees that temporary or Per Diem employees should not be given work if a regular employee does not have work, as long as the regular employee is qualified to do the work.
Employees who are subject to a reduction-in-force and who have not been placed in a regular job opening will replace a temporary or Per Diem employee on a unit or may, at the University's option and at the employee's request, be temporarily placed as a regular employee through the Central Staffing Resource or ACNRP for ninety (90) days, effective the first day of work in CSR/ACNRP, unless there is joint agreement to extend the placement. In the absence of an extension, the employee may be offered a position for which he/she is qualified. Rejection of such an offer will be considered a voluntary termination.
In the event that a regular employee replaces a Per Diem or temporary employee who is filling a position for another regular employee on extended sick time or leave of absence where the position is being held, the employee subject to a reduction-in-force will only hold that position until the original regular employee returns to the position.
If the employee subject to a reduction-in- force has not been placed in a regular job opening when the employee returns from extended sick time or leave of absence, the University will place him/her in another position or the Central Staffing Resource or ACNRP as outlined above, if work is available.
We agree to educate managers regarding the use of temporary and Per Diem staff:
a)	Relief for regular employee vacation
b)	Not as an allowance for paid time off
c)	Not built into 40 hour/week schedules unless filling in for leaves of absence, extended sick, unfilled posted positions (Reference Overtime System, Article 15)
d)	Limited in duration
228
185C. A process to provide Central Staffing Resource coverage for those units with non-traditional and/or varying shift lengths will be developed.
185H-1. Commitment to the increased appointment and hours must be worked and are on-going. Weekend, off-shift, and holiday requirements must be met on the home unit before additional hours in CSR/ACNRP. A RIF status from the home unit eliminates the requirement of granting additional appointment and hours through the CSR and/or ACNRP. . Implementation affects and begins with the 2013 Health Care premium year.
185K. CSR and ACNRP regular float employees will have assignment priority over temporary or Per Diem employees in the Ambulatory Care Clinics provided that the regular employee has the skill level required for the assignment. An attempt will be made to identify those Ambulatory Care areas where a special skill is required. (It is understood that some CSR/ACNRP float employees will remain available for unanticipated fills).
185L. "Not normally" means when no other options are available, or where the employee worked previously.
185N. The option for a seasonal assignment is not intended to be a dual unit position and as such, classification is not determinative. It is the intent that the employee would have a designated home unit and that the secondary unit would pay for orientation.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 20-A: PER DIEM EMPLOYEE
185R.3 It is understood that there is no lapse in University employment between changes from Regular to Per Diem status and then Per Diem to Regular status. If there is a break in University employment at any time, the employee is then subject to Article 22: Reinstatement, Credit For Prior Service and Bridging Eligible Service and all its provisions.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 21: SENIORITY DEFINITIONS AND LOSS OF SENIORITY
187. We agree that “seniority” does not include temporary employment.
212.	We agree that time worked in the Per Diem status, even upon reinstatement, will not count toward credit for eligibility for retirement.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 25:	PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES
232.	Employees may provide input concerning a peer's knowledge and skill level.
The manager assumes sole responsibility for hiring, evaluation and promotion
229
and for the completion of written documentation associated with these activities.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 26:	REDUCTION OF THE WORKING FORCE & RECALL PROCEDURES
Article 26: Refer to NP MOU.
247.	We agree that "priority consideration" means consideration including an interview.
248.	"As soon as practicable" means as soon as possible once the information is available. The intent is to give enough time prior to the reduction-in-force to call a meeting to look at solutions/alternatives.
251. Employees on personal leave of absence, excluding medical, FMLA and military, whose positions are being held will be included for reduction-in-force in seniority order with other employees on that unit. Those returning from medical, FMLA and military will begin reduction-in-force process, if applicable, upon return.
253. "Priority consideration" means that an employee who has been subject to a reduction-in-force, who has the required qualifications, will be placed even if an external candidate is determined to be more qualified.
Clinical areas will be defined jointly and reviewed at the time of a reduction in force to confirm consistency with the agreed upon rationale.
The two-week period for placement is the two full posting periods following notification of reduction in force.
253A. Employees returning from a leave of absence will be placed in reduction-in-force status if there are insufficient open positions and/or no probationary employees. These employees will be placed in seniority order with those employees subject to a reduction-in-force.
When an employee returns from a leave of absence and there are employees who have been subject to a reduction-in-force, the employee will be placed within the contractual seven (7) day time frame before other employees provided there are sufficient available positions for all employees to be placed, and the other employees have a time frame to be placed which is longer than the time frame for the employee returning from a leave of absence.
In the event the employee subject to a reduction-in-force has less than seven (7) calendar days remaining in the notification period, he/she will be placed first.
258.	In regard to placement of employees who have been subject to a reduction-in-force in the CSR/ACNRP, we agree that:
230
a)	Placement is at the University's discretion and at the employee's option;
b)	The employee may not refuse an offer of a regular position and opt to go into the CSR/ACNRP;
c)	The intent is to place the employee in a regular position or training position; and,
d)	The employee retains recall rights consistent with those of a laid off employee216.
259.	An Association representative will participate in the initial notification meeting with the employee unless the timing is such that the representative cannot attend.
Whenever possible, formal notification of a reduction-in-force will be done as early in the employee's shift as possible. The employee will not normally be expected to work the remainder of the shift following notification, and will receive pay for the rest of the shift. Interviews for other job opportunities that are scheduled on work time will be paid, provided prior arrangements for release are made with the nurse manager.
When necessary to facilitate the interview process, interviews will be scheduled for the employee through the Employment Office.
260.	"Whenever practicable" refers to the number of employees reduced-in-force, the number of open positions, and the time frame for placement.
260A. We agree that if an employee is offered a position outside of the Bargaining Unit or in the CSR/ACNRP and turns the position down, the employee does not become a voluntary quit.
264. In the recall paragraphs, "same position" refers to the same unit and same classification from which the employee was removed. An employee may be offered recall to a position of more or less than the original appointment hours. However, the employee may decline a position of less than eighty percent (80%) of original appointment hours without losing recall rights.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 27: TRANSFERS: PROMOTIONS, DEMOTIONS, AND LATERALS Article 27: Refer to NP MOU.
269. We agree that in transfer/promotion, the Employment Office will not discuss discipline older than two (2) years with the hiring manager. If an employee is denied transfer/promotion due to the manager's reliance on discipline older than two (2) years, the request for transfer/promotion will be reevaluated without consideration given to the discipline.
216 Paragraph 264
231
275.	The orientation framework for a unit will be provided to the employee who is transferring, including but not limited to:
1)	Program structure and defined timeframe;
2)	Clinical competencies;
3)	Available resources;
4)	Feedback process including employee evaluation;
5)	Name and title of the designated resource person.
Orientation participants will be given the opportunity to formally evaluate the program.
275A. Provisional selection status is intended to provide an opportunity for the employee and the manager to explore the "fit" of the new position.
278.	It is agreed that positions posted for less than 20 hours will be considered to be combined on a case-by-case basis in conjunction with the position that the employee proposes as a match.
The postings will clearly state that the required qualifications must be met by the candidate in order to be interviewed and considered for the position.
Opportunities to allow employees to transfer to desirable areas with a split appointment will be supported whenever possible.
278A. "Selection criteria" are a set of standards used to evaluate and compare candidates for a position. Selection criteria recognize the quality and amount of education, experience, knowledge and skills as indicated by the required and desired qualifications of the posted position. They must be job-related, measurable and/or demonstrable, and related to the ability to perform the work successfully, and are applied to all candidates consistently.
282.	6.a Prior to the one (1) year period following the employee's promotion, transfer or date of hire, the current manager will determine whether or not the employee may be considered for transfer. If the current manager agrees to allow a transfer, the usual transfer language applies.
283.	Unit employees who are involved in interviewing candidates for posted positions will be educated about the interview process including the philosophy and principles of the applicable language of this Agreement concerning Transfer and Promotion, required and desired qualifications and substantial differences.
284.	Job preference will be given to UMPNC employees for Bargaining Unit positions for which they are qualified.
Evaluation of the desired qualifications may include input from references.
232
SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE DEFINITION:
In an effort to meet the mutual interests of staff and managers, the following principles related to transfer and promotion were jointly developed:
•	To professionally value each other and to be respectful to each other's skills'
•	To foster commitment to internal and more senior employees;
•	To be able to demonstrate the relevance of required and desired qualifications to the role.
If a less senior or external candidate possesses exceptional professional credentials, skills, knowledge or abilities, he/she may be selected over a more senior or internal candidate according to the following guidelines:
1)	The professional credentials, skills, knowledge or abilities are relevant to the role, identified prior to the posting and listed in priority order as desired qualifications.
2)	Assessment of the professional credentials, skills, knowledge or abilities
is accomplished objectively through a combination of the candidate interview, resume, references, educational records or other documentation;
3)	The professional credentials, skills, knowledge or abilities enhance the ability to do the work so that the candidate will be able to become expert and function independently within an abbreviated timeframe.
4)	Placement of the candidate who possesses the professional credentials, skills, knowledge or abilities will further institutional and unit goals including quality patient care, patient/family satisfaction, cost effectiveness, and will promote effective teamwork.
Professional credentials, skills, knowledge or abilities include, but are not limited to:
•	Relevant education including degree, certification or continuing education;
•	Experience, both theory and practice based, evaluated by considering the breadth and depth, how recent, relevance, and specialized skills or knowledge.
•	Professional qualities including progressive professional growth, demonstrated interpersonal skills, initiative, leadership, and work quality or performance.
It should be noted that there is a saturation point for experience; that is, a longer period of the same or similar experience in and of itself may not constitute a substantial difference. Similarly, short periods of the same experience may not indicate enough depth to be substantial.
286.	If the time frames for a dispute are not met, the dispute may be moved to the
next step, including mediation where appropriate.
233
288.	Employees who participate in a formal internship or retraining program will be evaluated at specific intervals and will be encouraged to identify any concerns within three weeks of the date of transfer so that a return to the prior unit may be facilitated as necessary. Responses to concerns raised later in the program will be discussed and decisions made based upon mutual agreement. Employees will be advised in advance of the required commitment and the circumstances under which they may withdraw from the program and return to the former unit or to another open position. (see paragraph 288)
If competent performance is not demonstrated within the agreed upon timeframe, either through a regular transfer or promotion or failure to complete an internship or retraining program, the employee may be placed in a vacancy, if any, where the employee has previously demonstrated competent performance prior to any other employee or applicant.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 28:	WORK REDESIGN Article 28: Refer to NP MOU related to paragraph 303.
297.	Money designated for training required for work redesign will be a part of work redesign plans.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 29:	PAID TIME OFF
Article 29: See NP MOU for Section E.
325. Upon implementation of PTO, the equivalent of eighty (80) hours of current sick time was moved into a one-time bridge bank to be used when the employee experienced continuous illness, which required movement to Extended Sick Time (EST). The remaining current sick time accrual hours were held either to replenish the bridge bank or to supplement the EST. The former sick accruals are not renewable.
Hours in the one-time bridge bank will not fluctuate either up or down with changes in appointment fraction, but will remain applicable to the employee's appointment fraction at the time the bank was established.
Efforts will be made to restore banks that have been changed.
A "sell back" will occur every December for payment the last payday in January.
Employees will be granted a minimum of seventy percent (70%) of their year's accrual rate, as scheduled time off.
234
328.	For employees working a split appointment between different classifications, PTO accrual will be prorated to each appointment fraction and classification and then added to determine the total monthly accrual.
333H. PTO requests from employees who are in split management/bargained-for positions will not be part of the unit PTO process.
333J. Seven consecutive days means any seven-day period and will not be limited to a Sunday through Saturday definition of a week.
333P.2 Examples of patterns of unscheduled absence may include, but are not limited to, calling in on the weekends; calling in on the last scheduled day before the holiday; calling in on the first scheduled day after the holiday; calling in when scheduled to rotate to the off shift; before or after scheduled PTO; and calling in on the same day off of the week.
The employee’s past history related to the use of PTO should be taken into account. A sudden change in PTO usage may indicate a need for special consideration for time off. An atypical life event may be experienced which could lead to a moderately lengthy and inconsistent usage of PTO. Our intent is to work with the employee and to facilitate successful progress through the event. The problem solving meeting is intended to be one method to identify these issues and to provide assistance as appropriate. The problem solving meeting can also be utilized to promote a thorough understanding of the issues and professional use of PTO.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 30: EXTENDED SICK TIME
336.	If the employee's two (2) year anniversary occurs at some time during the eighty (80) hours access period, then the employee is eligible for short-term disability. Employees hired in February 1996 or earlier, renew their STD in February 2008 and every 5 years after. Those employees hired after February 1996 are as stated in paragraph 336.
337.	Once an employee is eligible for access to his/her extended sick time income as provided in Paragraph 337, eligibility will continue for all other absences related to the same illness or injury.
339.	If an employee is temporarily placed in CSR/ACNRP, the employee will retain their former classification and the University will have met its return to work obligation.
We agree that periodic re-evaluation may be requested to extend the need for accommodation.
235
343A. The Association and the University will consider accommodating employees in such roles as Association representatives on committees, Professional Development Framework implementation and other similar work.
343B. The University agrees to identify retraining opportunities to facilitate and/or expand career options for employees with disabilities.
343C. Employees receiving long-term disability (LTD) who are given work trial placements through CSR/ACNRP will not be considered as holding a regular position.
343D. We agree that employees covered by this paragraph qualify as disabled under the Americans with Disabilities Act. (ADA)
The University agrees to identify retraining opportunities to facilitate and/or expand career options for employees with disabilities.

348.	Thanksgiving Day and the day after Thanksgiving will be requested and scheduled as one holiday.
349.	Holiday Substitution Language and Operational Information for 24/7 Units April 14, 2005Interpretations:
1)	The employee can only substitute holidays they are off. Since this was the employee’s off holiday, all attempts will be made to see that they are off the date to which they have moved the holiday.
2)	Holidays cannot be substituted into weeks there is a university-designated holiday.
3)	To substitute a holiday to another date, the employee must be working the week that the holiday would have fallen into and may actually be scheduled to work on the holiday itself. (Example: To substitute July 4 to another week, the employee will be scheduled to work the week of July 4. An employee on a leave may not substitute holidays to dates outside of the leave.)
4)	Holiday incentives only apply to the weeks of University designated holidays. (Paragraph 349)
5)	In order for substituted holidays to be granted on a seniority order basis and for priority scheduling consideration over granted vacations, holiday substitution requests will be made within the week following the posting of the unit’s tentative holiday schedule.
6)	Following this priority week, holiday substitution requests will be granted on a first come, first serve basis as the unit schedule can accommodate taking into consideration already granted holiday substitutions and vacations granted.
236
7)	Holiday substitution requests must be submitted in writing with the date of submission to the manager or supervisor.
8)	Holiday substitution requests will be honored in the same time block as vacations, May 1-April 30.Suggested calendar of events:
a)	January: Holiday request period
b)	February 1st: Tentative holiday schedule posted
c)	First week of February: Requests for holiday substitutions submitted for granting in seniority order
d)	February: PTO granting process proceeds
e)	Second week of February: Holiday substitution requests accepted and granted on a first come first serve basis.
351B. To meet unit needs, employees may be scheduled to work an extra shift during Thanksgiving week.
In the event that staffing needs require an employee to work a holiday that had previously been granted off, the manager will select the least senior employee who has not been granted a vacation over the holiday period in question.
352C. This does apply to employees who alternate the number of shifts each week (i.e., two shifts one week and three shifts the next week.)
354A. Units that are completely closed (no work/no call) on the “observed” holiday will pay the Holiday Premium as in Para 354A to those employees that work on the ‘actual’ holiday. Units that are open in some capacity on both days, the “observed” and the “actual” Holiday, will pay the Holiday Premium as in Para 354A to those employees that work on the “actual” holiday. Holiday pay may be recorded and paid on the “observed” holiday as described in Para 347 to those employees that did not work. This does not apply to the M-F only areas that do not open on an additional off-day because of the holiday or 7-days per week operations that observe the holiday on the Saturday or Sunday. (Mutual Understanding 11/2010)
354A.2 The mutually agreed day off must occur within the same pay period of the Holiday and is paid at straight time.
355.	Paragraph 355 applies only when prescheduled.
Over appointment hours prescheduled during a holiday week do not count in the calculation of additional PTO217.
Cancellation of over appointment and overtime and assigned time off during holiday weeks, other than on the day of the holiday should following the process as outlined in Paragraph 157 and Article 15, Assigned Time Off.
217 see paragraph 333V
237
Assigned time off during the Holiday week does not affect the ability to receive the holiday incentives for employees who have the holiday off and who prescheduled their full appointment. This applies to employees who volunteer to go home or stay home, per paragraphs 164B & 164C, or who are assigned off per paragraph 164D. The employee may choose to use PTO or approved no pay for the shift per paragraph 164F. Other than assigned time off as described in this intent note, the full appointment fraction must be worked in order for the holiday incentive to apply.
Hours prescheduled to provide coverage for an absence related to EST or FMLA, which are paid the $8.00/hour premium, do not count toward the holiday incentives.
This language does not apply to Ambulatory Care Units.
367B. The WRC should make clear in their discussions and in the vote of the unit members regarding the inclusion or exclusion of those employees working on December 25 having the guarantee to have either December 24 or 26 off.

INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 38:	LEAVES OF ABSENCE
410D. Employees will provide as much advance notice as possible of an extended time off work for purposes of staffing and scheduling.
411A. Under the provisions of the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the twelve (12) month period during which employees are entitled to continuing benefits will be calculated from the first day of paid or unpaid absence related to the qualifying event including the first date of an intermittent leave.
412 . We agree that, when taken intermittently or on a reduced effort schedule, the twelve (12) weeks of personal medical or family medical leave available annually will be pro-rated based on the actual numbers of hours absent on leave per week. Examples: a full-time employee who is taking personal medical leave or family medical leave intermittently at twenty (20) hours per week, will be eligible for a maximum of twenty-four (24) weeks of such leave in a twelve (12) month period; or a part-time employee who normally works thirty (30) hours per week, but is taking ten (10) hours of leave under a reduced effort schedule, will be eligible for a maximum of thirty-six (36) weeks of such leave in a twelve (12) month period. An employee working a reduced effort schedule while on a personal medical or family medical leave of absence, will retain the same health benefits held prior to taking the leave.
Also, accrued PTO time need not be exhausted prior to taking an intermittent personal medical or family medical or reduced effort leave of absence.
238
416.	Under the provisions of the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the twelve (12) month period during which employees are entitled to continuing benefits will be calculated from the first day of paid or unpaid absence related to the qualifying event including the first date of an intermittent leave.
416A. Under the provisions of the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the twelve (12) month period during which employees are entitled to continuing benefits will be calculated from the first day of paid or unpaid absence related to the qualifying event including the first date of an intermittent leave.
We agree that, when taken intermittently or on a reduced effort schedule, the twelve (12) weeks of personal medical or family medical leave available annually will be pro-rated based on the actual numbers of hours absent on leave per week. Examples: a full-time employee who is taking personal medical leave or family medical leave intermittently at twenty (20) hours per week, will be eligible for a maximum of twenty-four (24) weeks of such leave in a twelve (12) month period; or a part-time employee who normally works thirty (30) hours per week, but is taking ten (10) hours of leave under a reduced effort schedule, will be eligible for a maximum of thirty-six (36) weeks of such leave in a twelve (12) month period. An employee working a reduced effort schedule while on a personal medical or family medical leave of absence, will retain the same health benefits held prior to taking the leave.
Also, accrued PTO time need not be exhausted prior to taking an intermittent personal medical or family medical or reduced effort leave of absence.
424A. We agree that the language on placement following return from a military leave of absence is not consistent with seniority.
426.	Employees on a personal leave of absence whose positions are being held will be included for reduction-in-force in seniority order with other employees on the unit.
Employees returning from a leave of absence will be placed in reduction-in-force status if there are insufficient open positions and/or no probationary employees. These employees will be placed in seniority order with those employees subject to a reduction-in-force.
When an employee returns from a leave of absence and there are employees who have been subject to a reduction-in-force, the employee will be placed within the contractual seven (7) day time' frame before other employees provided there are sufficient available positions for all employees to be placed, and the other employees have a time frame to be placed which is longer than the time frame for the employee returning from a leave of absence.
In the event the employee subject to a reduction-in-force has less than seven (7) calendar days remaining in the notification period, he/she will be placed first.
239
If an employee is temporarily placed in CSR/ACNRP, the employee will retain their former classification and the University will have met its return to work obligation.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 39:	BENEFIT PLANS
441.	There will be joint education on the use of the flexible spending account each year during open enrollment.
442-1. An average aggregate is the compilation of the costs across plans, employees including dependents and children throughout the University. It is not a reflection of actual contributions experienced on an individual basis but an aggregate from within the health care costs (premiums, prescriptions, co-pays and deductibles) and then spread throughout in relation to contributions by both the university and the employee.
The annual period that will be utilized in the determination of hours paid for part-time employees that will go in the determination of qualifying for contributions at the full-time equivalent salary is July 1 to June 30.
The Salary Bands that are referenced can be found at the JIT website and are
updated annually at the Benefits website as well.
http://www.med.umich.edu/nursing/jit/contracts.htm (Ctrl. click to open)
The Salary Bands for 2012 are:

Band 2: $40,001 -$54,500 (2nd quartile)	Between 9093%	Between 5766%	Between 70-75%
Band 3: $54,01 and above (3rd & 4 th quartile)	90%	57%	70%
The bands are based on quartiles, so the breakpoints from one band to the next will automatically adjust each year as salaries change.
240
458.	No employee will be permitted to decrease their appointment fraction below
fifty per cent or twenty hours per week without being fully advised, both verbally and in writing, of the consequences of the reduction as it affects retirement eligibility.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 40:	COMMITTEES
464.	The University and the Association agree to develop a system to monitor committees in order to avoid duplication of work effort and to evaluate effectiveness.
INTENT NOTE

For non-University of Michigan courses, the $1,006.00 per term maximum is effective through July 31, 2005. Thereafter the maximum will be adjusted each year by a percentage equal to the average percentage increase in resident undergraduate tuition at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus for that academic year.
INTENT NOTE

486. "If practicable" refers to distance and/or level of injury.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 45:	DISCIPLINE
499.	We agree that whenever practicable an Association Representative will be
present, when an employee receives notice of a disciplinary layoff or discharge.
501A. We agree that in transfer/promotion, the Employment Office will not discuss discipline older than two (2) years with the hiring manager. If an employee is denied transfer/promotion due to the manager's reliance on discipline older than two (2) years, the request for transfer/promotion will be reevaluated without consideration given to the discipline.
INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 46:	DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE AND MEDIATION PROCEDURE
551. The Association agrees to list specific paragraphs in disputes. Management agrees to answer specifically each of the paragraphs listed. If these
241
commitments are not met, the parties agree to bring this back to the table at the time of the next negotiations. Where either party has a question regarding the lack of specificity in either the dispute or the answer, that party shall approach the other for clarification of paragraph and/or specificity of answer.
An employee may consult with and utilize the Office of Equity and Diversity during the dispute resolution process.
559.	We agree the mediator is non-jurisdictional and advisory only. We also agree that a mediator may not be used as a witness for either party in arbitration.
575.	If a dispute has not been heard within thirty (30) calendar days of the filing date and there is no extension granted, the dispute may be submitted to the next step of the dispute resolution/arbitration procedures, including mediation where applicable.
The intent is to move disputes forward. The time frames outlined in the rest of Article 46 are the norm. We agree the intent is not to extend the norm, but to deal with exceptions.
INTENT NOTE

583.	"As soon as practicable" means schedules of participants, or needing additional information.
INTENT NOTE

INTENT NOTE
ARTICLE 53:	CHARGE NURSE GUIDELINES
242
605A. Intent is to allow flexibility in charge assignments to reflect patient acuity, census, and employee ability to perform charge duties.
