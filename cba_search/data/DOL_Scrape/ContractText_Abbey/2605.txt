The term "Contract" as used herein means the written agreement provided under Section 3517.5 of the Government Code.
ARTICLE 1	- RECOGNITION
A.	(Unit 11) Pursuant to Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) Decision S-SR-11, the State recognizes CSEA (Civil Service Division), Local 1000, SEIU, as the exclusive representative for the Engineering and Scientific Technician Bargaining Unit, hereinafter referred to as Unit 11.

The Union shall notify the State promptly of any changes of such stewards. Union stewards shall not be recognized by the State until such lists or changes thereto are received.
C.	Area of Representation - A Union steward's "area of primary representation" is defined as an institution, office, or building. However, the parties recognize that it may be necessary for the Union to assign a steward an area of representation for several small offices, department, or buildings within close proximity. Disputes regarding this paragraph may be appealed directly to the DPA Step of the Grievance Procedure.
2.2	Access
A.	Union stewards, Union staff, and/or elected bargaining unit council representatives may have access to employees to represent them pursuant to Section 2.1 A. above. Access shall not interfere with the work of the employees. Union stewards, Union staff, or elected bargaining unit council representatives seeking access to employees must notify the department head or designee in advance of the visit.

2.3	Use of State Equipment

B.	Union Stewards shall be permitted minimal and incidental use of State equipment for representational activities as defined in Section 2.1, if said equipment is available and utilized as a normal part of his/her duties. Such use of State equipment shall not result in additional costs to the State, nor shall it interfere with the conduct of State business.
C.	Union Stewards shall be permitted reasonable and occasional use of fax machines and copiers for Union representation purposes provided that such use does not result in additional cost to the State, nor interfere with State operations.

D.	The Union agrees that any literature posted or distributed on site will not be libelous, obscene, defamatory, or of a partisan political nature.
E.	The Union shall be permitted incidental and minimal use of State electronic communication systems for communication of Union activities as the departments permit for other non-business purposes.
F.	The use of electronic communication systems (devices) are not considered private or secure information and are subject to being monitored by the department.

Requests for use of such State facilities shall be made in advance to the appropriate State official. When required in advance, the Union shall reimburse the State for additional expenses, such as security, maintenance, and facility management costs or utilities, incurred as a result of the Union's use of such State facilities.
2.6	Steward Time Off
Upon request of an aggrieved employee, a steward shall be allowed reasonable time off during working hours, without loss of compensation, for representational purposes in accordance with Section 2.1 A. of this Contract, provided the employee represented is in the steward's designated area of representation. Release time for these purposes is subject to prior notification and approval by the steward's immediate supervisor. Upon mutual agreement of the parties, a reasonable number of additional stewards can also be granted reasonable time off under this section.

Upon initial appointment to any position as a probationary or permanent employee, the employee shall be informed by the employer that the Union is the recognized employee organization for the employee in said classification.

B.	The packet of information provided by CSEA shall include a pre-addressed, stamped postcard that the employee may use to notify CSEA of a new appointment.

ARTICLE 3	- UNION SECURITY
3.1	Union Security
The State agrees to deduct and transmit to the Union all membership dues authorized on a form provided by the Union. Effective with the beginning of the first pay period following ratification of this Contract by the Legislature and the Union, the State agrees to calculate, deduct, and transmit to the Union, Fair Share fees from State employees who do not have membership dues deductions for the Union, based upon an amount or
12
BU 11
03-05
formula furnished by the Union for Fair Share fees deductions. The State further agrees to recalculate, deduct, and transmit Fair Share fees to the Union based upon any revised amounts or formulas furnished by the Union for Fair Share fees deductions during the term of this Contract. The State and the Union agree that a system of authorized dues deductions and a system of Fair Share fee deductions shall be operated in accordance with Government Code Sections 3513(h), 3513(j), 3515, 3515.6, 3515.7, and 3515.8, subject to the following provisions:
1.	When Fair Share fees are in effect, an employee may withdraw from membership in the Union by sending a signed withdrawal letter to the Union with a copy to the State Controller at any time. An employee who so withdraws his/her membership shall be subject to paying a Fair Share fee, if such a fee is applicable.
2.	The Union agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the State and its agents harmless against any claims made of any nature and against any suit instituted against the State arising from this section and the deductions arising therefrom.
3.	The Union agrees to annually notify all State employees who pay Fair Share fees of their right to demand and receive from the Union a return of part of that fee pursuant to Government Code Section 3515.8.
4.	No provisions of this section or any disputes arising thereunder shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure contained in this Contract.
5.	Should a rescission election be successful, the written authorization for payroll deductions for Union membership shall remain in full force and effect during the life of this contract except that any employee may withdraw from the Union by sending a signed withdrawal letter to the Union with a copy to the State Controller's Office within thirty (30) calendar days prior to the expiration of this Contract.
3.2	Release of Home Addresses: Non Law Enforcement Employees
A.	Home Addresses - Generally
1.	Consistent with PERB regulations and State law, the State shall continue to provide the Union with home addresses on a monthly basis for all employees covered by this Contract until it expires.
2.	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, any employee may have his/her home address withheld from the Union at any time by submitting a written request to his/her appointing power on a form provided by the State.
B.	Home Address Withholding
The State will no longer use an Employee Action Request form that provides employees with the option of having their home address withheld from the Union. Instead, bargaining unit employees will, upon request on their own initiative, be given a separate form by their appointing power that permits two choices: (1) withhold their address from the Union, or (2) to cancel a previous withhold request thereby permitting release of their home address to the Union.
13
BU 11
03-05
C.	Home Address Withhold Notification to Employees
Within one month following ratification of this Contract by both parties, the State will send a letter drafted by the Union to all existing employees that have previously requested their home address be withheld. The letter will provide said employees with the option of canceling their previous withhold request thereby permitting release of their home address to the Union.
D.	Release and Use of Addresses
The State Controller's Office shall send the Union a list of all Bargaining Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees who, pursuant to subsection C. above, either did not respond or responded by indicating they wanted to continue withholding their home address from the Union. Said list(s) will contain the employee's name, agency, and reporting unit.
E.	Home Address Mailings by the State
The State will mail Union information once per year to the home address of bargaining unit employees who have requested their home address be withheld from the Union. Said material shall be provided by the Union. The cost of this mailing shall be paid for by the Union. The Union agrees to hold the State harmless for any annual mail that does not reach Bargaining Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15, or 20 employees.

ARTICLE 8	- LEAVES
8.1	Vacation Leave
A.	Employees shall not be entitled to vacation leave credit for the first six (6) months of service. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of six (6) qualifying monthly pay periods of continuous service, all full-time employees covered by this section shall receive a one-time vacation bonus of forty-two (42) hours of vacation credit. Thereafter, for each additional qualifying monthly pay period, the employee shall be allowed credit for vacation with pay on the first day of the following month as follows:
7 months to 3 years
37 months to 10 years
121 months to 15 years
181 months to 20 years
20 years and over
7 hours per month
10 hours per month
12	hours per month
13	hours per month
14	hours per month
An employee who returns to State service after an absence of six (6) months or longer, caused by a permanent separation, shall receive a one-time vacation credit on the first monthly pay period following completion of six (6) qualifying pay periods of continuous service in accordance with the employee's total State service before and after the absence.
B.	A full-time employee who has eleven (11) or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall earn vacation credits as set forth under Item A. above. Absences from State service resulting from a temporary or permanent separation for more than eleven (11) consecutive working days which fall into two consecutive qualifying pay periods shall disqualify the second pay period.
C.	Employees working less than full-time accrue vacation in accordance with the chart shown in Section 7 L. of this Contract.
D.	Vacation credits may be taken in fifteen (15) minute increments.
33
BU 11

E.	Employees are authorized to use existing fractional vacation hours that may have been accumulated.
F.	Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for accrued vacation credits for all accrued vacation time.
G.	Subject to operational needs, the time when vacation shall be taken by the employee shall not be unreasonably denied. Employee vacation requests shall be submitted and granted or denied in writing in a timely manner. Vacations can only be cancelled when unanticipated operational needs require it.
H.	Vacation requests must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on this subject. However, when two (2) or more employees on the same shift (if applicable) in a work unit (as defined by each department head or designee) request the same vacation time and approval cannot be given to all employees requesting it, employees shall be granted their preferred vacation period in order of seniority (defined as total months of State service in the same manner as vacation is accumulated). When two (2) or more employees have the same amount of State service, department seniority will be used to break the tie. Vacation schedules, which have been established in a work unit, pursuant to the seniority provisions in this Article, shall not be affected by employee(s) entering the unit after the schedule has been established.
I.	By June 1 of each calendar year those employees whose vacation balance exceeds, or could exceed by December 31, the vacation cap of Section 8.1 J. must submit to their supervisor for approval a plan to use vacation to bring their balance below the cap. If the employee fails to submit a plan, or adhere to an approved plan, the department head or designee has the right to order an employee to take sufficient vacation to reduce the employee's vacation balance or potential balance on December 31 below the cap specified in Section 8.1 J.
J.	If an employee does not use all of the vacation that the employee has accrued in a calendar year, the employee may carry over his/her accrued vacation credits to the following calendar year to a maximum of 400 hours. A department head or designee shall permit an employee to carry over more than 400 hours of accrued vacation leave hours if an employee was unable to reduce his/her accrued hours because the employee: (1) was required to work as a result of fire, flood, or other extensive emergency; (2) was assigned work of a priority or critical nature over an extended period of time; (3) was absent on full salary for compensable injury; (4) was prevented by department regulations from taking vacation until December 31 because of sick leave; or (5) was on jury duty.

K.	If an employee in Unit 1, 14 and Unit 20 does not use all of the vacation that the employee has accrued in a calendar year, the employee may carry over his/her accrued vacation credits to the following calendar year to a maximum of six hundred forty (640) hours. A department head or designee may permit an employee to carry over more than six hundred forty (640) hours of accrued vacation hours if an employee was unable to reduce his/her accrued hours because the employee: (1) was required to work as a result of fire, flood, or other extensive emergency; (2) was assigned work of a priority or critical nature over an extended period of time; (3) was absent on full salary for compensable injury; (4) was prevented by department regulations from taking vacation until December 31 because of sick leave; or (5) was on jury duty.
8.2	Sick Leave
A.	As used in this section, "sick leave" means the necessary absence from duty of an employee because of:
1.	Illness or injury, including illness or injury relating to pregnancy;
2.	Exposure to a contagious disease which is determined by a physician to require absence from work;
3.	Dental, eye, and other physical or medical examination or treatment by a licensed practitioner;
4.	Absence from duty for attendance upon the employee's ill or injured mother, father, husband, wife, domestic partner (as defined in accordance with Family Code Section 297), son, daughter, brother, sister, or any person residing in the immediate household. Such absence shall be limited to six (6) workdays per occurrence or, in extraordinary situations, to the time necessary for care until physician or other care can be arranged.
B.	A full-time employee who has eleven (11) or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall be eligible for up to eight (8) hours of sick leave credit. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each qualifying pay period of service, each full-time employee shall earn eight (8) hours of credit for sick leave with pay.
C.	Credit for less than full-time employees shall be computed as follows:
1.	Part-time employees. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each monthly pay period of continuous service, each part-time employee shall be allowed, on a pro rata basis, the fractional part of his/her appropriate accrual rate of credit for sick leave with pay in accordance with the schedule in Article 7.
2.	Multiple positions under this rule:
a.	An employee holding a position in State service in addition to the primary full-time position with the State shall not receive credit for sick leave with pay for service in the additional position;
35
BU 11
03-05
b.	Where an employee holds two (2) or more "less than full-time positions," the time worked in each position shall be combined for purposes of computing credits for sick leave with pay, but such credits shall not exceed the amount earned for (8 hours per pay period) full-time employment credit.
D.	An employee may be required to provide a physician's or licensed practitioner's verification of sick leave when:
1.	The employee has a demonstrable pattern of sick leave abuse; or
2.	The supervisor has good reason to believe the absence was for an unauthorized reason. A supervisor has good reason if a prudent person would also believe the absence was for an unauthorized reason.
E.	An employee will not be denied the right to use sick leave or be subject to any type of corrective or disciplinary action, or in any manner discriminated against for using or attempting to exercise his/her right to use sick leave based solely on the amount of use.
F.	The department head or designee shall approve sick leave only after having ascertained that the absence is for an authorized reason and may require the employee to submit substantiating evidence including, but not limited to, a physician's or licensed practitioner's verification. The State recognizes the confidential nature of the relationship between the health care provider and patient. However, such substantiation shall include, but not be limited to, the general nature of the employee's illness or injury and prognosis (i.e., the anticipated length of the absence, any restrictions upon return to work that prevent the employee from performing the full range of his/her normal work assignment and anticipated future absences). If the department head or designee does not consider the evidence adequate, the request for sick leave shall be disapproved. Upon request, a denial of sick leave shall be in writing stating the reason for denial.
G.	Sick leave may be accumulated without limit.
H.	Sick leave may be requested and taken in fifteen (15) minute increments.
I.	A full-time employee whose continuity of employment is broken by a permanent separation of six (6) months or longer and is subsequently reemployed cannot be credited with any unused sick leave accumulated prior to the employee's separation and the full-time employee must complete one month of continuous service before being granted one day of sick leave credit. In addition, when a full-time employee has a break in the continuity of employment because of a permanent separation of less than six (6) months or because of a temporary separation, the full-time employee's prior unused sick leave balance is restored.
J.	When an employee's sick leave balance is zero, other leave credits such as vacation, CTO, PLP, personal holiday, or holiday leave may be substituted with the supervisor's approval, and shall not be unreasonably denied.

Should additional leave be necessary, the department head or designee may authorize the use of other existing leave credits or authorized leave without pay. Any such request shall not be arbitrarily or unreasonably denied.

C.	Upon request, and subject to operational needs, an employee on an alternate work schedule or shift other than Monday - Friday, 8am to 5pm may be placed on an existing work schedule or shift that coincides with the time he/she is required to be available in accordance with the provisions of A. above.
8.14	Jury Duty
A.	An employee shall be allowed such time off without loss of compensation as is required in connection with mandatory jury duty. Upon receiving notice of jury duty an employee shall immediately provide a copy of the notice to his/her supervisor.
B.	If payment is made for such time off, the employee is required to remit to the State jury fees received. If an employee elects to use accrued vacation leave or compensating time off while on jury duty, the employee is not required to remit jury fees. For the purposes of this section, "jury fees" means fees received for jury duty excluding payment for mileage, parking, meals, or other out-of-pocket expenses.
C.	For an employee summoned to jury duty during hours other than the employee's regular and customary shift, management will endeavor to temporarily reassign the employee to a work shift that more closely coincides with the hours the employee is required to serve on jury duty, including any necessary travel time, subject to the following:
1.	The department already maintains an appropriate work shift that utilizes the employee's classification; and
2.	The operational needs of the department permit such reassignment.
D.	An employee shall be allowed time off without loss of compensation if approved by the department head or designee for voluntary jury duty such as grand jury. If approved by the department, paragraphs B. and C. apply.
E.	For the purpose of this section, an employee summoned to jury duty may be required to adjust the work shift to an eight (8) hour schedule.
F.	An employee summoned to jury duty who does not serve for a full day or who is placed on "on-call" status shall return to work to complete his/her scheduled workday if reasonable time remains for such return. An employee may not be required to report back to work if he/she feels there is not reasonably enough time left in the workday and if the employee's supervisor concurs. Concurrence will not be unreasonably withheld.
8.15	Personal Leave Program: 1992
A.	Personal Leave shall be requested and used by the employee in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Requests to use Personal Leave must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on vacation or annual leave. Employees may not be required to use Personal Leave credits.

BU 11

B.	At the discretion of the State, all or a portion of unused Personal Leave credits may be cashed out at the employee's salary rate at the time the Personal Leave payment is made. It is understood by both parties that the application of this cash-out provision may differ from department to department and from employee to employee. Departments shall consider an employee's request to retain leave credits for future use rather than have the leave cashed out. Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for unused Personal Leave credits in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Cash-out or lump-sum payment for any Personal Leave credits shall not be considered as "compensation" for purposes of retirement. If funds become available for the Personal Leave Program, departments will offer employees the opportunity to cash out accrued Personal Leave.
C.	If any dispute arises about this Personal Leave section, an employee may file a grievance and the decision reached at Step 3 (Department of Personnel Administration) of the grievance procedure shall be final and not subject to the arbitration clause of this Contract.
D.	Personal Leave credits shall not be counted towards the 1,734/1,934 hours of compensation for Special School employees subject to the State Special Schools 10-Month Compensation Agreement.
8.16	Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
A.	The State acknowledges its commitment to comply with the spirit and intent of the leave entitlement provided by the FMLA and the California Family Rights Act (CFRA) referred to collectively as "FMLA”. The State and the Union recognize that on occasion it will be necessary for employees of the State to take job-protected leave for reasons consistent with the FMLA. As defined by the FMLA, reasons for an FMLA leave may include an employee's serious health condition, for the care of a child, spouse, domestic partner (as defined in Family Code Section 297), or parent who has a serious health condition, and/or for the birth or adoption of a child.
B.	For the purposes of providing the FMLA benefits the following definitions shall apply:
1.	An eligible employee means an employee who meets the eligibility criteria set forth in the FMLA;
2.	An employee's child means any child, regardless of age, who is affected by a serious health condition as defined by the FMLA and is incapable of self care. "Care" as provided in this section applies to the individual with the covered health condition;
3.	An employee's parent means a parent or an individual standing in loco parentis as set forth in the FMLA;
4.	Leave may include paid sick leave, vacation, annual leave, personal leave, catastrophic leave, holiday credit, excess hours, and unpaid leave. In accordance with the FMLA, an employee shall not be required to use CTO credits, unless otherwise specified by Section 8.8 of this Contract.
44
BU 11
03-05
a.	FMLA absences due to illness and/or injury of the employee or eligible family member, may be covered with the employee's available sick leave credits and catastrophic leave donations. Catastrophic leave eligibility and sick leave credit usage for a FMLA leave will be administered in accordance with Sections 8.8 and 8.2 of this Contract.
b.	Other leave may be substituted for the FMLA absence due to illness and/or injury, at the employee's discretion. An employee shall not be required to exhaust all paid leave, before choosing unpaid leave, unless otherwise required by Section 8.8 of this Contract.
c.	FMLA absences for reasons other than illness and/or injury (i.e., adoption or care of an eligible family member), may be covered with leave credits, other than sick leave, including unpaid leave, at the employee's discretion. Except in accordance with Section 8.8 of this Contract, an employee shall not be required to exhaust all leave credits available before choosing unpaid leave to cover an FMLA absence.
C.	An eligible employee shall provide certification of the need for an FMLA leave. Additional certification may be requested if the department head or designee has reasonable cause to believe the employee's condition or eligibility for FMLA leave has changed. The reasons for the additional certification request shall be provided to the employee in writing.
D.	An eligible employee shall be entitled to a maximum of twelve (12) workweeks (480 hours) FMLA leave per calendar year and all other rights set forth in the FMLA. This entitlement shall be administered in concert with the other leave provisions in Article 8 of this Contract. Nothing in this Contract should be construed to allow the State to provide less than that provided by the FMLA.
E.	On January 1 of each year, FMLA leave shall be recorded in accordance with the calendar year. Each time an employee takes an FMLA leave, the remaining leave entitlement is any balance of the twelve (12) workweeks that has not been used during the current calendar year. Employees who have taken FMLA leave under the previous 12 month rolling period, shall be entitled to additional leave up to a total of 12 weeks for the current calendar year.
F.	An employee on FMLA leave has a right to be restored to his/her same or "equivalent" position (FMLA) or to a "comparable" position (CFRA) with equivalent pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment.
G.	For the purposes of computing seniority, employees on paid FMLA leave will accrue seniority credit in accordance with the Department of Personnel Administration Rules 599.608 and 599.609.
H.	Any appeals regarding an FMLA decision should be directed to the department head or designee. FMLA is a Federal law and administered and enforced by the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division. The State's CFRA is a State law which is administered and enforced by the Department of Fair Employment and Housing. FMLA/CFRA does not supersede any Article of this Contract which provides greater family and medical leave rights. This section is not subject to grievance or arbitration.

8.17	Mentoring Leave
A.	Eligible employees may receive up to forty (40) hours of "mentoring leave" per calendar year to participate in mentoring activities once they have used an equal amount of their personal time for these activities. "Mentoring leave" is paid leave time which may only be used by an employee to mentor. This leave does not count as time worked for purposes of overtime. "Mentoring leave" may not be used for travel to and from the mentoring location.
B.	An employee must use an equal number of hours of his or her personal time (approved annual leave, vacation, personal leave, personal holiday, or CTO during the workday and/or personal time during non-working hours) prior to requesting "mentoring leave”. For example, if an employee requests two (2) hours of "mentoring leave”, he or she must have used two (2) verified hours of his or her personal time prior to receiving approval for the "mentoring leave". "Mentoring leave" does not have to be requested in the same week or month as the personal time was used. It does, however, have to be requested and used before the end of the calendar year.
C.	Prior to requesting mentoring leave and in accordance with departmental policy, an employee shall provide his or her supervisor with verification of personal time spent mentoring from the mentoring organization.
D.	Requests for approval of vacation, CTO, and/or annual leave for mentoring activities are subject to approval requirements in this Contract and in existing departmental policies. Requests for approval of mentoring leave are subject to operational needs of the State, budgetary limits, and any limitations imposed by law.
E.	In order to be eligible for "mentoring leave", an employee must:
1.	Have a permanent appointment;
2.	Have successfully completed their initial probationary period; and
3.	Have committed to mentor a child or youth through a mentoring organization that meets the quality assurance standards in accordance with the California Mentor Program Directory, under the guidance of the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, for a minimum of one school year. (Most programs are aligned with the child's normal school year, however, there may be some that are less or more. Department management may make exceptions to the one school year commitment based on the mentor program that is selected.)
F.	An employee is not eligible to receive “mentoring leave” if:
1.	He or she is assigned to a “post” position in the Departments of Corrections or Youth Authority; or
2.	He or she works in a level of care position in the Departments of Developmental Services, Mental Health, Education or Veterans’ Affairs.

G.	Permanent part-time and Permanent Intermittent employees may receive a pro-rated amount of mentoring leave based upon their time base. For example, a half time employee is eligible for twenty (20) hours of mentoring leave per calendar year, whereas an intermittent employee must work a qualifying monthly pay period (equivalent to 160 hours) to earn 3.3 hours of mentoring leave.
H.	Any appeals and/or disputes regarding this section shall be handled in accordance with the Complaint procedure specified in Article 6 of this Contract.
8.18	Work and Family Participation
A.	Family Activity
Subject to operational needs and reasonable notice to the employer, employees shall be permitted to use accrued leave credits (vacation, annual leave, personal holiday, holiday credits, CTO) for the purpose of attending school or non-school family-related activities such as sports events, recitals, 4-H, etc., in which the employee’s child is participating.
However, use of such leave shall not diminish an employee’s entitlement under the Family School Partnership Act (Labor Code Section 230.8) to, upon reasonable notice to the employer, use up to eight (8) hours per month but not to exceed forty (40) hours per calendar year of accrued leave credits (vacation, annual leave, personal holiday, holiday credits, CTO) for the purpose of attending school or preschool related activities in which the employee’s child is participating.
Family is defined as the employee’s son, daughter, or any child the employee stands in loco parentis (to the child).
Employee leave requests for family activities shall be in accordance with the appropriate departmental procedures.

Subject to operational needs, and upon reasonable notice to the employee’s immediate supervisor, employees shall be eligible to use accumulated leave credits for the purpose of dealing with family crisis situations (e.g., divorce counseling, family or parenting conflict management, family care urgent matters and/or emergencies). If the employee has exhausted available leave credits, the employee may request unpaid leave.
Family is defined as the parent, stepparent, spouse, domestic partner (as defined in accordance with Family Code Section 297), child, grandchild, grandparent, brother, sister, stepchild, or any person residing in the immediate household.
If eligible, any family crisis leave that meets the definition of serious health condition will run concurrently with Subsection 8.16 of this Contract, Family and Medical Leave Act.
The State shall consider requests from employees to adjust work hours or schedules or consider other flexible arrangements consistent with a department’s operational needs and the provisions of this Contract.

14 hours per month
16	hours per month
17	hours per month

Part-time and hourly employees shall accrue proportional annual leave credits, in accordance with the applicable DPA rules. Employees shall have the continued use of any sick leave accrued as of the effective date of the Agreement, in accordance with applicable laws, rules, or memorandum of understanding. All provisions necessary for the administration of this Section shall be provided by DPA rule or memorandum of understanding.
C.	A full-time employee who has eleven (11) or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall earn annual leave credits as set forth in DPA Rules 599.608 and 599.609. Absences from State service resulting from a temporary or permanent separation for more than eleven (11) consecutive days which fail into two (2) consecutive qualifying pay periods shall disqualify the second pay period.
D.	Employees who work in multiple positions may participate in annual leave, provided an election is made while employed in an eligible position subject to these provisions. Annual leave accrual for employees in multiple positions will be computed by combing all positions, as in vacation leave, provided the result does not exceed he amount earnable in full-time employment, and the rate of accrual shall be determined by the schedule which applies to the position or collective bargaining status under which the election was made.

E.	If an employee does not use all of the annual leave that the employee has accrued in a calendar year, the employee may carry over his/her accrued annual leave credits to the following calendar year to a maximum of six hundred forty (640) hours. A department head or designee may permit an employee to carry over more than six hundred forty (640) hours accrued hours because the employee: (1) was required to work as a result of fire, flood, or other extensive emergency; (2) was assigned work of a priority or critical nature over an extended period of time; (3) was absent on full salary for compensable injury; (4) was prevented by department regulations from taking annual leave until December 31 because of sick leave; or (5) was on jury duty.

G.	The time when annual leave shall be taken by the employee shall be determined by the department head or designee. If on January 1 of each year an employee’s annual leave bank exceeds the cap in Subsection E, the department may order the employee to take annual leave.
H.	Annual leave request must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on the subject. However, when two (2) or more employees on the same shift (if applicable) in a work unit (as defined by each department head or designee) request the same annual leave time and approval cannot be given to all employees requesting it, employees shall be granted their preferred annual leave period in order of State seniority.
I.	Each department head or designee will make every effort to act on annual leave requests in a timely manner.
J.	Annual leave that is used for purposes of sick leave is subject to the requirements set forth in Article 8.2, Sick Leave, of this Agreement.

L.	Employees who are currently subject to vacation and sick leave provisions may elect to enroll in the annual leave program at any time after twenty-four (24) months has elapsed from date of last enrollment. The effective date of the election shall be the first day of the pay period in which the election is received by the appointing power. Once enrolled in annual leave, an employee shall become entitled to an enhanced NDI benefit (50 percent of gross salary).
M.	This section may be amended during the term of this Contract as a result of the negotiated agreement to implement State Disability Insurance.

A.	Each full-time employee subject to paragraph B. shall be credited with eight (8) hours of Personal Leave on the first day of the following monthly pay period for each month in the Personal Leave program.
B.	Salary ranges and rates shall be changed to reflect the July 1, 2003 general salary increase; however, each full-time employee shall continue to work his/her assigned work schedule and shall have a reduction in pay equal to 5%. In exchange 8 hours of leave will be credited to the employee's Personal Leave Program monthly.
C.	Personal leave shall be requested and used by the employee in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Requests to use personal leave must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on vacation and annual leave. Personal leave shall not be included in the calculation of vacation/annual leave balances pursuant to Article 8 (Leaves) and Sections 8.1 (Vacation Leave) and 8.19, (Annual Leave).
D.	At the discretion of the State, all or a portion of unused personal leave credits may be cashed out at the employee's salary rate at the time the personal leave payment is made. It is understood by both parties that the application of this cash out provision may differ from department to department and from employee to employee. Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for unused personal leave credits in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Cash out or lump sum payment for any Personal Leave credits shall not be considered as "compensation" for purposes of retirement. If funds become available, as determined by the Department of Finance, for the Personal Leave Program, departments will offer employees the opportunity to cash out accrued personal leave. Upon retirement/separation, the cash value of the employees personal leave balance may be transferred into a State of California, Department of Personnel Administration Deferred Compensation Program as permitted by federal and state law.
E.	An employee may not use any kind of paid leave such as sick leave, vacation, or holiday time to avoid a reduction in pay resulting from the Personal Leave Program.

An employee using the Employee Assistance Program, upon approval, may use accrued sick leave credits, CTO, vacation, and holiday credits for such a purpose. Leave of absences without pay may be granted by the department head or designee upon the recommendation of the Employee Assistance Program Coordinator if all sick leave, holiday credits, vacation, and compensating time off have been exhausted, and the employee is not eligible to use Industrial Disability Leave or Non-Industrial Disability Insurance. A list of all Employee Assistance Program Coordinators and a telephone number to contact the appropriate coordinator shall be furnished to the Union within a timely manner after the execution of this Contract.

9.12	Non-Industrial Disability Insurance
A.	Non-Industrial Disability Insurance (NDI) is a program for State employees who become disabled due to non-work related disabilities as defined by Section 2626 of the Unemployment Insurance Code.
B.	For periods of disability commencing on or after October 1, 1984, eligible employees shall receive NDI payments at 60 percent (60%) of their full pay, not to exceed $135 per week, payable monthly for a period not exceeding twenty-six (26) weeks for any one disability benefit period. An employee is not eligible for a second disability benefit due to the same or related cause or condition unless they have returned to their regular time base, and work for at least ten (10) consecutive workdays. Paid leave shall not be used to cover the ten (10) workdays.
C.	The employee shall serve a ten (10) consecutive calendar day waiting period before NDI payments commence for each disability. Accrued vacation or sick leave balances may be used to cover this waiting period. The waiting period may be waived when the employee is a registered bed patient in a hospital or nursing home, or receives treatment in a hospital or surgical unit or licensed surgical clinic. Procedure rooms and doctor's offices are not included.
D.	If the employee elects to use vacation, annual leave, personal leave, or sick leave credits prior to receiving NDI payments, he/she is not required to exhaust the accrued leave balance.
E.	Following the start of NDI payments, an employee may, at any time, switch from NDI to sick leave, vacation leave, annual leave, personal leave, or catastrophic leave but may not return to NDI until that leave is exhausted.
F.	In accordance with the State's "return to work" policy, an employee who is eligible to receive NDI benefits and who is medically certified as unable to return to full-time work during the period of his or her disability, may upon the discretion of his or her appointing power work those hours (in hour increments) which, when combined with the NDI benefit, will not exceed 100 percent (100%) of their regular "full pay". This does not qualify the employee for a new disability period under B. of this section. The appointing power may require an employee to submit to a medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the Director of the Employment Development Department for the purpose of evaluating the capacity of the employee to perform the work of his/her position.
G.	If an employee refuses to return to work in a position offered by the employer under the State's Injured State Worker Assistance Program, NDI benefits will be terminated effective the date of the offer.
BU 11

H.	Where employment is intermittent or irregular, the payments shall be determined on the basis of the proportionate part of a monthly rate established by the total hours actually employed in the eighteen (18) monthly pay periods immediately preceding the pay period in which the disability begins as compared to the regular rate for a fulltime employee in the same group or class. An employee will be eligible for NDI payments on the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of 960 hours of compensated work.
I.	All other applicable Department of Personnel Administration laws and regulations not superseded by these provisions will remain in effect.
J.	Upon approval of NDI benefits, the State may issue an employee a salary advance if the employee so requests.
K.	All appeals of a denial of an employee’s NDI benefits shall only follow the procedures in the Unemployment Insurance Code and Title 22.

B.	An employee working in the Departments of Developmental Services, Mental Health, or Veterans Affairs, or in the Special Schools in the Department of Education who loses the ability to work for more than twenty-two (22) workdays as the result of an injury incurred in the official performance of his/her duties may be eligible for a financial augmentation to the existing Industrial Disability Leave benefits. Such injury must have been directly and specifically caused by an assault by a resident, patient, student, client, or member.
C.	The EIDL benefits will be equivalent to the injured employee’s net take home salary on the date of occurrence of the injury. EIDL eligibility and benefits may continue for no longer than one year after the date of occurrence of injury. For the purposes of this section, “net salary” is defined as the amount of salary received after Federal income tax, State income tax, and the employee’s retirement contribution have been deducted from the employee’s gross salary. The EIDL benefit will continue to be subject to miscellaneous payroll deductions.

F.	Other existing rules regarding the administration of IDL will be followed in the administration of EIDL.
G.	This section relating to EIDL will not be subject to the arbitration procedure of this Contract.

B.	In the event that the disability exceeds twenty-two (22) workdays, the employee will receive 66 and 2/3 percent of gross pay from the twenty-third (23rd) workday of disability until the end of the fifty-second (52nd) week of disability. No IDL or payments shall be allowed after two (2) years from the first day (i.e., date) of disability.
C.	The employee may elect to supplement payment from the twenty-third (23rd) workday with accrued leave credits including annual leave, vacation, sick leave, or compensating time off (CTO) in the amount necessary to approximate the employee's full net pay. Partial supplementation will be allowed, but fractions of less than one (1) hour will not be permitted. Once the level of supplementation is selected, it may be decreased to accommodate a declining leave balance but it may not be increased. Reductions to supplementation amounts will be made on a prospective basis only.
D.	Temporary Disability (TD) with supplementation, as provided for in Government Code Section 19863, will no longer be available to any State employee who is a member of either the PERS or STRS retirement system during the first fifty-two (52) weeks, after the first date of disability, within a two (2)-year period. Any employee who is already receiving disability payments on the effective date of this provision will be notified and given thirty (30) days to make a voluntary, but irrevocable, change to the new benefit for the remainder of his/her eligibility for IDL.
E.	If the employee remains disabled after the IDL benefit is exhausted, then the employee will be eligible to receive Temporary Disability benefits as provided for in Government Code Section 19863.
F.	In the event that an employee is determined to be "permanent and stationary" by his/her physician before the IDL benefit is exhausted, but is unable to return to work, he/she must agree to participate in a vocational rehabilitation program. Refusing to participate will result in immediate suspension of the IDL benefit.
G.	All appeals of an employee's denial of IDL benefits shall only follow the procedures in the Government Code and Title 2. All disputes relating to an employee's denial of benefits are not grievable or arbitrable. This does not change either party's contractual rights which are not related to an individual's denial of benefits.

ARTICLE 11 - SALARIES
11.1	Salaries
Notwithstanding any other Contract provision to the contrary, the general salary of July 1, 2003 shall remain in effect for the term of this Contract unless amended pursuant to Article 22, Section 22.2 B.
11.2	Salary Definitions
Units 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 hereby agrees to support putting the following changes to Article 5 of the Department of Personnel Administration regulations into effect provided all bargaining units agree to the same.
As used in this Article, terms are defined as follows:
A.	“Salary range” is the range of rates between, and including, the minimum and maximum rate currently authorized for the class; Top Step Rounding: Classes shall be adjusted to reflect 5 percent increments between the minimum and the maximum salary rates. Each 5 percent shall be calculated by multiplying by 1.05 and rounded to the nearest dollar. To calculate 5 percent for daily and hourly rates multiply by 1.05 and round to the nearest dollar and cents amount, subject to the availability of funds.
70
BU 11
03-05
B.	“Step” for employees compensated on a monthly basis is a five percent (5%) differential above or below a salary rate rounded to the nearest dollar and for employees compensated on a daily or hourly basis is a five percent (5%) differential above or below a rate rounded to the nearest dollar and cents amount. One-step higher is calculated by multiplying the rate by 1.05 (e.g., $2,300 x 1.05 = $2,415). One-step lower is calculated by dividing the rate by 1.05 (e.g., $2,415 + 1.05 = $2,300).
C.	“Rate” for employees compensated on a monthly basis is any one of the full dollar amounts found within the salary range and for employees compensated on a daily or hourly basis is any one of the dollar and cents amounts found within the salary range.
D.	“Range differential” is the difference between the maximum rate of two salary ranges.
E.	“Substantially the same salary range“ is a salary range with the maximum salary rate less than two-steps higher than or the same as the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
F.	“Higher salary range” is a salary range with the maximum salary rate at least two-steps higher than the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
G.	“Lower salary range” is a salary range with the maximum salary rate any amount less than the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
Unless otherwise provided, the lowest salary range currently authorized for the class is used to make salary comparisons between classes except for deep classes. Any rate falling within the salary range for a class may be used to accomplish appropriate step differentials in movement between classes and salary ranges.
11.3	Timely Payment of Wages
A.	When a permanent full-time employee receives no pay warrant on payday, the State agrees to issue a salary advance, consistent with departmental policy and under the following conditions:
1.	When there are errors or delays in processing the payroll documents and the delay is through no fault of the employee, a salary advance will normally be issued within two (2) workdays after payday for an amount close to the actual net pay (gross salary less deductions) in accordance with departmental policy;
2.	When a regular paycheck is late for reasons other than 1. above (e.g., AWOL, late dock), a salary advance of no less than 50 percent (50%) of the employee's actual net pay will normally be issued within five (5) workdays after payday. No more than four (4) salary advances per calendar year may be issued under these circumstances;
3.	The difference between the employee's net pay and the salary advance shall not be paid until after receipt of the Controller's warrant for the pay period.

1.	A bilingual position for salary differential purposes requires the use of a bilingual skill on a continuing basis averaging ten percent (10%) of the time. Anyone using their bilingual skills ten percent (10%) or more of the time will be eligible whether they are using them in a conversational, interpretation, or translation setting. An employee may provide their supervisor with data supporting the use of their bilingual skills ten percent (10%) or more of the time. Management will evaluate this data in assigning bilingual designation to the position. In order to receive bilingual differential pay, the position/employee must be certified by the using department and approved by the Department of Personnel Administration. (Time should be an average of the time spent on bilingual activities during a given fiscal year.);
2.	The position must be in a work setting that requires the use of bilingual skills to meet the needs of the public in either:
a.	A direct public contact position;
b.	A hospital or institutional setting dealing with patient, client, student, or inmate needs;
c.	A position utilized to perform interpretation, translation, or specialized bilingual activities for the department and its clients.
3.	Position(s) must be in a setting where there is a demonstrated client or correspondence flow where bilingual skills are clearly needed.
4.	Where organizationally feasible, departments should ensure that positions clearly meet the standards by centralizing the bilingual responsibility in as few positions as possible.
5.	Actual time spent conversing or interpreting in a second language and closely related activities performed directly in conjunction with the specific bilingual transaction will count toward the ten percent (10%) standard.
B.	Rate:
1.	An employee meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria during the entire pay period would receive a maximum of $100 per pay period including holidays.
2.	A monthly employee meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria less than the entire pay period would receive the differential on a pro rata basis.
3.	A fractional-month employee meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria would receive the differential on a pro rata basis.
4.	An employee paid by the hour meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria would receive a differential of 58 cents per hour.
C.	Employees, regardless of the time base or tenure, who use their bilingual skills more than ten percent (10%) of the time on a continuing basis and are approved by the Department of Personnel Administration will receive the bilingual differential pay on a regular basis.

G.	Bilingual salary payments will be included in the calculation of lump-sum vacation, sick leave, and extra hour payments to employees terminating their State service appointment while on bilingual status.
H.	Work Week Group 2 employees will receive bilingual salary compensation for overtime hours worked.
I.	Employees receiving regular bilingual differential pay will have their transfer rights determined from the maximum step of the salary range for their class. Incumbents receiving bilingual pay will have the same transfer opportunities that other class incumbents are provided.
J.	The bilingual differential pay should be included in the rate used to calculate temporary disability, Industrial Disability, and Non-Industrial Disability leave benefits.
K.	Employees who do not receive a bilingual differential shall not be required to use bilingual skills.
11.7	Sustained Superior Accomplishment Awards
Sustained Superior Accomplishment Awards shall not be considered "compensation" for purposes of retirement.

BU 11

Upon request, within thirty (30) calendar days of the Union’s receipt of the notice, the State shall meet and confer with the Union over such assignments.
14.8	Contracting Out
A.	Purpose
The union has presented evidence that State departments are presently contracting out work appropriately done by Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees, and that said contracting results in unnecessary additional costs to the State. Thus, the purpose of this section is to guarantee that the State does not incur unnecessary, additional costs by contracting out work appropriately performed at less expense to the State by Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees, consistent with the terms of this section. In achieving this purpose the parties do not intend this section to expand the State’s ability to contract out for personal services. The parties agree that this section shall not be interpreted or applied in a manner which results in a disruption of services provided by state departments.
B.	Policy Regarding Personal Services Contracts and Cost Savings
Except in extremely unusual or urgent, time-limited circumstances, or under other circumstances where contracting out is recognized or required by law, Federal mandate, or court decisions/orders, the State must make every effort to hire, utilize and retain Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees before resorting to the use of private contractors. Contracting may also occur for reasons other than cost savings as recognized or required by law, Federal mandate, or court decisions/orders.
C.	Information Regarding Contracts To Be Let
1.	Departments will provide CSEA’s designated representative with copies of Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and Invitations for Bid (IFBs) for personal services contracts when released for publication if they call for services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications.
105
BU 11
03-05
2.	To the extent that a department is preparing to enter into a contract (or amend a contract) and it does not require an RFP or IFB, the department shall provide CSEA’s designated representative with a copy of the Standard Form 215 (or its departmental equivalent) if and when the Form 215 is completed but no less than five (5) business days thereafter provided the contract is/will be for services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications. If the Form 215 contains confidential or proprietary information, it shall be redacted as discussed below in subsection D(2).
3.	The purpose of this subsection (C) is to provide CSEA with notice and an opportunity to present alternatives which mitigate or avoid the need for contracting out, while still satisfying the needs of the State to provide services. Directors (or their designee) shall therefore meet with CSEA for this purpose, if requested by CSEA.
D.	Labor/Management Committee To Review Personal Service Contracts In Existence
1.	A State Joint labor/management committee shall be established. It shall consist of representatives of CSEA, the Department of Personnel Administration, the Department of Finance and affected departments. The first meeting of this committee shall occur no later than 10 working days from ratification of the MOU, and shall be for purposes of determining the procedures by which the committee will operate. An initial review of all currently existing contracts as requested by the committee shall be completed within six (6) months from ratification of this agreement. However, if this deadline cannot be met due to the number or complexity of existing contracts for review, the committee may mutually agree to extend this deadline.
106
BU 11
03-05
2.	Upon request of the committee (or either party on the committee) each department shall submit copies of any or all personal services contracts that call for services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications. For each contract, departments shall provide additional documents establishing the number, scope, duration, justification, total costs of all such contracts, and payment of all overhead and administrative costs paid through each contract, provided it does not disclose confidential or proprietary information, in which case it shall be redacted as discussed below. The requested contract and related information shall be provided as soon as reasonably possible. The parties expect that this shall be provided no more than 21 calendar days following the request by the joint labor/management committee, or longer if approved by the committee. This shall include contracts that may otherwise be protected from public disclosure, if they provide for services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications. However, the State may redact those portions of protected contract(s) that are proprietary, necessary to protect the competitive nature of the bid process, and that which does not pertain to the costing of personnel services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 classes. The goal shall be to protect against disclosure of information which should remain confidential, while at the same time providing the committee with sufficient information to determine whether unnecessary, additional costs are being incurred by contracting out work found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications. Costing information provided to the committee for protected contracts shall include total personnel costs for personnel services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 classifications plus any overhead charges paid to the contractor for these services, provided such disclosure does not breach confidentiality requirements or include proprietary information.
3.	Within 10 workdays after receipt of the personal service contracts and associated documents as provided for in paragraph D (2) above, the committee shall begin reviewing the contracts. The committee shall examine the contracts based on the purpose of this section, the terms of the contracts, all applicable laws, Federal mandates and court decisions/orders. In this regard, the committee will consider which contracts should and can be terminated immediately, which contracts will take additional time to terminate, which contracts may continue (for how long and under what conditions) and how (if necessary and cost effective) to transition contract employees or positions into civil service. All determinations shall be through express mutual agreement of the committee. Committee determinations regarding contracts let by the Department of Corrections shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in subsection F below.
4.	The committee will continue to meet as necessary to examine personal services contracts which have been let.
5.	If savings are generated by the termination of personal service contracts under this provision, it is the intent of the State to implement findings of the committee for utilization of said savings. Such findings may include:
a.	Contributing toward position reductions which would otherwise be accomplished by the layoff, salary reduction or displacement of Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees.
107
BU 11
03-05
b.	Enabling the employment of Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees for services currently performed by contractors;
c.	Enabling of the conversion to Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 civil service employment of qualified contract employees who wish to become State employees, as otherwise permitted by law, regulations, provisions of the contracts and resolutions by the State Personnel Board.
d.	Providing timely, adequate and necessary recruitment efforts. These efforts may include focused recruitment, publicizing in professional journals, use of the media, job fairs, expedited hiring, expedited background checks, spot testing authorized by the SPB, State employee registries, and recruitment and retention incentives.
e.	Such other purposes as may be mutually agreed upon by the joint labor/management committee.
E.	Displacement Avoidance
1.	The objective of this subsection is to ensure that Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees have preference over contract employees consistent with, but not limited to the following principles.
a.	The duties at issue are consistent with the Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee’s classification;
b.	The Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee is qualified to perform the job; and, c. There is no disruption in services.
2.	To avoid or mitigate Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee displacement for lack of work, the appointing power shall review all existing personal services contracts to determine if work consistent with the affected employee’s classification is being performed by a contractor. Displacement includes layoff, involuntary demotion, involuntary transfer to a new class, involuntary transfer to a new location requiring a change of residence, and time base reductions. If the joint labor/management committee that reviews personal services contracts determines that the terms and purpose of the contract permit the State to assign the work to a Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee who would otherwise be displaced, this shall be implemented consistent with the other terms of this section. The State and CSEA shall meet and confer for purposes of entering into an agreement about the means by which qualified employees are notified and provided with such assignments. This shall include developing a process that ensures that savings realized by terminating the contract and reassigning the work to a Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee to avoid displacement, are utilized to offset that employee’s moving and relocation costs, the amount of which shall be consistent with Section 12.2 Moving/Relocation of the parties’ collective bargaining agreement.
108
BU 11
03-05
F.	Department of Corrections
1.	This section shall not be applicable to the Department of Corrections until such time as it has been approved by the Federal court special master(s). Nothing in this section shall be interpreted or applied in such a manner as to interfere with Federal court orders, the authority of the Federal court or the authority of the special masters.
2.	The Department of Corrections shall present this section to the special master(s) immediately in writing upon ratification of this agreement. The parties agree to make themselves immediately available to meet with the special master, on a schedule determined by the special master.
3.	No contract for services by the Department of Corrections shall be prohibited, modified, restricted or terminated by virtue of this memorandum of understanding or by operation of the joint labor management committee established by this memorandum of understanding without approval of the Special Masters in Madrid v. Alameida et al (as it pertains to contracts effecting Pelican Bay State Prison), and/or the Special Master in the Coleman litigation (as it pertains to contacts effecting Coleman class members), and/or counsel for the parties in the Plata litigation or the Plata court (as it pertains to contracts effecting medical care for Plata class members).
4.	If this section is not approved by the special master the parties agree to reopen negotiations for the purpose of agreeing on an alternative contracting out provision, with the goal of satisfying the concerns of the Federal court and CSEA.
G.	Relationship Between This Section And Related Statutes
The State is mindful of the constitutional and statutory obligations (e.g., Govt. Code § 19130) as it pertains to restriction on contracting out. Thus, nothing in this section is intended to interfere with pursuit of remedies for violation of these obligations as provided by law (e.g., Public Contract Code § 10337).
ARTICLE 15	- TRANSFER
15.1	Appeal of Involuntary Transfer
A.	The State shall make reasonable efforts to avoid involuntary transfers. An involuntary transfer which reasonably requires an employee to change his/her residence may be grieved under Article 6 only if the employee believes it was made for the purpose of harassing or disciplining the employee. If the appointing authority or the Department of Personnel Administration disapproves the transfer, the employee shall be returned to his or her former position; shall be paid the regular travel allowance for the period of time he/she was away from his/her original headquarters; and his/her moving costs both from and back to the original headquarters shall be paid in accordance with the Department of Personnel Administration laws and rules.

Should the Court of Appeals only partially invalidate Section 15.3.11 in Case No. 02CS00787, the Saving Clause in Article 5, Section 5.4 shall be operative.

The parties therefore agree that the State may elect to fill vacancies using methods that include but are not limited to mandatory reinstatements; placement in lieu of layoff/demotion, appointment from a State Restriction of Appointment/Surplus list, reemployment list, limited duty (vacancy to be available at the end of temporary appointment); appointments pursuant to court orders, settlement agreements, State Personnel Board decisions, or the like; hardship transfers; reassignments (rotations, position “trades,” etc.); involuntary transfers in lieu of geographic relocation; promotions in place*; or an eligible employee who must be provided a reasonable accommodation.
*Promotion in place: Management shall have the option to promote employees in place without using Post and Bid provisions. For the purposes of this section, promotion in place is defined as 1) there is no true vacancy; and 2) there is no change of position, assignment, or supervisory/subordinate relationship of the

Employees shall be deemed to have performed satisfactorily if they received an overall rating of “satisfactory” on an annual performance evaluation or probationary report during the same 12 month period and they received no intervening counseling and/or corrective memos. If an employee did not receive a written performance evaluation during the 12 month period before bids are due (e.g., annual evaluation), the employee shall be deemed to have performed satisfactorily unless s/he received a counseling and/or corrective memo during the same 12 month period.
3.	Disciplinary Action: Employee must not have received a formal disciplinary action as specified in Government Code Section 19572 within the 12 months of when bids are due.

D.	Additional Bids
1.	An employee who successfully bids pursuant to this section shall not be eligible to bid for another position for twelve (12) months following the employee’s bid appointment effective date.

F.	Seniority
For purposes of this section “seniority” is defined as one point for each qualifying month of State service as used for purposes of determining leave (e.g., vacation) accrual.

2.	Most qualifying pay periods in the classification of the vacancy;
3.	Coin flip.
G.	Selection
When management decides to fill a vacancy:
1.	The most senior timely bidder who satisfies the eligibility criteria shall be offered the position.

If the most senior bidder is ineligible or disqualified for any reason listed in subsection C above, that bidder will be notified of the ineligibility or disqualification at the time the selection is announced.
2.	If the most senior employee offered the position declines the offer and there are remaining bidders who qualify, then the second most senior employee shall be offered the position until there are no remaining bidders who qualify.
3.	Employees offered positions pursuant to this subsection shall have a maximum of three (3) working days to accept or reject the offer unless the appointing power agrees to more time. Failing to respond within three (3) working days after being contacted (or longer as agreed to by the appointing power) may be deemed a rejection of the offer by management.

H.	Other Related Matters
1.	Bidding employees who accept appointments waive any and all right to claim moving, relocation and associated travel and per diem expenses. This does not, however, preclude payment of such expenses at management’s discretion.
2.	Nothing in this provision will prevent management from posting positions, and simultaneously beginning other methods to solicit applicants (e.g., sending contact letters out to employees on promotional lists), so no time is lost in filling the positions should, for example, there be no bidders. Such solicitation shall include the notice that the position is subject to post and bid process.

A.	Unless otherwise specified herein, the regular workweek of full-time employees shall be forty (40) hours Monday through Friday, and the regular work shift shall be eight (8) hours.
B.	Workweeks and work shifts of different numbers of hours may be established by the employer in order to meet varying needs of the State agencies.
C.	Employees' workweeks and/or work shifts shall not be permanently changed by the State without adequate prior notice. The State shall endeavor to give thirty (30) calendar days but in no case less than fifteen (15) calendar days notice.
D.	The State shall endeavor to provide employees with at least five (5) working days advance notice of a temporary change in their workweek hours and workday. This advance notice is not required if:
1.	The change is due to an unforeseen operational need;
2.	The change is made at the request of the employee.
E.	Classifications are assigned to the workweek groups as shown in the Lists of Classifications attached to this Contract.
F.	Workweek group policy for FLSA - Exempt/Excluded Employees:
State employees who are exempt/excluded from the FLSA are not hourly workers. The compensation they receive from the State is based on the premise that they are expected to work as many hours as is necessary to provide the public services for which they were hired. Consistent with the professional status of these employees, they are accountable for their work product, and for meeting the objectives of the agency for which they work.
Following is the State's policy for all employees exempt/excluded from the FLSA:
1.	Management determines, consistent with the current Contract the products, services, and standards which must be met by FLSA - exempt/excluded employees;
2.	The salary paid to FLSA - exempt/excluded employees is full compensation for all hours worked in providing the product or service;
3.	FLSA - exempt/excluded employees are not authorized to receive any form of overtime compensation, whether formal or informal;
4.	FLSA - exempt/excluded employees are expected to work within reason as many hours as necessary to accomplish their assignments or fulfill their responsibilities and must respond to directions from management to complete work assignments by specific deadlines.

6.	FLSA - exempt/excluded employees shall not be suspended for less than five (5) days when facing discipline;
7.	With the approval of the appointing power, FLSA - exempt/excluded employees may be allowed absences with pay for one or more whole days due to excessive work load or other special circumstances without charging leave credits;
8.	Subject to prior notification and management concurrence, FLSA exempt/excluded employees may alter their work hours. Employees are responsible for keeping management apprised of their schedule and whereabouts. Prior approval from management for the use of formal leave (e.g., vacation, sick leave, personal leave, personal day) for absences of an entire day or more is required.
19.2	Overtime
A.	Overtime is earned at the rate of one and one-half times the hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a regular workweek and is compensable by cash or CTO if it meets the following criteria:
1.	Ordered overtime of at least fifteen (15) minutes at any one time;
2.	Overtime will be credited on a fifteen (15) minute basis with a full fifteen (15) minute credit to be granted if seven (7) minutes is worked. Smaller fractional units will not be accumulated.
B.	Overtime may be compensated on a cash or CTO basis at the discretion of the department head or designee. Both parties agree and understand that a different type of overtime payment (cash or CTO) may be provided to employees at different times and may even be different for employees in the same or similar situations. However, in the event that the Department of Industrial Relations determines that this provision is inconsistent with Labor Code 204.3, the parties agree to immediately meet and confer regarding the impact of that determination.
C.	Overtime must be authorized in advance, except in an emergency, by the State or its designated representative. This authorization must also be confirmed in writing not later than ten (10) days after the end of the pay period during which the overtime was worked.

2.	Notwithstanding the above, FLSA covered employees traveling on state business, outside of their normal work hours (as defined in FLSA) will be granted a special allowance for actual time spent traveling. Employees shall receive this special allowance equivalent to the employee’s regular hourly rate on a straight time, hour for hour basis, in cash or CTO, at the discretion of the department head or designee. This is not overtime compensation and shall not be considered as time worked for calculation of overtime. This paragraph also applies to passengers in carpools, vans or other vehicles, traveling on state business. This paragraph does not apply to employees who voluntarily choose to travel outside their normal work hours.

If an employee fails to take all required extras simultaneously, reimbursement will not exceed the cost that would have been incurred had the tests been taken simultaneously.
D.	Release Time for Class A and/or Class B Commercial Driver's License and Medical Examination
1.	Upon ten (10) workdays advance notice to the department head or designee, the department shall provide reasonable time off without loss of compensation for a permanent employee required to take the Class A and/or B commercial driver's license examination and related medical examination(s), provided:
a.	The examination is scheduled during the employee's scheduled work hours; and
b.	The examination does not interfere with the operational needs of the department.
2.	If the employee's examination is rescheduled by the examining physician or by DMV, the employee shall be granted reasonable release time for the subsequent date, in accordance with the requirements specified above.
3.	Upon ten (10) workdays advance notice the department will allow the employee to use a State owned or leased vehicle or equipment appropriate for the Class A and/or Class B commercial driver's license examination. It is understood by the parties that use of the equipment or vehicle may be delayed for operational reasons.
21.4.11 Drug and Alcohol Testing
A.	Commercial Drivers’ License Holders
1.	Unit 11 employees whose job assignment requires them to have a commercial drivers’ license (CDL) are subject to drug and alcohol testing as defined in 49 CFR 382, et al.
2.	Employees who operate commercial vehicles seasonally as part of their required job duties for their employer may elect to deactivate their commercial driver status and remove themselves from the random testing pool by providing notice in writing to their employer at the end of each season of operating a commercial vehicle. Employees not electing to deactivate their commercial driver status for their employer will be deemed to continue to be available to operate a commercial vehicle for their employer and will remain subject to drug and alcohol testing under 49CFR382 et al and 49CFR40 et al. Employees who have received notice for a drug and alcohol test that was mailed or given to the employee prior to their employer’s receipt of the employee’s request to deactivate from commercial driver status must complete all such outstanding random tests.

BU 11
03-05
3.	The union and the State jointly encourage unit employees to seek counseling and treatment when appropriate for substance and alcohol abuse issues. Accordingly, an employee whose job duties do not require the employee to possess a CDL, and who requests to deactivate his/her CDL status and voluntarily utilizes the resources available to him/her in evaluating and resolving problems associated with the misuse of alcohol and the use of controlled substances, shall not be required to complete any outstanding random tests nor shall the employee be disciplined for exercising his/her rights under this section.
B.	Class C Drivers’ License Holders
Employees who operate State equipment requiring a class C drivers’ license are subject to reasonable suspicion drug and alcohol testing while on duty. Such testing will conform to the requirements and procedures of Department of Personnel Administration Rules 599.960, 599.962, 599.964, 599.965, and 599.966; 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 40, et al; and 49CFR Part 382, et al. Whenever the State’s rules are broader or are in direct conflict between State and Federal regulations, the State’s rules shall prevail.
C.	Miscellaneous Provisions Applying To CDL And Class C Drivers’ License Holders
1.	Notwithstanding section 5.10(b), the State shall only test for amphetamines and methamphetamines, cocaine, marijuana/cannabinoids (THC), opiates (narcotics), phencyclidine (PCP) and alcohol and shall use the cut-off levels for determining positive test results contained in 49CFR40 et al, and 49CFR382 et al.
2.	The State reserves full discretion to dismiss an employee for a first positive drug or alcohol test or for refusing to test. Employees so dismissed, except those on probation, shall have an opportunity to stipulate to a last-chance agreement. This opportunity may not extend to cases in which the employee has a past adverse action history or in which the positive test or refusal to test occurs in conjunction with a serious offense which in itself would result in dismissal. Serious offenses include but are not limited to workplace violence, acts that result in personal injury, acts that result in significant property damage, etc.
Last-chance agreements shall include a provision which requires an employee’s evaluation by a substance abuse professional as referenced in 49CFR382.605 and follow-up testing after returning to duty. The State will pay for the substance abuse professional’s evaluation and counseling by the same substance abuse professional when it is obtained through a State contract provider. While participating in rehabilitation as recommended by the substance abuse professional and with prior approval of the employer, employees may use accrued sick leave, vacation, annual leave, compensatory time off, or other accrued paid leave. Employees who have insufficient leave credits may use unpaid leave for the duration of this rehabilitation period.
3.	At the employee’s request, the State shall send the second portion of the split urine specimen (Sample B) to another certified drug testing laboratory of the employee’s choice, and the state shall pay for the test when the test of Sample B fails to confirm the test of Sample A.

4.	Employees who appeal a drug- or alcohol-related adverse action or reject on probation to the State Personnel Board shall automatically be deemed to have withdrawn with prejudice any related grievance filed pursuant to Article 6 of this contract and shall have no right to file any additional grievances related to the adverse action or rejection on probation. A grievance filed pursuant to this Article shall be filed with the department head or his/her designee within thirty (30) days after the Skelly Officer’s decision. In the event the grievance is denied and not settled by the parties within ten (10) working days from the date of its filing, the union may invoke the procedures in Article 6 to select an arbitrator. Adverse actions or rejections on probation may be arbitrated only after the grievant signs an express waiver of all rights to appeal the action or rejection to the State Personnel Board. In arbitration’s involving adverse actions, the arbitrator shall determine if just cause exists and, if not, the appropriate remedy. Grievants arbitrating a rejection on probation shall have the burden of going forward and the burden of proof.

This side letter is binding on the State and CSEA Units 1, 4 and 11 and intended as an addendum to Units 1, 4 and 11 MOUs for the duration of the contracts.
Side Letter #9 - Mitigation
Section 4.10 of the Budget Act recognizes that the Budget Bill approved by the Senate does not provide funds for employee compensation increases that may become effective during the 2003-04 fiscal year, and grants the Director of Finance authority to reduce and reallocate appropriations in the Budget Act in order to ensure the integrity of the 2003 Budget.

A.	The following differentials shall be paid to Water Resources Technician IIs (WR TECH IIs) in the Department of Water Resources (DWR) who qualify under the criteria stated herein.
1.	WR TECH IIs having 60 months of WR TECH II tenure and are at the top step of the WR TECH II level shall receive a monthly salary differential of $424.
2.	WR TECH IIs having completed 15 semester or equivalent college units, as approved by DWR and who have 12 months tenure at the WR TECH II level, shall receive a monthly salary differential of $424. The fifteen additional semester or equivalent units must be in a science, mathematics, or engineering curriculum of one of the college degrees referenced in Attachment A. College courses taken at a community college must be transferable to either a California State University or a University of California institution and fulfill course requirements for one of their degree programs referenced in Attachment A.
3.	WR TECH IIs who hold a four -year college degree in a DWR approved field of study per Attachment A and have 12 months tenure at the WR TECH II level , shall receive a monthly salary differential of $636.
142
BU 11
03-05
B.	WR TECH IIs assigned to a DWR field assignment will receive a $241 per month differential provided they have served for 24 consecutive months in a DWR field assignment after having reached the top step of WR TECH II and have completed the 80-hour course in Water Resources Engineering Technology. Management will schedule each eligible employee’s attendance in the 80-hour course in Water Resources Engineering Technology within 24 months of their appointment to a DWR field assignment at the WR TECH II level. A DWR assignment is defined as a permanent assignment to field work outside the office over fifty percent (50%) of the time.
C.	WRT IIs assigned to a DWR field assignment prior to the date this assignment is signed who have not completed the 82-hour course in Water Resources Engineering Technology but otherwise meet this differential’s eligibility criteria shall receive the differential. They will be scheduled to participate in the 80-hour course in Water Resources Engineering Technology as soon as possible.
D.	Counting base pay and Differentials 1 and 2, no WR TECH II may earn more than the top step of the salary of the Engineer, Water Resources, Range C. The State Controller’s Office will calculate the amounts of the differentials and automatically limit paid pursuant this section.
E.	Differentials 1(a), 1(b), and 1(c) “permanent” in that they shall apply to qualifying WR TECH II employees unless the differential is removed by adverse action. Regarding Differentials 1(a), 1(b), and 1(c), employees may receive only one of these three differentials at any time.
F.	Differential 2 is independent from differentials 1(a), 1(b), and 1(c). It is “permanent” so long as the qualifying WR TECH II remains assigned in a qualifying DWR field assignment, unless the differential is removed by adverse action. Payment of Differential 2 ceases when the employee leaves the DWR field assignment.
G.	A WR TECH II who previously received Differential 2 and lost it due to leaving the qualifying DWR field assignment will have the differential restored upon returning to a DWR assignment, provided that the employee satisfies the differential’s qualifications. Such employee returning to a DWR assignment will not, therefore, have to satisfy the 24 month continuous tenure requirement of A. 2 again.
H.	Qualifying WR TECH IIs may receive both Differential 1 (a, or b, or c) and Differential 2 simultaneously, subject to the limitations of item B above.
I.	Both Differential 1 (a through c) and Differential 2 will count as salary for purposes of retirement, overtime, and benefit payment calculations.
J.	It is the intent if the parties to reach a tentative agreement on a pay differential for WR TECH IIs which will replace Article 13.911 New Water Resources Technician Classification provisions of the January 31, 2002 through July 2, 2003 Bargaining Unit 11 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). If WR TECH II CSEA members do not formally ratify the WRT II pay differential proposal, then Article 13.9.11 provisions shall remain in effect and the WR TECH pay differential will not become effective.
K.	If ratified, differentials will be paid to qualifying employees retroactively to the pay period when they meet the qualifications. No differentials will be granted to the July 2002 pay period.

ADDENDUM I
Time off for Victims of Domestic Violence
State of California
M E M O R A N D U M
DATE: June 20, 2001
TO:	PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT LIAISONS	REFERENCE CODE: 2001-025
THIS MEMORANDUM SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO:
Employee Relations Officers Personnel Officers
FROM:	Department of Personnel Administration
Policy Development Office
SUBJECT:	Time Off for Victims of Domestic Violence
CONTACT:	Charlotte Gehringer, Personnel Management Analyst
(916)323-6938 FAX: (916) 324-9393
Email: CharlotteGehringer@dpa.ca.gov
The purpose of this memo is to notify departments of an addition to existing law regarding time off for an employee who is a victim of domestic violence.
Effective January 1, 2001, Assembly Bill 2357 added Section 230.1 to the Labor Code to specify that employers with 25 or more employees may not discharge or in any manner discriminate or retaliate against an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, as defined in Section 6211 of the Family Code, for taking time off to seek medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, obtain psychological counseling related to an experience of domestic violence, obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program, or rape crisis center, or to participate in safety planning to increase safety from future domestic violence.
As a condition for taking time off, the employee shall give the employer reasonable advance notice of the employee’s intention to take time off for any of the purposes summarized above, unless advance notice is not feasible. When an unscheduled absence occurs, the employer may require the employee to certify that the absence is a result of domestic violence in the form of a police report, a court order, or medical documentation. An employer would be required to maintain the confidentiality of any employee’s request for time off pursuant to provision of this law.

BU 11

PML 2001-025 June 20, 2001 Page 2
The law does not require an employer to compensate an employee for the time taken off under these circumstances, but the employee may use vacation, personal leave, or other compensating time off that is otherwise available to the employee.
An employee whose rights are violated under this section may be entitled to lost wages and reinstatement. An employer who willfully refuses to reinstate an employee under this section may be guilty of a misdemeanor. This law also allows an employee to file a complaint with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement of the Department of Industrial Relations.
This section does not create a right for an employee to take unpaid leave that exceeds the unpaid leave time allowed under, or in addition to the unpaid leave time permitted by, the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
The provisions of this bill apply to the State as an employer and to State employees. The entitlement of any employee under this law shall not be diminished by a collective bargaining agreement.
If you have any questions, please contact Charlotte Gehringer at (916) 323-6938.
