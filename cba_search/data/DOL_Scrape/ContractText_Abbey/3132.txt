An employee in a limited duration assignment can be either a new-hire or an existing regular status employee who is scheduled on a full-time or part-time basis, and who receives benefits and union representation per this agreement.

A regular employee serving a six (6) month period of trial service upon promotion to determine his or her suitability for continued employment in the classification to which he or she was promoted, such period to begin on the date of his or her appointment to a higher classification from a certified list of eligibles. During the period of promotional probation, the employee shall be returned to the classification and department from which he or she was promoted, without recourse to the grievance procedure, if, in the opinion of the employee’s supervisor, his or her continued service in the classification to which he or she was promoted would not be in the best interest of the County. Subject to management approval, the employee may elect to return to their previous Department and classification.
If a newly appointed employee is promoted during his or her initial twelve (12) month probationary period (hereinafter "initial probationary period"), his or her initial probationary period shall terminate twelve (12) months from the date the employee began work in the classification from which he or she was promoted. The promotion has no effect on the initial probationary period. The promotional probationary period extends six (6) months from the date of the promotion or until the end of the initial probationary period, whichever is later. During the initial probationary period, an employee may be terminated without just cause or appeal regardless of promotion. If an employee is terminated from his or her promotional position after completing his or her initial probationary period, he or she has return rights to the classification from which he or she promoted unless dismissed for just cause.
XIII.	Regular employee:

B.	A non-probationary employee who has been transferred to the County by intergovernmental agreement under ORS 236.610 through 236.650.
XIV.	Temporary employee:

A temporary appointment may be made for a period of up to six (6) months or one-thousand and forty (1040) hours within the preceding twelve (12) months. A temporary employee who has already worked one-thousand and forty (1040) hours may be appointed within the same twelve (12) month period to another position typically by a different Department, following a break in County service lasting fifteen (15) days or longer. A temporary employee may be re-appointed to a different position when an unforeseen circumstance requiring the employee's services arises shortly after the termination of one appointment, even when the break in service is limited. Temporary employees may be terminated at any time and have no appeal rights within the County.

five (5) working days in advance. The Union will make every effort to avoid disruptions of work. The Union shall reimburse the County for one hundred percent (100%) of the affected employees salary and fringe benefits (including pro-rata cost of workers compensation premiums, but excluding indirect administration or overhead charges) for straight time spent on Union activities conducted during regularly scheduled working hours. The County shall submit a monthly statement to the Union itemizing the amount of the Union’s reimbursement obligation, and may directly withdraw the amount required from a fund maintained with the County. Funds for this purpose shall be maintained in a separate interest-bearing account with an initial balance of twenty-two thousand dollars ($22,000) to be replenished within ten (10) days upon notice from the County Labor Relations Manager whenever the amount falls below two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500). If the County incurs liability arising from the activities of a member engaged in Union Business during such reimbursed time, the Union further agrees to reimburse the County for losses caused by such activities, to the extent that such losses are attributable to the acts of the employee receiving continued compensation pursuant to this section. In the event of a dispute over the causation or amount of loss attributable to the actions of Union agents, the parties agree to arbitrate such dispute under Article 18.III step 4, unless such arbitration is inconsistent with the provisions of any applicable third-party insurance indemnification agreement, or unless binding arbitration might jeopardize the availability of coverage by a third-party insurer. County employees participating in such activities will be allowed to do so without loss of pay.
3.	Union Business (Unpaid) Leave:
Employees selected by the Union for such activities that are considered political activities including political training, conferences, committees, or appointments, and time off to work on an election race are considered Union Business (Unpaid) Leave. Employees requesting such time off under this section would be governed by the notice requirements and time limits, unless mutually agreed otherwise, of Union Reimbursable Time.
F.	Union Business Leave - Employment Status:
Employees in Union Business Leave County Paid time and Union Reimbursable time shall be treated as in paid leave status regarding accrual of benefits such as vacation, sick leave, Health and Welfare, pension or any other benefit granted employees in paid leave status.
During Union Reimbursable Time, the employee shall not be eligible for County workers compensation benefits arising out of an injury or illness occurring during the leave from the County.
G.	Visits by Union representatives
The County agrees that accredited representatives of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, whether local Union representatives, Staff Representatives, or International representatives, upon reasonable and proper introduction, shall have reasonable access to the premises of the County at any time during working hours to conduct Union business. The Union agrees that such visits will

D.	Leave:

III.	Holiday Pay
A.	An employee required to work on an observed holiday will be compensated at one-and-one-half (1 %) times his or her regular rate of pay for the hours worked during the observed holiday for which the employee was eligible for holiday leave. Any additional hours will be paid at the regular rate of pay. The employee will also be granted the number of hours of leave to which he/she was eligible. The employee may elect to accumulate such leave as Saved Holiday time subject to the provisions of “Section I” above, or be paid at the employee's regular rate of pay. The election must be submitted by the employee in writing to his or her immediate supervisor on the forms so provided.
B.	Subject to supervisory approval, an employee whose regular day off falls on the officially observed holiday and whose observed holiday, pursuant to Section II.A-C above, falls on a regular work day, may voluntarily change the day of his/her observed holiday within the pay period in which the holiday falls, or may elect to be credited with saved holiday time in lieu of Section III.A above. All requests must be in writing and submitted to the employee’s supervisor prior to the date on which the employee wishes to observe the holiday.

iii.	whenever the County can articulate reasonable cause to believe that a misuse or abuse of sick leave has occurred, including questionable usage, questionable patterns of usage or calling in sick on a previously denied day off, provided the employee has been previously notified by a supervisor or Human Resources representative that, due to such concerns, future verification may be required. Employees notified of such reasonable cause may be required to furnish certification as referenced above for each use of sick leave for a period not to exceed six (6) months following the notice;
iv.	when the employee has called in sick five (5) or more times for separate events in any six (6) month period, regardless of how the time is charged and the employee has been notified by a supervisor or Human Resources representative that such verification will be required for a period up to six (6) months following the notice.
2.	Discipline
Subject to the limitations of law, including but not limited to those of the FMLA, discipline may be imposed under the following conditions:
a.	Abuse of sick leave
Misuse of leave, violation of orders, directives, or contractual requirements concerning the use of sick leave and other forms of leave used in lieu of sick leave are cause for disciplinary action.
b.	Use of accrued sick leave
i.	Use of accrued sick leave, without abuse of such leave, will not be cause for discipline.
ii.	When the intermittent use of accrued sick leave or other paid or unpaid leave used in lieu of sick leave interferes significantly with an employee’s ability to perform the duties of his or her job, management may do the following (subject to the requirements of law, including, but not limited to, the FMLA):
(a)	require the employee to take continuous leave; or
(b)	change the employee’s work assignment for six (6) months or until use of intermittent leave ends, whichever comes sooner; in such cases the provisions of Article 22 will not apply.
c.	Excessive absenteeism
The parties recognize that every employee has a duty to be reliably present at work, and that failure to confine sick leave usage to accrued and available sick leave raises the possibility of discipline for excessive absenteeism. Such cases, however, are subject to just cause review and require systematic examination of relevant factors, including but not limited to:
i.	Any legal requirements, including, but not limited to those of the FMLA or the ADA.

ii.	The tenure and work history of the employee, specifically to include whether there have been previous instances of this pattern of absenteeism.
iii.	Whether there is a likelihood of improvement within a reasonable period of time based on credible medical evidence.
iv.	The particular attendance requirements of the employee’s job.
v.	The pattern of use, and whether the absences are clearly for bona fide sick leave purposes.
C.	Sequencing of Leaves
The use of vacation leave, saved holiday time, compensatory time, and leave without pay is subject to approval by management according to the requirements of Articles 8, 7, 14, and 10, respectively. However, unless otherwise required by law, forms of leave shall be used and exhausted in the following sequences:
1.	Leave for illness or injury, that does not qualify for FMLA will
be taken in the following order:
a.	Sick leave until it is exhausted;
b.	Vacation leave, saved holiday time, or compensatory time, sequenced at the employee’s option, until they are exhausted;
c.	Leave without pay.
2.	Leave that qualifies under FMLA will be taken in the following order:
Paid leave until it is exhausted; employees will determine what order paid leave is used;
3.	Leave for other purposes will be taken in the following order:
a.	Vacation leave, saved holiday time, or compensatory time, sequenced at the employee’s option (to the extent allowed by vacation sign-up provisions) until they are exhausted;
b.	Leave without pay
D.	Limitations on the Use of Leave Without Pay in Lieu of Sick Leave
Use of leave without pay in lieu of sick leave for non-FMLA and nonOFLA qualifying conditions is subject to the approval of management and further subject to the following provisions:
1.	Continuous leave
In the event of a continuous leave of absence without pay in excess of any legal requirement of the FMLA or OFLA, the County may require from the employee’s physician, and/or arrange for the employee to see a physician selected by the County to examine the employee and provide a statement of the disability, current condition, and the anticipated length of current absence. If the County requires the employee to see a physician it has selected, it will pay the costs. If deemed necessary by the County, such an examination shall be repeated every thirty (30) days. If management determines that continued leave would not be in the best interest of the County, then any resulting termination would be subject to review under the just cause standard as to the

reasonableness of this determination. Following six (6) months of leave without pay, to include time spent on unpaid FMLA and/or OFLA leave, any extension of the leave shall be deemed permissive on the part of the County and if the employee’s leave is not extended, and the employee does not return to work, the employee will be deemed to have resigned.
2.	Intermittent leave
Intermittent leave without pay used in lieu of sick leave is not subject to the six (6) month entitlement provided for above. When such leave significantly affects an employee’s job performance and is not subject to the requirements of law (including but not limited to the FMLA), management may evaluate the employee’s use of leave according to the criteria of “Section B.2.c” above. Medical information as provided for in “Section D.1” above may be required for the evaluation. After completing the evaluation management may do one of the following:
a.	Approve a similar pattern of intermittent use of unpaid leave for a specified period followed by another evaluation; or
b.	Put the employee on a work plan to manage the use of leave without pay, followed by disciplinary action if the plan is not successfully completed; or
c.	Proceed with the disciplinary process.
E.	Use of Paid Leave in Counting FMLA/OFLA Eligibility
Only actual hours worked will be counted when reviewing the number of hours worked to determine if an employee meets the minimum hours worked eligibility requirements to be covered under FMLA and/or OFLA. Paid time off (such as vacation leave, sick leave, and comp-time taken) does not count toward FMLA and OFLA eligibility requirements.
F.	When an employee has been certified for continuous FMLA and/or OFLA leave of three (3) months or less, the employee’s position will only be filled on a temporary basis during that period.
III.	Fitness for Duty
The parties recognize that employees have the responsibility to report to work fit for duty. To ensure such fitness, management may send employees for medical or psychological examination when the supervisor reasonably believes that the employee is not fit for duty or may be a danger to themselves or others. Any such examinations will be at County expense.
IV.	Disability Insurance and Catastrophic Leave
A. Disability Insurance
1.	Short term disability
Any full-time employee covered by this Agreement may participate in the short term disability insurance program developed by the Union and the County (consistent with carrier contract(s)), the monthly premium to be paid individually through payroll deduction.
2.	Long term disability

a.	All bargaining unit employees will be covered by a County-paid group long term disability insurance policy, the provisions of which will be the same as those in the UNUM group policy available to Multnomah County employees.
b.	The County will pay for COBRA medical and dental insurance coverage for a period of up to six months beyond the month in which benefits would normally terminate for an employee with an approved long-term disability claim. Members must complete and return the COBRA enrollment form as required by law in order to receive premium payments by the County. However, employees who "opt out" of benefits coverage under the provisions of Article 11, “Section I.D” of this Agreement will not be eligible for continued County-paid coverage under this subsection.
c.	If proposed by management and approved by the Union, changes in short term and long term disability insurance coverage will be put into effect.
B. Catastrophic Leave Program
The Parties recognize that a Catastrophic Leave Program has been implemented which allows the donation of vacation leave, compensatory time, and saved holiday time to ill or injured employees who have exhausted all paid leave. This program may be terminated only subject to the terms and conditions of the implementing Ordinance.
V. Recall of Laid Off Employees
Employees who were laid off from County employment or are serving in a temporary or on-call position following layoff will have their sick leave balance restored when they are recalled from layoff.

I.	Unpaid Leaves of Absence
A.	Use of Leave
Leaves of absence without pay for a period of up to six (6) months may be granted by an employee’s supervisor for any reasonable purpose. The sequencing of the use of all leaves, to include leaves of absence without pay, is specified in Article 9, “Section II.C”. A separate standard for granting any leave of absence for sick leave purposes is specified in Article 9, “Section II.D”. Any time spent on unpaid FMLA or OFLA leave shall be deducted from the six (6) month period specified above. Extensions of such leaves may be granted solely at the discretion of the supervisor.
B.	Failure to Return from Leave
Except where otherwise provided by law, any employee who has been granted a leave of absence and fails to return to work within five (5) days after the expiration of said leave, shall be considered to have voluntarily resigned his or her position. However, if an employee provides evidence that he or she was unable to contact the County to request a leave extension on the date of, or subsequent to, the last day of the leave, the County shall rescind the employee's resignation. Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit application of Article 17, Disciplinary Action, in cases of absence without leave of less than five (5) days.
II.	Judicial Leave
A.	Jury Duty
1.	An employee shall be granted leave with full pay in lieu of jury fees on any scheduled day of work he or she is required to report for jury duty, if upon receipt the employee submits jury fees to Payroll. (Employees do not have to submit mileage and parking reimbursements.)
2.	Except during an emergency or due to operational requirements, the County will not require employees to report to work after completing a full day on jury duty, provided that if an employee is required to work over, any time spent on jury duty shall not be considered time worked for calculating overtime liability.
3.	An employee who is excused or dismissed from jury duty before the end of the day will report back to work if practicable.
4.	An employee may be scheduled to work Monday through Friday, eight (8) hours per day, on day shift, for the duration of jury duty with less than ten (10) days notice. An employee may also be returned to his or her pre-jury duty schedule with less than ten (10) days notice after jury duty ends. There shall be no additional cost to the County or days off for an employee as a result of any such schedule change.

c.	The employee submits witness fees to Payroll upon
receipt.
2.	Under no circumstances will employees be paid for time spent in a judicial proceeding or hearing in which they or their union is the plaintiff or the defendant, unless they are being defended and indemnified by the County for conduct occurring during the course of employment.
C.	Merit System Council Hearings
Time spent as a plaintiff or witness at a Merit System Council hearing will be treated as time worked to the extent that it occurs during regularly scheduled working hours.
III.	Military Leave
The County acknowledges its obligation under state and federal law to grant paid and unpaid leave for military training and service. Information about legally mandated military leave will be made available to employees upon request from the Department Human Resources unit.
IV.	Bereavement Leave
An employee shall be granted not more than three (3) days leave of absence with full pay in event of death in the immediate family or immediate household of the employee to make household adjustments or to attend funeral services. If such funeral is beyond three-hundred and fifty (350) miles, the employee shall be granted additional time for travel not to exceed three (3) additional days with pay. The amount of additional leave shall be at the discretion of his or her supervisor on the basis of the employee’s travel and personal needs. With sufficient advance notice, bereavement leave days may be taken non-consecutively provided they are taken within thirteen (13) months from the date of first use.
For purposes of Bereavement Leave, an employee's immediate family shall be defined as the employee’s spouse or domestic partner or the employee’s, spouse’s or domestic partner’s:
A:	parents

In relationships other than those set forth above, under exceptional circumstances, such leave of absence may be granted by the Department director, Sheriff, or District Attorney, or their designee(s), upon request. Employees may request additional bereavement leave in accordance with “Section I” of this article.
V.	Personnel Examinations/Interviews
Employees shall be given paid time off for participating in County examinations and interviews for promotion, demotion, or transfer which occur during their regularly scheduled shift. However, paid time off will be restricted to examinations and interviews for five (5) positions per fiscal year.
VI.	Inclement Weather and Natural Disasters Policy
The County reserves the right to establish policy with respect to attendance at work during inclement weather or a natural disaster, and further reserves the right to determine whether or not an event qualifies as such an event under the terms of any such policy. If such policy references “essential employees”, a list of Local 88 represented positions and/or classifications from each Department who are so defined shall be provided to the Union annually. The list, however, is subject to change as the County reserves the right to determine which positions and/or classifications are essential employees. Any time an employee is unable to be at work as scheduled due to such an event, may, at the employee’s discretion, be charged to:
A.	Vacation leave
B.	Saved holiday time
C.	Compensatory time
D.	Leave without pay
Provided, further, however, that an employee who attempts to get to work in such a County declared event, but is unavoidably delayed, shall not have time charged to one (1) of the above categories unless he or she is two (2) or more hours late, in which event all time late will be charged. The provisions of Article 13, “Section II, Right to Compensation for Regularly Scheduled Hours” will apply to instances in which employees report to work to a closed facility, or are otherwise specifically notified by the County that their facility is closed, and the employee is not reassigned.

B. Health Care Plan Changes During the Term of Agreement
1.	The Union and the County recognize the increasing costs of health care to be a major concern. In an effort to collaborate over quality health plans, design changes and increasing costs, the established Employee Benefit Team (EBT) will continue to meet to review and approve non-mandated proposed changes in plan designs, changes in plans offered, or changes in carriers, prior to implementation for the following plan year. Meetings will continue on a regular basis, except during the period when the parties are bargaining a new agreement. Changes in plans or plan designs which are mandated by carriers, and which cannot be resolved by the EBT, shall be subject to notice and expedited bargaining obligations consistent with applicable law. Changes in plans or plan design changes which are mandated due to Federal or State laws, rules, or regulations shall be presented to the EBT but will be implemented by the County as required by law.
2.	During the term of this agreement, the EBT shall in good faith, discuss means to reduce health care costs. The parties agree that the following subjects shall be discussed by the EBT:
a.	Engagement of a health care consultant(s) with experience in public-sector health care cost reduction;
b.	Expansion and/or redesign of the Employee Wellness Programs;

c.	Assessment of consolidation of the two lower-cost plans available to Part-time employees (“ODS Major Medical Plan” and “Kaiser Maintenance Medical Plan”) into a single plan; and
d.	Examine feasibility of designing a pro-rated benefit plan premium-sharing structure linked to FTE.
C.	Premium Calculations
For Kaiser Plans, the premium charges shall be the amount charged by Kaiser to the County. For the ODS plans, the premium charges shall be calculated, using sound actuarial principles, and include projected claim costs based on plan experience as required by state regulations, IBNR expenses, Oregon Medical Insurance Pool assessments, pharmaceutical claim expenses, stop-loss premiums, third-party benefit plan administration costs, and an appropriate trend factor selected to limit County contributions and employee cost shares while providing adequate funding for plan operations.
If a government agency or other taxing authority imposes or increases a tax or other charge upon the County’s Medical and/or Dental benefit plans(s) or any activity of the plan(s), the County may increase the appropriate premium(s) to include the new or increased tax or charge.
D.	Employee Contribution
Employee’s contributions will be made through payroll deductions. Enrollment in a County sponsored medical benefit plan coverage and associated employee contribution is mandatory for employees who do not “Opt Out” of medical benefit plan coverage.
E.	Opt-Out of Medical Plan Benefits
1.	Employees may elect to Opt Out of the County’s medical benefit plan coverage by making that election on their Benefit Enrollment form. Employees making such election must provide proof of other group medical benefit plan coverage in order to make the Opt Out election. Employees will not be eligible to change their election until the County’s official annual open enrollment period, unless the employee experiences an IRS recognized family status change event that would allow a mid-year health plan election change or qualifies for Special Enrollment under HIPAA.
2.	Full-Time Employees Who Opt Out.
Full-Time employees who Opt Out of medical benefit plan coverage will receive a reimbursement paid by the County of two-hundred and fifty dollars ($250) (gross) per month.
3.	Three-Quarter Time Employees who Opt Out.
Three-Quarter Time employees who Opt Out of medical benefit plan coverage will receive a reimbursement paid by the County of one-hundred-eighty-seven dollars and fifty cents ($187.50) (gross) per month.
4.	Half-time Employees who Opt Out.
Half-Time employees who Opt Out of medical benefit plan coverage will receive a reimbursement paid by the County of one-hundred-twenty-five dollars ($125) (gross) per month.

5.	Employees may also elect to decline dental plan coverage through the County. However, there is no reimbursement associated with declining dental coverage and no proof of other dental coverage is required. Employees will not be eligible to change this election until the County’s official annual open enrollment period unless the employee experiences an IRS-recognized family status change event that would allow a mid-year health plan election change or qualifies for Special Enrollment under HIPAA.
F.	Successor Plans and Carriers
In the event that any of the current benefit plans become unavailable, the County agrees to provide to affected employees a substitute plan for the same service delivery type, if available, at substantially the same or better benefit levels. If a plan or carrier is discontinued and no substitute plan is available of the same service delivery type, the employee will be offered the option to enroll in an alternative service delivery plan.
If the County chooses to change from a plan or carrier which is still available, the County agrees that the overall existing level of benefits for each plan will not be reduced.
G.	Premium Reimbursement for Part-time Employees
1.	Reimbursement Eligibility
Three-Quarter Time and Half-Time employees shall be eligible for premium reimbursement if they work the minimum required number of hours for each of at least four (4), but not more than twelve (12) consecutive pay periods. The four (4) or more pay periods used for calculation are considered a single qualifying block of time. The four (4) or more consecutive pay period block shall only be applied to one reimbursement request. Changes to a submitted reimbursement request will be considered only if a submitted payroll period is determined to be ineligible.
2.	Hours Required for Reimbursement
a.	For purposes of this calculation, Full-Time is defined as the total number of regular hours in a pay period for an employee scheduled to work Monday through Friday, eight (8) hours per day.
b.	“Work” for purposes of this section is defined as regular hours worked, and any paid time such as holiday, vacation or sick time. It is recognized that an employee may occasionally and inadvertently work overtime hours while working additional shifts to qualify for a reimbursement. Therefore, a maximum of three (3) overtime hours in any pay period will be considered time worked for purposes of reimbursement calculations.
c.	Hours required for Three-Quarter Time reimbursements and Full-Time reimbursements per pay period will be calculated according to the chart below.

Employees who submit an enrollment form after the first (1st) day of the month following hire, but within thirty-one (31) days of hire, will be covered the first (1st) day of the month following date completed enrollment forms are received by Employee Benefits Office. Employees who do not submit an enrollment form within thirty-one (31) days of hire will be enrolled based on the default enrollment procedure. Coverage under the default plan(s) will begin on the first (1st) day of the month following thirty-one (31) days of employment.

3. Employees on unpaid leaves of absence
a.	Leaves of less than thirty (30) days

iii.	During unpaid OFLA leave only, the County will not contribute toward medical or dental benefit plan coverage.
c.	Non-FMLA Unpaid Leaves
i.	Lapsing of County-subsidized coverage

II.	Seniority
A.	The period of time that an employee is off the job and unable to work by reason of a disability compensable under the Workers' Compensation Law shall not interrupt his or her continued period of employment with reference to accrual of seniority unless the employee's health care provider, the State Workers' Compensation Department or Board certifies to the County in writing that the employee will be permanently disabled to such an extent that he or she will be unable to return to the County and fully perform the duties of the position he or she last occupied.
B.	If an employee is transferred to another classification because of a compensable injury, his or her seniority shall be governed in accordance with Article 21, Seniority and Layoff. In such event the employee's status shall be governed exclusively by applicable state statutes related to re-employment and non-discrimination.
C.	If an injured employee has been released by his or her attending physician to return to the job at injury, he or she will be reinstated to that position if eligible under the provisions of ORS 659.043, or its successor; provided that such reinstatement shall not violate the seniority rights, as contained elsewhere in this Agreement, of any other employee.

C.	If an employee's Workers' Compensation claim is under appeal, and he or she is no longer entitled to medical/dental coverage under Article 11, Health and Welfare, he or she will be entitled to continued coverage under federal COBRA law. The duration of such coverage will be for six (6) months or the legally mandated period, whichever is greater, provided that the employee continues to be eligible and pays the premiums as required.
D.	If a denied claim is later held compensable upon appeal, the employee will be entitled to:
1.	Reimbursement of any premiums paid to the County for medical/dental benefits, and
2.	Any supplemental benefits not paid in accordance with “Section IV” of this Article.
VI.	Benefits
A.	The County shall continue to provide medical and dental benefits for an employee with a compensable claim and his or her dependent(s) from the first day of occupational disability, subject to the limitations of Article 11, Health and Welfare, if any, for a period of one (1) year or such longer period as may be required by law.
B.	The County shall continue to make retirement contributions, based upon the appropriate percentage of the gross dollar amount of supplemental benefits paid, throughout the period that the employee receives such benefits.

is four (4) or five (5) consecutive days beginning at 12:01 a.m. Monday and ending on the following Sunday at 12:00 midnight. Nine-Eighty’s (9-80s) would be considered an alternate work week schedule. Article 7 governing holiday observance will apply.
2.	Employees working less than 40 hours per week
Employees working less than forty (40) hours per week will be scheduled to work no more than five (5) days a week, and at least two (2) of their days off must be consecutive.
B. Changing Scheduled Days of Work and Days Off
1.	Voluntary changes
a.	Changes of work days and days off will be considered voluntary if they occur at the employee’s request or as a result of shift bidding. During the fourteen (14) day period following the transition from one schedule of work days and days off to another, the provisions of “Section III.A “ above will not apply, and, for example, the employee may have split days off.
b.	Shift Trading
Shift trading within Departments defined as trading time, hour, for hour, shall be allowed provided that:
i.	Exchanges do not conflict with a department’s operational needs;
ii.	Exchanges do not require involuntary scheduling changes on the part of other employees;
iii.	Exchanges do not make the County liable for OT under the FLSA.
Departments will develop procedures for requesting, approving, and tracking shift trades, subject to approval of the County HR Director.

a.	Employees who are scheduled to work more than five (5) days in a row without a day off will be paid at the time-and-a-half rate for all hours worked on the sixth (6th) and subsequent days until their next scheduled day off. Days worked immediately prior to the transition period will be included in the five (5) day requirement of this subsection.
b.	No employee normally scheduled to work forty (40) hours per week shall be paid for less than eighty (80) hours in a semimonthly pay period as a result of the application of the provisions of this subsection, except that in the second pay period in February this minimum shall be seventy (70) hours.

more hours in a work day and who works two (2) hours beyond his or her regular quitting time is entitled to a second meal period.
2.	Unpaid meal periods
Meal periods are on unpaid time unless the provisions of “Subsection 3” below apply.
a.	Length of the meal period
Employees will be scheduled for a thirty (30) minute meal period unless they request and management approves a one (1) hour meal period. Management may rescind approval for a one (1) hour meal period, subject to the provisions for changing work schedules in “Section I” above.

Management may assign employees performing duties which do not lend themselves to duty free breaks and meal periods to a continuous duty schedule. Any such assignment shall be in writing with a copy provided to the Union and the Labor Relations Manager. Meal periods for such employees will be on paid time. The scheduling of meal periods and breaks for affected employees will be based solely on management’s judgment of the need for supervision of clients or involvement in other continuous duty, or may be on an “as time is available” basis. Continuous duty employees may not be relieved of duty during their work day, and may have to take their meals and their breaks while supervising clients or attending to other duties. Any meal periods or breaks may be interrupted or missed without additional compensation.
b.	Temporary assignment
If an employee who normally works a non-continuous schedule is assigned to provide relief for a continuous duty post and that assignment includes the time of the relief employee’s normally scheduled meal period, it will be treated as a paid period following the conditions of “Section IV.C.3.a” above.
D.	Clean-Up Time
Employees occupying labor, trades or craft positions, or whenever it is essential for other employees to clean up or change clothes before being presentable upon leaving work, shall be granted not more than a fifteen (15) minute personal clean-up time prior to the end of each shift. The County shall provide the required facilities for the employee's clean-up time. Neither party to this Agreement shall construe "clean-up time" to mean "quit-early time" or "leave-early time".

V. Flexible Work Schedules
A.	Exceptions to the Requirements of This Article
Greater flexibility in work scheduling than is otherwise provided for in this article, which benefits employees and the County, may be implemented, provided that such schedules are in writing, and are agreed upon by the Union and the Labor Relations Manager. A copy of any such agreed upon schedules shall be provided to all directly affected employees.
B.	Employee Requests for Substitution of Hours Within a Work Week
Employees may request to work fewer hours than scheduled on one (1) day in an FLSA work week and make up for those hours by working an equivalent number of additional hours on another day or days in the same FLSA work week. Such scheduling is subject to the approval of management, and regardless of any other provisions of this Agreement, will not result in overtime pay.
C.	Changes in Work Schedules During the Term of the Agreement
1.	Assessment of Alternative Schedule Options
The Union and the County recognize that flexible or alternative schedule arrangements are of interest to both parties. In an effort to expand access to flexible schedule options, while still meeting County business needs, the parties agree to establish an ad hoc joint labor-management Alternative Schedules Team of ten (10) members, five (5) appointed by each party, to which the parties will submit the development of expanded access to flexible or alternative scheduling options, including a defined process for employee requests and supervisor approval of alternative schedule options. The parties agree that the Alternative Schedules Team shall first meet no later than sixty (60) days after ratification of this agreement and shall meet at least monthly.
2.	Review and Approval of Schedule Requests
To be considered for an alternative schedule option, an employee shall submit a written request to his or her supervisor; the employee’s otherwise-assigned schedule shall be the default unless an alternative is requested and approved. An employee’s request for an alternative schedule option shall be approved unless the supervisor indicates that it would interfere with County business needs, including but not limited to work requirements or employee performance or misconduct concerns. Denial shall not be arbitrary or capricious, and may be appealed to the Department Director; determination of the County’s business needs shall be at the Director’s sole discretion.
VI.	Job Sharing
A.	The intent of a job share position is that two (2) employees voluntarily
share the duties and responsibilities of one full time position in a single classification. Employees may request to share a position. Approval of job sharing is at the discretion of management. Each employee in the job share position must sign a job share agreement outlining the terms of the job share and be scheduled for forty (40) hours during two (2) work weeks.
B.	The County will develop a personnel rule and model agreement on job

sharing in consultation with the Union.
C.	Leave and Holiday Pay
Job sharing employees will be treated as part-time employees for purposes of holiday, leaves, pay, and health and welfare.
D.	Job Share Vacancy.
If one (1) job share employee vacates the position, the County determines whether the position should continue as a job share. The remaining employee has the right to assume the position on a full-time basis. If the position continues as a job share, the vacant half of the position will be filled using the department procedure.
E.	If the position does not continue as a job share, and the remaining employee does not assume the position full time, then the remaining employee may elect to transfer to a vacant position in the same classification or to voluntarily demote to a vacant position for which he/she is qualified. If the above conditions are not available or not acceptable, the employee would be subject to layoff.
VII.	Uniform Time Charging Provisions
A.	Rounding Rule
Time charged for all leaves and compensation for time worked under the terms of this Agreement shall be subject to rounding to the nearest quarter of an hour in accordance with the following rules:
0 - 7 minutes rounds to 0 hours
8 - 15 minutes rounds to 1/4 hour
B.	Applications
1.	Lateness
Employees who are less then eight (8) minutes late are not required to make up the missed minutes and shall be paid for a full shift without charge to a leave account. Employees who are more than eight (8) minutes late may be charged paid leave for time late or may be allowed to flex time at the manager's discretion. An employee who starts work after their start time is considered to be late. Being late to work can be grounds for discipline up to and including dismissal.
2.	Working over
An employee who works over less than eight (8) minutes shall not be compensated. An employee who works eight (8) to fifteen (15) minutes over shall be compensated one quarter (1/4) of an hour at the appropriate rate of pay in accordance with Article 14, Compensation.
3.	Leaves
Late and early return from leaves shall be subject to the same rounding practice as specified above.
4.	Work day
The above provisions shall not be construed as a right for management to extend the end of the working day beyond the normally scheduled ending time.

I.	Wage Adjustments
A.	July 1, 2011
Effective July 1, 2011 the rates and ranges of employees covered by this Agreement shall be increased one and two-tenths percent (1.2%). Employees covered by this Agreement shall be compensated in accordance with the wage schedule attached to this Agreement as Addendum A, Classifications, Rates & Ranges which by this reference is incorporated herein.
B.	July 1, 2012
Effective July 1, 2012 the rates and ranges of employees covered by this Agreement shall be increased by zero percent (0%). As such, the pay rates and ranges will remain in effect for this period. However, employees covered by the CBA will be eligible for step increases during this period in accordance with Article 15 (Classifications and Pay Ranges), Section II.B (Step Increases).
C.	July 1, 2013
Effective July 1, 2013 the rates and ranges of employees covered by this Agreement shall be increased by an amount equal to the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (Portland CPI-W 2nd Half, second half of 2011 to the second half of 2012 as reported in February 2013) with a minimum of one percent (1.0%) to a maximum of a four percent (4.0%).
D.	Market Adjustments for Selected Classifications
There is a joint understanding by the parties that market forces continue to have a variable effect on the relative market standing of many of the classifications in the bargaining unit. The County and the Union recognize the need for a fair and equitable compensation system and therefore agree to review market data and negotiate compensation for selected classifications every two (2) years, beginning in calendar year 2010, using the process outlined below:
1.	The parties shall each appoint a negotiating team of up to five (5) representatives no later than April 1 of each even-numbered year. No later than July 1, the teams shall agree to a list of classifications to be reviewed for possible market adjustments. The parties will review a minimum of ten (10) classifications and a maximum of thirty (30) classifications, provided that the number of employees covered by the selected classifications shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of regular employees in the bargaining unit. Any classifications agreed to which are part of a series shall include all classifications in the series and each classification within the series shall count towards the total number of classifications to be reviewed.
2.	If the parties are unable to reach agreement on the list of selected classifications by close of business July 1, and the total number of classifications

Any strike of a classification that is part of a series shall constitute a strike of the entire series. The party having the first strike shall be determined by a coin toss.
3.	Between July 1 and October 1 of each even-numbered year, the County will update the official class specifications for each job classification selected for study. The County will provide Local 88 with the final, updated class specifications no later than October 1. No changes will be made to the class specifications for jobs selected for study between October 1 of each even-numbered year and June 30 of the following odd-numbered year.
4.	Between October 1 of each even-numbered year and February
15 of the following odd-numbered year, the Union and Management will conduct separate wage surveys of the classifications identified. Wage surveys shall be conducted by comparing wage midpoints of the agreed upon job classifications with other jurisdictions’ job classifications’ wage midpoints. Classifications will be deemed “comparable” when the focus and purpose of work are similar in nature; minimum qualifications require similar education, training and experience; and the majority of duties are similar to the duties described in the selected job classifications. Wage comparisons will be made with the same or other comparable job classifications of employers/jurisdictions in comparable communities. “Comparable” is generally limited to public sector jurisdictions within the Pacific Northwest region, but may also include other public sector jurisdictions in comparable communities outside the region. Any comparables from jurisdictions outside the Portland metropolitan area shall be adjusted for differences in cost of labor, using accepted compensation tools or practices. Any cost of living adjustments in comparable jurisdictions that are effective on or after January 1 of each odd-numbered year shall not be factored into the wage rates.
5.	No later than March 1 of each odd-numbered year, the parties will meet and negotiate wages for the agreed upon classifications, using the information obtained from wage surveys. Negotiations will be subject to the provisions of ORS 243.712.
6.	Negotiated Wage Changes
a.	All negotiated wage changes will go into effect July 1 of each odd-numbered year.
b.	Wage Increases
i.	In classifications that are adjusted to a higher pay range as a result of a study, employees who would not otherwise receive an immediate step increase under the provisions outlined in Article 15.V. Pay Adjustments, shall receive the equivalent of a one-half (1/2) step increase, equivalent to a one and one-half percent (1.5%) increase in base wages, effective on the date of the study implementation. The one and one-half percent (1.5%) increase provided for in this section will not be considered part of base wages for purposes of calculating any wage adjustment or wage premiums, including but not limited to lead pay, bilingual pay, or shift differential, except overtime pay as required

ii.	Eligible employees shall receive the remaining one-half (1/2) step increase at the time of his or her individual anniversary date, and the combined increases shall be considered the employee’s step increase for that fiscal year. Beginning on the effective date of the step increase, the full step increase shall be treated as base wages for all purposes provided for in this contract, including wage premiums and wage adjustments.
iii.	All other wage adjustments shall be implemented in accordance with the provisions of Article 15.V. Pay Adjustments.
c.	In the event the employee’s rate of pay exceeds the new recommended maximum pay rate as a result of market adjustment, he or she shall be paid in accordance with Article 15.V.3.
7.	The language herein agreed to and identified as Article 14.E through Article 14.H shall not be subjects to negotiations during calendar year 2011; however, either party may open the provisions of Article 14.E for negotiations in calendar year 2012 by providing written notice to the other party no later than February 1, 2012.
E.	Reopener Provisions for Market Adjustments
It is the intent of the parties to negotiate market adjustments for selected classifications every two (2) years, with negotiations to begin no later than March 1 of each odd-numbered year. Any agreed upon wage adjustments shall be effective on July 1 of that odd-numbered year. In any such odd-numbered year in which contract negotiations would not otherwise be open, the parties agree to a limited wage reopener for the purpose of determining market adjustments for selected classifications using the process outlined above.
F.	Funding and Amount of Increase
The fund established in Article 14.X.B of the 2007-2011 Agreement between Local 88 and Multnomah County is hereby dissolved. Effective July 1, 2011 the County shall cover the full costs of implementation of any wage increases resulting from the negotiations provided for in Article 14.E.
G.	Compensation Plan
The compensation plan for Local 88 classifications utilizes eight (8) steps, with a difference of three percent (3%) between each step in a pay grade, and a difference of three percent (3%) between each pay grade. This is commonly referred to as the “3X3” Comp Plan. Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAs) shall be implemented by adjusting each step in each pay grade by the agreed upon COLA percentage. If the result of applying the COLA for any step(s) in the pay plan yields a result that does not align with the 3X3 plan, then, subject to the mutual agreement of the parties, an additional adjustment may be made to maintain the uniformity and integrity of the 3X3 plan.
II.	Pay Periods
Employees shall be paid on a twice a month basis. The pay periods shall be the first (1st) through the fifteenth (15th) of each month and the sixteenth (16th) through the end of each month. Employees will be paid on the fifteenth (15th) of each month for hours worked

III.	Work Outside of Regularly Scheduled Hours/Days
A.	Reporting to Work After Hours/Scheduled Day Off
From time to time, it may be necessary to have employees work outside their regularly scheduled working hours or on a scheduled day off. In order to be respectful of an employee’s schedules and activities outside of work, and to keep County costs down, every effort will be made to (a) give as much advance written notice as possible, (b) limit the employee’s uncompensated break between the end of employee's shift and the callback assignment or between the callback assignment and the beginning of the employee's shift by scheduling as close to their regularly scheduled shifts as possible, and (c) allow for a continuous break of ten (10) or more hours between the end of one shift and the beginning of the next shift. None of the provisions in this section shall violate the provisions of “Article 14.IV” as they apply to part-time employees.
1.	“Call Back” - Less Than Twenty-four (24) Hours Advance Notice
a.	Minimum Compensation
Any employee who returns to work at the direction of management outside his or her regularly scheduled working hours or on a scheduled day off—and there is less than twenty-four (24) hours advance verbal or written notice—shall be compensated for a minimum of four (4) hours—or time worked, whichever is greater—at the appropriate rate according to the provisions of “Article 14.IV”. If applicable, the employee shall have the option of receiving overtime or compensatory time, or they may flex their time at a time approved by their supervisor. This minimum does not apply if (a) an employee elects to accept an overtime assignment prior to the end of their scheduled shift, or (b) the employee was on “Involuntary On-Call” status according to the provisions of “Article 14, Section IX”.
b.	Start of Period and Immediate Callback
If all of these conditions apply: (a) the employee's regularly scheduled shift has already ended and (b) they are required to report back to work immediately (as soon as they can get there) and (c) they report to the work location within one (1) hour, the four (4) hour minimum period commences with the acceptance of the assignment and ends four (4) hours later; otherwise the four (4) hour minimum period commences at the time of reporting to the work location. (For example, if an employee’s regularly scheduled shift ends at five (5:00) p.m. and they are contacted at midnight (12:00) a.m. that night and required to report back to work immediately and they report to the work location within the hour—before one (1:00) a.m.—the four (4) hour minimum period commences at midnight—with the acceptance of the assignment. If an employee’s regularly scheduled shift ends at five (5:00) p.m. and they are required to report back to work the next morning at six (6:00) a.m., then the four (4) hour minimum period commences at six (6:00)

Than or Equal to Twenty-four (24) Hours Advance Written Notice
a.	Compensation
Any employee who is required to report to work at the direction of management outside his or her regularly scheduled working hours or on a scheduled day off—and there is greater than or equal to twenty-four (24) hours and less than ten (10) calendar days advance written notice—shall be compensated for time worked at the appropriate rate according to the provisions of “Article 14.IV”. If there is greater than or equal to ten (10) calendar days advance notice, the employee shall be (a) compensated as above; or (b) notified in writing of the change to their regularly scheduled working hours.
b.	Length of Break Between Shifts
In the event an employee is required to work additional hours between the end of their regularly scheduled shift and the beginning of their next regularly scheduled shift and the break is less than ten (10) hours, the County shall:
1.	allow the employee to flex the beginning time of his/her regularly scheduled shift to allow for a ten (10) hour break, County needs permitting; or
2.	compensate the employee at his/her regular scheduled rate of pay for the difference between ten (10) hours and the actual hours he/she is off between the end of work and the start of his/her shift. For example, if an employee’s regular shift normally ends at ten (10:00) p.m., works until midnight (12:00 a.m.) and then is scheduled to begin work at eight (8:00) a.m., the break is only eight (8) hours, they would be compensated for an additional two (2) hours.
This compensation shall be in addition to his/her rate of pay for actual hours worked. This additional compensation only applies when there is greater than or equal to twenty-four (24) hours advance written notice.
B.	Receiving Work Telephone Calls at Home
Any employee who is called at home or a location other than their job site for work related business during their off-duty time, and is not required to report to a work site, shall receive one (1) hour pay at the appropriate rate according to the provision of Section IV below. Multiple calls with less than twenty (20) minutes between the end of the first (1st) and beginning of the second (2nd) (or more) calls will be considered one (1) call. This provision does not apply to telephone calls regarding work scheduling, messages left on voicemail or answering machines and/or worksite directions.
C.	Off Duty Telephone/Computer Work at Home
Any employee directed to perform work from home outside of their regular scheduled hours, will receive one (1) hour pay or the length of work whichever is greater, at the appropriate rate according to the provision of Section IV below.

1.	In excess of eight (8) hours in any work day for a five (5)-day, forty (40)-hour -a-week employee; or
2.	In excess of ten (10) hours in any work day for a four (4)-day, forty (40)-hour -a-week employee; or
3.	In excess of forty (40) hours in any FLSA work week.
B.	Double Time
1.	All work performed on an full-time employee’s scheduled second (2nd) or third (3rd) day of rest will be paid at the rate of two (2) times the employee’s regular rate of pay, provided that an employee who has refused to work a full shift on the employee’s first (1st) scheduled day of rest will be paid at the rate of one-and-one-half (1 %) times his or her normal rate.
2.	The applicable day of rest will be determined by the calendar day the person begins work and will remain in effect until (a) they leave work, or (b) their next regularly scheduled shift begins, whichever happens first. For example, if an employee starts work at ten (10:00) p.m. on their first (1st) day of rest and works until two (2:00) a.m. on the second (2nd) day of rest (and their next regularly scheduled shift has not begun during that entire time period), all the hours will be computed at one-and-one-half (1 %) time. Work begun during the second or third day of rest will be computed at double time according to the provisions above.
3.	Part-time employees who work in excess of forty-eight (48) hours in an employee’s FLSA work week shall be compensated at the double rate for all such hours in excess of forty-eight (48) hours.

V. Shift Differential
A. Payment of Shift Premiums
1.	Hours and amounts
The County and the Union recognize that a work week may contain three (3) different shifts: day, swing, and graveyard. The County agrees to pay the following shift premium pay in addition to the established wage rate to employees who are scheduled to work eight (8) or more hours in a work day:
a.	Swing shift premium

3.	Shift pay disallowed for voluntary single shift change
Employees are not entitled to shift differential pay for a single shift change that is done at the request of and for the benefit of the employee.
VI.	Auto Allowance and Compensation
Auto allowance and compensation shall be paid pursuant to Addendum E.
VII.	Deferred Compensation Plan

A.	Voluntary On-Call
Employees on a regular work schedule may volunteer to be placed on on-call duty beyond their regularly scheduled work day or work week and may be assigned an answering device for on-call purposes to avail themselves of the opportunity to receive additional pay. Any such employee on voluntary on-call status may refuse to report if called.
B.	Involuntary On-call (FLSA Exempt)
Any employee determined by the Department Human Resources Manager to be FLSA exempt may be placed on involuntary on-call status. Any such employee shall be allowed compensatory time off at the rate of one (1) hour for each eight (8) hour period they are on on-call status. Employees who are assigned on-call duty for less than eight (8) hours shall be allowed compensatory time off on a pro-rated basis at full hour increments.
An employee shall be assigned on-call duty when specifically required to be available for work outside his/her working hours and not subject to restrictions which would prevent the employee from using the time while on-call effectively for the employee’s own purposes.
No employee is eligible for any premium pay compensation while on on-call duty except as expressly stated in this article.

CLASSIFICATIONS AND PAY RANGES
I.	Wage Schedule
Employees covered by this Agreement shall be compensated in accordance with the Wage Schedule attached to this Agreement as Addendum A, which by this reference is incorporated herein, and as modified by Article 14.
II.	Step Placement and Anniversary Dates
A.	New Employees and Rehires
1.	A rehire is an employee who has terminated regular employment with the County, and is subsequently selected to occupy a regular position from a civil service list. (Former employees who return to regular County employment without being selected from a list are not rehired, but reinstated. See “Section II.G.1” below.)
2.	New employees and rehires will be paid at the minimum rate in the range for their classification unless a higher rate is approved by the Central Human Resources Manager or his or her designee.
3.	The anniversary date for wage increases for new employees will be the date of regular appointment, and the date for rehires will be the most recent date of regular appointment. However, the anniversary date for new employees and rehires will be adjusted to reflect any additional job class seniority credit, such as credit for temporary service in the classification, which they receive under the provisions of Article 21.
B.	Step Increases
An employee not at the maximum of his/her pay range shall receive an anniversary step increase upon the completion of one year of service within the job class at the current step. Service within the job class is measured in accordance with Article 2.
C.	Promotion
1.	Definition
A promotion is an appointment to a classification with a higher top step than in the preceding classification.
2.	Pay adjustments upon promotion
a.	The base pay of a newly promoted employee will be at least one step higher than his or her base pay in the lower classification, unless such an increase puts him or her beyond the top of the higher range.
b.	If the employee’s base pay in the lower range plus one step increase is lower than the first step in the higher range, the employee will be paid at the first step rate.
c.	If the employee’s base pay in the lower range plus one step increase is higher than the top step in the higher range, the employee will be paid at the top step rate.
d.	If the employee’s base pay in the lower range plus one

step increase falls within the higher range, the employee will be paid at the step rate which represents at least a one step increase, but less than a two step increase in base pay.
e.	The rate of pay upon promotion for lead workers who have received lead pay continuously for a year or more immediately prior to the promotion will be calculated as if the lead pay were part of the base rate.
3.	Anniversary date upon promotion
The employee’s anniversary date for wage increases will be the date of a regular appointment to the higher classification, unless the employee receives additional seniority credit, such as credit for continuous, contiguous temporary service in the higher classification.
4.	Failure to complete probationary period after promotion
a.	When a regular employee is promoted and does not complete the probationary period for that classification, he or she shall be reinstated to a position in the classification and department from which he or she was promoted. Reference to probationary period in this section applies to any Local 88 or non-Local 88 probationary period in Multnomah County. Employees who do not complete promotional probationary period within the first six (6) months, in a Local 88 position and return within the probationary period to their previous position shall treat such time in the higher class as seniority accrual in the lower class. Employees who do not successfully complete promotional probationary period in a non-Local 88 bargaining unit position shall have their time count towards their total length of continuous service within the County.
b.	The employee will be placed at the same step in the old range that he or she would have been on but for the promotion.
c.	The anniversary date for wage increases will revert to the anniversary date in effect prior to the promotion.
D.	Demotion
1.	Definition
A demotion is the voluntary or involuntary movement of an employee from a position in a higher class who has attained regular status in that position, to a position in a lower class having a lower maximum pay rate. Reinstatement to a previously held position after failure to complete the probationary period is not a demotion.
2.	Pay adjustments upon demotion
a.	Employees demoted for other than disciplinary reasons will receive the rate of pay in the lower pay range that causes the least reduction in base pay. No demoted employee shall receive an increase in base pay.
b.	Employees demoted for disciplinary reasons will receive the rate of pay in the lower pay range specified as a part of the disciplinary action. If no rate of pay is specified, they will receive the rate provided for in “Subsection a” above.
3.	Anniversary dates upon demotion

1.	Definition
A transfer, for purposes of payroll administration, is an appointment to another position within the classification held, or to a position in another classification with the same top step. The same rules for step placement and establishing anniversary dates apply whether the transfer occurs within the bargaining unit or from outside the unit.
2.	Pay adjustments upon transfer
a.	If an employee transfers to another position in the same classification, or to another classification with the same pay range and steps, there will be no change in his or her rate of pay.
b.	If an employee transfers to another classification with the same top step, but with different lower steps, the employee will be paid at the step in the new range which is nearest to his or her former rate without causing a reduction in pay.
3.	Anniversary dates upon transfer
The employee’s anniversary date will remain unchanged.
F.	Reclassification
Wage adjustments and anniversary dates upon reclassification are covered in “Section IV.C” below.
G.	Reinstatement
1.	Step placement upon reinstatement
a.	If an employee is recalled from a recall list, after voluntary demotion, or after a leave of absence, the employee will be placed at the same step he or she was on when he or she left the classification.
b.	A former County employee who is not on a recall list may also be reinstated at the discretion of the Human Resources Manager or designee. If reinstated to the classification most recently held, the employee will be placed at the same step he or she was on when he or she left the classification.
2.	Anniversary dates upon reinstatement
The anniversary dates of reinstated employees will be adjusted so that if the time spent away from the classification exceeds thirty (30) days in duration, none of the time away will count.
3.	Probationary Period
a.	Reinstated employees who have not previously attained regular status must serve the remainder of their new hire probationary period. If an employee who has not previously attained regular status is reinstated to a different department, their new hire probationary period may be extended sixty (60) additional days by mutual agreement of both parties.
b.	If an employee who has previously attained regular status is reinstated to a different department, the employee may be required to serve a sixty (60) day probationary period by mutual agreement of both parties. Employees who have been recalled, although not subject to an additional probationary period, are subject to the provisions of Article 21, “Section V.A.(Recall)”.

2.	Compensation for work out of class
An employee working out of class will be compensated according to the promotional policy above. (See “Section II.C”) Note that if the employee’s pay range and the higher range overlap, the policy provides for an increase of approximately one step; if the ranges do not overlap, the policy generally provides for an increase to the first step of the higher range.
3.	Paid leave and work out of class
a.	When an employee works in a higher classification during all hours worked in an FLSA work week or longer period of time, the employee will be paid the out of class rate for all hours in pay status on days in which he or she was on leave for less than half (14) a shift.

b.	The higher base rate will apply to all hours the employee is in pay status; and
c.	The employee has the right to return to his or her regular position at the end of the appointment without loss of seniority.

IV.	Reclassification
A.	Definition
A reclassification review is an analysis of an employee’s duties and responsibilities to determine whether he or she is in the correct classification.

2.	Central Human Resources will notify the Union when it initiates a study.
3.	Central Human Resources will render a decision to affected employees with a copy to the Union within sixty (60) days of receiving a request or initiating a study.
4.	If the employee is placed in a new classification, the wage range for that classification will be established by the procedures described in “Section V.A” below.
5.	Wage increases resulting from an upward reclassification will be effective retroactively to the date of the reclassification request. However, the Human

Resources Manager or his or her designee may authorize retroactivity up to six (6) months prior to the date of the request.
C.	Resolution of Reclassification Disputes
1.	The outcome of a reclassification request may be appealed under Article 18 at Step 3 of the grievance procedure within fifteen (15) days of the date on which notice of the decision from Central Human Resources is received.
2.	If the grievance is advanced to Step 4, the arbitrator will fashion his or her award within the following parameters:
a.	The arbitrator shall be limited to deciding if the employee's principal duties fall within the classification to which his or her position is allocated by the County;
b.	If the arbitrator determines that the position is improperly allocated, the arbitrator shall direct the County to allocate the position to another existing classification. If no appropriate classification exists, the arbitrator shall direct the County to establish such a classification;
c.	The arbitrator shall have no authority to modify a classification or establish a new classification.
V.	Pay Adjustments
A.	If an employee’s rate of pay is below the minimum for a new salary range, his or her pay will be raised to the minimum rate.
B.	If an employee’s rate of pay is within the new salary range but does not match a step in that range, his or her wage will be raised to the closest step. If the employee’s rate of pay matches a step of the new range, there will be no change in his or her hourly rate.
C.	If an employee’s rate of pay is above the maximum of the new salary range, the rate will not change but will be frozen, and the employee will not receive any increases in base pay, specifically to include general wage increases. However, when the top step of the new range has risen to exceed the frozen rate of pay, the employee will be paid at the top step rate.
D.	When an employee is reclassified, his or her anniversary date for a wage increase will not be changed.
VI.	Establishing Wage Rates for New Classifications
A.	Method of Determining Wage Rates
Wage rates for new and substantially revised classifications will be established by Central Human Resources in the following manner:
1.	Assign a range which is reasonably related to the average mid point of wage ranges collected for comparable classifications within the agreed upon labor market or reasonable comparables.
2.	In the event sufficient market comparable data are not available, Central Human Resources may, at its discretion, use point factor evaluation or internal equity to determine a new wage range for a classification based on comparable levels of complexity found within the County’s structure.
3.	Central Human Resources may, at its discretion, assign rates

4.	Central Human Resources shall notify the Union of the range and its effective date.
B.	Resolution of Disputes Concerning Wage Ranges Assigned to New Classifications
1.	Within ten (10) working days of receiving notice from Central Human Resources, the Union may notify the County's designee for labor relations of its desire to discuss the appropriateness of the pay range assigned.
2.	If the parties are unable to reach agreement on a wage range, the matter will be resolved under Article 18 at Step 4 of the grievance procedure.
a.	At Step 4 the arbitrator may either affirm that the pay range assigned by the County satisfies the requirements of “Section A” above, or specify the parameters within which a range would satisfy the criteria.
b.	The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding and will be retroactive to the effective date established in the County's notice, per “Section VI.A.4” above.
VII.	Market Adjustments
The Central Human Resources Manager, or his or her designee for classification and compensation administration, may notify the Union in writing that market based adjustments to the rates and ranges of certain classifications are warranted. Such adjustments may be implemented upon written approval of the Union.
VIII.	Qualified Arbitrator
Recognizing the technical expertise required to adjudicate disputes relating to classification allocations and the establishment of pay rates, the parties agree to use an arbitrator with such technical expertise during the life of this Agreement.

I.	State and Federal Tax Offset

Whether or not the grievant or the union was aware of the alleged violation, no grievance may be filed more than sixty (60) days from the date of its occurrence. However, the sixty (60) day limitation cited above is not intended to affect the pursuit of grievances regarding alleged ongoing violations of the contract.

D.	Step 4. Arbitration:
If the grievance has not been answered or resolved at Step 3, the Union may, within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of the time limit specified in Step 3, request arbitration by written notice to the County.
Within fifteen (15) days of submitting a grievance for arbitration, the Union shall request a list of the names of seven (7) arbitrators from the State of Oregon Employment Relations Board. The Union and the County shall select an arbitrator from the list by mutual agreement. If they are unable to agree on a method, the arbitrator will be chosen by the method of alternate striking of names, the order of striking to be determined by lot. One day shall be allowed for the striking of each name. The final name left on the list shall be the arbitrator. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Union and the County from agreeing upon a permanent arbitrator or permanent list.
The Union and the County agree that no less than five (5) days prior to any scheduled arbitration hearing, they will mutually exchange copies of all exhibits and names of witnesses intended to be offered at the hearing, except the work product of any attorney or authorized representative involved.
No less than five (5) days prior to the scheduled arbitration, the Union and the County shall submit to the designated arbitrator a signed stipulation of the issue before the arbitrator. In the event they are unable to stipulate the issue in dispute, each party shall, not later than four (4) days prior to the scheduled arbitration, submit to the arbitrator and the other party a signed statement of the issue that party asserts is in dispute.
The arbitrator shall be requested to begin taking evidence and testimony within twenty-five (25) days after submission of the request for arbitration; and the arbitrator shall be requested to issue his or her decision within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of testimony and argument. The Union and the County hereby vest the arbitrator with authority to compel the attendance of witnesses on behalf of either party by issuance of a subpoena, the cost of which shall be borne by the party requesting the subpoena.
The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding, but he or she shall have no power to alter, modify, amend, add to, or detract from the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator’s decision shall be within the scope and terms of the Agreement and in writing. Any decision of the arbitrator may provide for retroactivity not exceeding sixty (60) days prior to the date the grievance was first filed, and it shall state the effective date of the award.
Expenses for the arbitration shall be borne by the losing party. Each party shall be responsible for compensating its own representatives and witnesses. If either party desires a verbatim recording of the proceedings, it may cause such record to be made, on the condition that it pays for the record and makes copies available without

Any time limits specified in the grievance procedure may be waived by mutual consent of the parties. A grievance may be terminated at any time upon receipt of a signed statement from the aggrieved party that the matter has been resolved.
E.	Content of Grievances and Responses
The parties agree that it is mutually beneficial if grievances and responses contain adequate explanations of the position of the parties at each step of the process. Failure to do so will not be subject to grievance.

3.	An employee may file a grievance through Step 3 of the grievance procedure without the assistance of the Union; however, departure from the grievance procedure described herein shall automatically nullify the Union's obligation to process the grievance. Also, whether or not the employee seeks Union assistance, the Union must be given the opportunity to be present when a settlement offer is made, and any settlement must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
B.	Stewards
1.	Definition and designation

Upon notification to the grievant's supervisor of the name of the grievant and the tentative cause of the grievance, or the name of the subject of a disciplinary investigatory interview, a Steward(s) responsible for the grievant's work area may investigate and process grievance(s) at the work site during working hours without loss of pay, or in the case of an investigatory interview, participate in such interview without loss of pay. All efforts will be made to avoid disruptions and interruptions of work.
b.	Employees meeting with their Steward to process a grievance will also be permitted to do so without loss of pay during working hours.
c.	A Steward may not process a grievance in any other work area than the one to which he or she is assigned by the Union unless mutually agreed by the Department and the Union.

MODIFICATION OF WORK PERFORMED
BY THE BARGAINING UNIT: CONTRACTING, INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENTS, AND USE OF VOLUNTEERS
I.	Contracting
A.	Limitations on Contracting
The County may contract or subcontract out work performed by employees in this bargaining unit regardless of impact on employees, including but not limited to layoff. In any instance in which such contracting or subcontracting would result in layoff, however, and the County is unable to find suitable or comparable alternative employment for the employees, this contracting or subcontracting will occur only if it was anticipated and considered as a part of the budgeting process and the Union Business Representative and/or President has been notified of the specific plan and its probable impact at least thirty (30) days prior to adoption of the annual budget, referred to as the “Adopted Budget”, or formal Board consideration of budget modifications.
B.	Meeting with the Union
1.	Layoffs.
The County agrees to meet with the Union to discuss the effect of proposed contracting out or subcontracting which would result in layoff prior to the presentation of the proposal to the Board for adoption. The County further agrees to meet with the Union, at its request, to explore the alternative of work force reduction by attrition.
2.	Contract Reviews
Parties agree to meet during the term of this agreement for the purpose of reviewing work that is contracted out, such as custodial work and the feasibility of such work being performed by bargaining unit employees.
3.	Contracting In
The County and the Union also agree to allow the Union the opportunity to bid on work which is being considered for contracting out in accordance with a procedure that is mutually agreed upon by the County and the Union.
C. No Interference with Contract
Any contracting out of bargaining unit work under the terms of this article shall be bound exclusively by the exercise of the discretion of the Board of County Commissioners, and any appropriate elected executive, subject only to the limitations of this article and laws in effect at the time of execution of this Agreement. This exercise of discretion shall specifically not be bound by the requirements of any Initiative Petition, or law promulgated thereto, which becomes effective subsequent to the execution of this Agreement.
II.	Intergovernmental Agreements

Intergovernmental agreement which would affect the transfer of employees to or from the County is placed on the Board agenda. The County also agrees to provide the Union with a specific plan and its probable impact relative to Intergovernmental Agreements involving employee transfer, when such Agreements are anticipated, at least thirty (30) days prior to formal Board consideration of budget modifications or the Board's adoption of the annual budget related to such a transfer.
III.	Rights and Benefits of Employees Involved in Consolidation, Merger, and Acquisition of Positions
A.	The County and the Union recognize the provisions of ORS 236.610 through 236.650 in the event an employee of the County is transferred to another public employer as defined under ORS 236.610(2) for reason of merger, consolidation or cooperation agreement.
B.	All employees acquired by the County as a result of merger, consolidation, cooperation agreement, or acquisition of a facility, shall be entitled to all rights and benefits granted employees under this Agreement and ORS 236.610 through 236.650.
IV.	Volunteers
The County shall have the right to use volunteers at any time for any purpose. If a volunteer program is instituted which the Union reasonably believes may lead to employee layoffs, the County shall at the Union request meet and confer concerning alternatives which would eliminate or mitigate adverse impact on employees.

ARTICLE 20 WORKLOAD AND STANDARDS, TRAINING, PERFORMANCE EVALUATION, AND ORGANIZATIONAL EXCELLENCE
I.	Workloads and Standards
It is the County’s right to establish the workload for employees. In addressing the assigned workload the employee's supervisor may establish reasonable job performance standards, and may, from time to time, revise them. Such standards shall be posted or individually stated to each affected employee, in order to assure advance comprehension and understanding of performance requirements. No employee shall be subject to disciplinary action for failure to meet standards of performance unless such employee has been fully advised of such expected performance standards, in advance of the work period in question.
When changes in functions, size, organization, mission, technology or equipment result in changes to the duties assigned to positions or the classification of positions, and employees occupying those positions do not meet the new required knowledge, skills and abilities, such changes will be brought forward by management or the union to the Employee Relations Committee (ERC). The ERC will review the matter for alternatives that meet the needs of the County with the least amount of impact on the bargaining unit members. This review does not apply to employees who would be subject to layoff based position elimination and/or budget reductions.
II.	Employee Development and Training
A.	Any time an employee is specifically required by management to participate in any development and training program shall be considered time worked for pay purposes, and all tuition, texts, training materials, and other expenses incident to such employee’s participation shall be assumed by the County.
B.	The County may subsidize employee participation in non-mandatory training or education based on relevance to the employee’s job, budgetary limitations, and managerial priorities. Each department’s labor-management committee will create a subcommittee of equal representation to develop a process for distribution of training opportunities. The subcommittee will also develop guidelines for employees to use when requesting training and for supervisors to use when determining appropriate training authorization.
1.	The subsidy may be made in the form of a partial or total reimbursement for expenses and/or time off with pay for part or all of the time required to attend.
2.	Employees may obtain information on how to apply for training or educational subsidies from their Departmental Human Resource Office.
3.	If approved prior to enrollment, reimbursements will be made within thirty (30) days of successful completion of the training or coursework, provided the employee has submitted verification as required under department policy.

B.	Employees will have the right to attach a response to any evaluations in their personnel files.
C.	No evaluations or employee responses will be admissible in any disciplinary or arbitration hearing.
D.	All performance evaluations shall be signed by the employee’s supervisor, who shall bear ultimate responsibility for the content of the evaluation.
E.	County performance evaluation forms will include a section on individual training and career development.
IV.	Organizational Excellence
The parties are committed to the continuation of Labor Management cooperation as represented by the ERC process. To further support this process:
A.	Joint Training
Joint training shall be provided on an annual basis to all shop Stewards and representative managers and supervisors on matters related to contract administration and the management of problem employees and teams. The purpose of this training will be to develop mutual understanding of basic processes and roles. Additionally, to support team development and quality initiatives, such training will involve appropriate group process and quality components.
B.	Employee Participation and Teams
It is understood that many of the terms of this Agreement are based on an individual rights and obligation model. The parties recognize that employees are increasingly involved in employee participation processes and working in teams. In such instances as issues arise from these processes, which may involve the terms of this Agreement, the parties will meet upon the request of either party to discuss any appropriate action. Mutually agreeable terms of any needed exceptions and understandings shall be in conformance with Article 26, Entire Agreement.

County. Employees holding positions that perform functions to be discontinued will be subject to the following in order of seniority:
1.	Reassignment to a regular position in the same classification and within the employee’s current department, or if the employee does not have enough seniority, then
2.	Reassignment to a regular position County wide, in the following order:
a.	Reassignment to a position in the same classification; or, if the employee does not have enough seniority, then
b.	Reassignment to a position in a lower or equivalent classification previously held, or if the employee does not have enough seniority, then
c.	Change of status between full-time and part-time, or if the employee does not have enough seniority, then
3.	Reassignment to a limited duration position, in the same order as in Article 21.III.2, above, provided the Union and the County mutually agree to the placement.
4.	Layoff.
B.	Voluntary layoff, bumping, or reduction in hours
1.	Lower Bumping Options
An employee may voluntarily choose to take a lower bumping option provided such option is available and does not adversely affect another regular employee who would not have been impacted had the employee bumped in the order specified above, and will not result in increased costs to the County. Such election will be made in writing within three (3) working days and submitted to Central Human Resources. Where more than one option exists, the employee shall list his or her preference(s) in rank order.
2.	Reduction in Hours
Any employee in a classification affected by layoff may request to be reassigned to a vacant position with fewer assigned hours per week if such reassignment would mitigate the impact of the layoff on other employees and does not result in increased costs to the County.
3.	Voluntary Layoff
Any employee in a classification affected by layoff may request voluntary layoff if such action does not result in increased costs to the County. When management identifies classifications to be laid off, management will first in order of seniority, look for volunteers to be laid off. Employees who agree to a voluntary layoff out of seniority order will have no bumping rights and such employee will be placed on a recall list in accordance with this Article.
C.	Non-Regular Employees during a Layoff
1.	Within an affected classification and department, temporary, nonregular probationary, and other employees who do not have classified status and who are occupying budgeted positions will be terminated before employees with classified status are affected by layoff.

3.	Probationary employees terminated or demoted in accordance with “Subsection 1” and “Subsection 2” above will be placed on reinstatement lists for one (1) year from the date of their termination or demotion. They may, at the County’s discretion, be reinstated to their former classification if there are no regular employees who are on a recall list for that classification. Probationary employees who are reinstated will be treated as if they have been on a leave of absence for purposes of computing seniority and length of probationary period.
D.	Layoff Processing for Employees on a Leave of Absence Without Pay
1.	Employee notification
Employees who are on a leave of absence without pay which is scheduled to continue after the layoff effective date and whose classifications are expected by the County to be affected by an upcoming layoff process will be notified in writing and given an option to return from leave.
2.	Use of positions during the layoff process
If no response is received by the County within five (5) days of written notification, or if the employee declines to return from leave of absence, or if the employee is unable to return from leave of absence, the position from which the employee is on leave of absence will be treated as a vacant position during the layoff process and will be available to be filled by another employee who is affected by the layoff process, according to the provisions of this article.
3.	Return from family medical leave without pay
After a layoff process affecting the employee’s classification has occurred, employees who are on Family Medical Leave without pay immediately prior to returning to work will return to the position formerly held, and the employee occupying that position will be reassigned according to seniority pursuant to this article.
4.	Return from other leave without pay
After a layoff process affecting the employee’s classification has occurred, employees not on Family Medical Leave without pay immediately prior to returning to work will be reassigned according to seniority pursuant to this article.
5.	Recalculation of seniority after leave of absence without pay
All employees on leave of absence without pay that exceeds thirty (30) days will have their seniority recalculated upon their return from leave so that none of the time on the leave of absence without pay counts toward seniority per “Section II.B.3” of this article.
E.	The Bumping Process
Regular status employees who are affected by layoff are reassigned using the rules listed in Article 21.III.A. In addition, the bumping process is administered with the following considerations:

Vacancies that are created and approved by the Board of County Commissioners to be effective the day following the layoff date shall be treated as vacancies available during a layoff process.
2.	Reassignment to Vacancies and Employee Preferences
Reassignment of employees to vacant positions within the employee’s current department, if available, will always take precedence over their bumping another employee; where multiple vacancies are available within the employee’s current department, the County will take into account the employee’s preferences for shift assignment, part-time or full-time status, work location, and work assignment to the extent practical prior to reassignment of the employee to a vacancy. An employee who is offered options must indicate a preference within three (3) working days of receipt of notice of the options in order to exercise that option.
3.	Bumping Less Senior Employees
If bumping is necessary, the least senior employee in the affected classification in the department will be bumped. If there is no employee with less seniority in the classification in the department, then assignment to a vacant position in the County in the affected classification, if no vacant position, then the least senior employee in the affected classification in the County will be bumped.
4.	Previously Held Classifications
If there is no employee in the classification in the County with less seniority then the employee will be bumped to a classification previously held. If the employee held more than one previous classification, order shall be to the previous class held and so forth. Employee bumping rights includes right to bump into a previous classification with a higher maximum salary only if the higher salary rate of the previously held class is due to a salary adjustment for that class resulting from a classification /compensation study and the employee moved from the class as a result of a lateral transfer, promotion or reclass. If an employee bumps to a classification previously held and did not complete the probationary period in the class, employee will be required to complete probation according to the terms of Article 2, Section IX.
5.	Change of Full-Time and Part-Time Status
Full-time employees will be reassigned only to full-time positions and part-time employees will be reassigned only to part-time positions, unless reassignment to the other status is the only available option other than layoff.
6.	Library Specific Classifications
a.	An employee being laid off from a Library specific classification and demoting into a previously held Library specific classification as a result of a layoff may request to exercise layoff options based on the FTE:
i.	The employee holds at the time of the layoff; or
ii.	The employee held immediately prior to promoting into his/her current classification.
b.	The employee must notify the Library Layoff Coordinator within three (3) business days (Monday-Friday) of receipt of notice of the FTE he or she

chooses, otherwise the employee will be laid off or reassigned based on part or full-time status in the classification held at the time of receipt of the layoff notice.
7.	Job Share Agreements
a.	Employees who are participating in job share agreements at the time the layoff process is being administered will be treated like part-time employees for the purposes of bumping and reassignment.
b.	If a part-time employee bumps into a position that has an existing job share agreement, the employee must agree to the terms of the existing job share agreement.
8.	Shift Assignment
Shift assignment will not have an effect on the layoff process.
9.	Failure to Accept a Reassignment
Employees who are reassigned to a position pursuant to these provisions and do not accept that position will be deemed to have resigned.
10.	Qualified to Perform the Duties of the Position
Employees may not be reassigned to positions under this article unless qualified to perform the duties of that position. An accurate job description, including any approved knowledge, skills, or abilities required for the position, must be on file with Central Human Resources prior to issuance of layoff notices. Employees may be denied rights otherwise available under these provisions only if they lack knowledge, skills or abilities required for the position that are not easily learned on the job within ninety (90) days. If an employee is on paid or unpaid leave for more than fourteen (14) consecutive calendar days during the ninety (90) day orientation period, the orientation period will be extended by the amount of the leave. Employees may be required to take and pass qualifying examinations in order to establish their rights to specific positions.
When the County determines that knowledge, skills or abilities (KSAs) in addition to minimum qualifications are required for a position, the Union may appoint a Steward or officer familiar with that job classification to participate in discussions about the required KSAs and the content of any qualifying examination used as part of the bumping process. Nothing requires the County to develop an examination at the time the KSAs are approved nor prevents it from modifying an examination at a later date provided the Union is provided an opportunity to participate in discussions regarding the new or revised exam used during bumping.
11.	Request for Leave
Employees who are reassigned or demoted pursuant to these provisions may request up to three (3) days of leave without pay prior to reporting to their new work assignment, consistent with the County’s voluntary furlough program, and subject to approval of the appropriate manager.
12.	Freezing of Personnel Actions
To ensure that data about vacancies and employee work assignments are reliable and that bumping options are accurate, the County HR Director may freeze all personnel transactions as determined appropriate beginning four (4) weeks prior to the date a layoff

for classifications in which they have previously achieved regular status. Limited duration employees who have not previously achieved regular status do not have recall rights.
C.	Employees who are laid off, demoted, or reassigned to a lateral classification and/or reassigned between full-time and part-time status will be placed on the recall lists, according to seniority. Employees will be placed on all the recall lists that meet the criteria below. (For example, employees who are demoted and reassigned from full-time to part-time will be placed on the recall lists for full-time appointment in the current classification, for part-time appointment in the higher classification, and for full-time appointment in the higher classification):
1.	Employees who are laid off will be placed on the recall list for the classification held by the employee at the beginning of the layoff process.
2.	Employees who are demoted will be placed on the recall list for all the classifications held by the employee at the beginning of the layoff process to, but not including, the one the employee demoted to.
3.	Employees who are reassigned to a lateral classification or to a classification previously held will be placed on the recall list for the classification held by the employee at the beginning of the layoff process.
4.	Employees who are reassigned from full-time to part-time will be placed on the list for recall to full-time assignment.
5.	Employees who are reassigned from part-time to full-time will be placed on the list for recall to part-time assignment.
D.	Employees who are placed on a recall list pursuant to these provisions will be provided with appropriate information concerning the rights after layoff, and their responsibilities. Information will include, but not be limited to, information concerning the County’s rules on reinstatement, and will offer employees the opportunity to provide alternate contact information for recall notice.
E.	Prior to issuing an open competitive recruitment for a vacancy, hiring managers should review any active recall lists and determine if the vacancy should be announced for internal applications first, in order to allow employees on recall lists in other classifications to have the opportunity to be considered.

6.	Disciplinary termination for cause.
H.	Effect of Recall on Seniority
Employees who are laid off and are on recall list(s) and return to regular County employment for any reason will be treated as if they have been on a leave of absence without pay for the purpose of computing seniority.
V. Recall
A.	Employees on a recall list will be certified in order of seniority, before applicants who qualify through examination, provided they are qualified to perform the duties of the position. Employees on a recall list shall be offered appointment to vacancies, in order of seniority, except when they lack knowledge, skills or abilities required for the position that are not easily learned on the job within ninety (90) days.
B.	Employees may be required to take and pass qualifying examinations in order to establish their rights to specific positions. The hiring manager is required to state in writing what qualification(s) the employee lacks that the position requires. The employee will remain on the recall list for certification to other vacancies during his or her term of eligibility.
C.	Failure to recall an employee, except as provided above, will be deemed a
dismissal of that employee for cause, and will be reviewed and processed according to the provisions of Article 17, Disciplinary Action.
VI.	Seniority Application
A.	The above terms for determination of seniority shall apply not only to the layoff process, but also to other situations in which seniority is applied, including total service for the purpose of vacation accrual rates.

work units where employees do not have readily available computer access, on or about March 1st of each year or anytime an employee or employees are notified that their position(s) is being eliminated. Employees may request a copy of the seniority list from their department human resources unit at any time.
B.	Seniority List Appeals
1.	Employees who have concerns about the calculation of their seniority shall notify Central Human Resources with a copy to the Union. If an employee’s concerns remain unresolved, the Union may file a formal written grievance at Step 3 of the grievance procedure within thirty (30) days of his or her initial consultation with Central Human Resources. If no grievance is filed within the thirty (30) days, the seniority calculation is deemed correct and no grievances may be filed on that issue at a later date. If a Step 3 grievance is filed, and Central Human Resources denies the grievance by upholding the seniority calculation, the Union may exercise its’ right to move the issue to arbitration in accordance with Article 8, Section III. If the Union chooses to not move the issue to arbitration by making such a request within fifteen (15) days of the Step 3 response, the seniority calculation will be deemed correct and no grievances may be filed on the issue again in the future.
2.	Employees may only file grievances over seniority calculations that have been accrued since the effective date of the previous contract. (For example, in the 2011 - 2014 contract, employees may only file grievances over seniority that has been accrued since the July 1,2007, which is the effective date of the 2007 - 2011 contract.)
3.	Seniority dates will be frozen during the bumping/layoff process consistent with the commencement of the KSA freeze date as defined in Section III.E.9 above.
4.	When a seniority date is changed due to a grievance, the affected employees and the Union shall receive written notification of the new seniority ranking for the affected classification.
VIII. Seniority of and Bumping by Non-Bargaining Unit Employees and Other Bargaining Units
A.	The only non-bargaining unit employees, confidential employees or members of other bargaining units, who may bump into the bargaining unit are those who are in the Classified service and who have previously been a member of the Bargaining Unit or in a classification which subsequently became part of these units.
B.	Only time served in the bargaining unit shall apply for bumping purposes. IX. Special Provisions to Save Employees From Layoff - Project Save
It is recognized by the parties that employees who are to be laid off or involuntarily demoted because of their seniority within a classification within a department face difficult circumstances in being placed in alternative employment within the County. Any such employee who is placed in a classification not previously held shall be subject to a trial service period of ninety (90) days to demonstrate his or her ability to perform or fulfill the requirements of the new classification. Employees who refuse an offer to be placed in alternative employment will not be deemed to have waived their bumping rights or right to
ARTICLE 21, SENIORITY AND LAYOFF

1	placement on the recall list. Employees who, in the opinion of the County, are
2	unsuccessful during this ninety (90) day trial service period will be removed from their new
3	classification and placed on the appropriate recall list. Such employees shall continue to 4 be eligible for placement under the provisions of this section as long as alternative 5 employment opportunities are being explored by management for affected employees.

The lateral transfer provisions outlined in Sections III and IV above will not apply in such cases.
2.	Upon promotion to the budgeted position, the employee’s pay will be governed by the promotional policy in Article 15.II.C. The trainee classification will be considered the base classification for purposes of determining the employee’s pay rate following promotion.
3.	Employees who are promoted after the completion of a training program will be subject to a promotional probationary period in accordance with the provisions in Article 2.XI.
F.	Termination of the Training Program
The Department or employee may end the training assignment at any time with ten (10) day written notice to the other party and to the department from which the employee came. The decision to end the training assignment is not subject to the grievance procedure. The employee will be returned to his or her classification and salary held immediately prior to the training position. If there is no vacancy for which the employee is qualified in the classification held by the employee immediately prior to the training program, the employee will be laid off in accordance with Article 21.
VII. Work Unit and Work Assignment Determination and Specification
A. Departmental Determination
Each Department, either directly at the Departmental level, or by delegation, shall determine the work units and work assignment structure of its organization and may change this determination from time to time to reflect changes in the organization’s structure and/or needs. For example, a Department which has defined its service delivery sites as work units, and major functions within those sites as work unit assignments, may choose to treat the entire Department as a work unit with the site locations as work assignments. Whenever practicable, to ensure communication with employees and discussion of the implementation process and/or of alternatives, the Department will notify the Union thirty (30) days in advance of any planned change in the determination of work units.
When changes in the Department structure and/or needs result in the need to make changes to employees geographic work locations, shift or days, management will seek qualified volunteers from the affected shift, schedule or geographic work location. Assignments will be made on the basis of seniority, unless the provisions of “Section III” of this article apply. If there are no qualified volunteers for the change, the
ARTICLE 22, SHIFT AND WORK ASSIGNMENT
95

2	with no less than a fifteen (15) working day notice period.
3	B. Listing of Units
4	In order to assist the Union in enforcing the terms of the Agreement
5	both in this article as well as in others, the County will provide on or about April first (1st) of
6	each year a comprehensive listing of all work units within the County by Department.

SAVINGS CLAUSE AND FUNDING
I.	Savings Clause
Should any article, section, or portion thereof, of this Agreement be held unlawful and unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, or any administrative agency having jurisdiction over the subject matter, such decision shall apply only to the specific article, section, or portion thereof directly specified in the decision. Upon the issuance of any such decision, the parties agree immediately to negotiate a substitute, if possible, for the invalidated article, section, or portion thereof. All other portions of this Agreement, and the Agreement as a whole, shall continue without interruption for the term hereof.
II.	Funding
The parties recognize that revenue needed to fund the wages and benefits and budget related existing conditions provided by the Agreement must be approved annually by established budget procedures. All such wages, benefits, and budget related conditions are, therefore, contingent upon sources of revenue and annual budget certification by the Tax Supervising and Conservation Committee. The County has no intention of cutting the wages, benefits, or budget related existing conditions specified in this Agreement because of budgetary limitations, but cannot and does not guarantee any level of employment in the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement.
The Board of County Commissioners agrees to include in its annual budget amounts sufficient to fund the wages, benefits, and budget related existing conditions provided by this Agreement, but makes no guarantee as to the certification of such budget pursuant to established budget procedures under Oregon law.
In the event of a delay in such certification, the County will make every reasonable effort to correct whatever budget deficiencies that exist, if any, in order to obtain certification. Retroactive monetary adjustment shall be made if any scheduled economic improvement is delayed due to a delay in certification, unless otherwise precluded by State or Federal law or administrative regulation.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT
The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement each had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and that the understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire existing Agreement between the parties. Except as specifically modified by or treated in this Agreement, all policies, matters, questions and terms affecting unit employees in their employment relationship with the County shall be governed by Article 4, Management Rights, unless such rights are specifically limited by the Multnomah County Code Chapter 9 or its successor and the Personnel Rules. The County and the Union, for the life of the Agreement, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right, and agrees that the other shall not be obliged, to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter referred to or covered by this Agreement, even though such subject or matter may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either party or both parties at the time that they negotiated and signed this Agreement.
Nothing in this article shall preclude the parties during the term of this Agreement from voluntarily entering into amendments to the Agreement; nor shall the Union and the County Chair or his or her designee(s) for labor relations be precluded from voluntarily entering into Memoranda of Understanding, Interpretation, or Exception concerning matters of contract administration.

ADDENDUM B
LEAD WORKER ASSIGNMENT AND PAY
I.	Duties Defined
A Lead Worker assignment involves certain limited oversight and administrative duties which are deemed not to warrant a separate classification. These duties include, but are not limited to: laying out the work for other employees, balancing the work, directing the work, reviewing the work and employee conduct for adherence to standards and rules, and making such reports as may be required to supervisory employees. Lead Workers shall spend a substantial portion of their time (fifty percent (50%) or more) in performing the duties of the base classification. Normally, the employees directed by a Lead Worker are in the same classification, but additional classifications are sometimes involved. An employee assigned to be a Lead Worker will not impose or effectively recommend (as that term is intended in Oregon law) formal discipline, i.e. a letter of reprimand or above. Lead Workers shall not issue oral reprimands. Lead Workers shall not be present when discipline is issued. Lead Workers shall not prepare or issue performance evaluations and any involvement of Lead Workers in performance evaluation shall conform to the restrictions of Article 20, “Section III.D”.
II.	Assignment, Selection, Modification, and Termination
Assignment and selection of Lead Workers shall be at the sole discretion of the County. Lead worker assignments for over sixty (60) continuous days will be posted in the affected work unit for no less than five (5) work days. Employees in the work unit interested in the lead worker assignment shall submit a letter of interest to the unit manager and will be considered for the assignment.
An employee assigned as a Lead Worker for one (1) year or more shall be given ten (10) days notice prior to the termination of such an assignment. A copy of the termination notice will be simultaneously given to the Union. Significant modifications of Lead Worker duties deemed by the County to warrant a modification in the amount of compensation shall also be with ten (10) days notice, with notice to the union of such change. All lead worker assignments will be reviewed for continuation at least annually. III. Pay
When in the judgment of the County:
A.	A new Lead Worker assignment is necessary; or
B.	A substantial modification of an existing Lead Worker assignment warrants a change in compensation, Central Human Resources shall establish a lead pay rate for the new or substantially modified assignment. The current pay rates for the classifications eligible for the Lead Worker premium shall be calculated by increasing the base hourly pay rates by the approved percentages.

2.	This program is offered only by Tri-Met. However C-Tran will honor the Tri-Met all zone pass.
C.	Procedural Requirements

Article 14.	Compensation
The terms of this article shall apply except:
Shift Differential
Payment of shift differential as provided by “Section V” shall not apply. However, the Library acknowledges that work hours past six (6:00) p.m. may require sacrifice on the part of employees.

Shift differential shall be subject to rounding to the nearest quarter of an hour in accordance with the rounding provisions of Article 13, “Section VII.(A)”. Shift differential for time worked after 6:00 p.m. will not be paid unless the employee works until 6:08 p.m., at which point the employee will be paid shift differential for one quarter (1/4) hour. Similarly, an employee whose shift normally ends at 8:05 p.m. will receive two hours of shift differential for the time between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. but will not receive shift differential pay for time worked after 8:00 p.m. unless the employee works until 8:08 p.m., at which time the employee will be paid an additional one quarter (1/4) hour of shift differential.
Article 15.	Classification and Pay Ranges
The terms of this article shall apply except:
Librarian or Library Assistant performing limited oversight duties

When the period of performance of such limited oversight duties is forty (40) hours or more, an employee in the Librarian classification shall be paid a five percent (5%) work out of class differential; an employee in the Library Assistant classification shall be paid according to the provisions of Article 15, Section III A.
Employees Substituting in Lower Classifications
Employees who voluntarily substitute in a lower classification shall be paid for such time at the top step of the lower salary range unless there is an overlap between the employee’s salary range and the lower salary range, in which case the employee would receive their regular rate of pay.

I.	Scheduling
A.	Any employee of the Department of Community Justice, upon request and approval of their supervisors, shall establish a work schedule that is approved by his/her supervisors and that is responsive to the demands of their job. Such schedule shall be limited to a forty (40) hour work week.
If the work week is within the forty (40) hour cap, all hours worked shall be at the flat rate, on an hour for hour basis, regardless of the starting time, day worked, or length of the work day. Split work weeks, varied starting and ending time for shifts, and split shifts shall be permitted.
B.	Variations of the established work schedule shall be approved by the supervisor.
C.	Employees receiving "after hours work calls" may respond. If responding to after hours calls, employees will "adjust" their work schedule, hour for hour, within the forty (40) hour work week with the approval of their supervisors.
II.	Shift Bidding for 24-hour, Seven-Day Operations
A.	Annual Bidding
Annual shift bidding shall take place in November of every year and the new schedule shall be implemented in the following January. All shifts will be open to bidding and posted as forty (40) hour shifts. The order of bidding shall be based on seniority within the job classification. If two employees are approved by management to job share, they may choose which of their respective positions they wish to split. The resulting vacant position shall then be available to be bid on by other employees.
B.	Vacancies Following Annual Shift Bid
Any vacancy within the unit of more than ninety (90) days that occurs subsequent to the annual shift bid shall be posted in the unit. The vacant position shall be filled by the most senior employee of those who express interest. The position vacated by that employee will then be posted within the unit and the process will be repeated. This process will be repeated one (1) more time for a total of three (3) postings. The remaining vacant position will be filled by a lateral transfer or new hire for the remainder of the bid year.
III.	Vacation Requests for 24-hour, Seven-day Operations
For work units that operate on a twenty-four (24)-hour, seven (7)-day schedule, vacation requests for the upcoming calendar year may be submitted at the time of the November shift bid. Management shall grant or deny these initial requests by December 31 of the current year. If two (2) or more vacation requests are submitted for the same days and times, the employee with the most seniority shall be granted the request. Each employee will be allowed to exercise the right of seniority for one (1) of their vacation bid

requests in a calendar year. Pending supervisor approval, the remaining requests may be granted if coverage can be found.
All subsequent requests shall be considered on a “first come, first served” basis; if two (2) or more vacation requests are submitted for the same days and times, preference will be given to the request that was submitted first, as verified by a date stamp. If two (2) or more requests are submitted at the same date and time, the more senior employee’s vacation request will be granted. Each employee will be allowed to exercise the right of seniority for one (1) of their “first come, first served” vacation requests in a calendar year. Employees shall submit requests as early as possible, and no later than two (2) weeks before the first (1st) day of the requested leave. Both parties agree that minimal staffing of all shifts must be maintained.
IV.	Holidays
Because of the complexity of scheduling, and the participatory scheduling process involved for certain employees of the Department of Community Justice, any employee who is offered a holiday off on an observed holiday but chooses to self schedule himself on that day shall be granted a personal holiday in lieu of any other holiday observance or pay. This personal holiday shall be used within the fiscal year but in no event more than four (4) months from the date of the holiday.
V.	Mixed Shifts
Day Reporting Center/Londer Learning Center: When employees at the Day Reporting Center/Londer Learning Center are regularly scheduled, in accordance with the provisions of Article 13, to work a combination of day and swing shifts which does not contain four (4) like shifts within the work week, they will not receive relief shift differential for all shifts worked. They will receive swing shift-differential for each swing shift worked VI. Community Works Leader
Employees assigned as Community Works Leaders shall be reimbursed up to three-hundred and fifty dollars ($350) annually for work boots, daypacks, and/or rain gear as follows:
A.	Work boots must meet Forest Service standards. Employees may have their old boots resoled instead of buying a new pair. The same maximum reimbursement standard applies. Staff who choose to not purchase their own work boots may use client boots from the Department of Community Justice.
B.	Daypacks must be capable of carrying the necessary safety items for daily work crews. Staff who choose not to purchase their daypacks may use one of the Department of Community Justice’s daypacks.
C.	Staff who choose to not purchase their own rain gear may use County issued rain gear from the Department of Community Justice.
D.	In order to qualify for reimbursement, employees must average thirty percent (30%) time in the field with crews. Reimbursed equipment shall be considered property of the County. Employees leaving County employment may purchase their boots at a pro-rated cost.

Notify their supervisors in advance when their use of prescription or non-prescription medications may impair the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions of their position that will result in a direct threat to others. Such employees include, but are not limited to, sworn officers, holders of a CDL, and those handling hazardous equipment or materials. Employees who drive a motor vehicle as part of their job, whether a County vehicle or their personal vehicle, should report when they are taking any medication that may impair their ability to drive.
4.	Cooperation with Policy Administration
Employees shall:
a.	Not interfere with the administration of this Drug and Alcohol Policy. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: tainting, tampering, or substitution of urine samples; falsifying information regarding the use of prescribed medications or controlled substances; or failure to cooperate with any tests outlined in this policy to determine the presence of drugs or alcohol.

3.	Consistent with Federal law, employees in safety sensitive positions, including but not limited to holders of CDL’s and Bridge Operators, shall be subject to the testing requirements of federal law, in addition to the requirements herein which apply to all employees. For example, unlike other employees, employees in safety sensitive positions will be subject to legally required random testing and testing following certain kinds of accidents.
B.	Establishing Reasonable Suspicion
1.	Definition
“Reasonable suspicion” is a set of objective and specific observations or facts which lead a supervisor to suspect that an employee is under the influence of drugs, controlled substances, or alcohol. Examples include, but are not limited to: slurred speech, alcohol on the breath, loss of balance or coordination, dilated or constricted pupils, apparent hallucinations, high absenteeism or a persistent pattern of unexplained absenteeism, erratic work performance, persistent poor judgment, difficulty concentrating, theft from office or from other persons, unexplained absences during office hours, or employee's admission of use of prohibited substances.
2.	Supervisory training
The County will provide training to all supervisors on establishing reasonable suspicion and the nature of alcohol and drug dependency. Supervisors who have not been trained will not have the authority to direct employees to be tested on the basis of reasonable suspicion of being under the influence.
3.	Lead Workers
When no supervisor is immediately present, lead workers who oversee day-to-day work activities are “supervisors” for the purposes of establishing reasonable suspicion and directing employees to be tested on that basis. This provision applies to lead workers who supervise or act as lead workers as part of their job description, as well as to those who receive premium pay under Addendum B, Lead Worker Assignment and Pay.
4.	Additional precautions
Application of the "Reasonable Suspicion" standard to any employee in this bargaining unit shall include the following additional precautions:
a.	The supervisor shall articulate orally a summary of the specific facts which form the basis for believing that the employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol; and
b.	The supervisor shall provide upon request within forty-eight (48) hours of the oral determination of "reasonable suspicion" a written specification of the grounds for reasonable suspicion; and
c.	Except in field or shift circumstances which render contact difficult, no supervisor shall refer an employee for a drug or alcohol test based on

"reasonable suspicion" unless the supervisor has consulted with another supervisor or managerial person regarding the grounds for the suspicion.
C. Testing Methodology
Testing procedures for all employees will be governed by the same standards as apply to CDL drivers under federal law. These standards include, but are not limited to, those governing sample acquisition, the chain of custody, laboratory selection, testing methods and procedures, and verification of test results.
1.	Drug Testing
a.	Drug tests are conducted using urine specimens. In accordance with CDL standards, the County will contract with a medical doctor trained in toxicology to act as an MRO (Medical Review Officer). In the case of positive tests, the MRO will attempt to contact employees to review preliminary positive test results with employees and any relevant health care providers before the results are reported to the County. Based on his or her professional judgment, he or she may change the preliminary test result to negative. The County will not be able to distinguish a test result that is negative by MRO intervention from any other negative result.
b.	In addition to compliance with federal guidelines, the following safeguards will also be applied:
i.	Test results will be issued by the MRO or the testing laboratory only to the County’s Drug and Alcohol Policy Coordinator. The results will be sent by certified mail or hand-delivered to the employee within three (3) working days of receipt of results by the County.
ii.	Appeals. If an employee disagrees with the results of the alcohol or drug test, the employee may request, in writing, within five (5) days of receipt of test results, that the original sample be re-tested at the employee's expense by the testing laboratory. The result of any such retest will be deemed final and binding and not subject to any further test. Failure to make a timely written request for a retest shall be deemed acceptance of the test results. If an employee requests a retest, any disciplinary action shall be stayed pending the results of the re-testing.
2.	Alcohol Testing
a.	Alcohol tests are conducted using a breathalyzer screening test. Employees who test 0.02 or higher will be required to submit to a confirmation test. Test results will be issued only to the County’s Drug and Alcohol Policy Coordinator. The results will be sent by certified mail or hand-delivered to the employee within three (3) working days of receipt of the results by the County.
b.	Alcohol confirmation tests are considered final, they may not be appealed.
3.	Test reports are medical records, and will be handled according to applicable state and federal law and County Administrative Procedures which insure the confidentiality of such records.

This time period will increase accordingly if I am absent from work, for any reason, for a cumulative period of one (1) month or more. I understand that if I refuse to take a drug and/or alcohol test or if a test is positive, my employment will be terminated.
5.	I agree to return to work upon successful completion of an alcohol/drug rehabilitation program if my substance abuse counselor requires inpatient treatment.
6.	It is understood that this agreement constitutes a final warning.

I.	Sign-Up
A.	Vacation
The method of vacation selection shall be in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 and employees shall choose their vacation dates in order of County Seniority. Vacation selection shall either be made at the time of the annual shift bid or at a later date in a timely manner. Each unit manager shall provide a written policy for determining how many employees may be scheduled for vacation on any given day or shift and notify staff before the vacation sign-up begins.
At their discretion, managers may make necessary modifications during the year to accommodate the needs of their individual units when circumstances beyond their control occur, such as budget cuts, layoffs or unexpected vacancies. Management will grant additional leave requests after the vacation sign-up is completed on a first come, first serve basis within their established written guidelines.
B.	Shift and Vacancy
1.	Programs Unit
Filling a vacancy that occurs as a result of a change in work assignment within the work unit, a change in shift, or as a result of a vacancy (as defined by Article 22.I.A-D) shall be based on job class seniority. Work Assignment is defined as work site location which is a MCSO facility (MCDC, MCIJ, WAPATO). Work Unit is defined as the Programs Unit within the Business Services Division in MCSO. Shift is defined by both the hours and the days worked either on or off (i.e. “C” shift Tuesday-Saturday or “C” shift Sunday/Monday off).
There shall be an annual sign-up for work location, shift and days off by job class seniority as defined by Article 2.VI, for all MCSO Corrections Counselors and separately for all MCSO Corrections Technicians for placement to occur at the beginning of the calendar year. If a vacancy occurs (as defined by Article 22.I) or a need arises to change shifts, days off or work location other than at the beginning of the calendar year, then the provisions of Article 22.VI.A apply so that management will seek qualified volunteers based on job class seniority. If there are no volunteers, the least senior qualified employee changes work location, shift or days off. Or if a ninety (90)-day or less vacancy occurs, Article 22.II.A applies so that management can make a short term assignment (as defined in that Article) at their discretion. All other provisions of Article 22 shall apply.
2.	All 24/7 Units
a. All twenty-four (24) hour, seven (7) day a week units in the Sheriff’s Office will bid annually for shifts and days off in the following manner unless otherwise indicated:
i.	Annual shift bids and days off shall be

posted two (2) weeks before the sign-up begins at each work location along with an updated list of staff members by their job classification seniority.
ii.	The annual shift bid will begin no later than December 1st of every year. If the annual shift bid cannot begin by December 1st, the manager of that unit will notify the union in writing by November 30th.
iii.	Each employee will have no more than two (2) complete shifts to make their selection of shift and days off. However, the bid shall be given to the next member as soon as possible after signing up to expedite the process. If a member is on his/her days off, the bid will stop and wait for their return.
iv.	Employees who will be gone on a leave of absence, other leave or vacation of three (3) or more days will submit in writing to their manager three (3) choices for shift and days off, numbering them by one (1) being their first choice, two (2) being their second choice and three (3) being their third choice for available shifts and vacation days. Members shall be allowed to call or authorize their manager to call them at home to sign-up if they are gone for more than three (3) days during the shift bid process.
v.	New shifts will be implemented no later than the following February 1st, annually.
vi.	Employees in the Auxiliary Services unit will additionally be afforded an opportunity to express a preference for work assignment and or location; provided however, that final determination in these matters is management’s discretion.
II.	Shift Trades (Time Exchanges)
Shift trades shall be allowable subject to the terms and conditions of Special Order 99-17 dated June 1, 1999.
III.	Uniforms
Records Unit employees required to wear uniforms shall receive, upon hire into the unit, a uniform allowance of one hundred dollars ($100) and thereafter all requests for additional uniforms shall be approved by MCSO Records Unit Manager prior to ordering.

ADDENDUM J
SCHOOL BASED EMPLOYEES
I. The purpose of this Addendum is to set forth certain understandings between the parties concerning terms applicable to the limited duration layoff, summer work and recall of employees in the Health Department and the Department of County Human Services who work in School Based positions.
A.	School based bargaining unit members who verify to the program manager a combination of work and vacation by May 7 to be in a paid status equal to their budgeted FTE throughout the summer, shall not be laid off.
B.	Bargaining unit members who do not have work available in their ten (10) month school based work site or who choose not to work outside of their school based site will be laid off during school closure for the summer.
C.	Bargaining unit members who are laid off may be called back as regular employees as provided in Section H. Summer Work/Effect of Refusal. Effective July 1, 2011, ten (10) month employees, upon recall, shall no longer realize a loss of seniority due to the two (2) months annual layoff. This shall only affect the calculation of their countywide seniority date.
D.	Limitation on Bumping and Recall from School Based
1.	Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, bumping by or recall of bargaining unit members who, for administrative purposes, are inside the County’s school based program shall be limited to positions inside the school based program if the County declares in writing at the time layoff notice is given to the affected employee that the layoff is of limited duration due to summer school closure.
2.	If business needs require the County to reduce a school based position from twelve (12) months to ten (10) months, the County will first look for volunteers among the twelve (12) month employees in the affected classification to determine whether there are any employees willing to have a reduced schedule. If there are no volunteers willing to change to ten (10) month schedule, the twelve (12) month school based employee with the lowest Countywide seniority date in the affected classification will be reduced.
E.	Administrative Purposes Defined
For purposes of this section “administrative purposes” means that the employee ordinarily files his or her payroll time sheet with the school based program.
F.	Deviation from Seniority Order for Layoff or Recall/Effect on Seniority and Insurance Benefits
When implementing limited duration layoff or recall from such layoff the County may deviate from the normal order of seniority layoff or recall otherwise required by the parties’ collective bargaining agreement. Such deviation shall not be for a period exceeding seven (7) calendar days. A more senior employee who would have been

retained or recalled but for the departure from normal seniority order of layoff or recall may use vacation or leave without pay for the period between the date he or she would have bumped or been recalled under normal procedures and the effective date of the general school based health summer layoff or recall as determined by the School Based Manager. In addition, such employees will accrue seniority and be eligible for medical and dental insurance coverage as though they were laid off or recalled in accordance with normal layoff or recall procedures.
G.	Probationary Employees
The probationary period of an employee on probation when a limited duration layoff takes effect shall be frozen over the summer and shall resume, if the employee is recalled to work, at the commencement of the next school year. This shall not apply if the County notifies the employee that his or her probationary service has been terminated.
H.	Summer Work/Effect of Refusal
Bargaining unit members in School Based Program who perform bargaining unit work for the County while on limited duration layoff during summer school closure shall be paid at the same wage step they held when the limited duration layoff took effect. They shall also be employed pursuant to the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement and receive all benefits/entitlements specified in the collective bargaining agreement as they do during the regular school year with the exception of “Section IV” of Article 21 and Article 11 Health and Welfare Benefits (see “Section M” of this Addendum for health and welfare benefits coverage). Employees on limited duration layoff who are working are not eligible for lead pay unless working in a lead assignment in school based program. An employee may refuse to accept work that is offered, with the understanding that such refusal may affect eligibility for unemployment compensation.
I.	Layoff or Carryover of Accumulated Vacation
Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, an employee subject to limited duration layoff in school based program may request payoff of some or all of his or her accumulated vacation. Such request shall be made in writing to the School Based Manager, the Department’s Human Resource manager and Payroll Supervisor of the Department of County Management within three (3) days after the employee receives notice of limited duration layoff. In the absence of such notice, vacation will be carried on the books over the summer unless the employee is subsequently terminated or resigns. In such case, normal provisions relating to vacation payoff shall apply.
J.	Considerations in Use of Vacation
Notwithstanding Subsection H or Article 8, “Section V” above, the parties acknowledge that although requests to take vacations during the school year may in some cases be granted, the risk that management will deny such a request is significantly greater than in other county operations, due to the need to provide services to students when schools are in session. For that reason, School Based Program Employees are encouraged to continue to select vacation times during Christmas and spring school vacations to the extent approved by management. Further, employees

facing limited duration layoff should take into account the limited availability of time off when schools are in session, the vacation accumulation ceilings set forth in this agreement, and the risk of forfeiture of vacation (when accumulation ceilings are reached) when deciding whether to carry their accumulated balance forward.
K.	Alternative Compensation
The Board of County Commissioners may adopt and implement a uniform policy whereby employees who transfer or are newly hired into the school based program are required as a condition of such transfer or hire to sign an agreement accepting the payment of County medical and dental insurance premiums in lieu of government unemployment insurance payments during the period of a limited duration layoff due to summer closure.
L.	Alternative Benefits
If the State of Oregon adopts a law which uniformly disqualifies employees on a limited duration layoff from receiving unemployment insurance, even if they are available for and actively seeking suitable interim employment, the County and Union agree to meet to negotiate over the terms of possible alternative benefits or compensation to cover that period of unemployment. This shall be construed only as contractual authorization for such a policy. This shall not be construed as a purported waiver by the union of individual employee rights under the Oregon unemployment compensation statute.
M.	Insurance Benefits for Summer Work
If the employee’s last regularly scheduled workday in pay status falls on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the calendar month in which the employee begins limited duration layoff, medical/vision and dental benefits toward which the County has contributed will lapse at the end of that month. If such work day falls after the fifteenth (15th) of the calendar month in which the employee begins limited duration layoff, coverage toward which the County has contributed will lapse at the end of the following calendar month. (Example: Employee A’s last day is July 15th: Employee A’s coverage toward which the County has contributed will lapse July 31st. Employee B’s last day is July 16th. Employee B’s coverage toward which the County has contributed will lapse August 31st.) Employees will be treated as a regular employee for purposes of receiving health benefits per Article 11 provided they work a minimum of two (2) shifts from July 16 through July 31.
N.	Supplemental Life and Short Term Disability Insurance
The County agrees to apply for the “teacher’s waiver” so that employees laid off as the result of limited duration layoff who are rehired within ninety (90) days will be reinstated with supplemental life and short term disability insurance that was in force at the time of layoff.
O.	Grievances
Any dispute over the meaning, interpretation or application of this Addendum shall be resolved through the grievance procedure set forth in Article 18.
P.	Holidays

unit regularly assigned to the School Based Program/School Based Mental Health Program who request and are granted time off for any scheduled school closure, including but not limited to the school winter vacation closure, spring vacation closure, teacher inservice days, or any other scheduled school closure, will be permitted, upon advance written request, to use leave without pay without first exhausting paid vacation, Saved Holiday time and/or compensatory time off. Employees who take such period as an authorized, unpaid leave of absence during the winter vacation closure shall receive their Christmas and New Years Holiday pay even though they are not in pay status on the days before and after such holidays. Unscheduled closures, such as those due to weather events, building safety issues, or any other unscheduled closures are not covered by this provision and are subject to the contract provisions and county personnel rules for building or office closures due to inclement weather and natural disasters.
