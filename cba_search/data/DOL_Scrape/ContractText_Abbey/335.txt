The employee shall be made whole by payment to him of an amount equal to the total overtime premium hours credited to the highest employee within the overtime category, minus the sum of sixteen (16) overtime premium hours and the employee's total overtime premium hours credited, multiplied by such individuals rate at time of filing of the grievance.
(c)	If, at the end of the six (6) months period, no grievance has been filed, it is agreed that this period will be considered equalized and no liability may be imposed upon the Employer for the cited period.
(2)	Employees entering or reentering an occupational title will be credited with the "average" total overtime of the pertinent category of that occupational title.
(3)	When employees progress into the skilled mechanic category, they will be credited with the "average" total overtime of that category.
(4)	Overtime work involving employees represented by Local 106, OPEIU, will be distributed by occupational title by shift by Department.

The Employer will not change an employee's normal or regular shift to equalize overtime and/or correct an inequality. The Employer will furnish the President of the Metal Trades Council every two (2) months a report of all employees whose shift has been changed.
EXAMPLES
A.	A second shift employee completes the probationary period and is assigned a starting average of the "Average Premium Hours” of the second shift (200 hours). Six months later the employee is transferred to 1st shift where the "Average Premium Hours" of the pertinent category are 120. The transferred employee now has "Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" or 252 consisting of:
32 "Overtime Premium Hours Paid"
12 "Overtime Premium Hours Refused'
24 "Overtime Premium Hours
(No Show 8 hrs. x 3)"
200 "Start Average"
268 Total Overtime Premium
Hours Credited"
In this case the employee's starting average would be reduced to 68 hours making the employee's "Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" equal to the "Average Premium Hours" of the pertinent shift.
32 "Overtime Premium Hours Paid"
12 "Overtime Premium Hours Refused'
24 "Overtime Premium Hours
(No Show 8 hrs. x 3)"
68 "Start Average"
136 'Total Overtime Premium Hours
Credited"
B.	In this example a second shift employee has 262 Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" consisting of:
160 "Overtime Premium Hours Paid"
32 "Overtime Premium Hours Refused’
21
16 "Overtime Premium Hours
(No Show)"
54 "Start Average"
262 "Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited"
The employee is transferred to first shift where the "Average Premium Hours" of the pertinent category are 120. In this case the entire starting average would be removed to reduce the employee's "Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" to 208 as shown below:
160 "Overtime Premium Hours Paid"
32 "Overtime Premium Hours Refused"
16 "Overtime Premium Hours
(No Show)"
0 "Start Average"
208 Total Overtime Premium Hours
Credited"
This employee would not be asked to work until the "Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" for other employee(s) in the category increased enough to make the person eligible.
C.	Employees who are transferred to a shift where their Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" are less than the "Average Premium Hours'1 of the pertinent category will be given an average to make them equal to that pertinent category.
(6)	Employees who are absent on Friday, regardless of reason, shall be charged with the applicable amount of "refused overtime" based on the overtime assignment that would have been offered had the employee been at work.
(7)	Letters of April 1, 1977 and September 22,1977 between the parties are re-executed and incorporated in their entirety (except for names and titles) in this Article.
(8)	Employees transferred from restricted duty and suspense departments to regular duty will be credited for purposes of overtime equalization with the Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" at the time of their return (excluding their prior starting average) or the average Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" ("Average Premium Hours") of the pertinent category of the occupational title and shift, whichever is greater. Where their Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" are less

Section 3.	General
A.	Policy - The basic intent of this Article is to ensure that an hourly employee will not lose wages as a result of travel required on Company business which occurs during the employee's regular hours of employment. Travel by hourly employees on Company business is usually required during the normal work shift and during the normal workweek;
36
however, Company business objectives may make deviations from this policy necessary.
B.	Travel Authorization - Determination of the need, method, and length of travel, the amount of cash advance, and justification of expenses are subject to approval by the cognizant Staff Manager or his designated alternate. The method of travel used is based on consideration of transportation costs, subsistence expenses, conflict of schedules, and the importance of the time element. A properly completed Cash Advance/Travel Order (84-00-0888) constitutes authorization to travel on Company business but it is not necessary for sea trials and for local trips within a 75 mile radius of the employee's normal work site unless meals and/or lodging expense will be incurred.
C.	Transportation Allowances - If travel by public transportation is authorized by the Company, arrangements must be made through the Travel Section. Time allowed for travel by common carrier will be actual time required.
(1)	Air Travel.
(a) Travel by commercial airlines will be coach class with the following exception: Travel plans cannot be delayed and coach class is not available; requires approval on the cash advance/travel order by the Director of Administration.

Chartered aircraft may be authorized in unusual circumstances. Only the Electric Boat Corporation President or a member of his staff may authorize travel by chartered aircraft.
The use of personal aircraft will not be authorized for travel.
(2)	Rail Travel. The allowance for rail travel is the actual expenditure. A reserved seat is allowed on trips exceeding 150 miles in one direction. A roomette is allowed for overnight travel.
(3)	Travel by Personal Automobile. If use of a personal automobile for travel to a new assignment on Company business is authorized, travel allowances will be paid at the rates stipulated in SP 8-2, currently thirty-six cents (.36) for automobile and eleven cents (.11) for motorcycle. This mileage allowance is for travel to and from the place of
37
assignment only, and no mileage will be authorized for normal travel to and from work at the new area of assignment.
Allowable mileage will be computed on the basis of the most recent Rand-McNally Standard Mileage Chart measured from the point authorized on the cash advance/travel order to location of new assignment or actual mileage traveled to location of new assignment, whichever is less.
Allowable travel time by personal automobile will be actual travel time required, not to exceed the number of days established by dividing 350 into the total mileage of the most direct route as shown in the most current edition of the Rand-McNally Highway Mileage Chart.
Parking and toll charges incurred during travel to location of new assignment and return travel, which are incidental to the use of a personal automobile, are reimbursable and must be itemized on the Employee Expense Voucher (84-00-0167). Receipts are required for expenditures of $5.00 or more.

Volunteers within the occupational title will be laid off before any other employee. If there are more volunteers for layoff than required, the most senior volunteers will be selected. Once employees have been notified of layoff, no further volunteers will be considered unless the affected employees agree that their layoff be canceled. Employees who volunteer for layoff under these circumstances will be required to sign an agreement waiving their right to be laid off in seniority order and informing them of their layoff and recall rights. Employees who sign this agreement will not be permitted to revoke it thereby forcing another employee to be laid off. If such employees subsequently accept temporary recall for a period of six (6) months or less, they will not be permitted to displace less senior employees when they are laid off at the conclusion of the temporary recall.
58
Section 4. Loss of Seniority
A.	When an employee fails to report absence from work within five (5) working days unless such employee can furnish a reason satisfactory to the Employer for not so reporting. An employee who fails to report, as provided herein, will receive a certified letter from the Employer, and unless such Employee can furnish, within three (3) days from the date of mailing, a reason satisfactory to the Employer for not so reporting, he will be terminated.
B.	All employees on layoff status will be required to register with the Employer, either in person or in writing, once every six (6) months in order to retain recall rights. The registration periods are January 1-15 and July 1-15 of each calendar year. Failure to register within these defined periods will cause the employee to lose all recall rights under the Agreement.
Thirty (30) calendar days prior to the above registration periods the Company will notify all employees with recall rights by certified letter of their obligation to comply with the registration requirement.
C.	Failure to return at the expiration of an authorized leave of absence.
D.	After an employee is absent due to lack of work for more than thirty (30) consecutive months. Employees on recall status shall keep Employer informed of current address.
E.	(1) If an employee voluntarily quits, is discharged for cause or is retired under the provisions of Article XV.
(2) Whenever an employee is laid off and is subsequently rehired into another occupational title, the employee shall be required to satisfactorily complete a probationary period of ninety (90) calendar days from the date of rehire. This new probationary period is only to determine the employee's suitability in the new job. The employee shall be eligible for overtime assignments during this probationary period.
Seniority shall be credited in accordance with Article XXII, Section 5, Paragraph G(l) from the date of rehire.
59
Seniority and recall in the title from which originally laid off shall not be lost:
(a)	If the employee voluntarily quits (excluding resignation in lieu of discharge) within thiny (30) days of the date of rehire.
(b)	Within ninety (90) days of rehire, it shall be management's right to remove any rehired employee whose performance is deemed unsatisfactory. Any such removal will not be subject to arbitration.
F. Any employee who has been, or is, promoted or transferred out of the bargaining unit to a salaried non-supervisory position.
Sections. Retention of Seniority
Employees shall accrue seniority when they are on:
A.	Military Service/Reserve Duty, Article XIX.
B.	Authorized Leaves of Absence, Article XVII.
C.	Vacations, Article XVI.
D.	Jury Duty, Article XVIII.
E.	Sick Leave, Article XX.
F.	Plant Shutdown, Article XVI.
G.	Periods of Layoff which do not exceed thirty (30) consecutive months when recall registration has been maintained as required by Section 4.B-
(1)	When employees are rehired into another occupational title during the thirty month period, their service time in the new occupational title (up to thirty months) shall be temporarily credited in that title for purposes of layoff. If such employees are laid off again, they shall have recall rights to their original title only.
60
(2)	(a) If any employee covered by paragraph (1) refiises recall to their original title, seniority in the new occupational title shall be the date of rehire for purposes of layoff and recall. Such employee shall retain all other rights and benefits based on total service with the Employer.
(b) Any employee who declines an offer of recall to a position for a period of thirty (30) calendar days or less will not lose his recall rights.
(3)	If any employee loses his recall rights because the Employer was unable to recall him, the employee will then be credited with all of the service time he has accrued within that Local Union for purposes of layoff and recall. If the employee was rehired into a different Local Union, such employee shall retain all other rights and benefits based on total service with the Employer.
(4)	When an employee is laid off from a premium title, he will have all of the service time he has accrued within that Local Union for seniority when applying for a transfer to another premium title. On the date of transfer the employee will have all of the service time he has accrued within that Local Union for seniority. However, by transferring the employee waives his recall rights to his former premium title.
H.	Medical Transfers.
(1) Whenever an employee is transferred for medical reasons and the medical limitations are eliminated or altered sufficiently to permit the employee to resume working in their former occupational title, such employee will then be returned, seniority permitting, and credited with all the seniority that would have been accrued had the employee not been medically transferred. (This provision will be applied retroactively to December 31,1984, for all employees thus affected.)
In the event a reduction in the workforce becomes necessary affecting the above mentioned employees, these employees shall be returned to their status in the suspense department they came from. This is not
61
considered a layoff. However, the parlies agree the reduction will be accomplished by seniority.
The Company agrees when a light duty opening occurs, first consideration for that opening will be given to the senior qualified employee on the applicable light duty list of employees with the necessary physical capacities. If the Union objects to the medical restrictions placed on an employee by the yard hospital it must grieve within twenty (20) working days of notice of the restriction to the employee.
Section 6. General Provisions
A.	Probationary Period: All new employees of the Employer shall be required to satisfactorily complete a probationary period of one hundred-eighty (180) calendar days from the date of hire before attaining any seniority status. If an employee is retained on the active payroll, the employee's seniority shall be computed from his date of hire. If such employee transfers to an occupational title within the jurisdiction of the same local union during probation, his seniority date shall be computed from date of hire- If the employee transfers to an occupational title outside the jurisdiction of his own local during probation, his seniority will be computed from the date of the transfer. Employees in the probationary period have recourse to the Grievance Procedure in all matters except discharge. The provisions of this section do not apply to the apprenticeship program.

If a reduction in the work force should occur during this six (6) month period, the employee will be subject to layoff on the basis of his seniority in his original occupational title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an individual who transfers to a
premium title within the jurisdiction of the same Local Union will have all of the service time he has accrued within that Local Union as of the date of transfer.
(b) In cases of transfer or promotion between occupational titles within the jurisdiction of one Local Union, the senior qualified employee shall have preference over other employees provided he possesses the necessary qualifications to perform the work in the occupational title where the opening occurs.
(2)	(a) Employees transferring between occupational titles represented by different Local Unions of the Metal Trades Council shall have seniority in the occupational title to which they are transferred as of date of transfer for purposes of layoff and recall. Such employees shall receive fringe benefits under this Agreement based on total seniority since their most recent date of hire.
(0) In case of transfer or promotion between Local Unions, senior qualified employees within the bargaining unit shall be given the opportunity for such transfer and/or promotion before any new employees are hired into the occupational title where the opening exists.
(3)	It is understood and agreed that no employees will be transferred into any occupational title within the bargaining unit where there are employees on layoff status with recall rights.
(4)	Seniority Lists: The Employer agrees to provide the Metal Trades Council a seniority list of employees in the bargaining unit on the basis of occupational titles defined in Appendix A each January and July during the term of this Agreement.
(5)	Any employee who is transferred to a job represented by another Union, and is subsequently returned to the bargaining unit, shall have seniority as of the date of his return.
63
(6)	Any employee who is transferred out of the bargaining unit to the MDA-UAW Design Work Category and is subsequently laid off and transferred back to the occupational title from which he was transferred shall be credited with full bargaining unit seniority accumulated up to the time of leaving the bargaining unit.
The laid off employee may re-enter his occupational title in the bargaining unit provided his former bargaining unit seniority is greater than any employee on layoff status with recall rights in that occupational title.
This provision is limited to employees who transferred to the MDA-UAW Design Work Category between June 4, 1995 (or who were enrolled in Drafter Training Class #5) and December 7, 1997 (or who were enrolled in Drafter Training Class #35).

(2)	The Company will post the opening for a period of ten (10) working days in accordance with past practice.
(3)	The notice, if not filled, will expire no later than nine (9) months from the effective date of the posting. The Company may issue a new notice pursuant to paragraph (1) within a nine (9) month period. However, the new notice will automatically cancel and supersede the prior notice.
Premium to Premium Title Transfers
(1)	Employees wishing to transfer from one premium title to another will be required to apply through the normal premium posting procedure. They will be integrated by seniority into the posting list along with non-premium applicants from the same local.
(2)	In the event of a layoff in a premium title, affected employees will regress to the last non-premium title held, within the bargaining unit, seniority permitting.
(3)	For premium to premium transfers, resulting from a posting, a lateral transfer memo is not required.
E.	The occupational titles of Construction Mechanic, Laborer, Custodian, and Janitor will be combined for purposes of layoff and recall, but not for medical transfers as defined in Article XXII, Section 5H of the 1991-1995 collective bargaining agreement.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING 2C
Prefunding of Post-Retirement Medical Benefits
Before the expiration of the Agreement, the Company may establish a welfare benefit fund to facilitate the funding of post-retirement medical benefits payable under this Agreement and prior agreements between the Union and the Company. The establishment and existence of such a fund shall in no way expand or diminish any individual's right to post-retirement medical benefit coverage. Instead, it shall only serve as a vehicle for more expeditious funding of post-retirement medical benefits.
The Company may then contribute to the welfare benefit fund established under this proposal.
The Company, if it creates such a fund, may elect to use a tax-exempt trust under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(9) (also known as a "VEBA") to fund any post-retirement medical benefits provided under this Agreement or prior agreements and may take any actions necessary with respect to establishment or administration or operation of such a welfare benefit fund. However, except to the extent permitted or required by law without application of the excise tax set forth in Section 4976 of the Internal Revenue Code, no assets of the welfare benefit fund shall ever revert or inure to the Company's benefit although the funds accumulated thereunder may be otherwise used for the benefit of the Company's employees as permitted by law or regulation.

109
Effective on the date of the Agreement, any employee who continues to work for the Company beyond age 65 will continue to accrue credited service under the plan while actively employed until the employee actually retires. With respect to employees who are actively at work on the date of the Agreement and are over 65 on that date, they will receive credited service for all periods of active employment worked with the Company after attaining age 65. Retirement benefits will not be paid until employees over age 65 actually retire from active service. The parties further understand that the government agencies administering the age discrimination laws recognize that costs of such benefit plans as group life insurance, optional life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, health expense benefits program, accident and sickness coverage, and dental program may increase for those employees age 65 or older. Interpretations concerning provisions of those benefit plans to employees age 65 and over have been issued. In accordance with these interpretations, the Company Plans are amended as follows:
A.	Basic Life Insurance Paid by Company. Continue on same basis as prior to age 65.
B.	Optional Life Insurance. Continue on same basis as prior to age 65.
C.	Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance Paid by Company. Continue on same basis as prior to age 65.
D.	Accident and Sickness Weekly Disability Benefits. Continue equivalent coverage as established for employee under age 65 but integrate benefits payable with any Social Security payments received while on disability.
E.	Dental Plan Paid by Company. Continue on same basis as prior to age 65.
F.	Medical Plan
1.	Employees age 65 and older; spouse age 65 and older will continue on the same basis as prior to age 65. If an employee elects Medicare coverage and rejects Company’s medical coverage (including HMO Plan coverage). Medicare will be the employee’s and eligible dependent's
110
only medical coverage and the Company would then reimburse the employee for the standard "Part B" Medicare contribution for employee and dependent until the date the employee actually retires.
2.	Spouses under age 65, regardless of the employee's age, will be covered under the plan of benefits for dependents of active employees under age 65.
3.	Spouses 65 and over of employees under age 65 will be covered under the plan of benefits for dependents of active employees under age 65.
G.	Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees. Coverage as set forth in Memorandum of Understanding 3.
H.	Savings and Stock Investment Plan For Hourly Employees. Continue on same basis as prior to age 65.
I.	Other Benefits such as Vacation, Holidays, Sick Leave as set forth in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Continue on same basis as prior to age 65.
From time to time the Company will review its experience and determine if the per capita cost to provide a benefit or insurance program (other than medical benefits coverage), for employees 65 or older is greater than the per capita cost for the hourly employees under age 65 (in the age class specified by government regulations) and employed by the Company. If the cost for any one such benefit, or insurance program is greater, then the Company will, at its option, have the right to change that benefit or insurance program, adjust or eliminate any payments or reimbursement so that, to the extent permitted by law, the cost to the Company will be no greater than the cost it incurs for the hourly employees under age 65 (in the age class specified by government regulations) and employed by the Company.

3.	The Company will utilize versatility to enhance productivity and to reduce disruption caused by workload fluctuation. It will not be used for the purpose of depopulating local unions. The Company will endeavor to maintain historical ratios between locals consistent with construction schedules. If the Union believes that the Company has violated any provision of this paragraph, it will provide written notice of such violation to the Director of Labor Relations. The Company will have thirty (30) days to remedy the violation. If the Union is not satisfied with the Company's remedial action it may initiate a grievance under the provisions of Article VI.

F. Dispute-resolution procedures:
1.	Disputes relating to Article XL, this Memorandum and/or Appendix A will first be raised, by the employee or Local Union involved, with (he MTC. If the MTC determines to pursue the matter after investigation and review, it shall (within 20 working days from the date of knowledge of the occurrence or knowledge of the failure of the occurrence of the incident upon which the dispute is based) provide Labor Relations with a Fact Sheet or a 'Notice of Violation", as the case may be, giving written notice of the existence of such dispute. The MTC shall provide the Company with sufficient information to
130
properly investigate and/or respond to the dispute. Labor Relations will investigate Fact Sheets and "Notices of Violation" which have been filed.
2.	In the case of a regular grievance filed under the procedures of Article VI alleging a violation of any provision of the Agreement other than Article XL or this Memorandum, the Company may elect that such grievance be processed and resolved under the procedures of this Memorandum unless the grievance states, or the Union thereafter stipulates, that the Union does not challenge the propriety of any assignment of work. If the Union claims that the effect of properly-conducted work assignments was to violate occupational title seniority rights, such grievance may be processed and resolved under Article VI.
3.	Designated representatives of the MTC and Labor Relations shall meet, no less than monthly, to attempt to resolve such disputes.- At such meetings, the parties will discuss all Fact Sheets and "Notices of Violations" filed 30 days or more prior to the date of the meeting. If at such meetings the Union presents the results of its factual investigation and its reasons for believing that a particular assignment was violative. Company will provide the Union with the results of its factual investigation and its position as to whether a violation occurred and its reasons if any why the assignment was permissible.
4.	If no resolution of a specific dispute is thus achieved, or if Labor Relations should refuse to meet with MTC representatives on a monthly basis, then the MTC may within 20 working days of the meeting described in Paragraph F (3) schedule such grievance for arbitration as provided below, by giving the Company written notice thereof. If any Fact Sheet or "Notice of Violation” is not scheduled for arbitration within the time provided above it shall be "administratively closed," which shall be without precedent to future assignment disputes but with prejudice to the specific Fact Sheet or "Notice of Violation" thus administratively closed.
5.	Such grievance shall be resolved by expedited arbitration by a standing Arbitrator (who is willing to
131
serve on a continuing basis), who has shipyard-related experience and who is to be selected by mutual agreement (through the A, A. A, processes if need be) and will after the issuance of his first decision continue to serve by mutual agreement.
6.	Where an Award by the standing Arbitrator holds that in a particular instance the Company committed a violation relating to Article XL, Memo 11 and/or Appendix A, there shall be no monetary remedy imposed but the standing Arbitrator shall only issue a cease-and-desist order which identifies the prohibited work performed, occupational title to which the assignment was made, occupational title claiming the work, and such other factual circumstances (such as location, duration, equipment, processes, etc.) as the standing Arbitrator decides are determinative. Each such cease-and-desist Award shall take effect 20 working days after notice to the Company of the Award.
7.	If the Union claims that the Company thereafter violates a prior cease-and-desist Award:
(a)	The Union shall file a written "Notice of Violation" (identifying the prior Award in question) in accordance with, and which shall be processed through, the provisions of Paragraphs F.I., 3. and 4. above.
(b)	The Company may at any time elect that any "Notice of Violation" filed shall be heard in immediate arbitration on specially-scheduled dates within ten (10) working days or as nearly thereto as may be feasible by written Company notice to the Union and the standing Arbitrator, which hearing shall not displace any date established for the hearing of an initial dispute under Paragraph F.4. or a "Notice of Violation" scheduled for hearing by the Union under this Paragraph F.7.
ft) If any "Notice of Violation" is pursued to arbitration (by either Company or Union election), the prior cease-and-desist Award in question may not be invoked by the Union or used by the standing Arbitrator as a basis for finding a repeat violation or imposing any
132
monetary remedy unless the subsequent disputed assignment involves the same work performed, occupational title performing the work, occupational title claiming the work and other determinative factual circumstances (such as location, duration, equipment, processes, etc.) as the prior cease-and-desist Award; provided, that the Union shall not be precluded, in an appropriate case as determined by the standing Arbitrator, from demonstrating to the standing Arbitrator that in the context of the specific work involved the particular occupational title performing the work should be regarded as immaterial to the propriety of the assignment; in such event the dissimilarity of performing titles shall not alone constitute a bar to invoking or using the prior cease-and-desist award as a basis for monetary remedy.
(d) If the standing Arbitrator determines that the pnor Award was violated, the Company shall pay the Union on an hour-for-hour basis for each hour the assignment (or portion thereof) found to be violative is proved to have been performed, provided that the Company shall not be monetarily liable for any period of performance prior to the date which is 5 days before the "Notice of Violation" was filed. Such payment shall be at the applicable rate in effect at the time of the assignment for the occupational title claiming the work (including the overtime rate to the extent that the work was performed on an overtime basts).
8.	For all arbitrations of disputes relating to Article XL, this Memorandum and/or Appendix A:
(a)	The standing Arbitrator shall be without power to change, alter or amend the language of the contract or this Memorandum, and the decision of the standing Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties.
(b)	The Company need not respond to, and the standing Arbitrator shall not decide, any dispute which is determined by the standing Arbitrator not to have been first processed in the manner
133
and within the time limits described above, provided that the time limits set forth above may be extended by the parties themselves by mutual agreement in writing.
(c)	Such arbitrations shall be separate from, and not in any way interfere with, postpone or replace any arbitration case scheduled or processed under the standard contractual arbitration procedure.
(d)	The standing Arbitrator shall issue his decision 45 workmg days after the close of the hearing.
(e)	The Company and the Union shall equally share the fees and expenses of the standing Arbiirator and hearing officers.
(I The purpose of this Agreement is a good-faith effort to improve productivity without eliminating fundamental craft jurisdiction. The Company and the Union agree to strive to improve labor management relations and communications so that incipient problems can be dealt with and resolved before they reach major proportions.

With or without agreement, the Company will post the vacancy. Candidates from the affected Flexibility Group will be jointly evaluated by the Company and the Local Union. If there is disagreement over who is qualified, the Company may proceed with the selection.
Employees in premium occupational titles are eligible to apply for promotion to Trade Technician. They will be promoted in seniority order from groups of qualified applicants.
Promotion to Trade Technician will be based on seniority in the group of qualified applicants. If the Union disagrees with the qualification criteria or the application of these criteria to the applicants, it may pursue this disagreement through the grievance procedure and arbitration.

In settlement of grievances M-l 00-93 and M-147-93 the Union and the Company agree to the following regarding the consolidation of Toolmaker and ISM Tool Grinder occupational titles:
145

Toolmaker and Tool Grinder occupational titles will be consolidated into the Toolmaker occupational title for the purposes of determining each affected employee’s contractual status including but not limited to seniority.

A.	Such payments do not constitute a Company agreement or admission that such "while engaged" payments are required;
B.	The Company reserves its right to discontinue the practice of making such "while engaged” payments within the Inside Machine Shop at the termination of the cunent labor agreement;
C.	The Union reserves its right to file and pursue an Article XL/Memo 11 fact sheet if the Company should discontinue such ISM "while engaged" wage payments; and
D.	This Agreement and the actions described herein are without precedent or prejudice to the positions of either party in any dispute, including any dispute described in paragraph 2(C) above, provided that either party may refer to this Agreement or use it as evidence, to the extent necessary to enforce its terms and meaning.

Overtime - Utilization of AT&A
During the negotiation of the 1995-1998 Agreement, the parties discussed ways to improve the existing overtime equalization system in order to ensure fairness in the distribution of overtime while reducing the administrative burden associated with record keeping.
The parties agreed to implement the following changes to the overtime distribution system and to make necessary changes to existing language if the AT&A or similar computer based system can be adapted for that purpose during the term of the 1995-1998 Agreement.
1.	On Monday of each week, the AT&A or similar system will be designed to query employees as to their willingness to support weekday extended shift as well as Saturday and/or Sunday overtime assignments.
2.	Failure to positively respond to this query by Thursday will result in a refusal being registered for employees who would have been scheduled to support overtime that week (those whose total credited hours are equal to or below the credited hours of the lowest individual who actually worked the assignment).
3.	Any employee who delays responding to the poll will not be considered for extended shift overtime assignments occurring on any day where opportunities would have been offered to that employee and will be charged the appropriate refusal hours as indicated above.
