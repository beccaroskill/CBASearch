U.S. UNION AFFAIRS:	NATIONAL FORD DEPARTMENT:
The Union, through its duly authorized representative, hereby certifies that the foregoing agreement between the Company and the Union was properly ratified by the membership on October 9th, 2008 and that the following provisions will govern the exercise of seniority.
7
SENIORITY AGREEMENT
It is mutually agreed between Ford Motor Company, Vehicle Operations, Kentucky Truck Plant and the International Union, UAW Local 862, Kentucky Truck Plant Unit on October 9th, 2008, that the following provisions will govern the exercise of seniority in the Kentucky Truck Plant in accordance with article VIII, Section 3 of the Master Agreement.
REDUCTIONS IN FORCE ON A TEAM
In the event of a reduction in force within a classification within a team, the least senior employee within that classification on that team will be reduced and placed on available work within the department, then by Natural Work Group, and then plant-wide.
In exercising this provision, it is understood that employees having the VAT relief designation are considered to be classified as Vehicle Assembly Technicians (VAT). It is also understood that employees having the Customer Acceptance Inspector (CAI) relief designation are considered to be classified as Customer Acceptance Inspectors (CAI).
REDUCTIONS IN FORCE - INSPECTOR CLASSIFICATION
Employees reduced from the Inspector classification shall exercise their seniority in the following manner:
Exercise their seniority within their Natural Work Group. If unable to exercise their seniority within their Natural Work Group then,
Exercise their seniority within the Line Inspectors. If unable to exercise their seniority within the Line Inspectors, then
Be placed on available work plant-wide in the Vehicle Assembly Technician classification with recall rights.
8
MATERIALS OCCUPATIONAL GROUP
The exercise of seniority in Materials Occupational Group will be governed by the present local seniority agreement for the following provisions:
It is understood that for purposes of recall, the most senior employee reduced from the A-2 classification will be recalled when an opening occurs in any A-2 classification. The classifications Stock Status Control and Follow-Up are included as designated classifications in the Materials Group and Production Control Group.
REDUCTIONS IN FORCE - MATERIAL CONTROLLERS
Employees reduced from the Material Controller classification shall exercise their seniority in the following manner:
Exercise their seniority within their Department. If unable to exercise seniority within their Department.
Exercise seniority with the A-2 Classifications. If unable to exercise seniority in the A-2 Classifications,
Be placed on available work plant-wide in the Vehicle Assembly Technician classification.
DESIGNATED CLASSIFICATIONS
The so-called “skilled” jobs in each occupational group shall be designated and the remaining job classifications in the group shall be undesignated.
In the designated jobs, employees in the first instance shall have seniority by job classification.
An employee in one designated job classification may not exercise his/her seniority against any other designated job classification in the occupational group except (1) certain designated classifications identified as A-l who shall first exercise their seniority against those designated classifications identified as A-2 within their occupational group. An employee on a designated
9
classification who has exhausted his/her seniority in his/her job classification shall first exercise his/her seniority in his/her department against the least senior employee in the undesignated classification. If his/her seniority is insufficient in his/her department, he/she shall then exercise his/her seniority against the least senior employee in an undesignated classification in his/her occupational group.
If he/she is unable to exercise his/her seniority in the undesignated classification in his/her occupational group, he/she shall then exercise his/her seniority against the least senior employee in any undesignated classification plant wide.
In the event of a cut in production, necessitating a reduction in force, the Company, upon an increase in production schedule, shall recall employees demoted from a designated job rather than promote an employee with greater seniority, provided he has not been accepted on another bid job though the job opening agreement.
An employee in a designated job classification in a group who is laid off shall not be recalled to his/her former job in a designated classification while there is a seniority employee in an undesignated job classification who can qualify for the designated job classifications under the provisions of the Kentucky Truck Plant Job Opening Agreement.
In the event an employee has been reduced from a designated job and then is laid off and is recalled to work in line of seniority within 30 calendar days from date of lay off, the employee will retain recall rights back to the former designated classification.
Unless otherwise specified in this agreement, employees reduced from a classified job will become VAT within that department with recall rights to that classification unless they become an accepted bidder on another classified job.
10
PLANT SERVICES GROUP
Permanent openings to be filled within the classification of cleaner/general will be posted for bid. Employees reduced from the classification of Cleaner-General (23-030070) will retain recall rights to that classification, unless they become a successful bidder on another job.
UNDESIGNATED CLASSIFICATIONS
In the event of a reduction in force, an employee in an undesignated job classification shall first exercise his/her seniority in his/her job classification within the department. If his/her seniority is insufficient in his/her job classification within the department, he/she shall then exercise seniority against the least senior employee in the group of undesignated classifications in his/her department and next against the least senior employee in the undesignated classifications in the occupational group and lastly against the least senior employee in any undesignated classification plant wide.
An employee on an undesignated bid job will retain no recall rights in the event he/she is reduced.

SHIFT/CREW PREFERENCE AGREEMENT
It is mutually agreed between the Ford Motor Company, Kentucky Truck Plant, and the International Union UAW Local 862, on October 9th, 2008 that the following provisions will govern shift/crew preference in the Kentucky Truck Plant in accordance with Article VIII, Section 28 of the Master Agreement.
1.	Employees may exercise their seniority with regard to their shift/crew preference at any time. Once the reassignment has been made, employees will not be permitted to exercise their right to shift/crew preference again for four (4) months.
2.	Employees shall submit their application for shift/crew change on the Hourly Preference System (HPS) on the Kentucky Truck Plant home page. Probationary employees are not eligible for shift preference during their probationary period.
3.	Shift/Crew preference assignments will be made by seniority within the classification within the natural workgroup.
4.	Employees will be notified of the bump at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the effective date of the bump.
5.	If there is a high concentration of bumps in one zone, then a satisfactory plan to move employees must be established and implemented.
6.	Timing for Shift/Crew Preference changes will be as follows:
5-Day Shift:
#	1 shift to #2 shift on Monday
#	1 shift to #3 shift on Monday
#	2 shift to #3 shift on Monday
#	2 shift to #1 shift on Monday
15
#	3 shift to #2 shift on Monday
#	3 shift to #1 shift on Monday
Crews:
A-Crew bump to C-Crew on Monday A-Crew bump to B-Crew on Tuesday B-Crew bump to A-Crew on Monday B-Crew bump to C-Crew on Monday C-Crew bump to B-Crew on Tuesday.
C crew person would not work on Monday night prior to bumping
C-Crew bump to A-Crew on Tuesday. Employee would work Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday on A-Crew. The employee would also be provided the opportunity to work on Friday (up to 40 hours of work available in the week of the bump)..
Shift to Crew/Crew to Shift:
#	1 shift to A Crew on Monday
#	1 shift to B Crew on Tuesday
#	1 shift to C Crew on Monday
#	2 shift to A Crew on Monday
#	2 shift to B Crew on Tuesday
#	2 shift to C Crew on Monday
#	3 shift to A Crew on Monday
#	3 shift to B Crew on Tuesday
#3 shift to C Crew on Monday

B Crew to #3 shift on Monday C Crew to #1 shift on Monday. Employee would not work the Sunday preceding the move. The employee would also be provided the opportunity to work
16
on Thursday of the week preceding the move.
C Crew to #2 shift on Monday.
Employee would not work the Sunday preceding the move. The employee would also be provided the opportunity to work on Thursday of the week preceding the move.
C Crew to #3 shift on Monday Alternate 4x 1 O’s Monday-Thursday schedule will be handled as the #2 & #3 shifts for purposes of shift/crew changes.
7.	In accordance with the above, all notifications shall be made within 30 calendar days following the date the employee submitted the request. However, the parties recognize the impact that employee movement has on safety, quality and cost. The Company recognizes that the intent is to complete shift/crew moves within thirty (30) days. Cases where this has not happened should be brought to the attention of the Labor Relations Supervisor for immediate resolution. Probationary employees shall be subject to shift roll during the calendar month following their hire in date. If the applicant does not have sufficient seniority to displace another employee on the shift of their choice, their application will remain active for six (6) months unless withdrawn by the applicant.
8.	Elected Team Leaders will be eligible to be “rolled” within their base classification in the Natural Work Group for which they are assigned.
9.	The Master Agreement recognizes that it is not possible to operate efficiently with all senior employees on any one shift. Therefore, seniority
17
alone cannot be the sole criteria in applying the above principle. When management finds that recognition of the expressed preference of employees would result in inefficiencies, the Union will be notified of the adjustment necessary and the manner in which it will be affected.
18
DURATION OF THE AGREEMENT
This agreement shall become effective concurrently with the effective date of any Collective Bargaining Agreement which replaces the September 15, 2003, Collective Bargaining Agreement and shall remain in effect for the same period as such new or extended Collective Bargaining Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.
In accordance with Article VIII, Section 28 of the Master Agreement, pertaining to local shift preference, this agreement is signed subject to the approval of the National Ford Department of the UAW and U.S. Union Affairs of the Company.

JOB OPENING AGREEMENT
It is mutually agreed between the Ford Motor Company, Kentucky Truck Plant, and the International Union UAW Local 862, on October 9th, 2008, that the following provisions will apply to the movement within and between teams and departments, including promotional and non-promotional job transfers in the Kentucky Truck Plant.
TEAM-TO-TEAM TRANSFER
When a permanent opening is to be filled within a department team, the department manager and district committeeperson will review the Hourly Preference System (HPS), team-to-team transfer list for employees within that department who have expressed a desire to transfer to another team. Movement between teams will be based on seniority and merit. When specialized skills are required on an open position, seniority and ability will be given first consideration along with merit. In selecting the individual for the opening, the individual’s ability will be reviewed by the department manager with the district committeeperson. In reviewing the individual’s qualifications, it will be jointly determined what type of training will be necessary to allow the employee to fill the position. The Company will provide the necessary training.
If there is disagreement over an employee’s merit or ability to transfer to an open position, the parties will conduct a joint interview of the employee to determine if assistance can be provided to correct whatever deficiency may exist. If the employee is willing to correct the problem, an opportunity to transfer to the open position will be afforded within 30 calendar days.

EQUALIZATION OF OVERTIME AND WORK OPPORTUNITY AGREEMENT
It is mutually agreed between the Ford Motor Company, Kentucky Truck Plant, and the International Union UAW Local 862, on October 9th, 2008, that the following provisions will apply to the equalization of overtime and work opportunities in the Kentucky Truck Plant.
Overtime Equalization
1.	When, in the judgment of management, a work opportunity is required for a specific area, the regular qualified employees assigned to the area will work such work opportunity. Qualified team members within the areas regularly performing the operations shall work such time. Work opportunities will be equalized among qualified team members.
2.	When, in the judgment of management, a work opportunity is necessary and requires less than a full complement of employees within a team, or where special skills are required, the Team Leader or supervisor will develop a list of low houred qualified employees on the team. A management representative and a union representative will review the equalization list and determine who works such time. All overtime assignments are subject to the approval of management. The qualified low houred employee will be given the opportunity to work.
3.	Superintendents or their designee will ensure equalization lists are posted and maintained for review by all team members.
4.	Superintendents or their designee, the Union representative, and Team members will resolve equalization issues that occur within the team.

34
on the equalization list, which will be posted in a prominent location within each team area. All hours will be recorded on the basis of hours paid, not hours worked.
6.	Employees who refuse each work opportunity for any reason shall be charged the number of hours that they would have been paid had they accepted the work providing the work was performed up to a cap of 12.0 hours per day.
7.	Employees who are properly scheduled for work (including regular scheduled workdays) and are AWOL (A orT code) will be charged double the number of hours they would have been paid.
8.	Hires, rehires, reinstates, and transfers to a team will assume the highest number of hours of anyone within the team unless the high houred employee has accumulated excessive hours as a result of working on special assignment. In such cases, the Superintendent or his designee and the Union Representative will identify the appropriate high houred employee.
9.	Employees absent for any reason (including vacation or personal days) except for bereavement, approved military duty, or jury duty will be charged for hours they would have been paid during the period of absence providing the work was performed.
10.	Loaned employees will be charged with all hours worked on their equalization list.
11.	Hours granted through the grievance procedure will be recorded on the employee’s equalization list.

35
and District Committeeperson.
13.	A copy of the computerized equalization list denoting all adjustments will be made available to the District Committee person.
14.	The VAT Relief will equalize overtime within the team they are assigned. If imbalances arise between the VAT and the VAT Relief, the Company and Union will meet on the subject to determine the best resolution.
15.	Any units off Chassis needing repair work will have this work performed by the Shop Repair. This does not include “no stock” items which are the responsibility of the team which missed the material.
16.	Employees on temporary classifications are not entitled to equalize in that classification. If all employees permanently classified on the team are offered the opportunity to work and additional employees are required, the temporarily classified employee may be utilized.
17.	All hours worked or refused will be charged in the following manner: Example:
8.0 straight time	time	charged 8.0	hours
2.0 time & one-half	time	charged 3.0	hours
2.0 double time	time	charged 4.0	hours
18.	With the implementation of the 2007 Local Agreement, all overtime hours will be zeroed out.
19.	Employees who refuse the opportunity to work through their lunch periods or breaks will not be charged for this overtime opportunity.
20.	Overtime adjustments, except for the vacation shutdown and Christmas holiday periods, must be submitted within thirty (30) calendar days of
36
the pay ending date of the overtime equalization information that is incorrect.
Overtime adjustments for any periods of downtime of forty (40) hours or more must be submitted within thirty (30) days of the resumption of your crew schedule following this downtime.
21.	The following provisions will govern all hours worked associated with FTPM:
•	FTPM work should be separated from the rest of the computerized worklist with a supplemental list just for FTPM within the Department.
•	All work performed in FTPM will be listed and charged on the weekly computerized equalization list.
•	All employees in the affected areas will be allowed to participate under the current FTPM guidelines as outlined in Master and Local agreements.
22.	All reasonable efforts will be made to equalize overtime between the crews.
23.	When overtime is available for Shop repair operations, the low houred qualified team member will be given the first opportunity. If additional opportunities exist, they will be offered in order to qualified Line repair, qualified Product Specialists, qualified VAT Team Leaders and finally qualified VATs.
24.	Product Specialist will be given the first opportunity on repairs and retrofits for all pre-Job #1 units up to 90 calendar days past Job # 1.

FORD MOTOR COMPANY Kentucky Truck Plant: Scott Britton Scott Rozzi Lonnie Corkum Danielle Sampson VEHICLE OPERATIONS DIVISION U.S. UNION AFFAIRS:	UAW Local 862: Scott Eskridge Bryan Kessinger Allen Hughes Rodney Janes Joseph Gorsick REGION #3: NATIONAL FORD DEPARTMENT:
50
MISCELLANEOUS AGREEMENTS
It is mutually agreed between the Ford Motor Company, Kentucky Truck Plant, and the International Union UAW Local 862, on October 9th, 2008, that the following provisions will govern crew preference in the Kentucky Truck Plant in accordance with Article VIII, Section 28 of the Master Agreement.
PAY PRACTICES
Supervisors’ Responsibilities
There should be no payroll shortages under the.TWOS System when the parties perform the tasks required. The following guidelines listed are mandatory in order to ensure the fewest problems with employee pay.
1.	Under normal operating conditions, the Daily Record of Time (DROT) will be posted within one (1.0) hour of the shift start-up in an area that is visible and accessible to all employees in the area. In addition, skilled trades DROT’s will be posted in the maintenance cribs as specified by the skilled trade committee person.
2.	Employees must check their DROT for the previous day and report any discrepancies to the Supervisor prior to the end of the shift.
3.	Supervisors will examine the DROT for miscoding, wrong hours, etc., and take action to resolve these items.
4.	The home “DROT” Supervisor has the responsibility to resolve any shortages or discrepancies if an employee is borrowed or loaned. Each Supervisor will be responsible to see that payroll related discrepancies are corrected on a timely basis.
5.	Proactive steps will be taken to emphasize management’s responsibility to insure that employees who have pay shortages will be addressed
51
immediately. Supervisors will properly process shortages, including adjustments of pay rates, and make employees’ checks available either by direct distribution or by turning over to the Security Department as the paycheck distribution policy states. Supervisors’ failure to comply with this policy should immediately be brought to the attention of the Labor Relations Supervisor.
Paycheck Distribution Process
1.	ALL hourly paychecks will be available for pick up by each department Wednesday afternoon at 2PM. The checks will be available in the Controller’s Office and will be sorted by area by crew/shift. Each area will be required to sign for their paychecks.
2.	Each area (Body, Paint, Final, Pre-Delivery, Maintenance/Plant Services, and Material Handling) should send a designated paycheck custodian to the Controller’s Office at 2PM each Wednesday to pick up ALL paychecks for their area. The custodian will sign the master sign out sheet as the checks are picked up from the Controller’s Office. This will give each area time to pull checks for those employees who will be on vacation or excused absence on their regular payday. “F” Crew maintenance employees should be paid Wednesday.
3.	WEDNESDAY NIGHT each area should ensure all paychecks are secured in a locked cabinet overnight.
4.	THURSDAY MORNING the “A” crew should be paid no later than two hours into the regularly scheduled shift.
5.	If a “B” crew employee’s paycheck cannot be
52
found the supervisor should notify the employee of the situation and the steps he/she is taking to locate the paycheck. If the check cannot be located by Thursday, 8:00 PM the area superintendent should submit a written request to payroll for a replacement check.
6.	THURSDAY NIGHT the “B” crew should be paid no later than 90 minutes into the regularly scheduled shift. Any #1 and #3 shift traditional employees should also be paid Thursday night no later than 2 hours into the shift.
7.	THURSDAY NIGHT all undelivered paychecks for crews “A”, “B”, #1 shift and #3 shift should be turned into security as unclaimed pay. “C” crew Z#2 shift checks should be retained in the areas overnight for Friday payoff. The paychecks should be secured in a locked cabinet overnight.
8.	FRIDAY MORNING the “C” crew should be paid no later than 2 hours into the regularly scheduled shift. The traditional #2 shift employees should also be paid Friday morning.
9.	FRIDAY NIGHT any remaining undelivered hourly paychecks should be turned into security as unclaimed pay. Security will maintain one alphabetical file of all unclaimed pay. Each week the Controller’s Office will collect all hourly paychecks over 30 days old and effect disposition.
Pay Days
The A-Crew, B-Crew, #1 shift and #3 shift employees in addition to employees scheduled Monday through Thursday on a 4x10 schedule will be paid on Thursday of a normal workweek. Likewise, C-Crew and #2 shift employees will be paid on Friday of a normal week.
53
Upon request, an employee who has a valid leave of absence form properly signed by his/her supervisor and authorized to be away from work will receive his/her regular paycheck earlier, if available.
When the plant is to be shut down for vacation, employees will have their vacation checks available on their current shift on the last scheduled day of work.
Pay Shortages
When an employee discovers a pay shortage of one or more hours, he may request payment of such shortage. His supervisor will initiate a request, before the lunch period, which will be authorized and signed by the production manager or department manager and it will be submitted to the Payroll Coordinator. As in the past, the payment will be made on their regular payday.
Payroll Availability During Night Shift Production Hours:
To address the Union concern over the availability of Payroll services for the night shifts, the Company agrees to develop an on-call process to be used during the first 3 hours of the night shift on Thursday nights in order to provide an emergency paycheck to employees as required for any critical pay issues. In addition, under normal operating conditions, the Company will endeavor to distribute hourly pzychecks to the B-Crew within the first 90 minutes from the start of the production shift.
VACATIONSAND PERSONAL LEAVES
Personal Leaves Of Absence And Vacation
Kentucky Truck Plant will apply the provisions for personal leaves of absence contained in the Master Agreement in accordance with 3-Crew Agreement, and a written form will be utilized to implement the procedure.
54
Personal Leave Procedure
The following procedure is established in accordance with the provisions of Article IX, Section 25(c) of the Master Agreement:
Every supervisor will have a calendar on which he/ she will denote any requests that he/she received from his/her hourly employees to be off during a scheduled workday, the first and last days of each crew included. Days off will be handled on a first-come basis, but will not be accepted more than 30 days in advance of the requested day off.
The supervisor will write the employee’s name and identification number on his/her calendar on the date the employee desires to be off from work. At the same time, employee form “Request for Planned Day Off with Pay” will be processed. Failure to respond to the employee’s written request not later than two (2) scheduled working days after the day the request is made will automatically excuse the employee’s absence.
The supervisor will review the requested days with the Superintendent’s designee. The Superintendent’s designee will enter each request on a master calendar, which will be retained in the superintendent’s office. If approved, he/she will so note on the calendar.
As soon as the decision is made, the supervisor will be told so that the hourly employee can be advised of the decision as soon as practicable.
Employees with excused absence time remaining will take precedence over employees with no personal time remaining regardless of seniority.
In case of two or more requests being submitted on the same day, the senior employee will be awarded the day off.
After the hourly employee has been informed that his/her request has been granted, it will not be canceled without the concurrence of the hourly employee
55
in writing.
At the end of each month, the Superintendent’s designee will submit the prior month’s master calendar and the supervisor’s copies of the disposition of “Request for Planned Day Off” with Pay form to the department manager who has the responsibility to assure this procedure for obtaining a day off is an effective, working procedure.
The continuing success of the “Excused Absence Payment Allowance” program depends upon a realistic approach to scheduling days off.
The supervisor must be able to manage his/her work force by developing versatility among his/her operators so that an absent employee’s job can be covered with a minimal loss of efficiency, and the superintendent is expected to maximize the number of scheduled days off in his/her department by providing a back-up operator to the supervisor who encounters difficulty in covering for any scheduled absent employee.
Under normal working conditions, it is agreed that limits will be established for personal and vacation days throughout the plant. The number of personal days to be granted on a departmental base shall be set at 4.5% of the agreed upon working plan number under normal working conditions, not to exceed 2 employees per team. This number shall be considered a minimum and further assumes that at least that number of requests have been received by management.
Vacation
In order to more effectively manage the headcount, vacation days will be scheduled according to the following formula: the total available vacation days will be determined for the entire calendar year. This total will then be divided between the number of scheduled workdays. The result of this calculation will be estab
56
lished as the number of vacations that can be scheduled. This provision excludes the normal summer downtime period.
The intent of this agreement is to provide stability in the workforce and allow employees to better schedule time off and achieve more uniformity in available workforce levels. Plant management’s ability to successfully implement this agreement will depend on employee presenteeism.
The following procedure will apply toward vacation scheduling:
1.	During January of each year, employees with at least 100 hours of vacation will be given the opportunity to schedule one full week of vacation.
a.	Seniority will be the determining factor when multiple requests for the same time period are submitted within any one department.
b.	Employees will be notified by the third Monday in February if their senioritybased vacation time-off request has been approved.
c.	All employees must reserve 80 vacation hours for summer shutdown, however if an employee only has 20 vacation hours remaining, these hours may be combined with 20 hours of their Excused Absence Allowance (EAA) hours in order to schedule a full work week off.
2.	Remaining vacation requests shall be scheduled and approved on a first come, first serve basis. In case of two or more requests being submitted on the same day, the senior employee will be awarded the day off.
3.	The requests for vacation time will be granted
57
provided it does not exceed the number of vacations that can be scheduled.
4.	Each supervisor will be provided with a calendar for each month of the year to record management approved time off requests for vacation.
EMPLOYEES REPORTING LATE TO WORK
This will confirm the Plant’s practice that an employee reporting to work within the first hour after their scheduled starting time is put to work and carried “L” for the time he or she was not on the job.
CHANGING SCHEDULED BREAK/LUNCH PERIODS
Except in emergencies, an employee’s regular lunch period shall not be advanced or delayed by more than one hour unless the employee agrees to such change. Employees will not be sent to break early unless it is truly an emergency. Management will be re-instructed as to what constitutes a true emergency. A ten (10) minute breakdown will not be considered an emergency under normal operating conditions. Management will notify the Union in advance of early breaks/lunch, including the reason and time for the unscheduled change. Management agrees to not reschedule more than one (1) break or lunch period during a scheduled shift/crew. The break or lunch will not start until the next tenth of the hour after the advance notice to the Union. A more detailed explanation will be provided by the Area Manager during the next scheduled Blue/ White Meeting. Top management will regularly monitor this activity to assure adherence to this agreement. Any issues that result from the application of this provision will be discussed by the Building Chairperson and HR Manager.
58
CHANGING SHIFT STARTING TIME
In the event it becomes necessary to change the starting times within shift hours of some employees within a classification performing similar work within a department from the regular starting time of employees within that same classification and department performing similar work, other than sporadic assignments, consideration will be given to request for starting time changes in making the assignment providing it does not interfere with efficiency of operations.
In the event that some employees have a complaint with reference to the above subject, the district committeeperson may register the complaint to the Supervisor of Hourly Personnel and Labor Relations for immediate investigation. If the employee in question is qualified, assignments to the contrary will be readjusted.
C-CREW SCHEDULE WHEN HOLIDAY FALLS ON MONDAY
Barring unforeseen circumstances, the C-crew work schedule will be changed from #3 shift to #2 shift on Sundays when the following Monday is a holiday, in line with the Letter of Understanding dated February 21, 1998, entitled Alternate Work Schedules - C-Crew Shift Switching.
SCHEDULE BOARDS
Schedule Boards for posting hours will be provided.
SHIFT SCHEDULE/WORK1NG HOURS & QUITTING TIME
During local negotiations the parties had a detailed discussion relative to the notification of shift working hours. The Union’s concern was to provide employees with as much notice as possible to allow employees to
59
plan their exit. The plant management team shares the Union’s concern and in this spirit the Company will take additional actions such as reviewing the required schedule with first line supervisors, as early as possible. Under normal operating conditions, employees will be given notification no later than one hour after the end of the scheduled lunch period as to their scheduled quitting time. In areas that have tag relief, line time will be set thirty minutes after the scheduled lunch period given normal operating conditions. Once employees have been notified of the quitting time, the time will not be increased unless a breakdown of at least twelve (12) minutes or longer occurs.
PREPARATORY TIME & ENVIRONMENTAL RELIEF
Paint Sprayers (enclosed in booth) will be allowed 18 minutes of preparatory time and will continue to receive ten (10) minutes relief per hour.
DOWNTIME INFORMATION
The Company recognizes the Union’s right and need to have access to accurate and timely information regarding production downtime. Therefore, the Company agrees the Union may obtain official information on product downtime by contacting the individual designated by the department Area Manager or by utilizing a system approved by management. Any failure to provide accurate and timely information should be immediately referred to the Labor Relations Office.
TEMPORARY LAYOFF
In the event of a temporary layoff and the Company has sufficient advance notification; the inverse seniority provision of the Master Agreement will be implemented.
60
ABSENCE REPORTING
Employees returning from an unexcused absence MUST clear through the Hourly Personnel office PRIOR to reporting to their work assignment and obtain a signed Return To Work slip from a Labor Relations representative. Employees returning from a medical leave of absence will be required to report to Labor Relations and Medical in advance of their return to work to ensure they are available for work at the start of their respective shift.
It is understood that some employees may be reluctant to disclose personal or sensitive information at the Hourly Personnel counter regarding the details of their absence. In such instances, an employee may request a confidential discussion with the Labor Relations representative (and Union representative if so desired) to review the circumstances pertaining to an absence.
This policy applies to all employees who are absent a full day as well as employees leaving the plant on passes through either Labor Relations or the medical office after the start of the shift.
It may be necessary for you to be absent from work sometime. If you know in advance, you should request permission for the necessary time off from your supervisor. In addition, employees who are absent for any reason must contact the Absence Call-in Line 1-866-893-0576 and report their absence at least fifteen (15) minutes prior to the start of their scheduled shift.
LEAVING THE PLANT DURING PRODUCTION HOURS
Absenteeism for a full day or a partial day has a harmful impact on product quality, cost control, plant efficiency, and the morale of the employees whose job assignments may be disrupted due to the absence of other employees.
61
The company and union realize that a vast majority of the employees are conscientious and take their attendance obligation very seriously. It is an employee’s obligation to report to work on time and remain for the entire schedule unless prior arrangements to be excused during the shift are made through the supervisor.
In many ways, unexcused absences during the shift are more harmful than if the employee is absent the entire day. Supervision makes manpower plans based on the employees who are present at the beginning of the shift. Employees above the required working numbers are loaned out to others departments or allowed to go home or “flip out”. However, when someone chooses to leave during the shift this requires supervision to rearrange manpower, cancel training, or even place team leaders on jobs just to cover production.
There are three main reasons why employees leave work during the shift, personal business/appointments, personal illness, and outside emergencies. The three crew work schedule provides additional opportunities for employees to handle personal matters during nonwork hours. Therefore, employees should endeavor to schedule personal appointments, doctors visits, etc., on their regular day off whenever possible.
We realize that with personal illnesses it may be hard to determine whether the employee will be able to work, however, we expect the employee to use good judgment. Many times an employee will report to work fully aware he/she will be unable to work in an attempt to avoid an absence. To avoid these instances, the company will assess discipline in those instances when an employee leaves during the shift and fails to properly document the medical need to leave work during the shift.
Employees who claim an inability to work due to a medical problem will be directed to the company medical facility for an evaluation. Each medical case will be
62
handled on its own merits. Management will review the circumstances of each case and direct the employee accordingly. The medical staff may be able to treat the employee, cover the employees absence if warranted, allows the employee to see his/her treating physician the following day due to office hours, or require the employee to seek immediate medical attention, including urgent care or emergency room.
We recognize that there are other family emergencies that may arise during an employee’s working hours and have provided an “Emergency Call Procedure” through our Security Office. If the nature of the emergency requires that an employee leave work he/she should first request that the supervisor excuse him/her. If the supervisor is unable to cover the employee, then the employee will be allowed to report his desire to leave through Labor Relations. Labor Relations will issue a pass for the employee to leave, documenting the date, time, and nature of the emergency, and then require the employee to provide documentation of the necessity to leave during the shift prior to returning the work. Labor Relations will evaluate the situation at that time.
HOURLY PERSONNEL AVAILABILITY
The Company agrees to provide Hourly Personnel coverage during all production shifts. It is understood that during the course of business, the Labor Relations representative may be called away to perform duties outside of the Hourly Personnel office. While it is not practical or cost effective to staff an additional person for the sole purpose of handling these contingencies, the Company will develop an employee self-serve station whereby employees will be able to complete and submit routine Hourly Personnel transactions 24 hours a day.
In addition, core Hourly Personnel hours will be posted to ensure that assistance is available in the Hourly
63
Personnel office for employees needing to transact more than routine hourly personnel business.
CHANGE OF ADDRESS
It is important that your personnel record with the Company and the union be accurate at all times. Any change in address or telephone number should be reported in person to the hourly personnel department, or submitted on Hourly Personnel System (HPS).
LEAVE OF ABSENCE:
PERSONAL
You may obtain a personal leave for compelling reasons (other than personal illness or injury) for a period up to 30 days, if you can be spared, by making a request with your supervisor. The request must be approved by him/ her in order to be valid. Such leave may be extended upon approval of the Employment Office.
MEDICAL (CONDITIONAL)
An employee who is unable to work because of injury or illness, of three or more days, and who furnishes satisfactory evidence thereof, shall be granted a conditional medical leave. Such a leave can only be obtained from the Employment Office. We suggest that you protect your seniority by obtaining a conditional medical leave by notifying the Employment Office by (1) personal visit, (2) telephone (area code 502-429-2241), (3) letter or (4) notification by agent. All employees that are absent due to illness or injury or who have been issued a conditional medical leave must report to the Employment Office before reporting to the job. The Employment Office (1) will expedite your return to work through the medical section for verification of your ability to return to work, and (2) will also make arrangements for the issuance of your return to work slip. Contact the Union for additional
64
information: 241-9491 or 429-2688.
By following the above procedure, you will be assured that proper medical information is furnished and that records reflect the proper amount of leave of absence time. By doing so, you will help assure correct payment of any sick benefits to which you might be entitled as well as proper pay for actual time worked.
LOSS OF SENIORITY
(Seniority) shall be broken for the following reasons: l.QUIT
If the employee quits.
2.	DISCHARGE
If the employee is discharged and the discharge is not reversed through Grievance Procedure.
3.	ABSENT FROM WORK
If a seniority employee with less than six months’ seniority is absent for three (3) working days without properly notifying the Company and giving a satisfactory reason for his/her absence, unless it is not possible him/her to do so.
4.	FAILURE TO REPORT
If the employee does not, within five (5) working days (excluding regular days off and Holidays) after notice to report has been sent to him/her, either report for work or give a satisfactory reason for his/her absence, unless it is not possible for him/her to comply with either of these requirements; and provided at least ten (10) working days have elapsed since his/her last day worked.
Such notice will not be sent where a medical leave has been issued to cover an employee’s disability for a specific extended period of time based upon a medical examination by the plant physician or when an employee on conditional medical leave provides medical evidence found acceptable by the plant physician.
Medical leaves will not be cancelled except in unusual
65
situations such as suspected abuse of the medical leave provision.
In cases where conditional or approved medical leaves of absence have expired, the Company may send a notice to report.
Such notice shall be sent by certified mail with return receipt to the employee’s last known address according to the Company’s records, and except in cases of recall, the notice shall be substantially in the form set forth in Appendix B*, attached. The date on the notice shall be the same date the Post Office receives the notice for mailing.
Disputes as to the Company’s failure to observe the procedural requirements of this provision, (e.g. timeliness of notice and transmittal to proper address) and the reasonableness of the employee’s failure to respond to a notice where his/her period of absence can be justified are subject to the regular Grievance Procedure.
A copy of the notice to report sent an employee will be furnished promptly to the Chairperson of the Unit Committee and to a Unit Committeeperson, designated by the local parties concurrent with the mailing of the notice. An attending Physician’s report (Form 5166) will be included with the Notice sent upon the expiration of an approved medical leave. However, failure to furnish a copy to the Chairperson of the Unit Committee and to the designated Unit Committeeperson or failure to include a Form 5166 with a Notice will not be the basis for any claim.
5.	DISABILITY SETTLEMENT
If a settlement with the employee has been made with the approval of the Union for total disability.
6.	CONTINUOUS UNEMPLOYMENT
For employees hired subsequent to June 20, 1941, who are continuously unemployed by the Company for a period of time equal to the Company seniority but in
66
no case less than eighteen (18) months.
For employees who have not broken seniority as of March 1,1982, the period of time shall be not less than the following: for employees with less than one year seniority, eighteen (18) months; for employees with one year but less than two years seniority, thirty-six (36) months; for employees with two but less than three years seniority, forty-eight (48) months; for employees with three but less than four years seniority, sixty (60) months; for employees with four but less than ten years seniority; for a period of time equal to their Company seniority plus twelve (12) months; and for employees with ten but less than eleven years seniority, not less than one hundred and thirty-two (132) months.
MEDICAL FACILITY MANNING
The Medical Department will be adequately staffed and kept open during the full production hours. Coverage at other times will be determined through the judgment of the Plant Physician and the Human Resource Manager with due consideration to the type of work to be performed and the number of employees scheduled to work at any given time. This decision will be made known to the Local Unit Chairperson who may discuss it with the Human Resource Manager.
A comprehensive first-aid course has been given to all Plant Security supervision who are required to work the off-shifts. In addition, rescue breathing instructions will be given to appropriate hourly and salaried employees on the #1 shift.
All supervisors will be given detailed instructions in a training session as to the emergency services available, the procedures to be followed in cases of emergency and the overall need for prompt, sound decisions in these instances.
In those instances when the hospital is not open, the
67
following procedure will be in effect:
A.	Signs will be placed on each hospital door directing employees seeking first-aid attention to the Security Office.
B.	A determination will be made at that time as to where the required treatment will be given. This decision will be implemented as quickly as possible.
C.	If any employee is physically unable to report for treatment, personnel will be dispatched to pick up the employee.
D.	An in-plant ambulance properly equipped with oxygen and other equipment recommended by the Ford Medical Director will be maintained and utilized when this decision appears to be the most prudent course to follow.
E.	When ambulance service is required, the Louisville Metro Police will be called in the first instance. Back-up service will be provided by one or more commercial ambulance services. This service includes trained personnel, oxygen, and other equipment necessary to provide efficient and effective emergency service.
Complaints concerning the administration of the above may be brought to the attention of the Human Resource Manager.
MEDICAL PASSES
The Company will provide arrangements to give adequate and responsible prompt relief for hospital and emergency cases.

71
ENCLOSED CABS
Enclosed cabs will be made available for tow-tractors and forklifts used extensively out of doors.
AUTOETTES
Instructions will be issued to drivers of autoettes that they are to carry no more passengers than the vehicle is designed to carry.
OPERATION OF POWER EQUIPMENT
Unsafe power equipment must be taken out of service. Employees must insure that the following items are not unsafe or inoperative before starting work with their vehicle; a light, horns, seats, brakes, steering, etc. If any of these items are found to be defective, they should be reported to the supervisor immediately. The operator must not attempt repairs to the truck.
The Company will continue the current licensing and training procedure for all drivers of power equipment and they will be instructed that only power equipment in safe operating condition may be driven.
Upon the request of the Building Chairman or Plant Manager, the Safety Representatives will continue to conduct spot checks of power equipment. Unsafe power equipment must be taken out of service^

72
TOW TRAILER LIMITS
Inside the plant, trailer trains will be limited to a maximum of four (4) dollies. Outside the plant, the maximum total length of trailers will be 58 feet.
B-LEVEL RACKS
Under current operating conditions the common sense standard for transferring loose stock and material skids on B level racks listed below will apply:
1.	No loose stock that is not banded or shrink-wrapped is to be carried on the B level.
2.	Pallets that are being returned for shipping or otherwise disposed of should not be carried on the B level.
The parties agree that new corporate safety standards will be controlling and may supersede the common sense standard.
LEVELATORS
Levelators on the Dock will be replaced or repaired and maintained in proper working order.
RAIL ROAD CROSSING BRIDGE AT V-13
Management agrees that during critical traffic periods, defined as one half hour prior to the normal scheduled lunch period through one half hour following the end of the lunch period, the bridge will be in place over the railroad tracks at V-13. It is understood that this agreement is intended to keep the portable bridge in place at all times except during periods of railroad switching.
PARKING LOTS
The parking lots will be cleaned in accordance with our current operating practices, which is once per week.
73
NON-FORD PERSONNEL TO REGISTER AT SECURITY
To maintain information of non-Ford Personnel who may be working and/or otherwise within the facility at all times, the Company will follow the KTP Facility Access Sign In Procedure where visitors who do not have a Ford ID will sign-in at Gate 6. Copies of the Sign In Procedure are available from Company and Union Safety Representatives. In addition, visitors, vendors, and contractors will be issued suitable identification, which they will be required to wear at all times.
VENDORS DELIVERING SUPPLIES
In regard to the issue of commodity vendors delivering supplies to the plant in non-traditional methods, the Company recognizes that situations can occur where included work is performed by vendors. Therefore, the company agrees to advise the appropriate members of management on the proper procedures for receiving and storing material and parts delivered by commodity vendors. Any violations of these procedures may be brought the attention of the JSOEC by the Union.
VENDOR REWORK OF PARTS
Under present operating conditions, Vendor rework and sorting of parts should be performed at RW-7, unless otherwise approved by Incoming Quality Personnel.
VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS
A program will be put into effect to make use of the expertise of employees who are experienced as volunteer firefighters.
74
JOB ELEMENTS SAME ON ALL SHIFTS/ CREWS
Under normal operating conditions, the Company agrees that production operations should be “set-up” the same on all shifts/crews. It is the responsibility of the supervisor and industrial engineering to ensure that production operations are consistent on all shifts/ crews. It is understood that the A-Crew/#2 shift will be the “lead” for the purpose of establishing workloads and processes. Any deviation in this practice should be brought to the immediate attention of the supervisor. Concerns that are not resolved by the production management team should be brought to the attention of Labor Relations prior to discipline.
LINE SPACING
•	Spacing Units Manually
When mechanical spacing devices fail to operate properly, supervision in the affected area will promptly take necessary steps to space units manually, with hourly employees. However, the frequency of pushing units must be curtailed. Therefore, the Bargaining Committee will meet with the Plant Manager, the Manufacturing Manager, the Lean Manufacturing Planning Manager, and the Human Resource Manager for the purpose of discussing the problem and to establish permissible limits involving this problem.
•	Chassis Line Frames
Management agrees to establish an engineering study team to review line spacing in the Final Line area, immediately following the date of ratification of the Local Agreement and will implement the necessary measures to assure that proper spacing of the frames is maintained in the Chassis Department. Issues pertaining to line spacing may be identified by the Company and/or Union and will be directed to the Industrial Engineer
75
ing department for immediate review and resolution. The Company reaffirms its support of the provisions outlined in Article IV, Section 4 of the Master Agreement pertaining to proper line spacing.
SHIP-OUT PRODUCTION
In order to remain competitive in the market and to grow the business for future job security for the workforce, the Company may need to run certain areas of the Body Shop additional hours to build customer ship-outs. The Company recognizes its responsibility to make the process capable within the shift hours. Therefore, in such areas where the Company may need to run in excess of ten (10) hours of production to meet these needs, the Union agrees to discuss innovative ways of supporting this production. These discussions may include, but are not limited to running areas on a voluntary basis in excess of ten (10) hours production.
FAIL-SAFE FLOATS
While the Union recognizes the need for fail-safe floats for efficient operations, it was requested that each Shift/Crew support its own fail-safe production needs, except in cases of a Shift/Crew having an excessively long breakdown. In which case, the parties agree that it may be necessary for another Shift/Crew to replenish the fail-safe float. The Company fully supports the concept of each Shift/ Crew maintaining its own fail-safe production. Any issues pertaining to the inequities of this agreement among Shifts/Crews may be taken first to the Blue & White meeting and then to the JSOEC meeting for discussion and resolution.
76
SUPERVISOR WORKING
The Company reaffirms the position of Article X, Section 3 of the Ford-UAW Master Collective Bargaining Agreement pertaining to Supervisors working.
INSPECTOR TRAINING
The Company will establish a training program for employees entering the Inspector classification. The Company further agrees that accepted bidders and transfers will be required to complete the inspection training program, prior to being placed on a permanent assignment in Quality Control.
EMERGENCY TELEPHONE LOG
The emergency telephone call log will be available for examination by union representatives.
FOOD SERVICE
At the request of the Union, the Company and the Union will discuss with the food service provider any complaints with regard to food service.
FTPM ACTIVITY GUIDELINES
The following Small Group rules and guidelines are for all FTPM Small Groups plant-wide at Kentucky Truck Plant encompassing all buildings:
1.	No employee will be allowed to violate any part of the Union and Company Collective Bargaining agreement.
2.	Small Group Members who are in the plant for FTPM activities will not be given other assignments that are not FTPM related.
3.	All employees will be afforded the opportunity to be on an FTPM Small Group on a voluntary basis, when a Small Group is in their immediate area. The Small Group will be permitted to
77
run, not in excess of six jobs to prove out the equipment following any such activity.
4.	When overtime is required, and the full complement of an FTPM Small Group is not needed, Small Group Members with the low overtime hours from the FTPM supplemental overtime list will be afforded the opportunities first. Any employee absent from their accepted scheduled activity will be charged double and carried AWOL for the hours scheduled.
5.	When FTPM opportunities present themselves for which they are qualified and physically able to perform, the Small Group Members will be required to participate in these activities (e.g. cleaning, tagging, inspection, etc.)
6.	Small Group Members may be trained in BEW 1 (Basic Equipment Wellness) and ECPL (Energy Control and Power Lockout) before being placed on FTPM activities, as long as training is offered. If the ECPL is required for the activity, the Small Group Members performing that activity must receive the eight (8) hour ECPL course and subsequent annual ECPL refreshers.
7.	If a Small Group Member cannot participate in a FTPM Small Group activity for a particular week, the Small Group Member must notify the department FTPM Coordinator so that the next low houred Small Group Member can be scheduled.
8.	When there is an FTPM activity scheduled, it will have Maintenance and Plant Services support.
It is understood by both parties that this is a living set of guidelines, which may present unforeseen circumstances. Both parties commit to flexibility, joint problem solving, and mutually agreeable resolution in these instances.

Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Alternate Work Schedules - Kentucky Truck Plant
This memorandum sets forth the parties’ agreement as to the application or waiver of certain provisions of the Ford-UAW collective Bargaining Agreement to accommodate the implementation of alternate work schedules at the Kentucky Truck Plant, effective March 30, 1998.
1.	The alternate work schedules authorized by determination of the National Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee, pursuant to the Ford-UAW Agreement and for the purpose of this memorandum, are as follows:
(a)	A production scheduled (Exhibit I attached) consisting of two 10-hour shifts, Monday through Friday and one 10-hour shift each on Saturday and Sunday, using three crews (A, B, and C) of employees,
88
with each crew working four days per week with Saturday and Sunday as normal work days. Certain maintenance and support personnel also may be assigned to this production schedule.
(b)	A booth and duct cleaning schedule (Exhibit II attached) consisting of two crews (A and B) working four 1 O-hour days each week on the midnight (#1) shift with one crew working Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Sunday and the other working Thursday through Sunday.
(c)	A skilled maintenance schedule (Exhibit Ill attached) consisting of:
(1)	Three crews (A, B, and C) each working five 8-hour shifts, Monday through Friday each week, plus one 8-hour Saturday “overtime” shift every third week; and,
(2)	Two crews (D and E) each normally working one 8-hour shift (on Monday or Friday) plus two 12-hour shifts (one each on Saturday and Sunday) each week.
2.	Additional personnel to support the alternate work schedules described above will be obtained through the placement hierarchy provisions of the Ford-UAW Agreement, including new hires as required.
3.	Not withstanding the existing provisions of the Ford-UAW Agreement, it is agreed that the following will apply at the Kentucky Truck Plant during the time the alternate work schedules are in effect:
(a)	Appendix H, Memorandum of Understanding on Voluntary Overtime and other related
89
provisions of the Agreement governing voluntary overtime will be waived and not apply.
(b)	Employees regularly assigned to the 10-hour or 12-hour daily schedules described in subparagraphs 1 ,(a) (Exhibit 1), (b) (Exhibit 11), and (c) (2) (Exhibit III) will: (1) The Parties further agree that the provision in Article IX, Section 19 to excuse an employee for up to five (5) regularly scheduled days of work in the event of the death of a current spouse, parent, child or stepchild, which is applied to Michigan Truck and Kentucky Truck Plants by letter from R.H.Marcin to Gerald Bantom dated December 15, 1997 provides eligible employees on Three Crew schedules up to forty (40) hours of bereavement pay in those instances. (This replaces previous 3,b (1) 9/8/97 Letter with Letter from D.J. Cirbes to Ron Gettelfinger dated 10/14/99)
(2)	Have their daily jury duty pay and short-term military duty pay eligibility determined on the basis of up to 12 straight-time hours, depending on their regular schedule.
(3)	Use their vacation entitlement in increments of 40 hours for each week of vacation and their excused absence allowance in increments of four to six straight-time hours for “half” days and eight to 12 straight-time hours for “whole days”,
90
depending on their regularly scheduled hours for the specific day.
(c)	Employees regularly assigned to the
1	O-hour daily schedules described in subparagraphs 1 .(a) (Exhibit I) and (b) (Exhibit 11) will have their holiday pay determined on the basis of:
(1)	Eight straight-time hours for each holiday falling on a day when they would not otherwise be scheduled to work; or,
(2)	Ten straight-time hours for each holiday falling on a day when they would otherwise have been scheduled to work, except for such specified holiday; provided, however, that holiday pay for the full week of holidays between Christmas and New Year shall not exceed 40 straight-time hours of pay.
(d)	Employees assigned to the Production Schedule C Crew and the Skilled Maintenance Schedule D and E Crews, as described in paragraph 1, and Exhibits I and III, who regularly work on Sunday and change shifts during the week, will be paid a special 10% shift premium for all regularly scheduled hours of work (in lieu of a lower or no shift premium, where otherwise applicable).
(e)	The provisions of Article IX, Section 10 of the Agreement will be waived and not apply to time worked on Sundays between:
(1)	Six p.m. and midnight by employees assigned to the Production Schedule
91
C Crew and the Skilled Maintenance Schedule D and E Crews, as described in paragraph 1, and Exhibits I and III; and,
(2)	Midnight and 6 a.m. by employees assigned to the Booth and Duct Cleaning Schedule Crews A and B, as described in paragraph 1, and Exhibit II.
(f)	The provisions of Article IX, Section 22(a) (3) (ii) of the Agreement, if otherwise applicable, will be waived and not apply for the Saturdays and Sundays immediately preceding and immediately following the Christmas holiday period.
4.	In the event the alternate work schedules described in paragraph 1, and Exhibits I, II, and III, would affect and require changes in the administration of other wage or benefit payment practices, the parties agree that such changes shall maintain the original intent of those practices to the extent practical, but shall not increase their cost to the Company in comparison to their application to work schedules traditionally recognized by the Agreement.
5.	The parties also agree that any local agreements affected by the alternate work schedules described in this memorandum shall be interpreted in such a manner to make them consistent with the terms of this memorandum. In this regard, either party may refer specific unresolved local issues to the UAW National Ford Department and the Company’s Employee Relations Staff for resolution.
Finally, it is understood that this memorandum does
92
not limit in any way management’s rights to schedule and determine the working hours of employees pursuant to the Ford-UAW Agreement. In that regard, however, if it becomes necessary for the Company to discontinue the alternate work schedules described herein, the regular work schedules traditionally recognized by the Agreement would be reinstituted. Moreover, in the event problems arise relative to the disposition and the placement of redundant personnel under the GEN provisions of the Agreement, such problems will be subject to discussion and resolution by the parties in a mutually satisfactory manner.

Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Alternate Work Schedules - Kentucky Truck Plant Addendum
This memorandum sets forth several additional understandings between the parties concerning the implementation of alternate work schedules at the Kentucky Truck Plant, effective March 30, 1998.
1.	Notwithstanding Exhibit III - Skilled Maintenance Schedule of the September 8,1997, Memorandum of Understanding on Alternate Work Schedules -Kentucky Truck Plant, the local parties may elect to:
(a)	Change the Saturday shift starting time for the (R) Crew from 11:30 a.m. to 11:00 a m. (quitting time would move from 8 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.); and,
(b)	Switch the shift for the D + E-Crews with the (R) shift for every third Saturday that the A Crew is scheduled to work. (In this case, the A Crew would work from 11 p.m. Friday to 7:30 a.m. Saturday and the D + E-Crews would work from 7 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Saturday. However, the normal Sunday starting time for the D + E-Crews would continue to be 3 p.m.; and it is understood that employees assigned to these
94
crews shall be entitled to any “back-up time” premium by virtue of maintaining this 3 p.m. starting time.)
2.	Notwithstanding the Ford-UAW Agreement or the September 8, 1997, Memorandum, for weeks in which a holiday falls on a Friday or Monday and the Production C-Crew is scheduled to work the adjacent Saturday or Sunday, the local parties, subject to approval by the UAW National Ford Department and Ford Automotive Operations North American Labor Relations, may agree to switch the holiday for the Production C-Crew from Friday to Saturday or from Monday to the preceding Sunday. In such cases, affected employees would receive: (1) Saturday time and one-half premium for work on Friday and ten hours of holiday pay for Saturday, if otherwise eligible, for switches between those days; or (2) straight time with time and one-half for hours over eight for work on Monday and ten hours holiday pay for the preceding Sunday, if otherwise eligible, for switches between those days.
3.	Whenever practical, qualified Ford tradesmen on the A, B, and C Maintenance Crews will be offered the opportunity to volunteer for “(V)” shift maintenance work on Saturdays and Sundays before scheduling temporary or outside contractor personnel in their place.
4.	Employees will continue to receive essential job-related and safety training opportunities.

Subject: Alternate Work Schedules - Kentucky Truck Plant Waiver of Appendix H
This will confirm the parties’ understanding that the waiver of Appendix H and other provisions of the Agreement governing voluntary overtime during the time the alternate work schedules are in effect is not intended to permit normal scheduling of more than ten hours per shift of final assembly line production. However, it is also understood that consistent with existing practices, other departments (e.g., body or paint) may have to work more than ten hours at times to support this final line schedule; and other arrangements may be required in the case of breakdowns, emergencies, or other unusual situations.

Subject: Addendum: Three Crew Schedules - Bereavement Pay
During the course of these negotiations, the parties discussed the impact of bereavement on employees assigned to the Three Crew operation pattern currently in use at the Michigan Truck and Kentucky Truck facilities.
The parties agree to amend the provisions of Paragraph 3, Section (b) (1) of the Alternative Work Schedules - Michigan truck Plant Memorandum dated August 16, 1994 and Paragraph 3, Section (b) (1) of the Alternative Work Schedules - Kentucky Truck Plant Memorandum dated September 8, 1997 so that regular days off and paid holidays are excluded from the determination of the next three (3) or five (5) regularly scheduled days of work following the death of a qualifying immediate family member.
The Parties further agree that the provision in Article IX, Section 19 to excuse an employee for up to five (5) regularly scheduled days of work in the event of the
97
death of a current spouse, parent, child or stepchild, which is applied to MichiganTruck and Kentucky Truck Plants by letter from R.H.Marcin to Gerald Bantom dated December 15, 1997 provides eligible employees on Three Crew schedules up to forty (40) hours of bereavement pay in those instances.

Local 862 - UAW
Louisville, KY 40241
Dear Mr. Lunsford:
Subject: Alternate Work Schedules - C Crew Shift Switching
The purpose of this letter is to confirm our understanding rescheduling the C-Crew afternoon production shift to day shift on Sunday,. Assuming this schedule proves mutually acceptable, similar arrangements can be considered for other Sundays preceding designated Company Monday holidays.
This option is consistent with the intent of paragraph 2 of the January 20, 1995 Letter of Understanding addressed to Mr. Ernest Lofton regarding “Alternate Work Schedules - Michigan Truck Plant Addendum”, wherein the parties have the option to switch scheduled Saturday/Sunday production shifts with adjacent Friday/ Monday Company Holidays, subject to approval by the UAW National Ford Department and Ford Automotive Operations North American Labor Relations.
It is further understood, assuming the parties mutually agree to the respective Sunday shift change, that the affected employees assigned to C-Crew would be paid comparable wages that otherwise would have been paid by working the afternoon shift. For example, a C Crew employee working 10 hours on the day shift on Sunday prior to a company holiday with a 6:00 AM start, who otherwise would have been scheduled to start at 6:00 PM, would have the first six hours paid at 5.5
99
hours straight time (assuming a half hour unpaid lunch is included in the first six hours), pursuant to the August 16, 1994 Alternate Work Scheduled Memorandum. The remainder of the shift, 4.5 hours, would be paid at double time.

Subject: Partial Work Week Layoff Administration
KTP Employees Assigned to C-Crew Hybrid Schedule
From: Greg Aquinto
The following is provided in response to your request for a review of a proposed specific timekeeping practice resulting from the Kentucky Truck Plant Alternative Work Schedule.
The Company and Local Union have agreed to the principle that the alternative schedule is to neither advantage nor disadvantage employees. Specific concerns were expressed about C-Crew Hybrid shift employees who are laid off for a partial week.
As a result, the parties agreed that, in the event of a partial week of layoff affecting C-Crew Hybrid Shift employees, timekeeping administration would be as follows:
1.	A regular 40-hour schedule will be assumed.
2.	Compensated and available straight time hours will count as hours worked.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
October 14, 1999 Mr. Dicky Sutton UAW Local 862 Kentucky Truck Plant Louisville, KY 40222
Subject: Plant-wide Cooling & Ventilation
Dear Mr. Sutton:
During the course of the 1999 Local Negotiations, the parties devoted a considerable amount of time to the discussion of plant heat related issues. The unusually hot summer of 1999 highlighted many heat related concerns. While the Company believes the Heat Stress Management Program proved successful under the extreme conditions, we do recognize that there is room for improvement.
After careful review of the Union and management proposal to improve heat levels and ventilation in the plant, the Company has committed to install a state-of-the-art plant wide ventilation system we believe will improve temperatures in the plant during the hot weather season. The system, called “Big-Foot”, will be installed over the next year, and is scheduled for completion in the fall of 2000. In addition to improving the plant temperature during hot weather, the 1.8 million dollar system will also generate energy savings that will aid the plant’s competitive cost position.
This letter will confirm the company commitment to complete the installation of its “Big-Foot” system and take any other actions practical to improve ventilation and Heat Stress Management in the plant. In addition, the company will air condition designated employee break areas to address specific Union demands and
106

Subject: Churning of the workforce
Dear Mr. Sutton:
During the course of the 1999 Local Negotiations, the Parties entered into a landmark agreement which will provide hourly employees increased freedom to move between departments.
While these agreements were negotiated in good faith and with full knowledge, their size and scope represent a potential risk to the efficient operation of the plant. In order to minimize this risk and provide the greatest opportunity for success, the Parties agree to closely monitor the early progress of these agreements. If excessive churning or adverse effect on operations occur, the Parties agree to meet and jointly seek solutions to any problems created. It will be the responsibility of Labor Relations to monitor this agreement and promptly report to the Bargaining Committee any adverse impact.
This agreement shall become effective concurrently with the effective date of (a) any Collective Bargaining Agreement which replaces the September 16, 1996 Collective Bargaining Agreement (other than an extension for a temporary of indefinite period) and shall remain in effect for the same period as such new or extended Collective Bargaining Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.

Subject: Relief For Material Handling
Dear Mr. Sutton:
During the course of the 1999 Local Negotiations, the Union expressed concern over the inability of employees on certain “free-efifort” jobs in Material Handling to receive necessary break time during the course of their normal shift. The Company concurs that all employees are entitled to receive personal relief time during the course of their normal work day to attend to basic personal needs. For those employees not tied to a moving assembly line, this personal time can be arranged by the operator periodically throughout the day. Issues pertaining to the feasibility of obtaining necessary break time will be addressed on an individual basis.
In those cases where employees feels that their Material Handling route does not provide for reasonable opportunity for relief, the employee or his/her committee person may request a review of his/her job to determine those factors which could be preventing the employee from establishing their personal relief time.
This agreement shall become effective concurrently with the effective date of (a) any Collective Bargaining Agreement which replaces the September 16, 1996 Collective Bargaining Agreement (other than an extension for a temporary of indefinite period) and shall remain in effect for the same period as such new or extended Collective Bargaining Agreement, except

Subject: Pay Adjustments
Dear Mr. Eskridge:
During the of course the 2007 Local Negotiations, the Union expressed their disappointment in the number of chronic pay adjustments which are continuously submitted as a regular course of business by certain supervisors. While the Company believes that most supervisors exercise necessary care when handling issues pertaining to pay, it recognizes that there are certain areas in the plant which account for a disproportionate number of pay corrections.
The company recognizes that proper paying of the hourly employees is a core function of the supervisor position. To insure the integrity of this process, the Company agrees to implement a procedure to monitor the pay adjustments submitted. The Company, on a weekly basis, will provide an electronic file of all pay adjustments to the Union. When the number of adjustments is excessive, a meeting will be called with the Plant Manager and Chairman to immediately address_the issue. Supervisors found to be chronic and habitual pay adjustment offenders will be brought to the attention of the Plant Manager and the Plant HR Manager. Every effort will be made to minimize the number of payroll adjustments and
117
the Company will continue to address problem areas as they arise. Additionally, pay adjustments made without a Past Period Adjustment form, and which result in a deduction of an employee’s pay, will be documented and attached to the employee’s check prior to distribution.

Subject: Job Security & Operational Effectiveness
Dear Mr. Sutton:
During the course of the 1999 Local Negotiations, the parties discussed various ways to increase job security and operational effectiveness. Many of these discussions centered on opportunities to bring new work and employment into the plant. To help encourage and secure these opportunities, the Union pledged to work closely with the Company in new and innovative ways. The Company in turn, pledged to seek out new opportunities and work with the Union to ensure the success of these efforts.
While the majority of these discussions were general in nature, the Company did identify areas where potential opportunities may exist. These included increased production volume, addition of an on-site modification center, increased stamping business, insourcing of non-traditional work, and an increase in plant ship-outs.
In conclusion, the parties agreed to continue this progress utilizing the JSOE meeting as the primary forum for discussions involving insourcing of new work and job security matters.

Dear Mr. Eskridge:
During the course of the 2007 Local Negotiations, the Union expressed concerns regarding the practice of promoting hourly employees to supervisor over their former team. While the Company maintains the right to assign all hourly and salaried employees, it is recognized that under certain circumstances assigning new supervisors to their former teams could represent a legitimate concern.
Therefore, under normal operating conditions, management will make every effort to initially assign new supervisors outside of their previous hourly work areas. Any concerns about a supervisor assignment will be discussed between the Building Chairperson and the HR Manager

Subject: Team Size
Dear Mr. Sutton:
During the course of the 1999 Local Negotiations, the parties discussed extensively the subject of team size and the adverse effect that it has on quality and consequently the job security of the work force. In an attempt to enhance the team’s ability to contain quality within the team, the parties agree to the following initiatives:
•	Each January 1, the Company agrees to take a “snapshot” to determine the current number of operations within each department (including all variance jobs that are in place for a minimum of 90 days, cardboard jobs, etc.).
•	Thirty (30) days following the snapshot, the Company will restructure the teams to include: a.) Maximum of fourteen (14) operations b.) Two Relief operators (Relief routes will be consistent with the structure of the team)
c.) One Team Leader
d.) Required team support members, i.e. AWOL coverage/trainers
•	Once the team has been established for the year, it will not be altered to reflect re-balances or additions of variance jobs until the following January 1 when the next snapshot and realignment occurs.
122
It is recognized that in areas that do not relieve or if the Company elects to utilize “mass relief”, the maximum team size will be reduced by an amount equivalent to the number of relief operators that would have otherwise been assigned to those teams. It is also recognized that geographically some teams may need to have fewer operations. To address these particular situations, specific cases will be brought to the JSOE for discussion or resolution.
To deliver the best possible product to the customer, the Company agrees to the principle of containing the quality within the team. In order to accomplish this initiative, the Company agrees that Team Leaders will remain in their assigned areas at all times. Team Leaders will not be sent out of their area for repairs or assignments not related to the maintenance of their team. Further, Team Leaders will not be assigned to provide restroom breaks except in cases of emergency as directed by line management.
This agreement shall become effective concurrently with the effective date of (a) any Collective Bargaining Agreement which replaces the September 16, 1996 Collective Bargaining Agreement (other than an extension for a temporary of indefinite period) and shall remain in effect for the same period as such new or extended Collective Bargaining Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.

The UAW and Management understand that many tough decisions still remain to be made but, the relationship between the local union and management to resolve these problems is a core reason for the plant’s continuing success.
This letter will serve as official recognition of the positive relationship which currently exists between the Union and management of the Kentucky Truck Plant as well as our commitment to continue to improve this relationship in the future.
The parties further agree to continue regular JSOESC
125
meetings and maintain that forum as the primary problem solving venue.
This agreement shall become effective concurrently with the effective date of (a) any Collective Bargaining Agreement which replaces the March 31,2004 Collective Bargaining Agreement (other than an extension for a temporary of indefinite period) and shall remain in effect for the same period as such new or extended Collective Bargaining Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.

During the course of 2007 Local negotiations, the parties discussed situations pertaining to skilled trades employees cycling equipment after completing their repair or modification to the equipment. The union expressed concern that the cycling of the equipment in these situations may deprive the regular employee on the operation of an overtime opportunity. As a result of our discussions, the parties acknowledged that a specified number of cycles of the equipment could not be designated due to the unique circumstances that each repair or modification to a piece of equipment may entail. We did agree that the cycling of equipment by skilled trades employees should be limited to the minimum number of cycles required to verify that the repair or modification to the equipment has been completed successfully.
Equipment cycled by production personnel in conjunction with FTPM activities will conform to the existing FTPM guidelines.
The Skilled Trades Chairperson and a member of the Bargaining Committee_should meet with the HR Manager to discuss issues pertaining to the application of this understanding.

During the course of the 2003 Local Negotiations, both parties recognized that regular attendance is a critical to the on-going viability of the Kentucky Truck Plant. Although vast majority of our hourly employees maintain good attendance records, most of the focus by the Company and Union has been on those employees for whom absenteeism has become clearly excessive.
While it is necessary to maintain an effective attendance improvement program for AWOL offenders, it is equally important not to forget about the daily efforts of those dedicated employees who report to work every day. Pursuant to this end, the parties agreed to establish a local reward and recognition program to highlight those employees who achieve Perfect Attendance on an annual basis.
For the purposes of this program, eligibility for Perfect Attendance shall be defined as:
•	Employees must be on rolls from January 1 through December 31, unless on an approved military leave of absence.
•	New hires/TPTs hired during the year are not eligible
•	During the eligibility period, employees must not incur a single AWOL or Medical Leave of Absence

(except in instances of work related injuries or under the provision under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA).

Subject: Adverse Effects Due to High Absenteeism
Dear Mr. Eskridge:
During 2007 Local Negotiations the parties discussed days which have been historically known to be high absence days. This issue has been addressed in the Ford/ UAW Master Collective Bargaining Agreement in the letter of understanding dated October 9, 2007 entitled “National Attendance Program”. The parties agreed that the following condition must be met, in addition to the conditions referenced in the above referenced letter, for an employee to be eligible to use an EAA day after-the-fact:
• The date of absence in question does not fall on the day before or after contractual Holidays, on the eve or day of the Kentucky Derby, the day of Thunder over Louisville, the day of Halloween or locally recognized observance days for Halloween.
The identification of these days does not preclude the Company from identifying other days where there was an adverse effect on operations due to high unplanned absenteeism.

OTHER SENIORITY MATTERS
For layoff purposes, an employee currently assigned to a Skilled Trades classification will retain the seniority company records indicate he/she now has on the classification. An employee subsequently assigned to a skilled trades classification will have date of entry seniority on the classification in the Kentucky Truck Plant. Layoff and recall will be in line of seniority on the classification.
Inverse seniority will not be implemented in Skilled Trades for periods of less than (5) days.
When more than one employee is selected from the same bid list, the first employee to be assigned to the skilled classification will establish the date of the entry for both employees.
When two employees have the same date of entry on a skilled classification, the employee with the greater plant seniority shall have the greater seniority on the skilled classification.
Seniority of employees hired on the same day will be determined by the last four digits of the social security number. The lowest number will indicate the greatest seniority. If the last four digits are the same, the lowest full social security number will indicate the greatest seniority.
No journeyman will be transferred from one craft to another without prior agreement from both Company and Union.
An employee on the rolls of the Louisville Assembly Plant on 02-23-69, who is subsequently laid off in a reduction in force at either the Louisville Assembly Plant, or the Kentucky Truck Plant, shall during the fourth week from the date of his/her layoff, elect in writing at the Employment Office of the Plant from which he/ she is on layoff to:
156
1.	If, on other than a skilled classification, exercise his/her seniority against the lower seniority employee in the labor pool or undesignated jobs at the plant or, remain on the recall list from his/ her present location.
2.	If, on a skilled classification, exercise his/her seniority against the lowest seniority employee on his/her classification at the other plant, or remain on the recall list from his/her present location.
If the employee elects to exercise his/her seniority in either 1 or 2 above, the Company shall effect such seniority adjustment by the end of the fourth week of the employee’s layoff, unless the employee by that time has been recalled to his/her present location.
Any employee who does not make an election in writing during the fourth week of his/her layoff at the Employment Office of the Plant, from which he is on layoff, shall be deemed to have elected to remain on the recall list from his/her present location.
OVERTIME EQUALIZATION & SCHEDULING PROCESS
1.	Employees’ overtime record will be maintained on the Principle of premium hours paid or refused less shift premium.
2.	Overtime records will be maintained on the Maintenance Scheduling Program.
3.	Overtime records will be input weekly by the maintenance scheduler or designated person.
4.	Overtime charges for the previous pay period shall be posted on the MSP by the second Monday following the pay period.
5.	In order to accommodate lines 1 thru 4, the Company will provide electronic documentation
157
for all hours worked/paid to the maintenance scheduler and the Skilled Trades Committeepersons by 11:00 AM Tuesday.
6.	The Paint/Manufacturing Engineering Manager will provide resources to ensure that the timelines required by this procedure are met.
7.	An active employee who is not available for overtime assignments will be charged for the overtime hours he/she would have been scheduled to work provided work was performed.
8.	Employees on bereavement leave, jury duty, approved military leave, paid Excused Absence Allowance of eight hours or more or on a paid vacation of 8 hours or more will not be charged for lost overtime opportunities on the day the hours are paid.
9.	An employee who fails to report as scheduled for an overtime assignment will be charged double the number of hours scheduled. (Only applicable to hours scheduled above the employee’s normal workweek)
10.	Overtime hours granted through the grievance procedure will be recorded.
11.	New hire, rehires, apprentice graduate employees and employees returning to active rolls will be given the highest hours on that classification (excluding project coordinators and Skilled Trades Group Leaders).
12.	Part B of Appendix H, Option 3C will apply at Kentucky Truck Plant.
13.	For scheduling purposes, low hour employees will be first to be offered overtime for each opportunity.
14.	However, overtime may be scheduled by area during production hours for production coverage. In addition, management may schedule up
158
to 50% of a full complement of employees from their area for up to 8 hours immediately preceding a production shift.to prove out any changes and/or start up the equipment. Only employees from within the area may be charged for area opportunities.
15.	Additionally, an area spread exceeding 40 hours will trigger a corrective scheduling process. Whereas the company will be required to schedule the low hour employee to work with any employee scheduled above the spread to improve versatility within the area. Personnel scheduled for non-production overtime will be from the master list; however, management has the right to schedule up to 25% of their scheduled work force by trade, per shift, from their home area.
16.	Project Coordinators, Group Leaders, PM Planners and other jointly appointed positions will equalize overtime within their base trade. However, they may be scheduled to perform their specialized duties irregardless of hours, provided they do not displace an employee in their base trade.
17.	Apprentices will equalize within their apprentice classification.
18.	When less than a full complement of employees within a classification are to be scheduled for overtime, and volunteers do not provide the required complement, the required number of qualified employees will be scheduled on a low-seniority basis.
19.	Areas are defined as Body, Paint, Final, Stamping, MP&L and Project Crew.
20.	Tradesperson will be required to select their overtime preferences for Monday thru Sunday by 6 AM of the preceding Tuesday.
159
21.	Opts (signup indicating a desire to work) for both weeks of the scheduled downtime in December and July will be due 2 weeks before shutdown. In addition, the company will not involuntarily move employees from their shift/crew during down weeks without proper notification and a business case (3 days before signup for employees to opt on closes for shutdown).
22.	The company will post the schedule for Monday thru Sunday before the end of the dayshift on the preceding Thursday.
23.	Employees who have opted to work and are not scheduled for overtime on the initial posting will have the option of removing their availability prior to being scheduled.
24.	In order to address the Union’s concerns with regard to skilled trades overtime scheduling for production coverage, the Skilled Trades Chairperson and the HR Manager will agree on a mutually satisfactory method of scheduling skilled trades overtime that accommodates to the extent possible skilled trades personnel unable to work more than a 10 hour shift to support production.
25.	The scheduling of Fire watch and waste treatment coverage presents unique issues as the small number of employees (typically two) renders the 25% rule untenable. Therefore when employees are scheduled for Fire Watch or Waste Treatment the first person scheduled by trade for these assignments will be the low houred employee from a list of personnel who have completed the required training and have experience within the dept, any additional personnel will be from the master equalization list. An agreed upon list of personnel will be posted.
160
This list will be updated 30 days following each roll period however, employees may be added at anytime if mutually agreed to by management and the union.
SKILLED TRADES STABILITY
The parties agree that the skilled trades shift and area bumping will be adhered to on the following basis:
1.	Twice per year (January 30lh and July 30,h) employees may exercise their seniority to change areas. However, this will be limited to 10% of each trade per open window and not more than 25% of any trades classification assigned per shift to any area may be displaced per open window. In the event base trades manning does not accommodate 25%, one move will be granted.
2.	Transfer requests must be submitted at least 28 days prior to the open window.
3.	Bumps will be prioritized based on seniority. Employees will be trained in their new assignment up to three (3) weeks prior to move.
4.	The Hourly Preference Selection System (HPS) will be utilized for this process.
5.	Employee transfer requests will be honored within 14 days of the open window.
6.	Employees will be limited to one (1) area transfer per year.
7.	Shift/Crew rolls will be processed per the following agreement. However, shift rolls that require an area transfer will be subject to the transfer restrictions outlined within this section.
SHIFT/CREW PREFERENCE
1.	For the purpose of allowing seniority employees to exercise shift/crew preference within their
161
area, shift/crew assignments will be open for adjustment twelve (12) months a year.
2.	Employees who exercise shift/crew preference must remain on the new shift/crew for at least four (4) months before they can exercise their preference again.
3.	In addition to notifying their supervisor, employees shall submit their application for shift/crew preference on the Hourly Preference System (HPS). Probationary employees may not apply.
4.	Shift/crew preference shall be adjusted by the second Monday following the receipt of the shift/crew preference request. Provided the employee being bumped is provided with at least ten (10) calendar days notice prior to the effective date of the bump.
5.	The employee will use his/her date of entry seniority for the purpose of shift/crew preference.
6.	The Master Agreement recognizes that it is not possible to operate efficiently with all senior employees on any one shift. Therefore, seniority alone cannot be the sole criteria in applying the above principle. That is shift/crew preference based on seniority, and probationary employees will not be displaced until after they have been on the job at least 30 days. When Management finds that recognition of the expressed preference of employees would result in inefficiency, the Union will be notified of the adjustment necessary and the manner in which it will be affected.
7.	Once an approved shift/crew roll has been posted, this shift/crew roll cannot be withdrawn, unless mutually agreed to by the Manufactur-
162

5.	The employee will use his/her date of entry seniority for the purpose of shift/crew preference.
6.	The Master Agreement recognizes that it is not possible to operate efficiently with all senior employees on any one shift. Therefore, seniority alone cannot be the sole criteria in applying the above principle. That is shift/crew preference based on seniority, and probationary employees will not be displaced until after they have been on the job at least 30 days. When Management finds that recognition of the expressed preference of employees would result in inefficiency, the Union will be notified of the adjustment necessary and the manner in which it will be affected.
7.	Once an approved shift/crew roll has been posted, this shift/crew roll cannot be withdrawn, unless mutually agreed to by the Manufactur
162
ing Engineering Manager or designee and the Skilled Trades Chairperson.
SHIFT STARTING TIME CHANGES
In the event it becomes necessary to change, for one calendar week or more, the starting times within shift hours of some employees within a classification performing similar work within a department from the regular starting time of employees within the same classification and department performing similar work, consideration will be given to the requests for starting time changes in making the assignment providing it does not interfere with efficiency of operations.
In the event some employees have a complaint with reference to the above subject, the district committeeperson may register the complaint to the Supervisor of Hourly Personnel and Labor Relations for immediate investigation. If the employee in question is qualified, assignments to the contrary will be readjusted.
MISCELLANEOUS AGREEMENTS
If an employee is moved from his/her desired shift by a reduction in force, he/she will have the right to return to his/her original shift if his/her seniority permits, on the second Monday following his/her request, even though he/she may have exercised his/her right to bump to his/her second desired shift.
When an employee needs to be replaced for a short period of time on a shift because of vacations, medical or other reasons, a seniority employee will be given the opportunity to accept or reject this assignment provided he is qualified to perform the work in question.

Subject: Rental Equipment
Dear Mr. Eskridge:
During 2007 Local Negotiations we discussed the Union’s concern regarding the Company’s utilization of rental power material handling vehicles (PMHV) and other related equipment. The Company and Union have previously developed and implemented a procedure regarding the procurement and utilization of rental equipment in line with the recent Vehicle Operations, Material Planning & Logistics policies. This process includes generating purchase orders, enforcing and adhering to the terms of the rental agreement, and the coordination of equipment delivery and return, ensuring that safety concerns and cost saving measures are addressed.
A Single Point Lesson (MH44, printed on the following page) has been revised and re-issued which provides specific instructions on how to request and obtain rental equipment. Adherence to this policy will ensure proper procedures to procure, monitor and manage the return of all rental equipment are followed. In the event that Company policy or changing business conditions require revision to MH44, the Union will be advised of the reasons for the required change.

Subject: Outside Contractors Utilizing Ford Equipment
Dear Mr. Eskridge:
During 2003 Local Negotiations the Union expressed concern regarding outside contractors utilizing Ford owned equipment. The Company and the Union discussed that this issue has been addressed in the Ford/ UAW Master Collective Bargaining Agreement. In addition, this subject is addressed in the Ford Motor Company North American Construction Specifications, section 01100. Violations will result in corrective actions as outlined within these specifications. Copies of these specifications can be obtained from the company or union safety representatives. The Company reaffirms that outside contractors are not to utilize Kentucky Truck Plant tools and equipment in their scope of work specified in the approved labor clearance. Violations of this contractual provision should be brought to the attention of security personnel, safety personnel or the Labor Relations Supervisor.

Subject: Technical Training
Dear Mr. Eskridge:
During the 2007 Local Negotiations, the Union expressed concerns regarding the ability of the skilled trades employees to receive the technical training necessary to be equipped to work in a new job assignment or in a new area. Every reasonable effort will be made to train our skilled tradespersons on new equipment. The parties agreed that these issues need to be addressed by the Plant’s Technical Training Steering Committee.
The Technical Training Steering Committee meets on a regular basis to discuss the departmental needs, scheduling of classes and individual participation in each class. The schedules are developed and concurred by management before employees are scheduled to attend. Maintenance Managers and/or Skilled Trades Group Leaders may request a need for training be evaluated by completing the Training Initiation Request Process. These requests are kept in a working matrix located on the technical training record tracking system. In addition, Kentucky Truck has a training web site where an employee may view a copy of the quarterly training schedule, as well as make a training request. Both the Company and the Union recognize the importance of continuous improvement in the technical training
211
arena. To that end, the Company and Union Technical Training Coordinators have jointly begun a plant wide needs assessment for all trades and departments. The needs assessments include a generic survey identifying skill sets needed by a specific trade regardless of area of assignment. In addition, department specific surveys identify the knowledge base required for a particular trade and area. The Coordinator will analyze the data from the surveys and publish a report to be shared with all relevant parties. The implementation of the needs assessment will serve as the platform to identify ongoing technical training requirements.
