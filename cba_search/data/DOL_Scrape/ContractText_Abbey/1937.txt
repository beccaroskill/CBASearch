CHANGEOVER AGREEMENT
This agreement shall become effective upon receipt of written notice from the Union on ratification and shall remain in effect until November 12, 2011. However, it is subject to termination by either party upon thirty (30) days notice in writing to either party.
Periods exist when it becomes necessary to place additional employees on skilled classifications of work when journeymen are not available. This agreement is entered into to define the application of “Changeover” classifications when workers are not available in journeymen's classifications in the Maintenance Department.

2.	Plant employees will be given the opportunity to transfer to Changeover classifications provided they have filed applications and have qualifications that are acceptable to Management. However, the Company's right to hire any non-journeyman employees for work in the skilled classifications is still recognized. Such non-journeyman transferees (other than apprentices) shall be known as “Changeover” (Transferred). Non-journeymen employees newly hired for work in the skilled classifications (other than apprentices) shall be known as “Changeover” (New). Changeover employees shall be regarded as temporary for a period of three (3) months on the Changeover classification.
3.	For the purpose of identifying Changeover employees and to prevent an automatic movement in the journeymen classification, changeover employees shall be designated in their respective classification in the following manner:

4.	Changeover employees will not be reclassified to journeymen classifications until such time as they have met the requirements of Section l(c) of this agreement, and then only if they are able to demonstrate ability through job performance and/or examinations, commensurate with those required of
4
journeymen. Such reclassified Changeover employees shall be granted seniority as a journeyman from the date of reclassification to journeyman.
5.	Changeover employees shall enter the Changeover classification at the minimum rate of the journeyman classification unless a C.O.T. has a rate, prior to transfer, higher than the minimum of the C.O.T. classification in which event they will retain the higher rate.
6.	Changeover employees will exercise seniority within their Changeover employee classification 'as of the date of entry into the Changeover group without regard to whether transferred (C.O.T.) or newly hired (C.O.N.).
A.	Changeover employees (Transferred) shall not acquire seniority within the skilled department, but will continue to accumulate seniority on the classification to which they belonged before transferred, except as provided in Section 4 above. Upon a reduction in force from the Changeover (Transferred) classification employees affected will return to the classification held before such transfer, in line with their seniority.
B.	Changeover employees (New) shall acquire seniority as provided for in Section 4 above and in the general labor pool.
7.	In the event of a reduction in force in the skilled departments, layoff will be made in the following order:
A.	All Changeover employees, both transferred and new, will be laid off before any qualified journeyman or apprentice in the same classification is laid off.
B.	Probationary journeymen.
C.	Qualified journeymen and apprentices in accordance with the Local Seniority Agreement. ■
8.	No Changeover employee shall be eligible to work premium time days (Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays) while any journeyman or apprentice on the same classification in the same department has not been given the opportunity to work.
9.	Changeover employees shall be required to sign a wavier indicating consent to the terms and conditions of this agreement and expressly waiving the accumulation of seniority in the skilled trades department.

I.	In making shift roll adjustments or changes in start times, management will survey the classification on the shift that is being moved.
2.	In exercising shift preference, eligible seniority employees will exercise their seniority by classification plant wide if there is an employee with lesser "date of entry" seniority on the chosen shift. In the event the date of entry is the same, the Company hire date will be used as a tiebreaker. In the event the Company date of hire is also the same, the employee with the highest (last four digits only) Social Security number shall be considered senior.
3.	The Master Agreement recognizes “that it is impossible to operate the Plant efficiently with all the higher seniority employees on any one shift and, therefore, seniority alone cannot be the sole determining factor in applying the
16
above principle, " i.e., shift preference based on seniority. When Management finds that recognition of the expressed preference of employees would result in inefficiency, the Union will be notified of the adjustment necessary and the manner in which it will be affected.
4.	The principles as mutually agreed to herein shall apply to all departments going on a two-shift operation at the Louisville Assembly Plant.

Letter of Understanding: Non-Traditional Assignments (Skilled Trades)
Dear Mr. Day:
During the course of the 2003 local negotiations, the parties agree skilled tradespersons may be assigned various non-traditional support positions, such as Material Expeditors, FTPM Coordinators, etc. This letter applies only to the selection of skilled tradespersons.
This letter confirms the understanding when skilled personnel are being considered for support positions, selection will be based upon a seniority survey from the trade chosen by management. Employees currently assigned to any of these positions will not be subject to the provisions of this letter as long as they remain on their current non-traditional support position(s).
This does not abrogate any National Agreement language on selection of skilled trades personnel for specific programs where either special skills are required or where this local process conflicts with National Language, letters or programs (i.e. Joint Programs, Health & Safety Training or processes, other specific training, etc.).
The parties reserve the right to deviate from the provisions of the selection process in this letter by mutual agreement.

Letter of Understanding: Outside Vendors / Contractor
Dear Mr. Day:
This will confirm the understanding reached during the course of the 2007 local negotiations pertaining to outside vendor/contractor used for daily production support on Company property.
When the Company brings an outside contractor in the plant for daily production support, for something other than stand by support, they shall only be used for a temporary basis until the plant Skilled Trades can be trained to fulfill their obligation. Such training may be done with in-plant training and/or outside training if necessary. The training shall be given in a reasonable amount of time in conjunction with the training coordinator.
Whenever possible, the Skilled Trades trainee will work hand and hand with such contractor for additional training needs. Once the trainee has met their training demands the contractor will be requested to vacate.

Dear Mr. Day:

To facilitate the timely notification, all requests for opting out of overtime will be submitted through the plant E-mail system and will be addressed to the Superintendent in Central Maintenance and the maintenance department where the employee is scheduled for the overtime.

Letter of Understanding: Training and Temporary Job Assignments - Skilled Trades
Dear Mr. Day:
During the course of the 2007 local negotiations, the parties discussed several concerns related to the training of the skilled tradespersons. This letter is to confirm our understanding of those issues associated with: 1) identifying the training needs of the tradespersons, 2) scheduling Journeypersons before the Apprentices, 3) training and temporary job assignments in excess of 30 days, and 4) simultaneous training opportunities.
The Company agrees to periodically survey the skilled trades for training needs consistent with maintaining and improving their core job skills. The Company will use the survey to help develop the training offerings through the plant's Technical Skills Program.
Further, when the need for additional training or instruction in a given area is identified within a skilled trades classification, the Company will make a concerted effort to schedule the Journeypersons for training in advance of the Apprentices. If the Company, in an effort to maximize training funds and/or opportunities, finds that it is necessary to adjust an apprentice's or journeyperson's training schedule, the Skilled Trades Committeepersons will be notified.
In an effort to ensure that seniority employees are given adequate consideration, the Company and Union will discuss Skilled Trades Training Assignments in excess of 30 days and 30 day temporary assignments. The parties shall mutually agree, should there be a need to exceed the 30 day period.
In the event Management offers identical training simultaneously at Louisville Assembly Plant (LAP) and another location, the choice of location for taking the training will be offered by seniority. If the number of participants choosing the distant location is too low, then employees will be selected in reverse seniority order.

Dear Mr. Mitchell:
During the course of 1999 local negotiations, the Union requested that the Company reaffirm its acceptance and support for the current Skilled Trades Work Assignments and the process by which disputes are jointly resolved. This letter will confirm the Company’s intent to continue to recognize and support the current Skilled Trades Work Assignments Committee.

If either party chooses not to accept the committee’s recommendation, the matter then may be referred to the grievance procedure.
It is understood that no recommendation made by the committee, or actions taken based on such recommendations will constitute a change to the existing Skilled Trades Work Assignments since such change can occur only through Collective Bargaining. However, it is agreed that any recommendation made by this committee and accepted by the parties will remain in force for the life of the current agreement unless altered, eliminated or ratified by Collective Bargaining.
