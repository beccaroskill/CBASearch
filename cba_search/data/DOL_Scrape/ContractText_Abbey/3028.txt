During such extension, an employee is entitled to all benefits, rights, and entitlements of the contract except that dismissal shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.

applicable to any Westmoreland Manor Nursing position shall not count towards fulfilling the forty-five (45) working day probationary period. Employees changing job titles shall not be required to complete another probationary period to become eligible for benefits.
Section 5:	Absence due to sickness or accident disability or other approved leave of absence shall not constitute an interruption of continuous service, except as provided in Section Two (2).
Section 6:

Section 7:	The names, dates of hire and job classification of all new persons hired, including temporary employees, shall be furnished to the Union within the first thirty (30) work days of employment.

Section 8:	Any employee promoted to a position outside of the unit covered by this Agreement will retain the right to return to his former position, within one (I) year from date of promotion, provided a vacancy exists. Said employee shall be entitled to fill the first such vacancy, notwithstanding Article Sixteen (16) to the contrary. Such employee shall retain all seniority which he accrued prior to the time of his promotion. However, he shall not accrue any seniority for the time spent outside his bargaining unit.
Section 9:	Any current employee who had his seniority determined by the drawing of lots shall retain said seniority on that basis. Effective January 1, 1989 any new employees hired on the same date shall

Section 7:	The County will adopt the proposed twelve (12) hour schedule for TCO’s on a trial basis for at least three (3) months. At the end of that time period, or any time thereafter, the County reserves the right to return to a schedule it deems necessary. The County will meet and discuss the effect of the schedule change and it’s effective date at least twenty (20) days prior to the effective date of the change in schedule. TCO’s will continue to earn sick time and vacation time at the current accrual rates. Accrued hours will be divided by the length of the shift to determine available sick and vacation days. The value of a personal day will be the length of a shift.
ARTICLE ELEVEN (11)
SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL
Section 1:	Throughout the life of this Agreement, the shift differential shall be thirty-five cents ($.35) per hour for the night shift and forty ($.40) cents per hour for the afternoon shift.
17
I
Section 2:	For purposes of applying the aforesaid shift differentials, all hours worked by an employee during the work day shall be considered as worked on the shift on which he is regularly scheduled to start work. Except that any employee who is required to work four (4) or more continuous hours beyond his normal shift and his work time falls within another shift herein, he shall receive the appropriate shift differential pay for all such continuous hours worked in said other shift.
Section 3:	Shifts shall be identified in accordance with the following:
A.	Day shift includes all turns regularly scheduled to commence between 5:00 a.m. and 9:59 a.m., inclusive.
B.	Afternoon shift includes all turns regularly scheduled to commence between 10:00 a.m. and 4:59 p.m., inclusive.

ARTICLE TWELVE (12)
OVERTIME
Section 1:	The County shall be the sole judge of the necessity for overtime.
Section 2:	The County shall retain the sole and exclusive right to determine work schedules and the number of shifts required.
Section 3:	All employees covered in this Agreement shall receive time and one-half (I !4) the regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight (8) hours in one (1) day or forty (40) in one (I) week. Hours are
18
not to be pyramided, except as noted in Article Ten (10), Section Six (6). TCO’s will receive time and one-half (1 >/b) the regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in one (1) week. Hours are not to be pyramided. In theevent the twelve (12) hourschedule at 911 is discontinued, the overtime shall be calculated in accordance with Article Twelve (12), Section Three (3).
Section 4:	Only hours actually worked shall be counted as time worked in the computation of overtime.
Section 5:	Each department shall maintain a record of overtime hours worked by employees within that department subject to the following limitations: Qualified employees within the needed classification shall be given the opportunity to work overtime on the basis of this record, so as to equalize as nearly as practical the opportunity to work overtime within classifications and within departments over a reasonable period of time. As overtime rosters are established in accordance with this provision, senior employees will be placed on top of the list. Ultimately, however, the objective will be to equalize overtime opportunity within a reasonable period of time within departments or section by classification.
The preceding notwithstanding, it is recognized that where a job is in progress, the most practical manner of assigning overtime will be to hold over qualified employees, within the needed classification, who are working on the shift that precedes the overtime. In such a situation, the above referred to roster would be consulted to determine which of the qualified employees in the needed classification would be held over from the preceding shift to perform the overtime work.
Other situations might occur inwhich the County may have to hold employees over (or inwhich a sufficient number of employees cannot be held over and some additional employees must be called in) and when this occurs, the above referred to roster will be consulted to determine which of the qualified employees, within the department or section and within the needed classifications, shall be called in.
It is understood that the County retains discretion to determine the number of employees, if any, within each classification that shall be used as overtime; moreover, nothing in this article is intended to restrict the County's right to limit work assignments to qualified employees. Individual departments may continue overtime scheduling practices consistent with operational needs.

The meal break shall be scheduled within said four (4) additional hours; however, if management determines, at its sole discretion, that a meal break cannot be scheduled because of the operational needs of the department, the employee shall be paid seven dollars ($7.00) in lieu of said meal break. Said payment shall not be included in the regular rate of pay, nor shall it be included in the calculation of overtime or premium pay. Employees shall be reimbursed in accordance with the existing meal allowance of the County and any improvements thereto.
Section 7:	When a situation occurs within the County that imposes a hazard to public safety, it is agreed that any employee shall be assigned to the abatement of that hazard, regardless of whether the work is overtime or not, without violating this Agreement.
Section 8:	No employee will unreasonably refuse to work overtime on any day when the necessity for working such overtime arises. The County reserves the right to discipline, suspend or discharge any employee who violates the provisions of this article. The preceding notwithstanding, however, the fact that other qualified employees were available and did perform the necessary overtime shall be given consideration when disciplinary action is contemplated for a refusal to work overtime.
Section 9:	Overtime distribution rosters will be posted in each department.
Section 10:	Any employee who is required to work on an unscheduled day in his defined work week shall be compensated at the rate of one and one-half (1 W ) times his regular hourly rate of pay for all hours worked on such days. These hours shall not be pyramided. This proviso shall not include voluntary schedule changes between and among employees nor the assignment of additional work days within a schedule of less than five (5) days.

Westmoreland County and S.E.I.U. recognized the desire to offer employees at Westmoreland Manor consistent and reasonable schedules including scheduling alternate weekends off, and that the work schedules for employees at Westmoreland Manor must be altered to accommodate this scheduling change. Westmoreland County and S.E.l.U. agree that the ultimate goal is quality care for the residents of Westmoreland Manor and recognize that staffing directly affects this goaL Therefore, the parties hereto intending to be legally bound hereby agree as follows:
A.	Employees at Westmoreland Manor will be scheduled for alternate weekends off. Alternate weekends off will be implemented and maintained according to the following schedule:
Date	% of Staff on Alternate W/E Schedule
7/1/02	10%
1/1/03	40%
7/1/03	50%
1/1/04	70%
7/1/04	90%
1/1/05	100%
B.	If at any point, due to increasing vacancy rates that are expected to last beyond one month, the County reserves the right to schedule employees at every third weekend off. This change in schedule will affect the least senior employees (per classification, per shift) and only the number of employees necessary to affect safe staffing numbers.

, alternate weekends off.

F.	Employees scheduled for alternate weekends may be required to make up any scheduled weekend missed. Weekend shifts missed due to bereavement leave, leave of absence or extended illness will not need to be rescheduled.
G.	Westmoreland County and S.E.I.U. recognize that there are some departments scheduling more than alternate weekends off. For those currently receiving these schedules, such schedules will be maintained unless conditions change which require an alternate weekend schedule to provide necessary services. But where the current schedules impede other employees from receiving alternate weekends off, the County and S.E.I.U. agree to meet to discuss the fair implementation of alternate weekend scheduling for the affected employees.
H.	Westmoreland County and S.E.I.U. recognize that there are some departments that, due to small staff numbers and the current complement of full time to part time employees, cannot implement alternate weekend scheduling. The County and S.E.I.U. agree to meet to discuss how to improve schedules for those affected employees.

APPENDIX “D”
WESTMORELAND COUNTY
HEPATITIS B INOCULATION POLICY
Westmoreland County has decided to provide Hepatitis B inoculations to at risk employees and to follow up the three (3) shot series with a blood test to determine the result. Employees will be given the inoculations free of charge if they complete the series. Those employees who start the series and do- not complete it in the recommended time frame will be charged the contracted rate of $36.66 per shot received. This could amount to $73.32 for employees who receive the first two (2) shots and do not follow up with their third (3"*) inoculation.
All shots are scheduled in advance at a location and lime that is announced (usually at Westmoreland Manor). If an employee is unable to attend the scheduled inoculation, they must notify their supervisor immediately who will then contact the Human Resources Department. These employees will be instructed to report to Med. Care in Youngwood for their inoculation. Those employees receiving shots at Med Care must do so within two (2) days of the missed scheduled day. Employees receiving their shot at Med Care for whatever reason, will be required to nay for the cost of the office visit and will not be reimbursed for this. Westmoreland County will provide Med Care with the needed serum. Employees with valid and documented medical reasons for not continuing with the series of shots will be exempt from this policy. Employees leaving the employment of Westmoreland County prior to completion of the series will have the cost of the shots received deducted from their final pay.
1 have read the above policy and agree to its terms and
conditions. By signing this I knowingly give Westmoreland County permission to deduct the above cost from my paycheck in accordance with this policy.
