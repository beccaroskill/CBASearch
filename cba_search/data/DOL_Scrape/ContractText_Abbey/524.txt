Exhibit 2
Effective on or about July 1, 2011 Central Hudson will make its matching contribution to deferrals in the Savings Incentive Plan (40IK) with CH Energy Group stock in lieu of cash.
1.	Matching contributions will be made to participant’s accounts once per month.
2.	Participants may exchange out of the Company stock investment at any time subject to NYSE 3 day settlement rules.
3.	Participants will receive tax deferred dividends that are declared by the CH Energy Group Board of Directors on the Company stock (typically quarterly). Dividends will be used to purchase additional shares of stock unless a participant elects to receive their dividends. Dividends paid out to a participant are taxable income.
4.	Participants will pay commissions of 2.9 cents per share for real time trades (commissions are paid for shares a participant receives and for shares the participant sells).
5.	Participants may defer their own contributions into the CH Energy Group stock but will be limited to 25% of their of their total deferral into the CH Energy Group stock. Exchanges and rebalancing into CH Energy Group stock may not exceed 25% of all a participant’s investments in the plan.
6.	Participants will pay a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fee of approximately .0000192 per dollar. The SEC requires that all investment firms charge a special fee known as an SEC fee, on all executed sell orders. This fee is a percentage of the total trade amount. Currently the fee is $19.20 per million dollars.
7.	After the purchase of shares with a participant’s deferral any monies left over will be pooled with the next month employee deferral to apply towards the purchase of additional shares.
8.	Distributions can be in the form of CH Energy Group shares or cash.
Exhibit 3
2006-044
Employees who accept a callout prior to a scheduled vacation day or while on a vacation day or accept a scheduled overtime assignment and work anytime between the 7th and 4th hours prior to the start of their next scheduled vacation day will be considered to have cancelled such vacation day and will work their previously scheduled vacation day in accordance with the normal provisions of the labor agreement.
Employees may elect not to cancel their previously scheduled vacation day, in which case no sleep time will be paid. Employees must inform their supervisor of this election prior to the start of next scheduled vacation day. Employees wishing to change their previously scheduled vacation day from a full day to partial day vacation must make this request to their supervisor. These requests will be approved at the supervisor’s discretion.
2006-055
At the third step hearing the parties discussed various situations relating to emergency operating conditions and the Company’s need for proper staffing. The Company will review with the line organization the circumstances when “all hands on deck” are needed.
Employees may appeal a decision to cancel a floating holiday with the Operating Supervisor.
Employees who have a floating holiday cancelled to meet the operating needs of the Company, and circumstances change after the cancellation of the floating holiday, allowing the reinstatement of the floating holiday, supervision will speak to the affected employees and reinstate the floating holiday, if the employee so wishes. Employees are encouraged to check with their supervision to determine if their floating holiday can be reinstated.
This grievance answer will be reviewed with the line organization and supervision.
2008-09

In recognition that a Chief Gas Mechanic was needed on Saturday, August 9, 2008, agrees to modify the gas crew callouts by chaining all districts’ Chief Gas Mechanics together and all districts’ Gas Mechanics 1/C together once the required complement from the district of need is not reached. The intent of this modification is to create consistent callout procedures that require minimal manual intervention. In addition, the intent is to eliminate calls out of turn; and equalize callout opportunities. The programmed chains in ARCOS for both Chief Gas Mechanic and Gas Mechanicl/C classifications are listed below.

In settlement of Grievance 2005-05 and 2005-83, the Company will agree for the term of the Labor Agreement that when all line personnel in a district (Fishkill, Poughkeepsie, Kingston, Catskill, Newburgh) are called out, the Company will also call out a Field Clerk/Storekeeper from that district. If no district Field Clerk/Storekeeper accepts the callout, the Company is not obligated to call out any other Field Clerk/Storekeeper from another district. The length of the callout for a Field Clerk/Storekeeper is not tied to the length of the callout for any such Linemen.

Exhibit 12
Item 20 of the 1977 Memorandum of Agreement shall be amended to read:
A.	Digest Item 1977-20 established a roving provision for the Line Organization that has from time to time been revised to meet the operating needs of the Company. The parties have agreed to work collectively to develop a means of transitioning to a more Flexible Work Force. The intent of establishing a Flexible Work Force is to provide the staffing necessary to:
1.	Provide the qualified crewing required to supplement existing District resources to productively complete the incremental capital and maintenance work associated with meeting one or more of the following: regulatory requirements, customer commitments, or work plan objectives based on system wide priority.
2.	Provide adequate qualified crewing for larger scale construction projects best suited for the Project Construction Program where a dedicated construction organization is required to be equally or more competitive with outside line contractors, and thereby assist in displacing the number of line contractors working on the Company property.
The transition to a more Flexible Work Force will require establishing and maintaining, for the term of this Labor Agreement, a minimum complement of six Utility Workers and six Linemen 3/C or a minimum of twelve Linemen 3/C. If the complement falls below those levels established above, the Company will post and fill each vacancy within nine months from the date the position was vacated
The Company will designate a group of Linemen/Linewomen 1/C consisting of 20% of Linemen/Linewomen 1/C as Rovers (who became Linemen/Linewomen 1/C on or after May 1,2003) (but in no event fewer than four such Linemen/Linewomen 1/C). The selection of such qualified Linemen/Linewomen 1/C will be from the least senior in such classification. Such employees will report at the normal or designated time to any permanent headquarters within the system from time to time as the Company may determine. Such employees shall only be reimbursed for additional mileage cost for transportation pursuant to Article V-P of the T&D Working Agreement when reporting to other than their normal headquarters.
All current Service Worker B’s who were scheduled to progress to Service Worker A will retain the Service Worker B’s pay rate 17 until they progress to Lineman/Linewoman 1/C.
Scheduled overtime records and a call-out system for such employees will be maintained at each such employee’s normally designated headquarters.
B.	Effective May 1,2011, the parties agree that all current and future individuals assigned to the position of Lineman/Linewoman 3/C after January 1, 2011, and progressing to the position of Lineman/Linewoman 2/C, and then progressing to Lineman/Linewoman 1/C shall become part of the Flexible Work Force but shall have a permanent headquarter assignment. Linemen/Linewomen 1/C in the Flexible Work Force will report at the normal or designated time to any permanent headquarters within the system or Project Construction job site reporting location from time to time as the Company may determine. When a Lineman/Linewoman 1/C in the Flexible Work Force is assigned to a Project Construction job site they will be subject to all provisions of the Project Construction Program as outlined under Exhibit 127 of the Labor Agreement. When the Flexible Work Force complement of Linemen/Linewomen 1/C reaches twelve, then the group of Linemen/Linewomen 1/C designated as Rovers consisting of 20% of Linemen/Linewomen 1/C shall be suspended. If the current Service Worker shift complement has a vacancy and cannot be filled through post & bid, then the Lineman/Linewoman 1/C with the least seniority currently assigned to either Project Construction or the Districts with a 60 month Service Worker commitment will be assigned the Service Worker A vacancy as their permanent headquarters.
C.	The parties agree that the Company will continue to require permanent staffing of Linemen/Linewomen 1/C in the District Headquarters in addition to Service Workers to support daily operation and maintenance requirements. There shall be Linemen/Linewomen 1/C excluded from the Flexible Work Force to support the District Operations. These Linemen shall be determined based on seniority.
D.	Effective May 1, 2011, the parties agree that the six least senior Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) will become part of the Flexible Work Force. Subsequent postings and assignments for Working Foreman/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) will become part of the Flexible Work Force, in accordance with paragraph D (1) below, but shall have a permanent headquarter assignment.
1.	When the Flexible Work Force complement of Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) reaches eight, then based on seniority, as each new Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) is created, they will become part of the Flexible Work Force and replace an existing Working Foreman/Working Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) on the Flexible Work Force.
Such Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) will report at the normal or designated time to any permanent headquarters within the system or Project Construction job site reporting location from time to time as the Company may
determine. Such Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) shall only be reimbursed for additional mileage cost for transportation pursuant to Article V-P of the T&D Working Agreement when reporting to a headquarters other than their normal headquarters. Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) reporting to a Project Construction job site reporting location shall be reimbursed in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit 127. During the term of the Labor Agreement, Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) designated as Flexible Work Force assigned to Project Construction shall have the option to opt out of Project Construction after 27 months (this service need not be continuous) The Working Foremen/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) who successfully bid or are assigned to Project Construction will be subject to all provisions of Exhibit 127, except as noted below.
Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) who did not bid, but are subsequently assigned to Project Construction, will have the option to work, but not be forced to work, the 10 hour/day work schedule provided that there is at least one Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) on each project working the 10 hour/day work schedule. A Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) designated as Flexible Work Force who decides not to work the 10 hour/day work schedule will also have the option to remain on the scheduled overtime list and callout system for such employee’s normally designated headq uarters, but will be held to the 20% response requirement of the Callout Response Program. If neither Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) designated as Flexible Work Force assigned to a Project Construction job site volunteers for the 10 hr/dav work schedule, such assignment shall be determined based on seniority. The Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) assigned to Project Construction will be subject to all other provisions of Exhibit 127.
Scheduled overtime records and a call-out system for Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) assigned to an alternate headquarters but not Project Construction will be maintained at each such employee’s normally designated headquarters.
E.	The parties agree that the Company will continue to require permanent staffing of Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) in the District Headquarters to support daily operation and maintenance requirements. There shall be Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) excluded from the Flexible Work Force to support the District Operations. These Linemen shall be determined based on seniority.
The foregoing shall not preclude the Company from assigning any Second or Third-Class Lineman/Linewomen to any headquarters for training as may be required, in accordance with Article IV (J4).
In view of the foregoing, all Linemen/Linewomen shall continue to progress through the Linemen/Linewomen automatic progression series. (See Exhibit 127). (CH 43 & 45)
1.	Exhibit 126 shall be amended to read as follows: This Agreement replaces Exhibit 91 to incorporate the following provisions for the term of the existing Labor Agreement.
a.	Except as specifically amended by this Agreement, all existing five year commitments for Linemen/Linewomen 1/C, Service Worker A’s and Service Worker B’s shall remain in effect until such commitments have been fulfilled by the affected employees.
b.	Line personnel who were Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV), Lineman/Linewoman 1/C, or Service Workers on May 1, 2003 and still had the one-year obligation at that time are considered to have fulfilled it as of May 1, 2006 (Sunset Clause).
c.	Any employee who held the classification of Lineman/Linewoman 1/C, Lineman/Linewoman 2/C, Lineman/Linewoman 3/C, Service Worker B, Service Worker A or Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) as of 2/1/90 was grandfathered and exempt from the mandatory reassignment.
The Company maintains the right to fill the Midnight to 8:00 AM Service Worker shift. The Company will fill the Midnight to 8:00 AM Service Worker shift if it determines operating conditions warrant such a shift. If the Company makes the determination to fill the Midnight to 8:00 AM Service Worker shift, the Company shall meet with the President and Business Manager of Local 320 in an attempt to identify other alternatives that will meet the operating needs of the Company. If the Midnight to 8:00 AM shift is implemented, all affected Local 320 employees will be notified a minimum of 30 days prior to the start of the schedule. If a Midnight to 8:00 AM Service Worker shift is reestablished, the 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM Service Worker shift will revert back to 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM.
All existing Service Worker A’s (109.1), as of 02/01/01, will continue to be exempted from being scheduled to work the Midnight to 8:00 AM shift. Such Service Workers may be assigned to work shifts consisting of 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM and/or 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM and such shifts will not be considered to be working the Midnight to 8 AM shift. If the Service Worker schedule, which need not conform to the Midnight to 8:00 AM, 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM and 4:00 PM to Midnight shifts, includes a shift from 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM and/or 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM these exempt Service Workers, working such shift, will not compromise their Midnight to 8:00 AM shift exemption. However, if these Service Worker A’s bid to another headquarters, they will be subject to work the Midnight to 8:00 AM shift.
Employees in the classification of Service Worker B (109.2) are subject to being assigned to work the Midnight to 8 AM shift. However, Service Worker B’s will not be assigned to cover a shift or any part of a shift alone or be paired with another Service Worker B to fill a Service Worker shift or any part of a shift.
Service Workers’ workdays off will be rotated as provided for in Article III C of the T&D Labor Agreement.
It is the Company’s intent to continue to operate all Service Crews as one-person crews. There are circumstances, related to the nature of a work assignment, where two one-person crews may be teamed together to complete an assignment. Where two one-person crews are teamed together, and the crew determines that it may be advantageous to operate as a two-person crew in a single truck, the crew will first discuss it with a supervisor and get agreement from the supervisor.
Where there is a Service Worker shift vacancy and the Company determines that such vacancy needs to be filled, the Company will first post to fill the vacancy.
Any individual who becomes a Lineman/Linewoman 1/C on or after 02/01/01 shall be subject to being assigned (either through reassignment under this agreement, post & bid or outside hire) into the Service Worker A position without any examination for promotion to Service Worker A.
Individuals who enter this Program will be obligated to serve in the Service Worker A position for a period of not less than 60 months (this service need not be continuous). The Company and the Union agree to permit Service Worker A’s, with less than 60 months as a Service Worker A, to bid a posted position in the Project Construction Program, such time assigned to the Project Construction Program will be credited toward the minimum 60-month commitment as a Service Worker A but such credit will be limited to 36 months for employees progressing to Lineman 1/C or Service Worker A effective May 1, 2012 as outlined in Exhibit 127.
The Company shall post for a Lineman/Linewoman 1/C and give Service Worker A’s, who are not needed to maintain the complement necessary to staff the Service Worker shift schedules that are in place at the time of such posting, the opportunity to bid to Lineman/Linewoman 1/C, regardless of the time they may have left on their 60-month Service Worker A commitment. Seniority shall prevail regardless of time served as a Service Worker A.
If the Company has a need for temporary Linemen/Linewomen 1/C in Project Construction, it will post. In the event there are no bidders to a temporary Lineman/Linewoman 1/C posting for Project Construction, the Company may
assign a Lineman/Linewoman 1/C to Project Construction provided the Lineman/Linewoman 1/C still has time remaining on his/her 5 year Service Worker A commitment. Such service as a temporary Lineman/Linewoman 1/C PC shall count as service for purposes of fulfilling an individual's 60-month Service Worker A commitment as outlined in Exhibit 127 and paragraph 7C above. Until this 60-month commitment is fulfilled, these individuals shall remain available for reassignment to the Service Worker A position as provided for under this agreement. Such group shall be comprised of the junior Service Workers A and/or Linemen/Linewomen 1/C that have time remaining on their 60-month Service Worker A commitment. All terms and conditions of the Project Construction program shall apply.
An individual hired on or after 02/01/01 directly into a Lineman/Linewoman 3/C position in progression to Service Worker A will also be eligible, prior to completing their 5 year Service Worker A commitment, to bid into other positions outside the Line classifications; however, if they do, they will maintain their obligation to complete the remainder of their 5 year Service Worker A commitment if they return to a Line classification.
In no event will any 5 year Service Worker A obligation extend beyond 12 years from the original date of the assignment of the employee to Service Worker A or Lineman/Linewoman 1/C, provided that the employee remains in the classification of Service Worker A or Lineman/Linewoman 1/C. There is no obligation on the part of the Company to post for Lineman/Linewoman 1/C or to reassign Service Workers A’s following the expiration of this 12 year period, except as otherwise provided for in this agreement. Any employees who bid for and accept a position as one of the 41 permanent Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) shall be considered to have fulfilled their obligation as long as they remain in that classification.
The Union and Company will discuss and rectify, if possible, the assignment of any individual that would result in a more favorable headquarters assignment being made to an individual with less seniority (including new hires) over a more senior individual.
Any employee reassigned on a mandatory basis shall be eligible for mileage reimbursement (with the rate consistent with Article V P of the T & D Labor Agreement.) Such reimbursement shall not exceed 24 months. The provisions of Article V G shall not apply.
Future Linemen/Linewomen 1/C subject to being assigned to Service Worker A will be assigned on a voluntary basis and if enough individuals do not accept the assignment, the employees with the lowest seniority will be assigned.
The parties will maintain a committee consisting of up to 5 members of the Union and up to 5 members of Management during the term of this Agreement. Meetings will be held at the request of either party to discuss any aspect of the program that is of concern to either or both of the parties.
Employees who were Working Foremen/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV), Linemen/Linewomen 1/C or currently assigned Service Worker A’s on May 1, 2003 have fulfilled their obligation as of May 1, 2006.
The Pay Group for Service Worker A shall be Pay Group 21.
Except as specifically amended by this Service Worker Agreement, all existing five-year commitments previously established under the Labor Agreement for Linemen/Linewomen 1/C, Service Worker A’s, and Service Worker B’s shall remain in effect until such commitments have been fulfilled by the affected employees.
Effective May 1, 2011, the parties agree that all current and future individuals assigned to the position of Lineman/Linewoman 3/C after January 1,2011 shall progress to the position of Lineman/Linewoman 2/C, and then Lineman/Linewoman 1/C and become part of the Flexible Work Force. If the current Service Worker shift complement has a vacancy and cannot be filled through post & bid, the junior Lineman/Linewoman 1/C with a 60-month Service Worker commitment will be assigned the Service Worker A vacancy as their permanent headquarters. All current Service Worker B’s who were scheduled to progress to Service Worker A will retain the Service Worker B’s pay rate 17 until they progress to Lineman 1/C.
The following procedure shall be followed when covering absences of Service Workers.
All Service Workers A’s and Service Worker B's (assigned to a shift) in the District are eligible to be called for any shift. Service Worker B's will only be called to cover a shift if a Service Worker A is scheduled to work the same shift. Service Worker B's will not be assigned to cover a shift alone or be paired with another Service Worker B.
When a shift vacancy occurs, the Company may elect to cover part or all of the shift. When the decision is made to cover part or all of the shift, the assignment will be offered to the Service Workers in accordance with the process outlined below:
1.	Call, if available, a Service Worker in the District on their first day off.
2.	Call, if available, a Service Worker in the District on their second day off.
3.	Assign, if available, a Service Worker in the District on the prior shift to work an additional four hours and call, if available, a Service Worker in the District on the following shift to report to work fours hours ahead of such Service Worker’s scheduled shift. The selection of the Service Worker to work an additional four hours shall be made from the scheduled overtime list. The selection of the Service Worker to report to work four hours early shall be made from the callout list. Assign, if available, a Service Worker in the District on the prior shift to work eight additional hours. The selection of such Service Worker shall be made from the scheduled overtime list.
4.	Call, if available, a Service Worker on the following shift to report to work eight hours early. The selection of the Service Worker shall be made from the call out list.
The off Service Worker is defined as a Service Worker who is not scheduled to work for the entire calendar day and shall be called using the callout list. Consideration shall be given to the Service Worker’s respective position on the list and the number of skips already assigned to each Service Worker. If all eligible Service Workers have the same number of skips, they shall be called in the order they appear on the call out list. If the Service Workers have different numbers of skips, the Service Worker with the lowest number of skips shall be called first. (See Example)
A skip shall be applied to those Service Workers called to work. No skip shall be applied if the pointer was at a Service Worker called. Skips are only removed when the pointer moves past a Service Worker during a normal call out.
If, after going through the above procedure, no Service Worker is available to cover a shift and the Company has determined that coverage is required, the shift may be filled in accordance with the terms of Exhibit 74 of the Labor Agreement.
Pay and meals for the employee called shall be administered in accordance with Exhibit 32 of the Labor Agreement.
EXAMPLE TO EQUALIZE SKIPS
The following example is a call out to fill an unscheduled Service Worker vacancy. The sequence begins with the Service Worker with the least amount of skips.

Exhibit 127 shall be amended to read as follows:
Exhibit 127 - Project Construction Program Agreement
A.	The intent of the Project Construction Organization is to be a dedicated construction organization, assigned to large-scale construction projects that would typically last 3 or more days, which will maximize crew productivity on construction projects, be equally or more competitive with outside line contractors, and assist in reducing the number of line contractors working on the Company property.
B.	The Project Construction Organization will be assigned to the Customer Services Group.
C.	The work force of the Project Construction Organization can be permanently headquartered in one or more normally staffed headquarters with like type job classifications. The Project Construction permanent headguarters will be established through the post & bid process utilizing temporary postings. In the event the Company changes the Headquarters at any time in the future, the Company may do so through a subsequent temporary posting. Any temporary posting under this program may extend for the term of the Labor Agreement. Under these provisions, the posting is subject to an individual employee’s right to opt out of the Program after completion of 12 months in the Program, and additional opportunities to opt out of the Program every 12 months thereafter and such employee shall be returned to their permanent job and headquarters as soon as possible thereafter but in no case more than 30 days. If an individual wishes to opt out of the program at any other time, and Management agrees to such opt out, such individual shall be returned to their permanent job and headquarters at the completion of their current assignment or within 30 days whichever occurs first. If such return is to a job they left less than 6 months before, such individual will maintain their position on the scheduled overtime list with the hours they had when they left their permanent headquarters, and all scheduled overtime hours they worked as part of Project Construction will be added to their scheduled overtime hours on the list in their permanent headquarters.
D.	Multiple alternate headquarter reporting will be established. Each Project Construction job that is expected to last at least 90 days or more shall be posted. This provision includes normally staffed headquarter reporting and project jobsite reporting. Employees of a Project Construction Crew will report at the beginning of the workday and be dismissed at the end of the
1
day from the alternate headquarters site, from the project jobsite to which they are assigned, or from their permanent headquarters.
E.	The Project Construction work force will include, but not be limited to, Linemen/Linewomen 1/C, Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) and Chief Line Clearance Men/Women. The work force will be established through a temporary posting for the purpose of performing project construction work on a job site reporting basis. Other employees assigned to the Project Construction work force may be assigned in accordance with paragraphs F, G, H, and I below and in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit 126.
F.	Employees may be assigned to this program through Article IV J 4 for training during their progression period. (Linemen/Linewomen 3/C may be assigned for up to 9 months of their 18 month progression period and Lineman/Linewomen 2/C or Service Worker B for up to 18 months during their 30 months in progression.) These employees shall be assigned for a minimum of 40 hours/week and will conform to the work schedule of the Project Construction Crew and all other conditions of this Project Construction Agreement. However, any such employee may enter this program through a temporary posting through post and bid.

The Company shall assign two Temporary Working Foremen/Forewomen 1/C (HV) from the list of gualified bidders.
2.	In the event that there are no gualified bidders to a Temporary Working Foreman/Forewoman 1/C (HV) posting for Project Construction, the Company shall assign a qualified Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) from the Flexible Work Force (1977-20) to Project Construction. Such assignment shall be to the classification of Temporary Working Foreman/Forewoman
2
1/C (HV). The Company shall also assign one Temporary Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) from the list of qualified bidders.
3.	If there is only one qualified bidder for the Temporary Working Foreman/Forewoman 1/C (HV) posting, then the Company shall also assign one Temporary Working Foreman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) from the list of qualified bidders.
4.	In the event that there are no qualified bidders to a Temporary Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) posting, the Company may assign a Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) from the Flexible Work Force (1977-20) to Project Construction.

I.	If the Company has a need for temporary Linemen/Linewomen 1/C in Project Construction, it will post. In the event there are no bidders to a temporary Lineman/Linewoman 1/C posting for Project Construction, the Company may assign a Lineman/Linewoman 1/C to Project Construction provided the Lineman/Linewoman 1/C still has time remaining on his/her 5 year Service Worker A commitment. Such service as a temporary Lineman/Linewoman 1/C - PC shall count as service for purposes of fulfilling an individual’s 60-month Service Worker A commitment but such credit will be limited to 36 months for employees progressing to Lineman 1/C or Service Worker A effective May 1, 2012. Such group shall be comprised of the junior Service Workers A and/or Linemen/Linewomen 1/C that have time remaining on their 60-month Service Worker A commitment. All terms of the Project Construction Program shall apply.
J.	Until the Flexible Work Force complement of Linemen/Linewomen 1/C reaches twelve, the provisions of 1977-20 do not apply to Linemen/Linewomen 1/C assigned to the Project Construction Program. No Linemen/Linewomen 1/C assigned to the Project Construction Program will be included in the percentage calculation provided for in 1977-20 nor will any Linemen/Linewomen 1/C assigned to the Project Construction Program be classified as a Rover while in said program.

5.	A training program will be provided to ail future employees prior to participating in the Program. Adequate refresher training will be provided to incumbents on an as-needed basis.
6.	Exhibit 17 of the Labor Agreement shall not be modified as a result of this agreement. Any Lineman/Linewoman 1/C	(HV), Working
Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV), Working Foreman/Forewoman 1/C (HV), or Service Worker A (HV) participating in this gloving program who is called out of turn to direct-handle 15KV energized conductors shall have a skip applied.
7.	Direct-handling of 15KV energized circuits shall not be performed in inclement weather or during the hours of darkness. (Emergencies shall not affect this prohibition).
8a.

The work associated with establishing a new service including inspection of appliance installations, care for leaks and stoppages, adjustment of appliances and inspection and adjustment of gas regulators, shall be performed by Commercial Representatives. A gas crew may connect the new service piping to the customer piping and set the gas meter.
Overtime
Relighting is to be performed on an overtime basis by gas crews in accordance with these general guidelines. Notwithstanding the Company’s right to uniformly make assignments on an overtime and regular time basis, gas crews will be assigned to relight on an overtime basis when repairing leaks, responding to emergencies, and relighting at the completion of an assignment on an extended workday. Gas crews will not be assigned to relight appliances on an overtime basis when the work has been scheduled with the knowledge that gas service will be interrupted. Commercial Representatives perform these scheduled overtime relights.
General
Bearing in mind that the relight assignment to a gas crew is intended to be incidental to their normal construction, repair and maintenance work, there is no restriction on number of services which may be relighted. Assignments to relight construction and maintenance jobs should be made with the purpose of scheduling and utilizing all employees in an effective manner.
Relocating Gas Meters
The relocation of the meter and associated piping, including tying into the customer piping, can be performed by either craft, separately or jointly. Relighting will not be performed by members of a gas crew.
Changing a Gas Meter in Accordance with the PSC Time Test Program
Commercial Representatives shall be responsible for changing small meters associated with the PSC time test program. A crew consisting of at least a Gas Mechanic and a Commercial Representative may work jointly to change a large meter.
Interruption by Others
When service is interrupted by a third party excavator, relighting will not be performed by gas crews. When the interruption is caused by the gas crew in response to damage by a third party excavator, the management reserves the right to assign Gas Mechanics the responsibility for relighting.
