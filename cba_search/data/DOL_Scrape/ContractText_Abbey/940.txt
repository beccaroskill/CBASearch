|	ARTICLE 12 ♦ CORRECTIVE ACTION
! Section 12.1 Progressive Corrective Action. The parties agree that a fairly administered progressive corrective action procedure can be effective in identifying and remedying many problems which inierfere with employee job I performance. They recognize, however, that very serious offenses may warrant immediate discharge. No corrective action shall be taken without just cause and all corrective actions shall be issued within ten (10) working days of learning of the cause for corrective action. Employees shall be furnished a copy of corrective action notices when issued, and one (1) copy shall be given to the Union steward if the employee has requested ;	that the steward be present If no Union steward is present and the employee is suspended or discharged, a copy of
■	the corrective action shall be submitted to the area steward. Except for serious offenses, the progressive corrective
action process shall not be advanced if six (6) months or more have elapsed since the employee's last previous
I corrective action or regression as provided below. Corrective actions in an employee's file will not be furnished or shown to prospective employers absent specific authorization by that employee.
Section 12.2 Suspension Pending Investigation. The Hospitals agree that when imposing discipline an employee shall not remain in “suspended pending investigation" status for more than fourteen (14) calendar days beginning with the date the suspension is issued and only will be placed in such status for serious offenses that could result in suspension or discharge for the first offense. In the event such time period is exceeded, the employee shall be paid at his or her straight time hourly rate of pay for all days in excess of fourteen (14) days until the day the final corrective action is issued by the Hospitals. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall prevent the Hospitals from suspending or discharging such employee and payment of wages shall not be introduced as evidence for any purpose whatsoever in any subsequent proceeding concerning a corrective action, decision by the Hospitals.
Section 12.3 Regression of Corrective Action. An employee who has received a corrective action for a minor offense and who works forthe next twelve (12) consecutive months without receiving an additional corrective action for the same type of offense, will have the corrective action which was issued for the minor offense reduced to the next lowest level of discipline for the purposes of regressing the corrective action process. Following the
8
regression, when and if the employee is charged with the same type of minor offense, the corrective action imposed shall be at the regressed level of corrective action achieved pursuant to this section. A notation of any annulled corrective action will be kept in the employee’s file. Any annulment processed hereunder will not obligate the Hospitals to reimburse the employee for any lost wages that may have been imposed with the corrective action. Last chance agreements shall be for a period of no more than two years.
Section 12.4 Corrective Action Considered When Bidding. Corrective action issued within the preceding nine (9) months may be considered in evaluating the qualifications of an employee to satisfactorily perform the work of a position which he or she is seeking pursuant to the applicable seniority articles of this Agreement.
Section 12.5 Union Representation During Interviews. Employees shall be entitled, on request, to Union representation during the course of any investigatory interview by a Hospitals representative if the employee reasonably believes that such interview might result in corrective action.
Section 12,6 Drug and Alcohol Testing. In all cases where the Hospitals suspects an employee is impaired and/or under the influence of drugs or alcohol, the employee will be afforded Union representation in advance of the employee being interviewed and/or being directed to undergo an alcohol or drug test, provided, however, that the testing shall not be unreasonably delayed. Pursuant to this proviso, the Hospitals, for the purpose of expediting this process and affording a representative, will contact a steward from (he list to be provided by the Union, which list is to be kept updated by the Union.
The Hospitals and the Union agree that as a Healthcare provider, the Hospitals has a vital interest in maintaining safe, healthful and productive working conditions for its employees, as well as for its patients, visitors and others at the Hospitals. Being under the influence of a drug or alcohol on the job may pose serious safety and health risks, not only to the employee, but to all employees, patients and visitors.
Therefore, the illegal manufacture, possession, distribution, dispensing, use, sale or being under the influence of alcohol and drugs on Hospitals property or while performing Hospitals business, is strictly prohibited. Any employee engaged in any such conduct will be subject to disciplinary action, including termination, even for a first offense of such conduct. For purposes of Chis agreement employees who, while performing their assigned duties, pick up and properly dispose of refuse containing intoxicants such as alcoholic beverage containers, medical supplies and contents of ashtrays, shall not be deemed to be in personal possession of such materials.
The parties agree that alcohol/drug testing is one means of ensuring a drug-free workplace. Such testing of an employee may be required by the Hospitals when there is a reasonable suspicion that an employee is under the influence of alcohol or drugs while on Hospitals property or on Hospitals business. Such tests are an important part of the Hospitals investigation of alcohol or drug misuse and any refusal to take such a test will result in termination.
In advance of any alcohol/drug testing, the following will occur:
(1)	Supervisors and managers will receive fitness-for-duty training which will include training to recognize signs of impairment. This training will be presented to interested union representatives, upon request; and
(2)	Representatives from the Hospitals and the Union will meet to discuss testing issues of concern to the Union such as confidentiality and testing procedures.
The Hospitals and Union further agree that employees who misuse alcohol and/or are substance dependent should be encouraged to enroll in a treatment program or otherwise seek assistance for alcohol/drug problems. Referrals can be made through the Hospitals’ Employee Assistance Program. An employee’s participation in such programs will not jeopardize job security. Likewise, participation in such a program will not preclude the discipline or discharge of an employee for failure to maintain satisfactory performance, conduct, attendance, or
9
for failing to adhere to conditions of continued employment following a rehabilitation program if required by the program.
The Hospitals and the Union recognize that there shall be no random testing of employees covered by this Agreement (unless pursuant to a last chance agreement resulting from a violation of the Hospitals drug and alcohol policies). However, employees who have been off the active payroll for one year or more for any reason shall be subject to a health screening, including drug testing. Employees will be afforded the opportunity at the time of testing to authorize the Union to receive a copy of the test results. If the employee has given such authorization, the Hospitals will provide test results to the Union's business representative within two (2) business days of its receipt of same.
ARTICLE 13	- SUBCONTRACTING
The Hospitals agree not to contract any work which is ordinarily and customarily performed by its regular employees, where it would result in the layoff of bargaining unit employees without first in good faith complying with the remaining provisions of this Article.
Recognizing the Union's long-standing concern over the contracting out of work necessitating layoff of bargaining unit employees, the Hospitals will provide as much advance notice as is practicable under the circumstances for purposes of affording the Union the opportunity to bargain concerning such change and reviewing the various alternatives before deciding whether or not to contract out such work. Such alternatives to be considered shall include, but not be limited to whether bargaining unit employees may with reasonable training acquire the skills or become otherwise qualified to perform the work in question.
The Union agrees that in bargaining, full consideration and weight will be given to economic savings and institutional needs. The Hospitals agree that in bargaining, full consideration and weight will be given to the economic impact on bargaining unit members; and provided further that the Hospitals will not subcontract for the purpose of eroding the bargaining unit or avoiding die terms and conditions of this Agreement.
The contracting out of bargaining unit work shall not be considered for any purpose whatsoever as an abandonment by the Union of its jurisdictional claim to have the subcontracted work performed by its members at some future date if the Hospitals later decides to terminate its subcontractor and resume utilization of its own employees.
ARTICLE 14	- DISABILITY COVERAGE
The Hospitals agree to provide disability coverage for employees who have completed their probationary period. Following is a general description of the benefits and conditions of this Plan:
1.	Any employee who is absent from work because of a non-work connected accident or illness will be entitled to benefit payments beginning the fifteenth (15lh) day of such absence or at the completion of time covered by accrued sick leave, whichever is the longer period.
2.	The benefit payment will be sixty percent (60%) for full-time employees and forty percent (40%) for part-time employees of basic straight-time hourly earning but not to exceed two hundred dollars (S200) per week (effective with ratification of this Agreement). Such benefits shall continue so long as the employee is disabled until the end of a thirteen (13) week period that begins with the first day of absence, or until commencement of long term disability coverage, but in no event shall such benefits be paid for more than twenty-six (26) weeks.
10
3.	Employees who are injured on the job or suffer occupational injury or occupational illness will be entitled to prompt handling of their claims for referral to such outside insurance carriers utilized by the Hospitals fur processing such claims.
Upon fifteen (15) days written notice, the Hospitals may reopen Articles on Disability Coverage, Sick Leave with Pay, Authorized Hospitals Holidays, and Vacations With Pay for the purpose of negotiating a Paid Time Off (“PTO”) program.
If the Hospitals elects to reopen the contract to propose a PTO plan, die Union may, within fourteen (14) days of notice of such reopening, reopen the contract to propose improvements in the Disability Pay provision.
If, after reopening the foregoing provisions, the Hospitals unilaterally implements a PTO program, the Hospitals agrees it will not: a) implement a program prior to January, 2005, or b) implement a program which provides employees with less paid time off than they currently enjoy.
Notwithstanding any language to the contrary contained in the collective bargaining agreement, the parties agree that, solely with respect to any reopened provisions, the Hospitals retains its rights under the law to unilaterally implement a final proposal after impasse and the Union retains its right under the law to strike.

Failure to submit such proof upon request shall automatically disqualify such employee for sick leave allowance with pay and may result in further disciplinary action.
Full-time employees must use accrued hours (sick, vacation, or personal) for purposes of routine doctor's appointments. Employees must inform departmental supervision at the lime the appointment is made. The Hospitals reserve the right to request proof that the time off was in fact used for the purpose requested. Failure to submit such proof upon request shall automatically disqualify such employees for accrued hours utilization and may result in further disciplinary action.
Employees unable to report for work shall so inform their department as soon as possible. Time lost by employees who fail to notify their departments as required shall be treated as an unexcused absence. Employees who expect to return and are unable to return at their regular starting time that day, shall coll in as above.
II
In December of each year, employees may elect to convert any portion of their unused sick leave hours accrued that calendar year, at the rate of one-half (1/2) the total amount, at the employees’ regular straight-time hourly rate. Employees must notify their supervisor of their election by November 1 of each year.
Upon retirement, an employee may redeem up to seven hundred (700) hours, at the rate of one hour for each two redeemed, at the employees’ regular straight-time hourly rate. All other accrued unused sick leave shall lapse upon termination of employment.
Section 15.4 Employees who have exhausted sick leave but who are eligible to use accrued vacation may, if they so desire, substitute such vacation hours for sick leave. If employees are required by the Hospitals to leave their jobs to secure a medical examination, the time thus lost shall be counted as time worked and the cost of such examination shall be borne by the Hospitals.
Section 15,5 Absences resulting from accidents or illness and compensated under the Workmen's Compensation or Occupational Diseases Acts of the State of Illinois, shall not be charged against the employee's accrued sick leave except to the extent necessary to make up the difference between salary when so requested by the employee.
ARTICLE 16	- OTHER ALLOWANCES

In either case, the employee retains the check issued by the court for expenses.
12
In order to receive payment, an employee must give the supervisor notice of the summons at the earliest practicable time. The provisions of this Section are not applicable to an employee who fails to cooperate in seeking to be excused from jury duty when the Hospitals deem seeking to be so excused is in order.

Re: Working Ootdoon
Dear Mr. Walston:
During the recent 2003-2004 contract negotiations between your Union and the Hospitals covering the Service and Maintenance Unit employees, we agreed to renew the terms of certain letters of understanding which had been previously agreed to during prior negotiations between the Hospitals and the Union.
Regarding snow removal, the Hospitals will make adequate winter wear available to members of tire bargaining unit required to work outside in inclement weather. Employees receiving such winter wear are responsible for it while in their possession. The Union and the Hospitals agree that certain employees may be physically unable to perform the snow removal tasks, and those persons should not be required to do so. For the removal of abnormal snowfalls, meaning six (6) inches or more in a twenty-four hour period, or lesser snow accompanied by drifting requiring substantially more effort the Hospitals will pay the employees premiums, in addition to their regular straight-time hourly rates amounting to $1.00 per hour for each hour or any portion of an hour to Hospitals (including Parking Attendants) Employees.
Also, the above premium shall be paid whenever they are required to remove snow from public areas, such as city sidewalks. The above premiums shall be paid at the one and one-half (1 '4) times basis when the work is performed as overtime hours.
Please indicate your concurrence by signing and returning a copy of this letter to my attention.

Re: Letter of Understanding
Dear Mr. Walston:
During the recent 2003-2004 contract negotiations between your Union and the Hospitals covering the Service and Maintenance Unit & Clerical Unit employees, we agreed to renew the terms of certain letters of understanding which had been previously agreed to during prior negotiations between the Hospitals and the Union.
The matters agreed upon were as follows:
1.	SIXTEEN HOUR EMPLOYEES. If a sixteen (16) hour employee (excluding student employees) works an average of forty (40) or more hours per pay period for more than seven (7) consecutive pay periods, or if the employee exceeds 280 hours for the same seven (7) consecutive pay periods, the Hospitals will change the employee's status to regular part-time and he/she thereupon becomes a union member. This provision does not apply to relief employees in the Food and Nutrition Services Department as provided in Article 35.
2.	PAYCHECK ERRORS. If the Hospitals causes a paycheck shortage of S50 to 5100 and the employee notifies Hospitals supervision of the error by noon on payday, the Hospitals will correct the error by the following Wednesday. If the Hospitals caused the shortage and it is greater than $100, and the employee notifies Hospitals supervision by noon on payday, the Hospitals will correct the error that day. The Hospitals will not issue a separate pay check if the employee caused the shortage (e.g., failing to property record time), except that if an employee promptly notifies Hospitals supervision of an error of at least $200.00 the Hospitals will issue a separate paycheck as soon as practical, but in any event, no later than the next business day.
3.	PAYCHECK DISTRIBUTION. The Hospitals will make every reasonable effort to make paychecks available by noon on payday.
Please indicate your concurrence by signing and returning a copy of this letter to my attention.

Re: Operating Room Premiums; General Operating Room and CLI Operating Room
Dear Mr. Walston:
During the recent 2003-2004 contract negotiations between your Union and the Hospitals covering the Service and Maintenance Unit employees, we agreed to renew the terms of certain letters of understanding which had been previously agreed to during prior negotiations between the Hospitals and the Union.
1.	The Housekeeping Assistants assigned to the General Operating Rooms (GOR) and Chicago Lying In Operating Rooms (CL1-OR) are responsible for the cleaning of the GOR and CLI-OR. The employees assigned to this area receive special training and instruction. In recognition of these special duties involved, employees receive premium pay in addition to their Service Grade 8 classification.
2.	It is further recognized that the GOR and CLI-OR cannot fulfill its responsibilities to provide the necessary level of cleaning consistent with the requirements of an operating room area, which must be cleaned at a higher standard than other hospital areas, without the assurance that its employees will meet performance and attendance standards.
3.	The parties agree that the corrective action process is to be used to identify and remedy problems of performance and attendance.
4.	Employees assigned to the GOR and CLI-OR who fail to meet performance and/or attendance standards and have received written corrective action(s) may, be reassigned to other areas of the Hospital.
5.	The Union may utilize the Grievance Procedure provided in the Agreement to protest such corrective action.

Re: Lead Positions, S&M and Clerical Units

c.	respond to. and resolve customer complaints within the scope of the employee's area of responsibility;
d.	promptly notify supervisor or designate of any operational problems which can not be resolved, including any shortage of personnel scheduled to perform the assigned work within the unit/ department;
e.	■ communicate to employees specific instructions from the supervisor as required.
It is expected that lead employees perfonn any and all of the duties of the classification and related duties as assigned. The foregoing not withstanding, lead employees will not take or recommend that corrective actions be taken against bargaining unit employees.
Effective with the ratification of the Agreement, employees covered by this Agreement when working in a lead capacity as provided above shall receive a lead differential of one dollar and five cents ($ 1.05) per hour.

Re: Low Census Davs
Dear Mr. Walston:
During the recent 2003-2004 contract negotiations between your Union and the Hospitals covering the Service and Maintenance Unit & Clerical Unit employees, we agreed to renew the terms of certain letters of understanding which had been previously agreed to during prior negotiations between the Hospitals and the Union. As discussed, to minimize the adverse impact upon patient care assistants, patient service assistants and patient service coordinators (the "employees") assigned to the Hospitals' various patient centers, the Hospitals’ Scheduling Managers will take the following sequential steps:
1.	Upon a determination that any particular scheduling unit’s occupancy results in the need to call-off employees for a particular shift or shifts, Scheduling Managers responsible for scheduling will use their best efforts to coordinate with each other and ascertain whether the adversely affected employees can be utilized in another scheduling unit area. Assuming another scheduling unit can utilize the employee or employees, the employees will be reassigned for the particular shift or shifts to a patient area where the Hospitals deem they can be best utilized.
2.	Following the Hospitals' efforts to reassign employees affected by a low census day and in the event employees still need to be called off, the Scheduling Manager In each affected scheduling unit win solicit volunteers who arc willing not to work on the particular shift or shifts in question,
3.	To the extent an insufficient number of employees on a particular scheduling unit fail to volunteer not to work, the Scheduling Manager for the particular scheduling unit will notify the employee or employees in each classification (NSAs and PSCs) based upon seniority that they are either not to report for work or that they are being sent home for the affected shift or shifts, it is understood that each time an employee is to lose hours, the employee with the lowest seniority in the applicable classification is to be selected. To the extent employees are to be sent home after reporting for work, the Hospitals shall comply with the appropriate minimum reporting pay set forth in Section 19.8 of the contract.
4.	Scheduling Managers are to compile lists within their respective scheduling units as to employees who lose hours of work for low census days. To attempt to best afford employees adversely affected by low census days with the opportunity to recoup their lost hours, the Hospitals agree to use its best efforts to afford overtime hours and "sitter work" to these adversely affected employees on a first refusal basis as said opportunities become available within their respective scheduling units.
For purposes of the foregoing, the parties recognize that any particular patient unit for scheduling purposes (i.c., the "scheduling unit") may be different for NSAs and PSCs working within the Hospitals' various patient areas. Accordingly, when following the steps outlined above, Scheduling Managers will make their determinations based upon their respective schedules for each of the three classifications of employees. Finally, the Hospitals agreed that employees are not to suffer a loss of benefits when employees are called off or sent home due to a low census day.

Re: Attendance Policy Occurrences and Infectious Diseases
Dear Mr. Walston:
This correspondence serves as a letter of agreement between the Hospitals and Local 743, 1BT regarding infectious diseases as related to the Hospitals’ Attendance Policy.
In January 1999, the Hospitals revised the Attendance Policy with a final revision issued in June. 1999. The Hospitals’ Infectious Diseases Policy defines certain communicable diseases which may result in the restriction of duties and/or removal from service. If the Hospitals receives documentation from a doctor of medicine or osteopathy who is authorized to practice medicine or surgery by the State in which the doctor practices, or from the Primary Care Group (PCG), that an employee is suffering from one of the listed communicable diseases, the employee will not be charged an occurrence under the Attendance Policy for the absencc(s) necessitated by the covered illness. If the employee’s primary care physician is a member of the Primary Care Group, the employee must receive documentation from his primary care physician.
For purposes of avoiding disputes, the following illnesses, and only these illnesses are to be the illnesses covered by the exception to the Attendance Policy, which policy otherwise remains in full force and effect: Conjunctivitis, diarrhea, enterovirus infections, exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis, hepatitis A or B, herpetic whitlow, measles mumps, pertusis (whooping cough), ringworm, rubella, scabies, staphylococcal lesions on hands, streptococcal group A infection, upper respiratory infections (rsv, influenza, etc.), chicken pox, varicella zoster.

Any driver determined to be under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances as the result of an alcohol or controlled substance test, or who refuses to submit to a test when directed by a supervisor, will be suspended immediately pending a determination of employment status or until the driver submits to the test. Subsequent submission to an alcohol or controlled substance test must be timely. For the purposes of this policy, “under the influence of alcohol" means testing positivefor alcohol at a BAC of 0.04 or greater.
Testing for alcohol and controlled substance will be conducted on drivers employed or contracted by the Hospitals as follows:
•	Post-accident. When any driver is involved in an accident where there is a human fatality. A driver also will be tested after an accident if the driver receives a citation under state or local law for a moving traffic violation arising from the accident and there is either: (a) bodily injury to a person that required medical treatment away from the accident site; or (b) damage to a vehicle that resulted in it being towed. The Hospitals will comply with 49 CFR 382.303 in the event of post-accident testing.
*	Reasonable suspicion: When a determination is made by a supervisor or manager who has received appropriate training in recognizing behaviors consistent with alcohol and controlled substance use.
•	Random testing: Each driver shall submit to one unannounced, randomly scheduled alcohol and controlled substance test each calendar year. The test will be conducted during the normal on-duty time of a driver or immediately before going on duty or immediately after going off duty.
•	Retum-to-duty: A driver who has been relieved of duty as a result of a verified positive drug test result, an alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol
13
concentration of 0.04 or greater, a refusal to take a test, or adulteration or other attempted manipulation of a test, may not return to duty unless he has taken and passed a drug and/or alcohol test. The driver must have a negative drug test result and/or an alcohol test with an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 before resuming performance of safety sensitive duties.
•	Follow-up testing: Any driver who has completed an alcohol or controlled substance program as a condition of continued employment must submit to unannounced follow-up testing as directed by a substance abuse professional.
Retention and management of confidential records relating to alcohol and controlled
substance use, test results, and other related documents will be in accordance with Title 49 CFR
Section 382.401 Retention of Records, and will be maintained in a confidential manner and kept in a secure location with controlled access.
Tests will be performed by the Occupational Medicine Department of the Hospitals. All samples for testing will be split samples. In the event of a positive test, at the request of the driver, the second sample will be sent to an outside agency authorized under DOT regulations to perform testing for confirmation of the results, at the cost of the Hospitals.
Training: Each driver will receive training, as compensated time, and educational materials addressing alcohol misuse and controlled substance use during the initial 90-day probationary period and not less than annually thereafter.
Each supervisor will receive at least one hour of training for alcohol use and one hour of training on controlled substance use at least annually in accordance with 49 CFR Section
382.603.
Physical Qualifications: Each driver must pass an annual physical examination at the time of employment and each year thereafter in accordance with Title 49 CFR Section 391.41. Such examinations will be counted as hours worked and paid for by the Hospitals. Any conflicts
14
between the examination performed by the Hospitals' physician and that performed by the driver’s selected physician will be resolved in accordance with the procedure set forth in 49 CFR Section 391.47, a copy of which will be provided to the driver if he is disqualified by the Hospitals’ physician.
Initial, annual, and requested exams as a result of a potentially disqualifying condition will be performed by the Occupational Medicine Department of the Hospitals.
Each driver will keep a copy of the physical qualification certificate or a photocopy on his or her person at all times when on duty.
