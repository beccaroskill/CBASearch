FOREWORD
This Contract Agreement contains terms and conditions of employment which have been developed by the Minnesota Nurses Association, representing the professional nurses, and by North Memorial Health Care. It will answer many of your questions concerning your conditions of employment.
You will note that the following Agreement contains provisions for leave of absence, cost reimbursement, and increased salary recognition for education in nursing-related subjects beyond the basic nursing programs. These incentives are intended to encourage you to continue your professional interest and education in nursing. Your attention is directed to the section relating to Association Security. This generally provides that members of the Minnesota Nurses Association will retain their membership in MNA, and that nurses employed on or after July 22,1974, will either join and maintain membership in the Minnesota Nurses Association or pay a service fee as a condition of employment. A system for voluntary payroll deduction of such dues and fees is also provided.
This Contract also provides for several Joint Committees between the Minnesota Nurses Association and the Hospital. These Committees are to consider nursing care delivery, staffing and scheduling, and health and safety. In addition, Action Plans agreed upon during the negotiations reflect a joint commitment to address other issues of mutual concern. It is hoped these activities will make possible a broad basis of participation by the staff nurses and assistant head nurses.
The Twin City Hospitals / Minnesota Nurses Association Pension Plan is negotiated between the Minnesota Nurses Association and the participating Hospitals. The Pension Plan is funded by the Hospitals without nurse contributions. The instruments for the Pension are kept for your inspection at each Hospital and at the Minnesota Nurses Association office. Also, a descriptive brochure is available for every nurse.
North Memorial Health Care and the Minnesota Nurses Association have a common goal of offering continuously better hospital and nursing care to the public. As a professional nurse, we know you will cooperate in achieving this goal. If we can be of help to you, feel free to ask our assistance.

Exceptions to the general pattern of scheduling may be made by agreement between the Employer and the nurse concerned or in cases of emergency or unavoidable situations where the application of the general patterns would have the effect of depriving patients of needed nursing service.
23
16.	PATIENT FLOW CONTROL METHOD:
A.	Evaluation of Resources:
The charge nurse, in collaboration with unit staff, will evaluate the following factors to assess and determine adequacy of resources to meet patient care needs:
1.	Staffing grids and resources	available
2.	Patient acuity
3.	Experience level of RN staff
4.	Skill mix
5.	Unit activity level (admissions, discharges, transfers)
B.	Collaborative Assessment of Resource Reallocation:
If resources are inadequate, the charge nurse will notify the Manager i Administrative Designee as soon as the potential need to close the unit Is known; in any case, prior to the time an admission presents. The Charge Nurse and Manager / Administrative Designee will consider the following:
1.	Ability to redistribute current assignments
2.	Ability to facilitate admissions, discharges, and transfers on the affected unit
3.	Consultation with charge nurses in the other units in their clinical cluster (and other clinical clusters as appropriate)
4.	Consultation with the ED charge nurse

6.	Availability of additional resources (including calling capacity bonus)
C.	Temporary Unit Closure I Reopening:
If the issue cannot be resolved between the charge nurse and Manager I Administrative designee and resources cannot be reallocated, then the unit will be closed to admissions for a designated time period. Specific criteria for opening the unit will be agreed on between the charge nurse and the Manager / Administrative designee. If no agreement can be reached, the administrator on-call will be consulted to hear both sides and attempt to negotiate an agreement.
D.	Required Admissions:
' ►
However, it is recognized that certain situations such as community emergencies, EMTALA, or other legally-required admissions and situations that would jeopardize the safety of the patient may require a unit to admit a patient. In those situations, the charge nurse will continue to work with key decision makers to explore alternative solutions.
24
E.	Implementation:
This provision will be instituted August 15,2004. Prior to that date, the JSC will collaborate with education to develop and present a competency to be given for all charge nurses, Administrative Managers, and Administrative Designees.
F.	Unit Closure Review:
Each unit closing will be debriefed jointly by staff involved, unit leadership, and the MNA using a root cause analysis method to look at systems. The JSC will review trends and develop methods to address them.
17.	TEMPORARY NURSES:
The parties agree that full- and part-time registered nursing staff employed by the Employer are most likely to provide the desirable level of nursing care, to provide care io patients at an economical cost, and to provide the necessary balance in assignment of shifts. It is understood that Employer-employed full- and part-time float nurses are also Hospital nursing staff. The Employer's basic policy shall be to use its registered nursing staff to the exclusion of temporary registered nurses from outside agencies except in unavoidable situations where no other means of providing necessary staffing are available.
Such temporary nurses shall be used only as a supplement to and not in lieu of Hospital registered nursing staff. Prior to utilizing a temporary nurse, the Employer shall take all steps available to cover a shift or partial shift with its own nursing staff. Before making any use of a temporary nurse, the Employer shall offer each shift or partial shift to the members of its own registered nursing staff who are qualified to perform the work, These offerings shall be made as soon as any schedule opening is discovered by the Employer and shall be immediately communicated to the qualified Hospital nursing staff by written notice posted on the nursing service central bulletin board and on appropriate station bulletin boards. If the discovery is first made by the Employer less than twenty-four (24) hours before the opening, the Employer shall communicate such offering by telephone calls to the qualified Hospital nursing staff.
No Hospital staff registered nurse will be denied available work because such work would incur overtime premium. A tempera rymurse shall be required to have education, prior experience, and adequate advance orientation to the clinical service and station unit in the facility to which assigned to satisfactorily perform as a staff nurse on that station unit.
A temporary nurse shall not be assigned leadership or charge nurse responsibilities but shall be expected to otherwise perform substantially the same functions as Hospital registered nursing staff members.
25
The Employer shall ensure that there will not be increased assignment of any of its nursing staff to night, evening, holiday, or weekend duty as a result of the use of temporary nurse personnel.
The Employer shall maintain all necessary steps to reduce and minimize reliance on temporary registered nurses from outside agencies. The Employer, upon request of the Association, will furnish information with respect to the number of day, evening, night, holiday, and weekend shifts worked by temporary nurses.
If the Employer, its parent corporation, or affiliated entity establishes or maintains a common float pool with another Contract Hospital or Hospitals to provide registered nurses to work in bargaining unit positions at any of said facilities, such nurses shall be covered in all respects by the terms and provisions of this Contract Agreement. Seniority and the bargaining unit to which such nurses will be attached will be agreed upon by the parties.
18.	ROTATION AND SHIFT OF CHOICE (20.800 HOURS):
Nurses with ten (10) or more years of seniority will be afforded the opportunity to work a permanent shift assignment of the nurse's choice subject to the need to provide proper staffing on all shifts. In order to provide greater opportunities for nurses to select a shift of choice, the Employer will create more straight shifts. The parties recognize that complete implementation of this provision will need to be phased in and that the period of implementation will be governed by the following:
A,	Schedule Reviews:
The Employer will review the current schedules on each unit in order to determine if additional straight shifts may be offered. It is recognized that to the extent that permanent day shifts are created on a unit, the balance of the staff on such units may be required to work additional evening and night shifts occasioned by the establishment of the permanent day shifts. Provided that any change in schedules to create additional straight day shift positions will not require nurses with less than ten (10) years of service to rotate to more than a total of fifty percent (50%) evenings or nights.
B.	Work Agreements:
No confirmed work agreement as provided in the work agreement section specifying the number of hours per payroll period and shift rotation of a currently employed nurse will be involuntarily changed.
C.	Order of Eligibility:
Eligible nurses*in seniority order on the unit will be offered their shift assignment of choice.	•
26
D.	Unit Plans for Development of Positions:
Each unit will develop and provide a specific plan for development of shift of choice nurse positions to the Staffing Advisory Committee. The Staffing Advisory Committee of each Hospital will monitor the progress and implementation of this provision in their Hospital. The Joint Committee on Interpretation will meet at least six (6) months and twelve (12) months following conclusion of this Agreement to review questions of Contract application relating to implementation of this provision and will meet thereafter as needed.
E.	Nurse Election of Shift Assignment:
The nurse may elect an assignment of days, evenings, nights, or a rotating assignment including days and either evenings or nights. Rotating shift positions will be decreased but not eliminated.
F.	Election Option:
A nurse may use this election to fill an available position having a flexible work schedule or an alternate weekend schedule but may not use the election to require the creation of new flexible work schedule or alternate weekend schedule positions.
G.	Permanent Shift Assignments:
If a permanent shift assignment becomes available because of changes in the schedules of nurses currently employed on a unit which has no open unfilled positions, the available permanent shift assignment will be first offered to nurses on that unit. Otherwise, all openings, including those offering permanent shift assignments, will be offered and filled in accordance with the sections related to hours and schedules and posting of hours.
H.	7:00 A.M. Start Times:
Nurses with a current work agreement specifying a 7:00 a.m. starting time shall not have such shift time changed without the consent of the nurse.
I.	Rotating Shift of Choice:
A nurse electing a rotating shift of choice shall not be scheduled for more than three (3) starting shift times per four- (4) week period. A nurse electing a straight shift of choice shall not be scheduled for more than two (2) starting shift times per four- (4) week period. The foregoing provisions shall be modified to the extent necessary if the number of ten-year nurses on a unit would mean an inability to cover the required shifts.

Provided, however, that,in no event shall more than six (6) weeks' notice of , revocation be required.
B.	Basic Work Period:
The basic work period shall be forty (40) hours per week. A nurse shall be paid time and one-half (1%) for work in excess of forty (40) hours per week rather than the overtime provisions set forth in the section related to hours and scheduling. Further, even though the total hours worked during a week may not exceed forty (40), a nurse working in excess of her or his scheduled workday shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half (1%) for all excess time so worked, except that hours In excess of twelve (12) consecutive hours in a workday shall be paid at the rate of double time.

In no event will the occurrence of a holiday, paid sick leave, or vacation have the effect of diminishing the number of-hours normally paid to a nurse in a payroll period.
28
D.	Less Than Eight-Hour Schedules:
The Employer and the individual nurse may agree upon a pattern of work schedule of less than eight (8) hours per day. Nurses who agree to this pattern of shifts of eight (8) hours or less per day shall remain on the 8/80 standard for purposes of overtime. This would mean eligibility for overtime would be after eight hours per day/80 hours per pay period.
The Employer or individual Registered Nurse may agree to less than eight (8) hours per day. Registered Nurses or the Employer will be eligible to revoke this pattern of scheduling with six (6) weeks' notice. If the Registered Nurse's previous FTE is greater or less than the FTE agreed upon with the less than eight- (8) hour pattern, the Registered Nurse will need to wait for a posted position or additional posted FTEs to change their number of hours. The Registered Nurse will be guaranteed a return to an eight- (8) hour shift.
Registered Nurses who agree to work a combination of less than eight (8) hours and greater than eight (8) hours per day shall continue on the forty (40) hour standard for purposes of overtime.

H.	Non-Discrimination:
There shall be no discrimination by the Employer against any nurse because she or he declines to volunteer for flexible work schedules or because she or he revokes a prior election in the manner herein provided. In establishing a flexible
29
schedule, the Employer will avoid any disruptive impact or alterations in scheduling of hours, shifts, holidays, vacation, or weekends for a nurse who is not on a flexible schedule, it being the intention of this section that flexible schedules are to be a supplement and not a replacement for the basic 80 and B patterns.
. I. 40-Hour Workweek:
A nurse who is hired to work seventy-two (72) hours a pay period and is scheduled twelve- (12) hour shifts will be eligible to increase through posted positions to full time on their unit. A nurse would have the opportunity to fill posted positions by working a combination of twelve- (12) hour and four- (4) hour shifts. The nurse would remain on a forty- (40) hour workweek.
20.	ALTERNATIVE WEEKEND SCHEDULES / BAYLOR:
The Employer may establish flexible scheduling plans providing work schedules of two twelve- (12) hour or three eight- (8) hour shifts per weekend.

A nurse will receive one (1) hour of credit toward benefits for each additional hour the nurse agrees to work.
30
E.	Voluntary Low-Need Davs:
A nurse on an alternative weekend schedule shall be considered to be regularly scheduled for seventy-two (72) compensated hours per payroll period.

N,	Shift Trades:
A nurse participating in this alternative weekend program may, with Employer approval, trade hours with a nurse who is not on an alternative weekend schedule. Each nurse involved in the trade will be paid at that nurse's regular rate of pay, excluding the alternative weekend schedule premium and in accordance with that nurse's standard for overtime eligibility. A nurse on an alternative weekend schedule who trades hours with another nurse who is scheduled to work a twelve- (12) or an eight- (8) hour shift between 7:00 a.m. Friday and 7:00 a.m. Monday shall continue to receive pay as set forth in this section.
Any nurse who agrees to work a scheduled shift for a nurse on an alternative weekend schedule shall be paid at the rate of pay the nurse would otherwise receive for weekend work.
32
-21. FLOATING:
A.	Twenty-Five Year Nurse:
Any nurse with twenty-five (25) consecutive calendar years of service will not be required to float.

If the contract procedures are not followed, the position will be reposted for an additional seven (7) days prior to permanently filling the position.
in filling any such bargaining unit position, the primary consideration shall be whether the applicant meets the required qualifications to perform the duties of the open position. The transfer of a nurse to the position for which the nurse has been accepted may be postponed for a period not to exceed three (3) months if it is necessary to provide the proper skill level on the unit from which the nurse will be transferring. Subject to the foregoing, nurses meeting the required
33
qualifications shall be given preference over nurses not currently employed by the Hospital, and as between nurses employed by the Hospital, preference shall be given to the most senior nurse within the bargaining unit.
(NOTE: See Article 5, “Orientation to North Memorial Health Care,” Section B3, RNs In Performance Improvement Process, for additional information on transfers.)

Said notice will include the Employer's initial determination as to whether such position will be included in the bargaining unit.
Upon request of either party, the Employer and Association representatives will meet to discuss and consider the bargaining unit status of the position in question. Considerations will include, but not be limited to, the relationship of the position to existing bargaining and non-bargaining unit positions and the workability of including the position in the bargaining unit including, but not limited to, compensation, work schedules, and seniority. The Employer and the Association may make such mutual agreements as they deem appropriate which involve terms and conditions of employment related to identified barriers. In arriving at any agreement which would constitute an exception to the then existing seniority provisions of the Contract Agreement, the Minnesota Nurses Association shall establish a process for consultation with the Association leadership of the local facility nurses, and any recommendation by the Minnesota Nurses Association after such consultation will be given due consideration by the Employer in attempting to arrive at an agreement on the seniority matters.
The Employer agrees to provide the Association with any additional relevant available information,
34
If the parties are unable to agree on including or not including the new position in the Contract, either party may request the assistance of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) in any attempt to resolve the issue. If no agreement is reached as a result of the assistance of FMCS, the unit clarification procedure of the National Labor Relations Board may be used by either party.
C,	Notice of New Program or Business Venture:
The Employer, or its parent or affiliate, shall give the Association prompt written notice of any new program or business venture as soon as a decision to initiate the program or venture is made. Such notice shall describe the anticipated registered nurse positions in the new program or venture and the Employer’s initial determination as to whether such positions will be included in the bargaining unit.
The Employer, its parent or affiliate, will meet upon request with the Association to explore questions of Association representation. The procedures set forth in the foregoing subsection (B) of this section will be used to process such questions.
D.	Inclusion of Other Nurses in Bargaining Unit:
The Employer will meet with the Association upon request to determine the interest associated with including certain groups of nurses in the bargaining unit. If mutual interests exist, the parties will meet at the local level to apply the process described in the foregoing subsection (B) of this section.
24.	ON-CALL DUTY:
The units that have required on-call are the Operating Room, Radiology, Air Care, Cath Lab, Endoscopy, PACU, and Home Care and Hospice (Home Health RNs who were hired before on-call was mandatory will not be required to work on-call.) If required on-call duty is not part of a nurse's confirmed work agreement, on-call shall not be newly assigned to any nurse on a unit where required on-call assignments have not been an established practice.
Assignment of a nurse required to work on-call duty beyond her or his scheduled shift shall not be used as a substitute for scheduled on-duty staff when there is a demonstrated pattern of a consistent and continuing need for nursing care. A trigger shall be developed indicating when evaluations by the JSC should take place to determine if the shift should be converted to a regularly scheduled shift.
An RN will not be required to be on-call on a weekend off or regular day off unless they choose to accept call. The preceding sentence shall not prevent weekend call on units which are normally not open on weekends.

I
I
Years of Service	Vacation	Accrual Rate
After completing 1 year	2 calendar weeks	.0385 vacation hours per compensated hour
2 through 4 years	3 calendar weeks	.0577 vacation hours per compensated hour
5 through 11 years	4 calendar weeks	.0769 vacation hours per compensated hour
12 through 13 years	4 calendar weeks + 1 day	.0808 vacation hours per compensated hour
14 years	4 calendar weeks + 2 days	.0847 vacation hours per compensated hour
15 through 17 years	4 calendar weeks + 3 days	.0886 vacation hours per compensated hour
18 through 19 years	4 calendar weeks + 4 days	.0924 vacation hours per compensated hour
20 years and over	5 calendar weeks	.0964 vacation hours per compensated hour
Assistant head nurses/unit shift coordinators shall accrue vacation according to the above schedule, except after four (4) calendar years of service, they shall accrue four calendar weeks of vacation. After five (5) calendar years of service, they will accrue vacation per the above schedule.
While on vacation, the amount of salary to be paid to the part-time nurse may be based upon the average number of compensated hours per two- (2) week payroll period during the preceding six (6) months.
Vacation shall be accrued from the nurse's most recent date of employment by the Hospital. A nurse may utilize earned vacation after completion of six (6) continuous months of employment. Thereafter, vacation may be utilized as it is accrued in accordance with vacation scheduling provisions in this Contract.
Vacation shall be accrued based on compensated hours as such hours are defined in this contract. The accrual rate for full-time and regularly scheduled part-time nurses shall be determined by dividing the annual number of hours of vacation to which a nurse would be entitled by 2080 hours.
B.	Terminal Vacation Pay:
Nurses who have completed six (6) months or longer of continuous service in the Hospital, including nurse’s of leave of absence otherwise qualifying, will receive terminal vacation pay prorated from the above schedule, providing that they give the Employer one (1) months’ written notice in case of voluntary termination of employment.
46
C.	Vacation Scheduling:
The primary factor governing the scheduling of earned vacation shall be availability of RN staff to provide patient care on each nursing unit. If two or more nurses on a station unit request concurrent vacation times and staffing for patient care does not allow granting of all requests and such conflict is not resolved on a mutually agreeable basis between the nurses involved, the vacation shall be given to the nurse making the earlier request for such vacation. In the case of simultaneous requests, the nurse on a station unit having greater length of employment in the Hospital as defined in the section related to low-need days and layoff shall be given preference. Where a Hospital utilizes an annual defined vacation sign up period, all requests submitted during such period shall be considered as simultaneous requests. Consistent with the foregoing, the Employer may maintain and reasonably enforce a non-discriminatory policy specifying the way in which requests for the same or overlapping periods of vacation time shall be given consideration.
The number of RN vacations to be based on this formula:
0,5 FTE total caregiver vacation can be granted for every seven (7) caregiver FTEs regularly scheduled.
1.	Determine number of caregiver FTEs
2.	Divide by 14
3.	To determine RN slots, multiply by the percentage of RN staff
Example:
1.	A unit has 40 caregiver FTEs
2.	40/14 = 2.86 FTEs
3.	2.86 x .7 = 2 RN FTE vacations can be granted
This formula would need to be evaluated for applicability to each fixed staff unit.
Registered Nurses have the ability to use one weekend day of vacation for every week of earned vacation.
RNs with twenty (20) calendar years of service at .6 or above and scheduled for eight- (8) hour shifts and every other weekend will be granted one (1) additional weekend of vacation. The weekend cannot be used May 15 - September 15.
No other qualifications on the scheduling of vacations shall be applied except as set out in this Agreement or as required by unavoidable situations in which granting of requested vacation time would have the effect of depriving patients of needed nursing service.
Earned vacation shall normally be taken within a 12-month period following the anniversary date when such vacation was earned. Provided, however, that earned vacation shall be carried over to a subsequent year if a nurse is unable
47
to take accrued vacation within the foregoing time period because of the inability of the Employer to grant such vacation time due to staffing needs,
31.	SICK LEAVE:

Nurses will be entitled to sick leave with pay for personal illness not to exceed the accumulated rate of nine hundred sixty (960) hours. Sick leave will be earned and accumulated at the rate of eight (8) hours for every 173.3 hours the nurse is continuously employed. So long as a nurse has nine hundred sixty (960) hours of accumulated and unused sick leave to her or his credit, she or he will earn and accumulate no further sick leave. If and when any of the accumulated sick leave is used, then the nurse will accumulate sick leave at the rate herein specified until she or he again has reached an accumulation credit of nine hundred sixty (960) hours of accumulated and unused sick leave.

C.	Compensation for Unused Sick Leave:	,
1.	The Employer shall pay a yearly bonus of five hundred dollars
($500) to any regularly scheduled nurse who has not used sick leave in the past year.
2.	An RN scheduled .9 to 1.0 FTE who uses twenty-four (24) hours or less of sick leave in a contract year (June 1 - May 31} will receive a three hundred dollar ($300.00) bonus on June 1.

f.	If the request is denied related to department staffing needs, alternate dates will be discussed and granted.
g.	If the Registered Nurse is eligible for the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), see policy and procedure.
E.	Verification of Illness:
The Hospital may request reasonable evidence of illness. General requirements of a physician's certificate for proof of sickness shall not be made, but individual nurses may be required to furnish such certificates, provided that such nurse is given advance notice that the certificate is required. A nurse shall not be required to explain an illness at the time sick call in is made. Such explanation may be required at a later time based on a review of a pattern of sick leave use. Sick leave will not be granted for absences from work on the day immediately preceding or following a holiday, weekend, or day(s) off when the nurse is not scheduled to work unless reasonable evidence of such illness is presented to the Hospital. No nurse shall be penalized for legitimate use of sick leave or be subject to discipline based solely on the number of sick leave days used. The preceding sentence shall not prevent the use of counseling relating to sick leave.
F.	Sick Leave When Eligible for Long-Term Disability:
Sick leave shall be paid up to the accumulated amount or until the nurse is eligible to receive long-term disability benefits pursuant to this Agreement.

If representation is rejected, the Hospital will, nonetheless, review options for accommodation with the Minnesota Nurses Association in order to facilitate mutual problem solving and consistency prior to a decision in all situations.
2.	The Association will be provided with all relevant information requested related to the accommodation of the Registered Nurse, Medical information will be released subject to written authorization of the nurse. Consistent with their status as employer and bargaining representative, respectively, the Hospital and the Minnesota Nurses Association will respect any confidential information being considered or disclosed.
3.	Nurses will be accommodated on an individual basis, with a focus on the nurse’s ability, rather than disability.
4.	In evaluating the ability to accommodate a disability and/or restriction(s), the Hospital will not rule out increasing the number of staff scheduled on a unit as a method of achieving accommodation.
5.	As part of these discussions and upon request of the Hospital, the Minnesota Nurses Association will waive the posting requirements of Article 14, "Scheduling,” and Article 22, “Posting and Filling of Positions,” relative to selected new or existing open positions which would allow the Hospital to accommodate a nurse who is currently a member of the bargaining unit in a bargaining unit position.
6.	A nurse who has not been, or in the future may not be, accommodated in a bargaining unit position, retains bargaining unit seniority for all purposes for as long as the nurse is accommodated outside the bargaining unit. The nurse shall be given preference in returning to any new or existing open bargaining unit position within four (4) years where the nurse is qualified and can be accommodated.
51
I
7.	The parties agree to use the processes set forth in Article 23, "Promotions, Transfers, and New Positions,” relating to the inclusion of new or existing positions into the bargaining unit for any and all new or existing positions where nurses currently or previously in the bargaining unit have been transferred due to accommodations necessitated by illness or injury.
8.	The Hospital and the Association will jointly develop and periodically present education regarding the A.D.A.
9.	Refer to Article 46, “Nursing Health and Safety Committee,” related to the modified duty work list.

This includes any portion of the ninety (90) days when a nurse on workers’ compensation is working in an alternate position having fewer hours than the nurse’s previous position.
A nurse on a personal illness, injury, or disability leave and receiving workers’ compensation may agree to accept a temporary alternate position different from the nurse's previous position. Agreement to such alternate position shall not constitute a forfeiture of the nurse's right to return to her or his previous position or classification as provided in the section related to leave of absence.
Except as provided in the section related to leave of absence (personal illness), all hours worked by a nurse covered by this Contract in a temporary alternate
52
employment position not otherwise covered by this Contract shall, nevertheless, be considered compensated hours toward accrual of seniority as provided in the section related to low-need days and layoff. Such hours shall also be credited toward eligibility for and accrual of benefits provided by this Contract. Benefits accrued and provided will be based on the compensated hours of the nurse when working in the alternate employment position.

53
■ Others:	.
For individuals who are important to the Registered Nurse (other than those listed above), the Manager will attempt to grant time off and the RN will use vacation pay or Personal Holiday Pay for compensation. The Registered Nurse may be asked to help find a replacement if time and circumstances permit.

4.	Vacation and length of service increments will continue to accrue for the first ninety (90) unpaid calendar days of this maternity/paternity leave.
If a nurse desires to return to the hospital at a date different than the date of return specified at the beginning of the leave, she or he shall notify the Employer two (2) weeks in advance of the earlier of the specified return date or the desired return date. A nurse who desires to return to a different position at the conclusion of the leave must make such request at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the expiration of the leave.
This subparagraph (D) shall be fully applicable in instances of adoption except for the pay out of accumulated sick leave for the nurse. Sick leave is
54
paid out in relationship to the disability of the delivery. The nurse may use accumulated sick leave if the child is ill.
E.	Jury Duty and Subpoenaed Witnesses:

The nurse will be expected to report to jury duty instead of reporting to work while on call for jury duty unless mutually agreed to by the nurse and Nurse Manager. If the nurse is on jury duty Monday through Friday, the nurse will be required to work the weekend shift twenty-four (24} hours prior to the start of jury duty or the scheduled weekend shift immediately after completion of jury duty on Friday. If the nurse's regularly scheduled weekend to work occurs during jury duty, the nurse will be relieved from work on that weekend . Regularly scheduled work hours lost because of jury duty or serving as a witness will be considered as hours worked except for purposes of computing overtime.
Regularly scheduled work hours necessarily lost because of jury service or serving as a witness will be considered as hours worked except for purposes of computing overtime.
F.	Voluntary Leaves Before Layoff:
Before resorting to any layoff procedure, the Employer will offer the nurses an opportunity to voluntarily request leaves of absence without pay of not more than ninety (90) calendar days. During such leave of absence, vacation and length of service rights shall continue to accrue. The Employer will not permanently fill the nurse's position during the period of leave of absence.
G.	Military Leave of Absence:
A nurse who is a member of the military reserve or National Guard shall be granted leaves of absence without pay to enable the nurse to fulfill obligations for one weekend per month plus two weeks per calendar year for temporary military duty. The nurse may be offered the opportunity to, but may not be required to, work extra unscheduled weekend shifts in place of normally scheduled weekend shifts missed because of military duty. A nurse electing to do so will be entitled to the weekend bonus.
In addition, a nurse who serves on active duty and who returns to work within ninety (90) days after discharge from military service will be returned to her or his previous position or to the position of like classification and pay to which the nurse would have been entitled but for the absence due to military duty.
55
The nurse will be credited with hours towards benefits, including seniority and pension, and length of service salary increments for military duty in accordance with the Uniformed Services Employment and ReEmployment Rights Act (USERRA). The nurse will be credited with hours towards benefits, including seniority and pension, and length of service salary increments for the period of military duty (including the ninety (90) days postdischarge) based on the authorized number of hours per payroll period or the average number of hours worked per payroll period during the thirteen (13) payroll periods preceding the active duty, whichever is greater. Earnings lost will be credited toward W-2 earnings for pension purposes in accordance with the terms of the Pension Plan.
An RN who is on a military leave of absence will be sent a letter from the Benefits Department outlining insurance and other benefits available while on active duty and informing the nurse of his/her return rights to North Memorial once the military leave has ended.
H.	Other Leaves of Absence:
Leaves of absence for reasons other than above will be granted to nurses at the discretion of the Employer and on an individual basis. Length of service benefits will continue to accrue for leaves of absence of fourteen (14) calendar days or less. Of leaves of absence of more than fourteen (14) calendar days, length of service benefits will not continue to accrue, but will remain the same as at the time of beginning the leave. The Employer may permanently fill the nurse's position after the first fourteen (14) calendar days of leave. Upon returning from leave, the nurse will be given the first opportunity to return to a position for which she or he is qualified and will be given the first opportunity to return to her or his former position if and when the position is open.
I.	Association Activities:
Leaves of absence without pay of reasonable duration shall be provided nurses for the purpose of attending meetings, conferences, and conventions of the Association on a local, district, state, or national level. The number of nurses attending such functions shall not exceed a reasonable number at any one time and the granting of such leaves shall be predicated on the Employer's staffing requirements.
In addition, nurses elected to serve as a regular or alternate member of the nurses' Negotiating Committee for the Employment or Pension Contract shall be given credit toward eligibility for and accumulation of benefits for all hours spent serving in this capacity.
34.	LOW-NEED DAYS AND LAYOFF:
Reduction of registered nurse staff may be made only in the event of a diminished number of needed nursing care hours. Unanticipated declines in patient needs may result in the need to temporarily reduce hours, but it is recognized by the parties that
56
the basic policy shall be to use the layoff procedures of this Contract to accomplish staff reductions when a reduction in patient needs is reasonably expected to occur over a continuing period of time. Non-bargaining unit personnel shall not be utilized to replace any bargaining unit nurse whose hours are so reduced.
A.	Definitions:
As used in this section, the following terms shall be defined as follows:
1.	"Clinical group" means a unit or group of units which require similar nursing skills.
2.	"Qualified" means the ability to independently provide safe, direct patient care for the standard case load on the unit within a reasonable period of orientation not to exceed four (4) weeks, but said term does not require proficiency in all technical skills or the performance of leadership roles.
3.	"Seniority" means the total compensated hours accrued by a nurse since her or his most recent date of employment into the bargaining unit at the Employer. Compensated hours, as qualified in this paragraph, shall include all hours for which a nurse is paid. Each overtime hour worked shall be counted as one (1) compensated hour. Off-premises on-call shall be counted at the conclusion of each W-2 year at the rate of one-half (7?) of the on-call hours paid. In addition, compensated hours shall include hours which Article 33, "Leave of Absence,” subparagraphs (A), (D), (t), (G), and (I) provide are hours worked or hours for which length of service increments accrue.
The above notwithstanding, seniority for a nurse who transfers to a non-supervisory and non~managerial nursing position that is not covered by the Contract Agreement and is in the same hospital in which the nurse is employed in a bargaining unit position shall accrue no further seniority. The nurse's accrued seniority shall be maintained on the nurse's record and shall be restored to the nurse if she or he transfers back to a bargaining unit position within one (1) year. The nurse may not exercise frozen seniority for any purpose under this Contract while in the nonbargaining unit position. If the nurse does not return to a bargaining unit position within one (1) year from the date of the transfer out of the bargaining unit, all bargaining unit seniority is lost.
A revised and up-to-date listing of the seniority for each nurse in the bargaining unit will be posted by the Employer each six (6) months and provided to the Minnesota Nurses Association.
B.	Voluntary Low-Need Davs and Leave:
Before resorting to Part (D) of this Section or any layoff procedure, the Employer will offer the full-time and part-time nurses an opportunity to voluntarily request a low-need leave of absence without pay for up to ninety
57
(90)	calendar days. The Employer will not permanently fill the nurse’s position. In addition, the Employer may, on a day-to-day basis, offer individual low-need days to full-time and part-time nurses. A nurse taking low-need days pursuant to Parts (B) and (D) of this Section shall be given credit toward all benefits provided by this Contract and the Pension Plan for the hours lost.
C.	Floating in Lieu of Mandatory Low-Need Davs:
If additional low-need reductions are needed, nurses will be given the opportunity to float to available assignments in other units for which they are oriented or otherwise qualified.
D.	Mandatory Low-Need Davs:
If additional reductions are indicated, low-need days shall be taken by the least senior regularly scheduled part-time nurse scheduled for the particular unit and shift where the reduction is necessary.
No regularly scheduled part-time nurse shall be required by the Employer to take more than twenty-four (24) hours per Contract year. If the least senior part-time nurse on a particular unit and shift has been assigned twenty-four (24) hours of low-need, the next least senior part-time nurse scheduled for the particular unit and shift may be assigned the low-need day. In any case, the total of low-need days of this provision shall not exceed twenty-four (24) hours per Contract year for any regularly scheduled part-time nurse.
A part-time nurse regularly scheduled for sixty-four (64) compensated hours or more per pay period shall be considered as a full-time nurse for purposes of this Section and shall not be assigned low-need days. A nurse to be assigned a low-need day pursuant to this Part (D) shall be given a minimum of four (4) hours advance notice before the beginning of the shift.
Casual part-time or temporary nurses shall not be assigned to work on units for which the nurse receiving low-need days is oriented or otherwise qualified. Part-time nurses having hours reduced shall be given first opportunity for subsequent additional work hours that may become available to replace work I	hours lost.
I
I	E. Layoff:
i
।	In the event that it is necessary to lay off nurses due to lack of work, the least
,	senior nurse(s) in the employ of the Employer shall be laid off first The layoff
shall continue in order of least seniority toward most seniority until the needed reduction in nursing care hours has been accomplished. Any reduction in the number of scheduled hours shall be considered a layoff except as provided in paragraphs above. It is specifically agreed that less senior nurses are to be completely laid off before more senior nurses are to be affected by a layoff except as expressly provided as follows:
58
1.	It is agreed that the operation of this Section shall not have the effect of depriving patients of needed nursing service. A nurse may be retained out of seniority, however, only if nurses with greater seniority do not have the ability to become qualified.
2.	A reduction of hours rather than a complete layoff may be used if necessary to provide appropriate coverage for weekends or for operating rooms, visits, or procedures. Reductions shall be made by reducing the hours of the least senior nurse remaining on the unit to thirty-two (32) hours per pay period and proceeding in that manner in reverse order of seniority until the necessary reduction has been achieved. Reductions in reverse order of seniority to less than thirty-two (32) hours may be made at the discretion of the Employer.
Before effecting a reduction of nursing care hours on any unit, all nurses shall be offered voluntary leaves of absence as provided in the section related to voluntary leaves before layoff of this Agreement. In effecting a reduction of nursing care hours on one or more units, the Employer shall use a system whereby all affected nurses in order of greater seniority shall be offered all of the following choices:
a.	Vacant positions for which they are qualified.
b.	Qualified nurses will be offered an opportunity in order of
seniority to replace less senior nurses within the clinical group.
c.	Qualified nurses will be offered an opportunity in order of seniority to replace less senior nurses in other clinical groups.
d.	Nurses may accept complete layoff and retain full rights to recall.
A nurse displaced by a more senior nurse under b. and c. above would then, in seniority order, be offered option a. through d.
In exercising seniority rights under steps a., b., and c., the nurse will be offered a position for which qualified according to the step selected, such position to be determined on the basis of the nurse's position preference, greater seniority, and the need to minimize multiple displacement of nurses.
Concurrently with the offering of steps a. through d., nurses shall be offered the option of accepting reduced hours in their unit. A nurse accepting such reduction shall be considered on layoff and retain all recall rights. Before or at the time a nurse is offered vacancies or replacement opportunities, the nurse will be provided a description of available positions which includes the unit assignment, shifts, and number of scheduled hours.
59
As long as any nurse remains on layoff, the Employer shall not newly employ nurses into the bargaining unit and shall not transfer or temporarily assign nonbargaining unit nurses into the bargaining unit until all nurses holding recall rights who are qualified shall have been recalled. After a full or partial recall of all qualified nurses on complete layoff who retain recall rights, this provision shall not prevent the new hire of nurses needed to provide appropriate coverage for weekends or for operating rooms, visits, or procedures. Such newly-hired nurse shall be limited to not more than thirty-two (32) scheduled hours per pay period as long as any more senior nurses on the unit have not been fully restored to her or his number of scheduled hours before layoff.
Scheduled hours on a unit shall not be increased for non-laid off nurses without offering such hours to nurses from that unit who are on partial layoff. If a nurse from a unit has been completely laid off, scheduled hours of thirty-two (32) or more per two-week pay period shall not be added for non-laid off nurses until nurses on complete layoff have been recalled.
Nurses on layoff who are presently qualified shall be given first opportunity to work intermittent shifts that are available before such shifts are offered to casual part-time or non-bargaining unit nurses. To the greatest extent feasible, such shifts shall be offered to nurses on layoff in order of seniority up to but not exceeding the number of scheduled hours per pay period before layoff.
Intermittent shifts reasonably expected to occur over a continuing period of time shall not be used in lieu of recall of nurses who retain recall rights. An offer for intermittent shifts shall not be considered a recall.
When floating is needed, the Employer will endeavor to take into consideration a nurse's interest in becoming qualified in another unit of the Hospital.
As part of on-going communication between the Association and the Employer, the Employer will notify the Association as soon as it determines that a layoff may occur. The parties will meet to review relevant data and to jointly develop the procedures for applying this section to the specific situation.
A nurse and the Association will be given two (2) weeks’ written notice in advance of any layoff.
Involuntary transfers of nurses shall not be used to circumvent the layoff provisions of this section.
A nurse who is laid off shall have the right at the time of layoff to receive appropriate prorated vacation with pay upon written request to the Employer therefore.
A nurse on layoff status who has been benefit eligible and has worked an average of .4 FTE for the first four pay periods following layoff shall continue on a benefit eligible status so long as she or he continues to work an average of at least .4 FTE per four pay periods either through intermittent shifts or because of recall. In the event that the nurse refuses a recall to a regularly scheduled
60
benefit-eligible position for which she or he is qualified, the nurse shall lose the benefit-eligible status. Exceptions to the loss of benefit-eligible status may be made in cases of extenuating circumstances.
In the event of a pending layoff or major restructuring, in addition to other contractual options, each senior nurse in affected or related clinical areas will be given the option of early retirement with the employer portion of health insurance (single coverage) continued until attainment of age 65. For purposes of this paragraph, senior nurses are defined as nurses (.7 or above FTE) at age 58 or above who have attained the monthly salary increment for twenty (20) years employment.
F. Recall:
Notice of recall shall be in writing to a nurse with simultaneous copy mailed to the Minnesota Nurses Association. Recalls shall be in order of seniority with the most senior nurse in layoff status recalled first. Recall shall continue in order of most seniority to least seniority until all nurses have been fully restored to their number of scheduled hours before layoff. A nurse shall be allowed up to one (1) week to report to work after receipt of a notice of recall. A nurse who has been recalled or offered a position different than the position from which the nurse was laid off may accept or reject such different position without loss of , recall rights under this Contract Agreement. A different position means either a different unit or shift or number of scheduled hours. A nurse recalled to the same position who declines the offer of recall shall lose all seniority rights.
A nurse unable to respond to notice of recall to the same position due to a reason justifying a leave of absence shall be transferred to appropriate leave of absence status.	'
Seniority shall be lost if the nurse is not recalled from layoff within one (1) year. Provided, however, a nurse may have seniority rights extended for an additional period of one (1) year by giving written notice to the Employer within thirty (30) days before the expiration of the first year of layoff.
35.	EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT:
It is the mutual purpose of the Minnesota Nurses Association and the Employer to encourage each nurse to continue and pursue her or his professional interest and education in nursing.
A.	Tuition Reimbursement for Completion of a BSN, BAN, or MSN:
1.	The Employer shall pay the nurse tuition and required fees and books up to three thousand dollars ($3000) per year for educational course work at an accredited institution under the following circumstances: a. The RN will submit a proposed degree completion plan to

1001 -1500 paid hours	50% repayment
1501 - 2000 paid hours	25% repayment
2000 + paid hours	0% repayment
e.	Nurses who have 20,800 seniority hours or more at the time of termination shall not be required to make any repayment. At the time of layoff, a nurse will continue to be eligible for reimbursement as provided in this Section for courses previously approved and shall not be required to repay the Employer any reimbursement.
f.	RNs who become disabled while completing their education will not be required to make any repayment.
g.	Payment shall be made upon receipt of credit of each preapproved course for which reimbursement has been requested.
2.	Schedule Accommodations:
A nurse making satisfactory progress toward completion of a preapproved degree may temporarily reduce hours in a manner that is mutually agreed upon between the Employer and the nurse in order to accommodate completion of the pre-approved degree.
A nurse may also be granted scheduling accommodations (without reduction of hours) in a manner mutually agreed upon between the nurse and the Employer to facilitate the nurse completing the pre-approved degree.
3.	Educational Leave of Absence:
Upon request, a nurse who has been employed by the Hospital for a period of two (2) years or more shall be granted an educational leave of absence totaling up to twenty-four (24) months. Any extension of an educational leave of absence shall be at the discretion of the Employer.
62
In order to qualify for such leave, the nurse must be a full-time student at a college or university working toward a pre-approved degree or enrolled in a nurse-practitioner program.
Upon obtaining such additional degree or completing such practitioner program and after returning to work at the Hospital granting the educational leave and completing an additional one (1) year of service at such Hospital, the nurse will be given credit for purposes of vacation, length of service, and salary increments in an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the length of the educational leave. The nurse will earn regular credit for time worked before and after her or his educational leave of absence.
B.	Workshops. Courses, and Other Educational Programs:
A regularly scheduled nurse may use up to $350 a year for the cost of the workshops, courses, recertification testing and/or fees, and other types of educational programs that are:
1.	preparing for national certification for the nurse's area of practice. (See
Article 7, “Salary,” Section N, regarding Pay for Certification), or
2.	related to complementary therapies that may enhance the nurse's skills, or
3.	related to the nurse s clinical area of practice.
The Employer will accept any form of proof of payment for education reimbursement.
C.	Required Education Subsequent to Employment:
Any education required by the Employer subsequent to employment shall be provided during hours compensated pursuant to the Contract Agreement and with the expenses thereof paid by the Employer.
Mandatory meetings and required education will be offered or made accessible to the Registered Nurse during or adjacent to the nurse's scheduled work shift. Alternate mechanisms such as video tapes, audio tapes, or self-study may be used.
The Employer agrees to develop and implement a system to channel mandatory/required education for RNs into a manageable format.
This will be routed through the Education Department to provide a continuous, yet predictable, planning schedule to ensure RNs stay consistently informed and current with key information.
63
36.	ADOPTION BENEFIT:	,
The Employer will reimburse adoption expenses of $2000 per household per adoption. Nurses who are authorized to work thirty-two (32) hours or more a pay period are eligible for this benefit.
The reimbursement is payable when the adoption is finalized and proof of adoption is provided to the employer.
37.	JOB PROTECTION, MERGERS, AND REDUCTION OF BEDS:
Determinations or actions by a hospital or by a government, community, or hospital's agency or agencies which recommend or require the elimination or reduction of patient beds or facilities presently in operation are determinations made and actions taken with the stated intention of serving the welfare of the community. Determinations or actions by a Hospital include actions by parent or affiliates or entities which have the power to effectively direct such determinations or actions in a contract Hospital. Consequently, it is the policy of the Hospital and the Minnesota Nurses Association that determinations made and actions taken to serve the community and patients should not be at the expense of individual registered nurses employed at an affected institution. In the event that such determinations or actions, including corporate merger, consolidation, or reorganization of services, directly or indirectly will cause an elimination or a reduction in the number of registered nurses in present, or if greater in future bargaining unit positions in any classification on a station unit, the following principles shall apply:
A.	Notice of Merger, Consolidation, or Reorganization:
The Employer shall give the Association written notice of such action or determination immediately upon any notice to the Employer, whether said notice is preliminary, tentative, or final. The Employer will also give the Association immediate written notice of any decision to authorize a corporate merger, consolidation, or reorganization of services involving the Employer. In these connections, the Employer will cooperate in providing the Association with relevant background information and alternative courses of action available. The individual nurses who will be affected shall receive written notice with a copy to the Minnesota Nurses Association as soon as the action to be taken is ascertained.
B.	Offer of Reassignment Within the Organization:
Nurses from an affected area which is being reduced or eliminated shall be offered reassignment, along with other affected nurses, to other vacant or new registered nurse positions in the same classification (an "opening") within the Hospital for which they are reasonably qualified. The term "reasonably qualified" means the ability to perform the duties of the position within a reasonable period of orientation and in-house training not to exceed four (4) weeks. Such orientation and training shall be at no cost to the nurse.
Reduction of nurses on an affected area and the offering of reassignment in the
64
Hospital shall be made on the basis of seniority in the Hospital as defined in the section related to low-need days and layoff of the Agreement.
The Employer will not promote or employ new nurses or use casual part-time or temporary nurses until all affected nurses have been placed or given the opportunity to qualify for registered nurse openings which are available or become available in their respective classifications. A nurse may voluntarily choose to exercise her or his length of employment rights for an opening in a lower registered nurse classification,
C.	Reductions to Follow Layoff Procedure:
If there are not sufficient registered nurse openings to place all nurses employed at the time of the change or if nurses are not able to qualify for such positions as the same are described in the foregoing paragraphs, the reduction of registered nurse positions in the Hospital shall be made according to the procedure of layoff and recall established by Article 34, "Low-Need Days and Layoff.”
D.	Offer of Employment in Hospitals Controlled by the Same Corporation:
If a nurse cannot be offered placement under paragraphs (B) and (C) above, offers for employment shall concurrently be made by Contracting Hospitals controlled by the same corporate body as the Hospital which employed the nurse who was laid off or who received notice of layoff. Offers of employment under this paragraph (D) shaii be made during the period that the nurse retains recall rights.
Any offer of employment under this paragraph (D) shall be treated for all purposes, including seniority, as a transfer within the same Hospital and not a re-employment,

The affected nurse shall receive the same support and consideration as would be provided to any other patient or client of the Hospital. 6.	The policy shall provide for presentation of information relating to treatment options available. The nurse will be advised at the time of reporting of the exposure of her or his right to utilize the nurse's personal physician.
49.	RIGHTS OF THE CHEMICALLY DEPENDENT. PHYSICALLY IMPAIRED, AND THE MENTAL HEALTH IMPAIRED REGISTERED NURSE: The Employer and the Association are committed to a beiief that early recognition and intervention of chemical abuse dependency and physical or mental health impairment is in the best and professional interest of the nurse, of the Employer, and of the public. Chemical dependency shall be treated for all purposes under this contract as a personal illness. If the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that a nurse is chemically dependent or physically or mentally impaired which has impacted her/his ability to practice safely, the manager will notify Employee Health Services/Human Resources. Health Service/Human Resources will facilitate an investigation at this time. Health Service, the Unit Management, Human Resources, and the MNA Chairperson will meet with the RN. Management will review the information they have with the RN. When appropriate, a referral to the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) will be made. The Employer may request a chemical, neuro-psych, and/or physical evaluation at this time. The health care professional conducting the evaluation will be jointly agreed upon with the Health Service manager and the RN. This assessment will be paid for by the employer and will generally take place within ten business days. The RN will be placed on paid administrative leave until the evaluation is completed. If appropriate, a referral for treatment will be made and the health care provider will develop a treatment plan. The RN will be placed on medical leave. During the medical leave, the employer will request the RN to self-report to the Health Professional Services Program (HPSP). If HPSP is unavailable, the Employer and the Association will jointly agree to its successor or another governing body. A return-to-work agreement will be developed when the RN, MNA Chairperson, Health Care Provider, HPSP, and the Unit Management agree that the RN is ready to return to duty. Accommodations may be made to ensure success upon return to work and accommodate practice restrictions. These may include, but are not limited to, temporary decrease in scheduled hours, shift changes, reduction in shift length, and
81
schedule accommodations to meet the RN’s need to attend therapy or counseling. Only the manager or director may complete the work site monitor report for HPSP. If the diversion of drugs occurred, the RN may be involved in Performance Improvement. Theft of drugs for self-use will not be cause for termination on a first-time offense.
If drug testing is required by HPSP, the option of drug testing in the Employee Health Center (EHC) at North Memorial will be made available. HPSP states that the drug testing fees are the obligation of the RN. If the RN is unable to pay the cost, the EHC will absorb the cost.
The RN is discharged from HPSP upon successful completion of the monitoring agreement without incident. HPSP or the Employer may report violations of the monitoring agreement to the Board of Nursing and terminate the agreement.
50.	CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY:
The Employer and the Association are committed to a belief that the early recognition and intervention of chemical abuse and dependency are in the best personal and professional interest of the nurse, of the Hospital, and of the public. To this end, chemical dependency shall be treated for all purposes under this Contract as a personal illness.
A.	Chemical Dependency Evaluation:
If the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that a nurse is chemically dependent or the Employer had documentation of counseling the nurse regarding previous behavior patterns, the Employer will refer the nurse to the Hospital Employee Assistance Program. The nurse may, in the alternative, elect to secure a required evaluation by a professional qualified in chemical dependency of the nurse's choice. A nurse may be placed in a paid leave of absence status for work time lost during a period of investigation, chemical dependency assessment, or in the period during which the results of a drug or alcohol test are pending in instances where it is believed to be in the best interest of patient care for the nurse not to continue in active on-duty status. The forgoing is subject to a maximum of five (5) days of paid leave. Unless declined by the nurse, the Employer will make a referral of the nurse to the Minnesota Nurses Association's Peer Support Program for Nurses. The nurse will also be given written information concerning the Peer Support Program and encouraged to initiate personal contact with this program.
B.	Drug and/or Alcohol Testing:
Any Hospital that elects to engage in drug and/or alcohol testing for registered nurses shall provide sixty (60) days notice to the Association and shall provide the Association with copies of: (1) Supervisory Guidelines for Drug and Alcohol Testing of Employees in Reasonable Suspicion Cases, (2) Hospital Guidelines for Post-Treatment Program Testing for Alcohol and Drugs, and (3) behavioral observation checklists for use by supervisors. Other relevant information concerning the drug and alcohol testing process will be available to the
82
	Association upon request. The policy shall not be changed during the term of this Contract except by the express written mutual agreement of the parties. No drug or alcohol testing will be requested by the Employer solely based on a pattern of previous workplace behaviors. A request to the nurse to take a drug or alcohol test as part of an assessment may be made only in the event of observable work-related behavior that is documented at the time the request is made. A decision to request a test from a nurse shall be made by two nonbargaining unit Hospital representatives who have received training regarding implementation of the Hospital's Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy, except where only one such person is available. Under normal circumstances, the request for testing will not be attended by Hospital security personnel. At the time that a request for a drug or alcohol test is made, the Employer will advise the nurse in writing of her or his rights to the presence of an Association representative and, if the nurse so chooses, will make a prompt, reasonable effort to secure a representative for the nurse and will document those efforts. In addition, the disclosure statement which allows the nurse to advise the Employer with respect to information regarding prescription drugs, nonprescription medications, and other explanations of positive test results prior to testing will include language that informs the nurse that she or he has no obligation to provide such information prior to testing. The occurrence of a workplace accident or injury will not be considered reasonable cause for testing unless the accident, injury, or the circumstances surrounding either is significant rather than routine.
c.	Treatment: If, following an assessment or evaluation, it is recommended that the nurse receive treatment for chemical dependency, she or he may use the benefits provided by the section related to Sick Leave, Personal Illness, Injury, and Disability, and Insurance Benefits. At conclusion of the leave, the nurse will be returned to work in a position as provided in the section related to leave of absence (personal leave) except that a nurse shall not be returned to a position on a chemical dependency treatment unit until completion of two (2) years of being chemically free. This nurse will be returned to a position of like classification, hours, and pay and may return to the first available position on the chemical dependency treatment unit after the two- (2) year period has passed.
D.	Return to Work: The conditions of the individual nurse's return to work shall be jointly developed by the nurse, hospital representatives, and, unless declined by the nurse, Association representatives. A professional involved in a nurse’s treatment program may also participate. An agreement setting forth return to work conditions shall be in writing and shall be retained for protection of the nurse's rights under this Contract. This return to work agreement may include the
83
I
I
I
I ’	■
.	testing for drugs and alcohol without prior notice for a period of up to a
maximum of two years during and following any referral for chemical
1	dependency counseling or treatment.
I
E.	Discipline:
। .
,	A nurse shall not be disciplined solely for being chemically dependent nor will a
nurse be disciplined solely for refusing a request for which there is not reasonable cause for requesting the test. A nurse may, however, be subject to discipline for action related to the chemical dependency. Any such discipline shall be for just cause as provided in the section related to discipline and shall include consideration of all relevant facts including the relevant facts of the symptoms of chemical dependency. The Employer will agree to defer any investigatory and disciplinary meetings with the nurse until it is determined, in consultation with the treatment professionals, that the nurse is able to fully participate on her or his own behalf.
F.	Confidentiality:
Any referral and related records and discussions of the Peer Support Program, the Employer, the Hospital's Employee Assistance Program (including any agency with whom the Employer contracts for employee assistance) shall be completely confidential and not disclosed without authorization of the nurse. Throughout all steps of the drug or alcohol testing procedure, the right to confidentiality of the nurse at the time a request for testing is made may not be disclosed except as permitted by law or used for any purpose other than evaluating the propriety of testing for drugs and alcohol and evaluating the test results. A specially trained physician utilized by the Employer or an outside source shall only report to the Employer the physician's determination whether or not the positive test results are explainable for reasons other than drug or alcohol use and, if requested, the level of drugs or alcohol present in the sample. Information upon which the physician bases this determination shall be available only to the physician and the nurse. By written authorization, the nurse may agree to release the information to a specified Association representative.
G.	Training for Designated MNA Representatives:
The Employer shall make the training program it provides to "trained supervisors” or "trained resource persons” prior to implementation of the Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy available to MNA-designated members or provide a similar training program to MNA-designated members. In either event, the training program shall be made available for up to 20 MNA-designated members at each Hospital. The training will be provided on work time and at no cost to the nurse.
The Employer will advise the Association if subsequent training concerning the Hospital’s Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy is provided to its "trained
■ supervisors” or "trained resource persons," and the Association may designate
84
up to twenty (20) members per Hospital who did not receive the prior training to attend. The Association will provide to the Hospital the names of its members who have received training provided by the Hospital and who may be contacted by a registered nurse in conjunction with a request for drug or alcohol testing.
Any controversy arising over the interpretation or application of this provision shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the section related to grievance procedure.
H.	Information Requests:
The Employer shall provide to the Association summary information regarding the number of nurses tested, the number of positive tests, and the reasons giving rise to the testing. Such information will be provided in such a way as to not disclose the identity of the nurses tested. The Employer will also provide such information with respect to a grievant whose alleged drug or alcohol use or abuse is the subject of a grievance or arbitration proceeding upon receipt of a written authorization to this effect from the grievant. The Employer will provide employee information which is relevant and necessary to the Association for the proper performance of its duties as bargaining agent, to the extent such information does not violate the confidentiality and privacy safeguards of applicable laws.
NORTH MEMORIAL HEALTH CARE DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING POLICY FOR REGISTERED NURSES
PURPOSE: North Memorial Health Care is committed to maintaining a work environment which is free from the influence of alcohol and/or illegal drugs to protect the health, safety, and well-being of our patients, employees, and visitors. North Memorial Health Care has, therefore, adopted this Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy for Registered Nurses.
POLICY: North Memorial Health Care prohibits the use, possession, transfer, and sale of alcohol and/or illegal drugs while working, while on all premises owned or operated by the Employer, and while operating any Hospital vehicle, machinery, or equipment. It also prohibits reporting for work and working anywhere on behalf of North Memorial Health Care under the influence of alcohol and/or illegal drugs.
Violation of this policy may result in discipline, up to and including discharge. "Illegal drugs" means controlled substances and includes prescription medications which contain a controlled substance and which are used for a purpose or by a person for which they were not prescribed or intended.
This policy does not prohibit: (a) the moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages at Hospital-sponsored events, if any, where the Employer has authorized alcoholic beverages to be served and (b) the possession of sealed bottles or cans of alcoholic beverages in employee vehicles on Hospital premises so long as this possession would be in compliance with state law if the vehicle were on a public street.
85
VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE: Registered nurses are encouraged to voluntarily disclose the excess use of alcohol and/or illegal drugs before being confronted, tested, or otherwise involved in drug- and/or alcohol-related discipline or proceedings. An individual who does so will be granted needed time off for treatment, rehabilitation, or counseling in accordance with the current Contract Agreement. Registered nurses who voluntarily disclose the excessive use of alcohol and/or illegal drugs before being confronted, tested, or otherwise involved in drug- and/or alcohol-related discipline or proceedings will not be discriminated against because of this disclosure nor will any information which is disclosed be used as the sole basis for discipline.
SCOPE: This policy is applicable to all registered nurses of North Memorial Health Care and I	its subsidiaries, except those employees subject to mandatory drug testing by federal law or
|	regulation. Except as to the sale and transfer of alcohol and/or illegal drugs, this policy does
।	not apply to a registered nurse while on Hospital premises solely for the purpose of receiving
।	medical treatment or visiting a person who is receiving medical treatment.
I
।	LABORATORY CRITERIA: State law regarding laboratory certification and licensure has
changed since the policy was initially drafted and bargained. The first paragraph of the
1	section entitled GROUNDS FOR TESTING in the policy should be revised to read as follows:
i
GROUNDS FOR TESTING: All tests are conducted by a laboratory certified in accordance
1	with state law.
i	■
Testing will be requested or required only under the circumstances described below. No test I	will be sought for the purpose of harassing a registered nurse. All tests are conducted by a
i	laboratory licensed by the State of Minnesota and certified by the National Institute on Drug
Abuse. No test will be conducted by a testing laboratory owned or operated by North Memorial Health Care. The laboratory will notify the Employer only of the presence or
1	absence of controlled substances and their metabolites and/or alcohol in the sample tested.
1.	Reasonable Suspicion - A registered nurse may be requested or required to undergo a drug and/or alcohol test if there is a reasonable suspicion that the registered nurse: (a) is under the influence of alcohol and/or illegal drugs, (b) has violated the policy statement above, (c) has caused himself/herself or another employee to sustain a personal injury, (d) has caused a work-related accident, or (e) has operated or helped operate machinery, equipment, or vehicles involved in a work-related accident.
2.	Treatment Program Testing - The section of the Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy which relates to "treatment program" testing and which is found in the section entitled GROUNDS FOR TESTING should be revised as follows:
3.	Treatment Program - A registered nurse may be requested to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing if the registered nurse has been referred by North Memorial Health Care for chemical dependency treatment or evaluation. The registered nurse may be requested or required to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing without prior notice during the evaluation or treatment period and for a period of up to two years following the referral for chemical dependency treatment or evaluation.
86
NOTIFICATION: Before requesting or requiring a registered nurse to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing, the Employer will provide the registered nurse with a copy of this Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy and provide the registered nurse with an opportunity to read the policy.
RIGHT TO REFUSE TO UNDERGO DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING AND THE EFFECT THEREOF: Any registered nurse has the right to refuse to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing. A registered nurse who refuses to be tested or whose behavior prevents meaningful completion of drug and/or alcohol testing will be subject to discharge or other disciplinary action in conformity with the current Contract Agreement. If a registered nurse refuses to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing, no test will be administered.
RIGHTS IN CASE OF A POSITIVE TEST: If the initial result on the drug and/or alcohol test is positive, the sample which was tested will be subject to a second, confirmatory test. No registered nurse will be discharged, disciplined, discriminated against, or requested or required to undergo rehabilitation solely on the basis of an initial test result which is positive.
If the confirmatory test result is also positive, the registered nurse may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, in accordance with the current Contract Agreement and the following:
1.	First Positive Test Result on Confirmatory Test - A registered nurse will not be discharged based on a first-time positive result on a confirmatory test for alcohol and/or illegal drugs requested or required by the Employer unless he or she has been given the opportunity to participate in a drug or alcohol counseling or rehabilitation program and has refused to participate or has failed to successfully complete the counseling program.
2.	Subsequent Positive Result on Confirmatory Test - An employee who receives a positive result on a confirmatory test for alcohol and/or illegal drugs requested or
'	required by the Employer and who has previously received a positive result on a confirmatory test for alcohol and/or illegal drugs requested or required by the Employer may be discharged, so long as a previous positive result occurred within the three preceding years.
If the result of the confirmatory test is positive, a registered nurse has the right to explain the reasons for the positive test and to request a confirmatory retest of the sample, to be conducted at the registered nurse's expense. Any registered nurse wishing to exercise these rights must do so within five (5) working days. Additional internal appeal mechanisms may be available.
If the initial result of the drug and/or alcohol test is negative or the confirmatory test result is negative, the registered nurse is considered to have satisfactorily completed the drug and/or alcohol test.
ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES: A registered nurse who is requested or required to undergo drug testing will be provided with a copy of the test results upon request. A registered nurse who is suspended without pay will be reinstated with back pay if the outcome of the confirmatory test or requested confirmatory retest is negative.
87
I
CONFIDENTIALITY: The fact that a registered nurse has been requested or required to take a drug and/or alcohol test, the result of the test, and information acquired in the alcohol and/or illegal drug testing process shall be treated in a manner consistent with the Employer's treatment of other private, confidential information concerning employees. Voluntary disclosure by a registered nurse of the excessive use of alcohol and/or illegal drugs before being confronted, tested, or otherwise involved in drug- and/or alcohol-related discipline or preceding will also be treated in a manner consistent with the Employer’s treatment of other private and confidential information concerning employees. This information will not be communicated by the Employer to individuals inside or outside of the Hospital without the registered nurse's consent except to those who need to know this information to perform their job functions and as permitted or required by law or regulation.

2.	These RNs agree to report to the North Memorial Medical Center from 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. if they are not flying or completing a flight in order to be paid at the double time rate.
3.	This is not considered floating.
4.	These RNs will be entitled to be paid 16 hours of straight time when ill or using vacation.
5.	Effective June 1,2001, the Metro RNs will resubmit their work agreement verifying the actual position. The RNs would also have the permanent option of not working as a CCRT, thus being paid at straight time for the 16-hour shift and eight hours on-premise on-call.
6.	This arrangement is permanent and is not subject to revocation by the employer or nurse. The option the RN agrees to will be reflected in her or his work agreement.
D.	New Hire Scheduling:
All future Air Care RNs will be hired at 16 hours of straight pay with eight hours on-premise on-call.
E.	Shift Differential:
Shift differential pay will start at 7:00 p.m.
F.	On-Premise Call:
On-premise call will be paid per contract.
1.	All RNs are eligible for the guarantee of four hours pay when required to report to duty when working call. The rate of pay will be at time and one-half or double time if consecutive to the sixteen- (16) hour shift. Metro RNs working on-premise on-call who are called back for less than half an hour will be paid for the actual time worked at time and one-half.
2.	An RN who is called back to work and who clocks back in within one (1) hour of the end of the scheduled shift will be considered continuous for
95
the purpose of double time overtime accrual. This will be considered an extended shift and the clock out time will be considered the end of the call back shift. The half hour window addressed above does not apply in this instance.
3.	If an RN is called to work and works beyond four and one-half (4%) hours, they will receive an additional four (4) hours pay at the ■ appropriate rate.
G.	Non-Fliqht Time:
All Metro RNs not involved in a flight would be required to report to the Administrative Manager/Designee if a Hospital Emergency Incident Command System (HEICS) Alert is called.
H.	Weekend Obligation:
Weekend obligations will be scheduled in rotation.
I.	Overtime Computation:
On-premise on-call hours will not be considered for overtime purposes as part of the work agreement. This method of scheduling cannot prevent any RN from working extra straight time or overtime shifts above the scheduled work agreement.
J.	Hours Crediting:
All RNs shall be credited for all hours worked and on-premise call, receiving all contractual benefits and seniority accrual.
I	<■

PENSION PLAN NOTE
The Twin City Hospitals Retirement Plan for Registered Professional Nurses represented by the Minnesota Nurses Association, previously established as a result of negotiations between the Minnesota Nurses Association and the participating Hospitals, has been amended. The Plan is now known as Twin City Hospitals / Minnesota Nurses Association Pension Plan.
The Pension Plan is funded by the Hospitals without nurse contributions. The instruments for the plan are kept for your inspection at each participating Hospital and at the Minnesota Nurses Association office. A summary plan description is available from Wilson McShane Corporation.
The plan, as amended, provides for certain rules relating to when a nurse becomes a participant in the plan, how benefits are accrued under the Plan, how benefits may be lost by a break in service, and how benefits may be vested.
When considering dates for a leave of absence or termination of employment, it is important that you specifically check with one of the offices listed below to determine the effect that a leave of absence or termination may have on your eligibility for benefits under the plan. This Pension Plan Note and the summary plan description represent only a summary of plan provisions. In all events, the legal documents are controlling.
If you have questions, be sure to contact one of the following offices:
