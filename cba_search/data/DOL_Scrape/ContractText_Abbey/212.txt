19
Forced Overtime
First, Supervision asks/posts overtime according to the Labor Agreement and defined procedure, i.e. asking in sequence of the senior qualified employee with the lowest overtime hours in the department and shift.
If Supervision does not get enough qualified people in the department on the shift for the scheduled overtime assignment the Company will when practical, follow the following procedure:
Step 1: Supervision wilt ask qualified employees in the department on off shifts to work, overtime. The asking will be done in sequence of the senior qualified employee with the lowest overtime hours.
Step 2: Supervision will ask senior qualified employees in the plant on the shift to work overtime. The steward can be used to help identify any qualified people.
Step 3: Supervision will ask senior qualified employees in the plant on off shifts to work overtime. The steward can be used to help identify any qualified people.
Step 4:	For forced weekend overtime only: Supervision will,
before forcing the junior qualified employee on the shift currently working in the department to work overtime, attempt when reasonable and practical to contact and ask to work the overtime any qualified permanent department employee currently transferred outside the plant. When it is necessary, the asking of such overtime will be done in sequence of the senior qualified employee with the lowest overtime hours and the following criteria:
8
I
a)	The employee must be fully qualified and not require any training.
b)	Employees that Have already accepted an overtime assignment in another department and are not eligible for overtime in their home department.
c)	The steward will be used io help identify any qualified people whenever possible.
Step 5: If Supervision still does not have the required number of people scheduled to work the junior qualified employee on the shift in the department will be assigned.
Furthermore, Supervision has the right to force qualified employees to work the necessary scheduled overtime hours for situations such as emergencies or unforeseen production requirements.
The Company will communicate the reasons when it is not practical and/or reasonable to contact qualified employees as outlined in steps 1,2, 3 and 4 above.
An employee has an obligation to work any accepted or assigned overtime shift unless excused by Human Resources. Scheduled overtime is considered a regular work shift and subject to the attendance program. If an employee accepts an overtime assignment and later wants to cancel it - this is only allowed if Supervision can reasonably reschedule another employee for this overtime.
20 It shall be the policy of the Company to ask for daily overtime before: 12 o'clock for the First shift, 12 o'clock for the Mid shift and 9:00 p.m. for the Second shift (Monday Through Friday shifts), the day before for the Third shift, 1:00 p.m. for Variable

in no event shall a first, second or mid shift employee (Monday through Friday) or Variable shift (V-1 or V-2) be required to work Saturday when notification is given later than the end of the employee's Thursday shift nor where the Saturday shift is more than five (5) hours. For first and second shift employees, the Company will schedule consecutive five (5)-hour shifts on Saturday and/or Sunday except where production needs require another schedule. When two (2) shifts are being scheduled, the first and second shifts will be scheduled for the same number of hours. Third shift employees will not be required to work Saturday when notification is given later than one (1) hour after the beginning of the Friday shift. The normal Saturday or Sunday shift for third shift employees is eight (8) consecutive hours. If a change in schedule is necessary, the area Committeeperson or Union office will be notified and given the reasons for such deviation. Whenever possible such explanation shall be given prior to the deviation.
In the event the scheduled work is unable to be performed, the following may apply:
1)	Scheduled work may be moved to another department and performed by the original employee.
2)	Employee may be assigned to other nonscheduled work within the department.
If a department's scheduled work is assigned to be performed in another department prior to scheduling overtime, the qualified employees within the assigned department will be scheduled.

16
appropriate overtime group into which the employee is transferred or recalled.
(b)	an employee becomes permanent in a new department.
(c)	an employee is on temporary transfer. The employee will be given the average of the appropriate overtime group in the new department. The employee will be maintained on the home department overtime records, while on temporary transfer and the employee's overtime record will be charged with any eligible overtime had the employee remained in the home department. The employee's overtime record will not be re-averaged when the employes returns to the home department.
(d)	a probationary employee gains seniority. The employee will be given the average of the appropriate overtime group.

32	When an employee is farmed out and works overtime in that department the overtime shall be charged against the employee and the employee’s home department.
Overtime Dis_tribution
33	The supervisor will keep daily records of all overtime worked by the employees. In order that the overtime on a shift within a department is distributed as evenly as possible (within a half [Mt] an hour balance), those with the least amount of overtime shall be asked to work first among those qualified to do the work. It is recognized that an employee may be qualified to do the overtime work without holding the applicable job classification. If an employee is eligible for overtime but declines the hours that are offered, the overtime will be offered to the next qualified employee.
17
The supervisor’s copy of the overtime record will be posted at the supervisor's desk and kept as current as possible. The names and work centers, where applicable, of those scheduled for daily and weekend overtime work or in the department and shift will be displayed in the department area by the supervisor prior to the overtime work to permit checking by employees so they may determine before the overtime is worked if any errors in selection have been made. This information is to be used by employees to point out any overtime assignment errors to the supervisor before the overtime is worked. When an entire shift in a department is scheduled for weekend work, a notice displayed to that effect need not include names and work centers.
34	It is further agreed that the Company will maintain as close a balance of overtime hours among the shifts .within a department as production necessitates and individual skills allow, tt is recognized that overtime hours worked on any given day are subject to production requirements. Such requirements may not require all shifts (i.e.: both first and second shifts, V-1 and V-2 or WE-1 and WE-2) to work additional hours in the same day. The intent of this paragraph is to only work the overtime required to meet production requirements, not to balance overtime between shifts.
Overtime Guidelines: (Where Monday through Friday, Variable and Capacity shifts are all in the same department.)
For Scheduled Overtime - Planned absences, planned vacations, planned shift gaps, etc. where production needs dictate that all shift openings be filled.
Monday Through Friday Shifts (M-F)
-	Use WE-1 to cover M-F’s first shift Monday through Thursday.

18
I',

19
-	Use V-1 to cover the first half (6 hours) of shift.

If both shifts are scheduled on Friday and/or Saturday and/or Sunday
-	Use V-1 to cover all WE-1
-	Use V-2 to cover all WE-2

For other daily production needs or to cover for short notice (i.e. unplanned) absence or vacation, the plan would be to work
20
shifts ©arty or late, as needed and with an effort toward balancing distribution among the shifts.
These guidelines attempt to define primary on-shift overtime. Where an employee is a primary on-shift candidate, the employee will be charged for the overtime, even if not worked. When situations arise where not enough employees “on-shrft” accepted the overtime, and an off-shift employee is asked, the employee will be charged only if the employee works, not if the overtime is declined.

Holiday/Vacation Scheduling
38	Holiday/Vacation hours are comprised of the holiday hours an employee earned during the previous year. These earned hours are available for the employee to preschedule in full day/odd increments with their supervisor, within the current vacation quotas, or the employee may choose to be compensated for all or a part of the earned Holiday/Vacation hours during January of each year.
When scheduling earned Holiday/Vacation hours, employees must follow the guidelines listed below.
1.	All Holiday/Vacation hours are to be prescheduled with supervision.
2.	Holiday/Vacation cannot be used for random or half (1/2) day vacation.
3.	Employees are responsible to keep track of their regular vacation and Holiday/Vacation entitlement and usage.
4.	Regular vacation and Holiday/Vacation will be tracked separately (i.e.: two buckets of hours).
5.	Employees must stipulate which bucket of hours is to be used. If the employee does not stipulate, the hours will first be taken from the vacation bucket.
23
6.	Odd hours (non-shift increments) of Holiday/Vacation may be used at any time. All odd hours (non-shift increments) of regular vacation must be used last.
7,	Holiday/Vacation must be taken in prescheduled full days within the vacation quotas. All odd hour increments of less than a full shift must be taken at one time.
8.	Remaining odd hour increments of regular vacation and Holiday/Vacation can be combined if equal to or less than a full shift. These odd hour increments must be prescheduled.
9.	All earned Holiday/Vacation hours must be taken in the calendar year. Holiday/Vacation cannot be carried over into the next calendar year. Regular vacation and Holiday/Vacation bucket hours cannot be combined to qualify for carryover to the next vacation period.
10.	The Three Hour Rule applies to Holiday/Vacation and regular vacation. The submission of documentation to Human Resources is required as per the attendance policy. If an employee has excused time off during their shift, the employee is responsible for coming to work if three hours or more can be worked. If less than three hours can be worked the employee needs to communicate this when submitting their documentation to Human Resources.
Note the three hour attendance guideline will apply for employees with less than a full days vacation left. As an example: (a) if an employee has two hours of vacation remaining, the employee is scheduled to work the remainder of their shift. All attendance policies/guidelines apply for employees taking off from work, (b) if an employee is assigned to a V-1 shift and has eight hours of vacation remaining and wants to take the remaining two hours off work, the three hour guidelines stipulates that the time would be an excused absence provided the employee follows the attendance policy.

After being laid off, if an employee fails to report for work within five (5) days after being notified by the Company, through the Human Resource Department by certified letter, provided, however, that no employee shall lose seniority rights if the employee's failure to so report is the result of sickness or causes beyond the employee’s control, in which case the employee shall furnish written proof.
4.	If for any reason an employee has had thirty-six (36) consecutive months of unemployment with the Company or a period equal to one-half (Va) of seniority, whichever is greater.
5.	If the employee is absent without notice to the Company for five (5) consecutive days.
Layoff
54	When it becomes necessary to reduce the working forces, the last employee on the seniority list shall be the first employee laid off, etc., and the last employee laid off shall be the first employee recalled, etc., except as hereinafter provided. Before any layoffs or recalls of any employees occur, a list of employees to be laid off or recalled will be presented to the Shop Committee as to the employees laid oft or recalled and
32
the effect on seniority; but this shall not in any way interfere with the right of the Company to reduce its force.
If it is necessary to call employees back out of seniority because their skills are required, the Company will provide a list of those being called back to the Union before doing so.
When employees are called back out of seniority because their skills are required, the Company will assign the employees to the jobs they were called back for out of seniority.
Maintenance Manpower Guidelines
55	It is agreed that manpower movements (layoff/surplus) of maintenance personnel will be done in accordance with the labor contract with the following clarifications:
I)	Within the same trade and department, (Journeymen to Journeymen) seniority will be the predominate factor governing manpower movement. Deviations from straight seniority will only occur in the instance where a very specific, highly technical skill not common to all journeymen from the same trade is required based on recognized work requirements. Possible exceptions to straight seniority will be reviewed by Human Resources and Union Shop Committee before the exemption is acted on.
II)	Within the same trade and department, (Journeymen to Apprentice) the journeyman is recognized to have a higher skill level than an apprentice. Journeyman will have layoff protection over an apprentice in the same trade even if the apprentice is more senior.
Ill)	Within the same trade and department, (Apprentice to Apprentice) the following criteria will be utilized to determine skill/qualifications for manpower movement:
33
A. 8001-10,000 Hours - Governed by straight seniority. It an apprentice is not able to complete indenture, apprentice will be moved into his most
B. 7001-8000 Hours C. 6001-7000 Hours D. 4001-6000 Hours E. 2001-4000 Hours
F.	1001-2000 Hours
G.	0-1000 Hours
current journeyman classification.
- Governed by straight seniority. - Governed by straight seniority. - Governed by straight seniority. - Governed by straight seniority. - Governed by straight seniority - Probationary period.
For example, an employee in the 6001-7000 hour category will be considered as having more skill and qualifications than an employee in the 2001 -4000 hour category.
Note: If the need arises within one year of being declared surplus (based on employee working at the time) an apprentice with over 1000 hours completed in the apprenticeship program will have the opportunity to be reinstated into the apprenticeship program.
This opportunity must comply with all current rules and regulations of the Wisconsin Apprenticeship law, Trane Company Apprenticeship guidelines and current Labor Contract.
It is also agreed that exemptions in maintenance will be handled based on skill and qualifications with senior qualified/skilled people being given the opportunity to perform the work with the junior person going to layoff.
Exemptions and Deviations from Layoff
56 All boiler operators, welders, and electricians are exempt from the seniority clause as to layoff as long as they are needed on their exempted jobs. It is understood that an exempted
34
employee must have demonstrated the capability to perform the required job. If the Company replaces an employee exempted in one of the above jobs with an older qualified employee, the exempted employee will be laid off.
57 Deviations from straight seniority in addition to those listed above can only be made for justifiable reasons, that is, when an employee's qualifications are essential on available work and no senior employee not subject to layoff has the necessary qualifications. The Company will specify such exemptions to the Shop Committee sufficiently in advance of the layoff/recall giving the specific reasons tor such deviations in each case. The company will endeavor to find alternate qualified employees not subject to layoff for such exempted employees to replace those so exempted. The Company will not be required to make more than two (2) transfers to replace one (1) employee under this paragraph.
The following guidelines clarify the exemption procedure and are in reference to Paragraphs 55 - 61 of the current Labor Contract.
1.	All exemptions from layoff are based on needed skill requirements.
2.	The Company will identify the employees and needed skills to be exempted to the Union Shop Committee as soon as possible after manpower requirements have been determined.
3.	Furthermore, production operations will review manpower to determine if adjustments can be made to free up skilled employees to fill the needed exempt positions. Such manpower adjustments will be communicated to the shop committee.
35
4.	The Company will (per the job posting/internal upgrade language) initiate a job posting/internal upgrade for exempted skills as soon as determined.
•	All capable employees will be considered provided the employees can perform the skilled job with a reasonable amount of training.
If such training is required for capable senior employees, the junior employees will remain on the exempted jobs until the senior employees are trained to fill the exempted positions. At that time the junior exempted employees will be laid off.
•	No qualified employees will be forced out of their home department into any exempted job position.
5.	Exemptions will be discussed between the Company and Shop Committee upon request.
58	The parties may discuss from time to time the problem of deviations from seniority on layoff.
59	Probationary employees will not be exempt from straight seniority if other qualified employees are available.
60	If the Union does not agree with certain exemptions, the Company and the Shop Committee shall make every effort to resolve their differences before resorting to the grievance procedure.
Layoff Notice
61	When layoffs, because of lack of work, are in accordance with straight seniority, the employees affected shall be given two (2) working days notice of the employee’s regular work shift before being laid off for a period of two (2) weeks or more. It is further agreed that in case of material shortages resulting from conditions beyond the Company's control, the two (2) days
36
notice provision will be waived. Employees exempted from layoff who are to be laid off because they are no longer needed on the work for which they are exempt may be laid off without notice. Such exempt employees will work to the end of the shift in which layoff notice is given.
One-Day Layoffs
62	Layoffs due to lack of work or material shortages will be made by seniority in a department, provided such a layoff does not exceed one (1) day in any one (1) week. For any layoff in excess of one (1) day in any (1) one week, the procedure set forth in Paragraphs 54, 56-60 will be followed. This paragraph is not intended to be used to establish a regular workweek with less days than the employees regularly scheduled week for the employees in any department, and shall be applied in such a way that no employee is affected more than six (6) times or more than three (3) consecutive weeks in a twelve (12)-month period. The Union Office will be notified in advance of any layoff under this paragraph.
Inventory
63	The interruption of production due to the taking of inventory is not to be considered as an ordinary layoff. Employees will be asked for inventory work on the basis of seniority in the department provided they are able to perform the work involved. However, when production is also scheduled on their shift, an employee who is scheduled for inventory will be given the opportunity instead to work on such production for which the employee is qualified on this shift and is senior to employees who would otherwise be scheduled for such production.
If inventory is scheduled for Saturday and/or Sunday, this principle will still apply notwithstanding Paragraph 33. Employees who work inventory assignments on Saturday and/or Sunday will be charged for such hours on their overtime record. A refused offer of inventory work on an overtime basis will not be charged.
37
Final notice for production work shall be posted four (4) days before inventory. If any addition is made in the production schedule subsequent to such notice, any employee affected thereby will not be disqualified for holiday payment if the employee chooses not to work on production on inventory day.
ARTICLE VIII - TRANSFER
Requests for Transfer
64	All requests for permanent transfers by employees may be granted by the mutual consent of the Shop Committee and the Company. These transfers shall not be put into effect until agreed and acted on at a regular monthly meeting between the Shop Committee Chairperson and a representative of Human Resources.
The selecting of employees to fill vacancies shall be based upon seniority and qualifications. An employee shall not be entitled to have more than one (1) pemnanent transfer a year. An employee shall be entitled to submit no more than twelve (12) such requests in any calendar year.
65	When an employee is granted a job or department transfer, the employee shall have up to a thirty (30) calendar day, or in the case of the maintenance and inspection departments, up to a sixty (60) calendar day trial period to determine:
1.	If the employee is acceptable in the new job. If not acceptable in the new job, the employee will be given verbal notice by the supervisor as to why the employee is not acceptable. Wherever possible, such verbal notice will be given prior to the employee leaving the department.
2.	If the employee desires to remain in the new job, one (1) thirty (30) calendar day extension may be made at the request of the employee, the Union, or the Company.
38
When such request is made, the Union, the employee, and the supervisor will receive a written notification using the designated form obtained from Supervision, the Union Office or Human Resources.
3.	The employee’s rate will not be lowered in the new department until the employee becomes permanent in said department.
Temporary Transfers
66	All employees who have been on temporary transfer for three (3) months prior to January 15, April 15, July 15, or October 15 will be reviewed on these dates of each year to determine whether or not it would be possible to make the transfer permanent. An employee's rate will not be reduced during the temporary transfer period. The employee will receive the rate of the job being performed while on temporary transfer if it is higher than the employee’s classified rate as soon as the job cycle has been completed. If it is decided to make the transfer permanent, the employee is given a rating in the new department, and the option of accepting the new rate or returning to the old job and department.
Seniority Principle
67	It shall be the policy of the Company to follow the principle of seniority insofar as it is possible to do so in making temporary transfers and in returning employees to their home departments.
Employees will be transferred from their home department by inverse seniority regardless of shift assignment, provided the remaining employees are qualified to perform the remaining work.
Exception for Union Representatives
68	A department steward, a chief steward, or a member of the Shop Committee, will not be farmed or transferred from the
39
department, nor subject to replacement on the shift (under Paragraph 85) nor transferred to another shift (under Paragraph 87) so long as there is work available in the employee’s job classification, or in a job classification the employee has held, or other work available which, in the Company's judgment, the employee is able to perform. This provision shall not be construed to give extra seniority to such Union representative in the event of layoff under Article VII, or to prevent such Union representative from exercising individual seniority under Paragraphs 85 and 87.
Calling Back Transferred Employees
69	When it is established that there is a need for additional personnel for two (2) calendar weeks or more in a department with employees out on temporary transfer, such temporarily transferred employees will be returned to their home department to fill the need in accordance with Paragraph 67 unless such need is being met temporarily by an employee with physical limitations who is unable to perform these normal duties. Such needed employee will be returned to the department no later than the first scheduled workday of the affected employee following the existence of the need except where an unusual replacement problem exists or there are employees with physical limitations assigned to the job, in which case the employee and the Union will be so notified. However, prior to the senior employee on temporary transfer losing rate protection and home department rights, the employee with physical limitations will be removed from the job. The Union will also be informed of the action to be taken by the Company so that the employee can be returned to the home department as promptly as feasible.
70	If an employee is scheduled to be returned to the home department to fill a need, but is delayed due to an unusual replacement problem, and rate protection or right to return, as provided in Paragraph 72, is due to expire during such delay
40
period, such rights wilt be extended until the employee is replaced.
Farming
71	It is recognized that in order to utilize the work force efficiently and to keep people working insofar as possible, the Company requires flexibility in fanning employees for short periods up to six (6) calendar weeks. An employee may be farmed out by the Company because of a reduction of work in the home department, because the employee’s specific skill is needed in another department or because of the production needs of another department. Department seniority will be applied on farm-outs and in the return of farmed out employees where practical to do so.
Except where production needs reasonably require otherwise, employees shall not be placed in a department where employees are farmed out prior to returning those on farmout back to their home department by seniority.
Forced Transfers
72	When an employee is forced to accept a permanent job or department transfer due to a shortage of work, material, manpower, etc., such employee shall carry the present classification rate for a period of three (3) months as provided in Paragraph 66 of the current contract plus an additional thirty (30) days. This period may be extended for a period equal to the length of time such employee was precluded from consideration for return to the home department by the temporary presence therein of an employee with physical limitations. The Company will make every effort to place such an employee within the four (4) month period on available work consistent with the employee's rate, seniority, training and qualifications. However, in no case will such an employee replace another employee in a job. If work again becomes available in the occupation the employee was performing, the employee will have the option of returning to the occupation
41
providing the individual has sufficient seniority and no employee with physical limitations is assigned to the job. However, prior to an employee losing rate protection or the employee with limitations getting permanent department rights, the employee with limitations will be removed. After this period, the employee on forced transfer shall receive the rate for the new job provided such rate is lower than the old rate. If the new job rate is higher than the old rate, the employee shall receive the new rate as soon as the job cycle has been completed. If, during the four (4) month period immediately following the new rate and department assignment, work becomes available in the department from which the employee was forced transferred, the employee will have the option of returning to the department.
Wage Rate Handling
73	When an employee is transferred into a job classification where the training cycle has previously been completed the employee shall receive the rate for that job immediately provided such rate is higher than the rate carried.
74	If an employee continuously performs a job, with a higher classification rate for one (1) full day or more, that job rate shall be received as long as the employee continues to perform the job provided the job cycle has been completed. If the employee continues on the job for a period of nine (9) cumulative months within a two (2)-year period, the employee’s short-term rate shall become the employee’s job classification.
Product Transfer or Discontinuance
75	When the Company transfers a product line or a portion thereof from La Crosse, or discontinues the manufacture of a product line or portion thereof at La Crosse, or merges two (2) or more departments and as a result of such action a department is dissolved or a major portion of the regular employees in such department are no longer needed on their jobs, each employee in the department whose job is abolished because of this action will be subject to the following procedure:
42
1.	Such employee will not be reduced in wage rate for a period of six (6) months from the date of transfer from such department unless the employee requests, and is awarded, a permanent transfer. If, after the six (6) months period, the employee has no permanent department, the employee will be placed on a forced transfer in accordance with Paragraph 72.
2,	Further, before such transfer or discontinuance of a product line or a portion thereof takes place, the Company and the Union will discuss the problems of the placement of the above-affected employees on jobs within the bargaining unit in an attempt to resolve such problems consistent with other provisions of this Agreement.
New Department
76 A new department is created when a new product line is originally manufactured in a separate plant area, and such department is assigned a new department number. When a new department is created, the Company and the Union will agree upon a procedure for the distribution of information regarding the department and the minimum requirements therefor. The selection of the employees will be made in accordance with Paragraphs 64 and 82, and the provisions of Paragraph 65 shall also apply.
Requirements for Upgrade
77 Upgrades, on or after June 15,1993, for both current and future employees will be based on distribution percentages. The Company will manage the distribution of employees as identified in the Contract Amendment, “Attachment B" throughout the Labor Grade Structure based on need. Groupings, under the Job Restructuring Program, will continue to be used for the purpose of preparing an individual for upgrade when the need as identified by distribution arises. The use of “groupings" will no longer be the sole qualifier for an upgrade.
43
Employees who temporarily perform a stand-alone job, in a higher classification, will be compensated as outlined in Article VIII, Paragraph 74, of the current Labor Agreement. However, consistent with Demand Flow Technology principles, employees may be required to perform duties at adjacent work stations for short periods of time that may be in a higher or lower classification without having their rate of pay adjusted. This principle of “one up, one down,” is essential to Demand Flow.
The Company will establish the distribution percentages, including the current workforce, and will manage to that distribution. Operations will be responsible for establishing and managing distribution percentages. In addition, Operations will schedule a meeting to discuss the workforce distribution at least semi-annually with Union leadership. The minimum percentage for MT will not fall below ten percent (10%). The combined total for MT and T1 will not fall below 35 percent (35%).
Seniority within a department will be used to fill upgrade needs in grades T2 and below. Upgrades based on need in T1 and MT will be filled by classification (welding, machinist, machine operations, assembly, factory services) and seniority within the department, i.e., an upgrade to an MT welder will be filled by the senior qualified person already in the welding classification. An exception may exist when the entry-level position within a department is above a T2. In such cases, seniority will be used to fill the upgrade.
Transfer to Lighter Work and Incapability
78 When a senior employee, who is at the time working, requests a transfer to light work, or the Company determines that such an employee is incapable of performing the employee’s regular job, the Company and the Union will discuss the problem with the intent of:
44
1.	assigning the employee to available work which the employee is able to perform and which needs to be performed, and
2.	paying for such work at the wage rate of the job the employee would be performing.
It is understood that the above does not obligate the Company to make work for an employee or to assign an employee to work which cannot be performed satisfactorily.
Americans With Disabilities Act (A.D.A.)
79	Nothing in Ihe Agreement shall be construed as a barrier to reasonable accommodation to qualified applicants or employees with a disability, as defined by the Act, provided the Company agrees to provide the Union with advance notice of any job assignment or other form of accommodation which may otherwise conflict with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Leaving or Returning to Bargaining Unit
80	Any member of the bargaining unit who has been promoted or transferred or is promoted or transferred to a position outside the bargaining unit described in Article I shall maintain the amount of seniority held at the time of such promotion or transfer and will not continue to accumulate seniority within the bargaining unit.
Should such employee request to return to the bargaining unit or should the Company decide to return such employee to the bargaining unit, the employee will be reinstated with the amount of seniority maintained at the time of promotion or transfer. The Company agrees that it wilt not return employees to the bargaining unit for the purpose of temporarily reducing the staff of non-bargaining unit employees. When such employee returns to the bargaining unit, job and department assignments will be at the discretion of the Company. The employee will be
45
assigned the entry-level job within a department. The employee will be granted home department rights in the department where assigned. The Union will be notified of the job and department assignment five (5) days prior to such assignment wherever possible.
However, an employee will not be placed in a department where the assignment would cause the transfer of a regular department employee then working in the department, or where there are employees out of such department on temporary transfer, or where there is not a need for the employee in the department for at least two (2) calendar weeks.
81	Nothing, however, contained in Paragraph 80 shall be construed as limiting the Company's right to discharge any employee promoted or transferred from the bargaining unit for cause.
Should any employee who has been promoted or transferred from the bargaining unit and then returned to the bargaining unit under the above procedures, be subsequently again promoted or transferred from the bargaining unit, the employee will lose all seniority status in the bargaining unit on the date of such promotion or transfer.
An initial temporary vacation replacement assignment of up to three (3) months outside the bargaining unit will not be counted toward the limitations of this paragraph.
Permanent Transfers Not Covered
82	All permanent transfers not covered elsewhere in this Agreement shall be discussed with the Shop Committee before such transfers are made.
46
ARTICLE IX - SHIFT TRANSFERS
Voluntary Shift Exchange (up to 1 week)
83	Voluntary shift exchanges which are approved by the Company will be permitted between two (2) employees in the same department on a temporary basis (up to one [1 ] week) if such exchange conforms to the Walsh-Healey Act and does not cause overtime payments. No changes in night shift premium will be made for either employee Involved in temporary shift exchange under this paragraph.
Voluntary Shift Exchange (more than 1 week)
84	A request for an exchange of shifts - for up to one (1) year by two (2) employees in the same department will be permitted providing:
1,	Neither employee puts in more than one (1) workday in a twenty-four (24)-hour period in making the exchange, to conform with the Walsh-Healey Act.
2.	Neither of the employees making the exchange may do so again within a period of six (6) months, based on Company approval.

85	An employee with at least one (1) year seniority may replace a junior employee on a different shift in the same department subject to the following:
47
1.	The junior employee shall have worked in the same department for at least six (6) months.
2.	In order to bump, an employee must be qualified to do the job of a junior employee being bumped. Typically, this means the bump will be in the same classification (i.e. welding, machining).
3.	In addition, an employee will be allowed to bump if the employee is able to do the job of a junior employee with a minimal amount (couple days) of updating on the job.
4.	Alternately, the Company will consider manpower adjustments/moves in order to accommodate the bump. This accommodation will only be allowed if there is no disruption to production and within all applicable Labor Contract provisions. The Company maintains the right to assign work.
5.	The Company is not required to train the employee that is requesting the shift preference. The only training requirement is where the senior employee is replacing an employee in the same or a lower rated labor grade, the Company will, in all instances where possible, train a replacement within three (3) months for the senior employee so that the shift transfer may be exercised. The training period will start within a one (1) week period after the employee's written request is acted upon at the regular meeting. Also, employees transferred to other shifts for training cannot be bumped.
6.	Bump Procedure (Shift Preference) with the Maintenance Program. Bump Procedure Apprenticeship: To meet the training requirements of the apprenticeship program, an apprentice may not bump or be bumped while on a specific shift for training the first 2 years of a 4 year program or the first 6 months of a 1 year advanced program.
48
Joumeymen/apprentice may bump only within their own classification.
7.	Supervision determines the person being bumped and any manpower adjustments involved. Supervision will communicate to the employee and steward on the status of all bumps.
8.	There will be not more than one (1) such transfer for every thirty (30) regular employees or portion thereof in a department in any two (2) month period, except that each department will be allowed at least one (1) such transfer in any two (2) month period. The number of transfers to ba allowed in accordance with the above provisions will be determined on August 1st and February 1st of each year.
86	With respect to the operation of this paragraph, an employee who has performed a job in a department classified in Labor Grade Technician 4 for nine (9) months, or a job classified in Labor Grade Technician 3 or above for twelve (12) months, may be replaced by a senior employee from another shift. This does not place a requirement on the Company to grant a full rate to any employee before the job cycle has been completed.
Transfer to Another Work Schedule
87	When it is necessary to transfer an employee from one shift to another, the youngest employee by seniority in the department capable of doing the work involved, shall be so transferred. When another shift is to be established in a department, the shift will be manned by transferring the youngest employees by seniority from the shift capable of doing the work involved.
The above principles will apply provided no senior employee capable of doing the work expresses a preference to be transferred to the shift involved.
49
Variable Output or Capacity Transfer to Another Work Schedule 88 An employee being transferred from one shift to another shall be notified as follows:
1.	An employee on Variable Output will be notified prior to the end of the shift on Thursday. However, if the shift being transferred to is a weekend shift, then the transfer will be effective on the second Friday following such notice.

Each period of time (three [3] months, one [1 ] year, etc.) followed by “of working time” will in every case terminate no later than eighteen (18) months after the date it begins.
Reporting Absence
96 RULE 6) All employees must notify the Company when they are going to be absent or tardy. Notification must be made prior to the start of the shift by calling the “Employee Absence Reporting System” (EARS) on (608J-787-2142 All absences or tardys must be reported on EARS even if the employee notifies other Company representatives about their absence or tardy. All calls must be completed and saved per the procedure/ Employees that do not have a touch-tone telephone are to call (608)-787-4882 to report their absence or tardy. If an employee does not call in for each absence or tardy, prior to the start of their shift, as identified above, the absence or tardy is unexcused. Employees should also inform their supervisor ahead of time whenever they know they will be absent or tardy. Emergency situations will be handled on a case by case basis.
Employees do not have to report their leave early on EARS prior to the start of their shift. Employees must verbally notify their supervisor prior to the start of their shift if they are going to leave early and want consideration to be excused.
All absences pertaining to work related injuries/illnesses must be reported and handled in accordance with the attendance
52
policy, unless Paragraph 97 applies and the daily reporting is not required.
97	Employees that know they are going to be absent from work have the option to apply for a formal leave of absence through Human Resources. Once an employee is on an approved leave of absence through Human Resources, the daily reporting is not required. In addition, employees must go on a leave of absence after missing in excess of one work week per Paragraph 140 of the current labor agreement.
Employees that are going to be absent from work for one workweek (seven calendar days) or less may schedule the time away from work with Human Resources. In such cases, employees are required to: (a) schedule a time to meet, outside of the employee’s shift, where practicable, on their own time, with a Human Resources representative, (b) submit documentation acceptable to the Company in advance of the absence to Human Resources, and (c) receive approval by Human Resources to be away from work. Upon receiving advanced approval by Human Resources, daily reporting is not required.
98	Furthermore, employees returning to work from a medical leave of absence, or a leave that does not have a predetermined return date, must first report to Human Resources with the appropriate return to work authorization/documentation before returning to the job.
Excused Absence Defined
99	The following absences will be excused when approved by the Company and will not be subject to the progressive discipline procedure:
1.	Jury duty, military duty, funeral leave, occupational illness/injury, Human Resource-approved leaves of
53
absence, vacation, paid holidays, not scheduled for work, Union business and sick with medical proof.
2.	Employee must provide documentation acceptable to the Company within five (5) working days of the employee's work schedule after return to work.
3.	Regarding the “Three Hour Rule”, if an employee has excused time off during their shift, the employee is responsible for coming to work if three (3) hours or more can be worked.

6.	Employees scheduled to work during a shutdown period will be notified of this not later than 30 calendar days prior to the shutdown period. At the time of such notification, vacations for such employees will be scheduled.
7.	The Three Hour Rule applies to regular vacation. The submission of documentation to Human Resources is required as per the attendance policy. If an employee has excused time off during their shift, the employee is responsible for coming to work if three hours or more can be worked. If less than three hours can be worked the employee needs to communicate this when submitting their documentation to Human Resources.
75
Note the three hour attendance guideline will apply for employees with less than a full days vacation left. As an example: (a) if an employee has two hours of vacation remaining, the employee is scheduled to work the remainder of their shift. All attendance policies/guidelines apply for employees taking off from work, (b) if an employee is assigned to a V-1 shift and has eight hours of vacation remaining and wants to take the remaining two hours off work, the three hour guideline stipulates that the time would be an excused absence provided the employee follows the attendance policy.
Employees entitled to vacation may take all of their vacation on a one-day-at-a-time basis.
1.	Vacations must first be used during scheduled vacation shutdowns as described in number five (5) above.
2.	Vacations on the last regular workday prior to and the first regular workday after a holiday(s) and the Friday prior to deer season cannot exceed the department established quota plus 50 percent (50%).
3.	Requests for prescheduled vacations should be made as far in advance as possible. Such requests made after the start of the employee’s unpaid lunch break of the previous day may not be considered. Additional vacation hours must be scheduled in advance and approved by the Company.
4.	Employees entitled to eighty (80) hours or more vacation (not including Holiday/Vacation hours or vacation carryover hours) may apply their vacation as random full day vacation as identified in number five (5) below.
5.	If an employee calls in on time, the employee may specify that they wish to apply that day as a random full day of vacation, to a maximum of:
76
Monday through Friday shifts: five (5) random, eight (8) hour day-at-a-time days vacation.
Variable shifts: four (4) random, ten (10) hour day-at-a-time days vacation.
Capacity shifts: three (3) random thirteen and three tenths (13.3334) hour day-at-a-time days vacation.
All employees will be charged the number of hours paid for when taking vacation. Reference Paragraph 164.
6.	The use of day-at-a-time vacation cannot disrupt production operations.
7.	Requests for day-at-a-time vacation are subject to the approval of the Company.
Employees entitled to eighty (80) hours or more vacation will be able to convert up to three (3) single days vacation into six (6) “pre-scheduled” half (y&) day vacations. Requests for a half (W) day vacation should be made as tar in advance as possible. Pre-scheduled is defined as being scheduled prior to the start of the employee’s unpaid lunch break of the previous work day. Employees may not call in for a random half I1/;) day vacation.
1.	All department vacation quotas remain in effect and the use of a half (Vi) day vacation cannot disrupt production operations. As in the past, supervision may deviate up or down from the vacation quota based on production needs.
(a)	Half (14) day vacation scheduling will be recorded with the day-at-a-time vacation quota. Employees may preschedule the first or second half (Me) of the shift as a half (14) day vacation. Two (2) employees may each pre-schedule a half 04) day vacation to equal one (1) full day per the department quota provided:
77
(b)	one half (1/z) day vacation is scheduled in the first half (Vs) of the shift ,and
(c)	the second half (Vi) day vacation is scheduled in the last half( V2) of the shift.
Note that once a half (ty day vacation is scheduled, each day-ai-a-time vacation quota opening is considered full unless another half (Vs) day vacation is scheduled for the other half (ft) of the shift. Two (2) people in the same department or shift may sign up for the same half (14) day of that shift provided this does not result in exceeding the vacation quota and/or result in disruption to production.
1.	Note that all Contract language remains in effect. All day-at-a-time vacation language will apply to the half day vacation.
2.	Shift hours refer to normal hours paid, thus the first half (14) of the shift is defined as the first four (4), five (5) or six (6) hours paid at the applicable rate, and the second half (14) of the shift is defined as the second four (4), five (5) or six (6) hours paid at the applicable rate. Based on when the unpaid lunch period is scheduled, such unpaid lunch periods must be included in the defined half of the shift when scheduling a half day vacation.
For example: an employee assigned to work a Monday Through Friday first shift (6:45 a.m. - 3:00 p.m.) may preschedule a half (Vi) day vacation for the first half (’/£) of the shift (6:45 a.m. -10:45 a.m.) or the second half (14) of the shift (10:45 a.m. - 3:00 p.m.).

An employee assigned to work a Variable V-1 shift (5:45 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.) may preschedule a half (1/2) day vacation for the first half (1/2) of the shift (5:45 a.m. - 10:45 a.m.) or the second half (1/2) of the shift (10:45 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.).
An employee assigned to work a Variable V-2 shift (4:00 p.m. - 2:15 a.m.) may preschedute a half (1/2) day vacation for the first half (1/2) of the shift (4:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m.) or the second haff (1/2) of the shift (9:00 p.m. - 2:15 a.m.).

172	In-house candidates selected for an apprenticeship will continue to carry their current rate until such time as the appropriate progression schedule takes over.
All six (6)-month advancements, whether part of the progression schedule or this provision, are contingent on the evaluations of supervision and the journeyman-instructor as reported to Joint Committee.
Upgrading
173	The Company will continue to upgrade employees io higher skilled jobs where possible to do so. The fact that an employee is proficient on the job currently held, will not in itself be the cause to prevent the upgrading to a higher skilled job. Seniority will be a factor in making the selection.
Requirements tor Upgrade
174	Upgrades, on or after June 15,1993, for both cunent and future employees will be based on distribution percentages. The Company will manage the distribution of employees (see Attachment B chart on page 102) throughout the Labor Grade Structure based on need.
Groupings, under the Job Restructuring Program, will continue to be used for the purpose of preparing an individual for upgrade when the need as identified by distribution arises. The use of “groupings" will no longer be the sole qualifier for an upgrade.
Employees who temporarily perform a stand-alone job, in a higher classification, will be compensated as outlined in Article VIII, Paragraph 74, of the current Labor Agreement. However, consistent with Demand Flow Technology principles, employees may be required to perform duties at adjacent work stations for short periods of time that may be in a higher or lower classification without having their rate of pay adjusted.
91
This principle of “one up, one down,” is essential to Demand Flow.
The Company will establish the distribution percentages, including the current workforce, and will manage to that distribution. Operations will be responsible for establishing and managing distribution percentages. In addition, Operations will schedule a meeting to discuss the workforce distribution at least semi-annually with Union leadership. The minimum percentage for MT will not fall below ten percent (10%). The combined total for MT and T1 will not fall below 35 percent (35%).
LABOR GRADE GUIDELINES
GUIDELINES FOR ASSIGNING LABOR GRADES
1.	Labor grade assignments will be based on need and managed to the distribution guidelines.
2.	Employees who are temporarily assigned to a higher rated job will be covered under Paragraph 73 and 74 of the Labor Agreement.
3.	Employees may be required to perform duties at adjacent work stations for short periods of time that may be in a higher or lower labor grade without having their labor grade or rate of pay adjusted.
4.	Any employee who is assigned to a permanent stand alone job will be assigned the appropriate labor grade when qualified. If an employee is trained as a backup, the employee will receive the appropriate labor grade as outlined in Paragraph 74.
5.	Employees assigned a stand alone or a seniority based grouping labor grade will retain the labor grade unless it is voluntarily forfeited by the employee as identified in the Labor Agreement.
92
6.	Groupings will be used for the purpose of preparing an individual for upgrade when the need, as identified by distribution, arises.
GUIDELINES FOR UPGRADE
I) Ai) seniority qrout2ing_upqrades will be based on La Crosse wide seniority and distribution requirements, adjustments to seniority grouping upgrades will be discussed at least semiannually. For all required seniority grouping upgrades, the first opportunity for upgrade will be afforded to the senior employee who is already qualified for the upgrade grouping. However, if there is a senior employee that only requires one more *T’ qualification to attain the upgrade grouping qualification then the senior employee is afforded the upgrade opportunity.
An example of a required MT seniority grouping Upgrade is as follows:
Step 1 The senior employee carrying a T1 or T2 labor grade who is already a qualified MT (7 x T2’s) will be upgraded (an exception may exist based on Step 2-B). Refer to Attachment B chart on page 98.
Step 2
A.	If there is no qualified employee in the “A" category then the upgrade will be afforded to the senior employee who is a T2 with 6 x T2's (T1 grouping), Refer to Attachment B chart on page 98.
B.	However, if the employee in the “BT category has more seniority than the employee in “A" and only requires one more “T" qualification to obtain a MT rating, then the senior employee
93
is afforded the upgrade training opportunity. Refer to Attachment B chart on page 98.
C.	Upon successful completion of the training, the employee will receive the appropriate back pay from the date the employee was identified for the required grouping upgrade.
II)	In work ceils, employees are required to (earn all jobs within their respective work cell before training on jobs outside of their work cell. Furthermore, employees in their work cell are afforded the opportunity to train on ail jobs within the work celt before employees outside of the work cell are afforded the opportunity.
Ill)	Employees have the responsibility to do all assigned work including training.
IV)	Training does not have to be offered to an employee if the training is not a one step away upgrade, i.e. it is not required for a MT welder to be trained on a T1 job since it would not result in an upgrade.
V)	Capability will continue to be a factor of consideration in filling a training need.
VI)	On occasion, it may be necessary to train junior employees in order to free up senior employees for training. This will be done only if there is a written training plan and all employees involved are informed about the needed training.
VII)	The extent of training in a department is based on the production needs and the practical ability to keep employees cross trained.
94
Vlll)	Supervision will communicate the general plan for training to employees. Training is normally an ongoing process.
IX)	All applicable labor contract language is in effect.
Supplement to Upgrade and Training Guidelines
•	No training for overtime
•	Upgrade - Labor Grade change (i.e., T3 to T2)
•	All employees will rotate in their assigned work cell.
•	Home department employees on the shift within the department will be given primary consideration for backup job training.
A)	For Standalone/workcell job training for backup operator MT & T1 unless entry level applies. Select back up person to be trained in the following order.
*	1a Criteria: Fill by qualification within classification. Balance for flexibility.
•	2nd Criteria: Fill within classification without qualification. Balance for flexibility.
•	3rd Criteria: Within department, assign junior qualified person if they are on a lower rated job.
•	4th Criteria: Assign the junior person within the department.
B)	For Standalone/workcell job training for backup T2 & below unless entry level applies. Steward/Factoiy Unit Manager identify individuals for training. Balance for flexibility. Considerations:
95
•	Seniority, number of jobs already trained for back up and one away from grouping upgrade. Steward/Factory Unit Manager judgement call.
•	Upgrade offered to home department employees in department (based on Guidelines). It is not required to train home department employees for a lateral labor grade job unless one away from upgrade; however, the Company is not excluded from selecting home department employees for a lateral move when it is deemed practical.
A)	For lateral moves within classification or outside of classification if qualified. Employees can be assigned to any job the employee is qualified to perform. Lateral moves are a normal occurrence if employees are qualified. If an employee is unqualified and requires training, the training selection guidelines apply.

229 In the event it is determined that an employee with seniority needs corrective lenses in safety glasses due to near/far vision problems, the employee will furnish a copy of the prescription and the Company will pay the cost of the glasses.
230 When it becomes necessary to replace prescription lenses after the first pair, because of a change in prescription needs, the employee will furnish a copy of the prescription and the Company will pay the cost of the lenses.
231 When it is necessary to replace an employee's prescription safety glasses because they are pitted to such an extent that they are no longer serviceable, the Company will pay for the cost of the new lenses if the employee has had the glasses for a period of more than two (2) years of working time. If the employee has had the glasses for less than two (2) years of working time, the Company will pay the cost of the new lenses unless there has been negligence on the part of the employee.
122
Damaged Glasses
232 Safety glasses damaged without the fault of the employee will be repaired or replaced at no cost to the employee; however, it will be the employee's responsibility to maintain the glasses in acceptable condition and to replace them if they are lost, or if they are damaged through misuse or improper care.
General
233 The Company will maintain adequate facilities for necessary minor adjustment and minor repair of safety glasses. In addition to medical department employees, first aid attendants will perform these functions.
234 All prescription safety glasses will be purchased through the Company (any exceptions must be approved by the Safety Department).
ARTICLE XXIII - MISCELLANEOUS
New Technology
235 The Company and the Union agree that it is to both their mutual benefit and a sound economic and social goal to utilize the most efficient machines, processes, methods and/or materials. In this way, the Company will be able to compete effectively in the marketplace and, thereby, provide economically secure jobs for its employees.
The Company further agrees to meet with the Union in order to evaluate the impact of technological changes on all employees. Where possible the Company will assist in reassigning employees in affected areas based on seniority and ability.

Limitation on Supervision Doing Bargaining Unit Work 237 The policy of the Company is to have supervision perform supervisory work. Supervisors and other nonbargaining unit employees of the Company shall not perform the work of employees in the bargaining unit other than for instructive purposes, or in case of emergencies, and when attempting to eliminate trouble on a job when employees who can eliminate the trouble or handle the emergency are not readily available, but the work so performed shall not take away any work from any employee.
Notices to Employees
238 All notices to employees will be sent by mail to their address as it appears on the records of the Human Resource Department or if it is necessary that the telephone be used, the message will be given to the person answering at the number given by the employee as the one to use for that purpose.

239 An employee will take a physical examination at Company expense upon the request of the Company. Before an employee is sent for such physical examination, the Company will inform the Union and discuss the reasons for the physical examination. The time spent for such an examination will be paid at the rate of straight time. When requested, employees under temporary medical restrictions will be required to provide the Company with a medical update concerning such restrictions.
Wash Up Period
240 A three (3)-minute wash up period before the stopping signal will be granted for spray painters and helpers working in the
124

Out of Town Assignments
244 The Company will inform the chairperson of the Shop Committee when members of the bargaining unit have been sent on assignments outside La Crosse. Compensation while on such assignments will be based on the applicable provisions of the Fair Labor Standard Act and Trane Company Travel Policy.
245 The Trane Company Travel Policy presently provides that an employee traveling on Company business outside La Crosse will receive an additional 20 percent (20%) (or more for certain international trips) added to the employee’s earnings applicable to paid travel time and work performed on the trip with the exception of authorized time off before and/or after a trip, travel for purposes of the employee's own training, and any trip completed within one (1) day,
125
Employees are considered first shift employees for purposes of determining normal working and sleeping hours while traveling. Travel, including time outside normal working hours, will be compensated according to the Trane Company Travel Policy.
Experimental Department
246 It is agreed that the Memo of Understanding dated May 22, 1958, with reference to the Experimental Department remains in effect.
MEMO OF UNDERSTANDING
The experimental department (367) is responsible for building sample, test and experimental units. These units are used for the most part as a means of obtaining production orders for the units from customers or potential customers. The customer may subject a group of experimental units to severe tests, some of which are destructive in that they exceed by far the specifications necessary. If the customers specifications are met, the Trane Company usually receives confirmation on a quantity order for the units involved. Once such an order is received, the company takes steps to obtain the necessary tooling to produce the units on a production basis. In general, it is not the purpose of the experimental department to manufacture units on a production quantity basis.
In view of the problem arising out of the carrying on of Experimental Department work in Plant 3, the Company has decided to move Dept. 367 facilities and personnel to the Engineering Laboratory. This problem arose because these men have been physically located in a factory building.
The parties agree this transfer means that the personnel involved are outside of the Company’s factory employee group and therefore outside of the Union’s jurisdiction. The transfer will be made on or before June 15, 1958.
126
It is understood that Experimental Department personnel may be required to coordinate the work between Experimental and Production and to instruct factory employees when necessary as is now being done. However, it is not intended that such personnel act in a direct supervisory capacity over hourly employees.
The union further agrees that their grievance dated February 18, 1958 on this problem is settled.
Reference is made to the signed minutes of the meetings between the Company and the Union on April 9,1958, April 24,1958 and May 5,1958 in which questions relating to this matter are covered.

ARTICLE XXIV - STRIKES AND LOCKOUTS
No Strike - No Lockout
247 Since the procedures herein provide a means of peaceable settlement of all differences, disputes, complaints and grievances that may arise between them, it is agreed that the Union shall not authorize, encourage, or participate in any
128
strike or slowdown, and the Company agrees that there shall be no lockouts.
Violation of Clause
248 In the event of an illegal, unauthorized or uncondoned strike, sitdown, slowdown or interference with the operation by an employee or employees in violation of this Agreement, the Union will undertake all reasonable means at its disposal to terminate such action. Employees who participate in or are responsible for such violation may be disciplined or discharged, and such discipline or discharge shall be subject to the grievance procedure except as to employees who do not terminate the violation promptly. The question of whether an employee participated in or had any responsibility for such violation shall in every case be subject to the grievance procedure. In the event that the Union, using immediate action, is unable to induce the employee or employees to terminate such unauthorized action, the Company will not hold the local Union or its officers or the International Union or its officers financially responsible therefor.
ARTICLE XXV DEMAND FLOW TECHNOLOGY
249 The Union and Company agree to use their best efforts to work cooperatively to implement Demand Flow Technology throughout La Crosse operations. Demand Flow Technology is a prerequisite for consideration of manufacturing in La Crosse, and by doing so makes La Crosse more cost-competitive in our industry.
129
ARTICLE XXV) - 1993 AMENDMENT*
*(Note that all articles and paragraph numbers referenced in the 1993 Amendment are based on the 1991 - 1995 Agreement.)
250 Over the past several months Company and Union representatives have met to discuss the future of Trane’s La Crosse manufacturing operations. These joint discussions covered the multifaceted cost disadvantages lacing La Crosse of which La Crosse’s high labor rates were identified as a major cost factor that could work against the La Crosse Business Unit when making future investment decisions.
The objective for both parties was to control future labor costs thereby insuring that meaningful consideration for future investments of redesigned products (Commercial Scroll and Absorption Water Chillers) was given to La Crosse while maintaining the base wages of the current workforce through grandfathering.
It is understood between the parties that should the Company not make the decision to invest in the above referenced redesigned products tor La Crosse production by June 15th of 1993, this Amendment in its entirety becomes null and void.
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive outline of the proposed Amendment to the current labor Agreement as well as noncontractual commitments and agreements on various issues of discussion, as featured below and supplemented by Attachments A, B and C.
Demand Flow Technology
American Standard Inc., and ail of its facilities and manufacturing locations are converting to Demand Flow Manufacturing Technology which is intended to eliminate nonvalue-added activities. Cooperation with Demand Flow Technology is a prerequisite for consideration of manufacturing
130
the redesigned products in La Crosse, and by doing so makes La Crosse more cost-competitive in our industry.
The Union and Company agree to use their best efforts to work cooperatively to implement Demand Flow Technology throughout the La Crosse Business Unit.
New Wage Schedule
A new wage schedule will be added to the Labor Grade Structure, Schedule E (see Attachment A and A-1) and is applicable only to individuals hired (or rehired) on or after June 16,1993. This does not affect current employees who may be laid off with recall rights. Wage protection provisions based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, as outline in the current Labor Agreement, Article XVI, Paragraph 169, will apply to all wage schedules. Future changes to the Wage Protection provisions beyond the current Labor Agreement will be subject to future tabor contract negotiations.
Trainee Rates
Trainee rates, as outlined in Schedules I, II and III of the current Labor Agreement will not apply to employees hired on or after June 15,1993 under Schedule E. Such employees will fall under Schedule E of this Amendment.
Probationary Period
Individuals hired on or after June 15,1993, must complete a probationary period as outlined in Article VIII, Paragraph 53, of the current Labor Agreement. Upon successful completion of one's probationary period individuals will receive $1.00 per hour increase under Schedule E. The day following the end of an individual’s probationary period will establish the seniority date.
Time Progression
Time progressions in grade where applicable under Schedule E will continue to be based on “of working time” the same as it is
131
for individuals hired prior to June 15,1993. Time progression increases will be one (1) year “of working time" from one’s seniority date allowing for adjustments outside “of working time," i.e., layoff, long leave, and leave of absence. Single day(s) of leave of absence will not cause adjustments towards time progressions.
The Company is implementing a new time and attendance recordkeeping system which will aid in the tracking “of time worked,” as well as provide timely response to requests for certain types of personnel infoimation.
The Company will provide the Union Office with two (2) terminals and one (1) printer so direct viewing can be made by the Shop Committee of non-confidential hourly employee information, i.e., vacation, absentee records, training records, etc.
Upgrades Between Levels
Upgrades (pay) for individuals hired on or after June 15,1993, under Schedule E will be based on time in grade. The following examples illustrate how upgrades between levels would work:
First illustration: an individual who has been employed for three (3) years and is at an FT2 36'month progression rate and is upgraded, based on need, to an FT1 will receive the 36-month progression rate for an FT1,
Second illustration: an individual who has been employed for five (5) years and is at an FT2 60-month progression rate and based on need qualifies for an upgrade to FMT will receive the 60-month progression rate for an FMT.
Requirements for Upgrade
Upgrades, on or after June 15,1993, for both current and future employees will be based on distribution percentages. The Company will manage the distribution of employees (see
132
Attachment B) throughout the Labor Grade Structure based on need.
Groupings, under the Job Restructuring Program, will continue to be used for the purpose of preparing an individual for upgrade when the need as identified by distribution arises. The use of “groupings’’ will no longer be the sole qualifier for an upgrade.
Employees who temporarily perform a stand-alone job, in a higher classification, will be compensated as outlined in Article VIII, Paragraph 75, of the current Labor Agreement. However, consistent with Demand Flow Technology principles, employees may be required to perform duties at adjacent work stations for short periods of time that may be in a higher or lower classification without having their rate of pay adjusted. This principle of “one up, one down," is essential to Demand Flow.
The Company will establish the distribution percentages, including the current workforce, and will manage to that distribution. Operations will be responsible for establishing and managing distribution percentages. In addition, Operations will schedule a meeting to discuss the workforce distribution at least semi-annually with Union leadership. The minimum percentage for FMT will not fall below ten percent (10%). The combined total for FMT and FT1 will not fall below 35 percent (35%).
Seniority within a department will be used to fill upgrade needs in grades FT2 and below. Upgrades based on need in FT 1 and FMT will be filled by classification (welding, machinist, machine operations, assembly, factory services) and seniority within the department, i.e., an upgrade to an FMT welder will be filled by the senior qualified person already in the welding classification. An exception may exist when the entry-level position within a department is above an FT2. In such cases, seniority will be used to fill the upgrade.
133
Vacation
Vacation for hourly employees hired on or after June 15, 1993, will be capped at four (4) weeks (see Attachment C). All other provisions of Article XVI - VACATION remain unchanged.
Vacation entitlement, for current employees, will remain unchanged for the life of the Contract, subject to future labor contract negotiations.
Wage Increase
The Union agrees to forego the 1993 negotiated general wage increase of 30c per hour. The 1994 negotiated general increase of 350 per hour will apply to all wage schedules.
State Funding
The Company and Union will work together in an effort to secure State funding assistance for capital purchases and/or leasing of capital equipment and expense needs. Specific needs will include: capital financing and/or leasing of capital equipment for Scroll Compressors and Absorption Water Chillers, and grants for the relocation ol Plant 6 Compressor Operations and training for people on new jobs.
The Company and Union have discussed the future of work considered for placement in La Crosse as a result of the Company receiving State Funding assistance and the implementation of this Amendment.
The Company and the Union agree that the Company’s obligations with respect to the ongoing continuation of work placed in La Crosse, as a result of the Amendment, is limited to those conditions as required by the State to secure the funding assistance. As previously stated, this Amendment in its entirety becomes null and void if the Company does not make the decision to invest in the redesigned products for La Crosse by June 15,1993, regardless of the source of funding.
134
Grandfathering
The intent of grandfathering, as outlined under Security of Amendment, is to maintain the current base wage rate for all hourly employees hired prior to June 15,1993. All employees will be assigned their appropriate job classification (labor grade) based on the agreed distribution guidelines and percentages per Attachment B.
Grandfathered employees will maintain their current base wage rate unless they voluntarily choose to forfeit their grandfather protection. Examples of voluntary forfeiture of one’s grandfathered rate would be if an employee refuses training for an upgrade on the shift, bids on a posted lower-rated job, accepts a request for transfer to a lower-rated job, bumps to a lower-rated job, or chooses a lower labor grade when offered a choice between two (2) or more levels.
Employees must continue to qualify to receive “premiums”.
Paragraphs 73 and 76 of the current Labor Agreement will apply to employees who forfeit their grandfathered rate, as well as to all employees hired after June 15,1993.
Security of Amendment
The intent of this Agreement is to grandfather current employees with regard to current wage rate and establish a new wage structure that, in time, will lower the cost structure within the La Crosse manufacturing operation.
To that end, upward adjustments in wages for the grandfathered wage schedules and the new wage structure (Schedule E) will be subject to future labor contract negotiations with the following two (2) qualifications:
1.	From the effective date of the Amendment, the Company will not ask for any downward adjustments to any
135
grandfathered wage schedule or labor grade of the current Labor Agreement for the next ten (10) years.
2.	From the effective date of this Amendment, the Union will not ask for any changes to the intent of the new wage and ' (abor grade structure for the next ten (10) years.

ATTENDANCE POLICY GUIDELINES UPDATE AND RELATED POLICIES & PROCEDURES
Please note, when the Company considers excusing absences/ tardiness, which are not defined as “excusable absences”, under the Labor Agreement’s Attendance Policy, the Company and the Union jointly agree the absences/tardiness are considered on a case by case basis, and if excused, are excused on a non-precedent setting basis. The employee’s attendance record is included in the consideration process.
1)	All employees must notify the Company when they are going
to be either absent or tardy. Notification must be made prior to the start of the shift by calling the Employee Absence Reporting System (EARS), using a touch-tone phone, on (608) 737-2142. Please note that all absences and tardiness must be reported on EARS even it employees notify other Company representatives about either their absences or tardiness. ALL CALLS MUST BE COMPLETED AND SAVED PER THE PROCEDURE, Employee must stay on the line until the system says the call has been saved. If you do not have a touch-tone phone, call (608) 787-4882 to report either your absence or tardy. Note, only the current day and next day can be reported. Employees should also inform their Supervisor ahead of time whenever they know they will be either absent or tardy. If an employee does not give notification prior to the start of their shift, then the absence is an unexcused “no report”. If an employee is going to be tardy, notification must be made prior to the start of the shift on EARS, otherwise it is an unexcused “no report”.
Emergency situations will be handled on a case by case, non-precedent setting basis.
Employees that are going to be absent from work for one workweek (seven calendar days) or less may schedule the time
143
away from work with Human Resources by going on an approved leave of absence. In such cases, employees are required to: (a) schedule a time to meet, outside of the employee's shift, where practicable, on their own time, with a Human Resources Representative, (b) submit documentation acceptable to the Company in advance of the absence to Human Resources, and (c) receive approval by a Human Resources Representative to be away from work. Upon receiving advanced approval from a.Human Resource Representative, daily absence reporting is not required.
Ail work related absences must be reported and handled in accordance with the Attendance Policy.
Employees must go on a leave of absence after missing in excess of one (1) workweek. Once an employee is on an approved leave of absence, through Human Resources, then the daily reporting is not required. Also, employees returning to work from a medical leave of absence, or a leave that does not have a predetermined return date, must first come to Human Resources with the return to work authorization/documentation before returning to their job.
2)	It is the employee’s responsibility to provide the Company acceptable documentation to be considered for excused time away from work. Employees have five working days, of their work schedule, beginning the date of their return to work to provide documentation to cover the absence/tardy. If the absence is for an entire shift, then the documentation must indicate that the employee be excused for the entire shift. For example, if an employee has a doctor's appointment, the employee would not normally be excused for the entire shift unless the doctor’s slip identifies that the employee is medically unable to work and should be excused for the entire shift. Whenever possible, personal appointments should be made during off shift times.
144
tt is the employee’s responsibility to get the documentation directly to Human Resource’s (Building 13-1) 1700 Horton St La Crosse, Wl 54601 or other address as communicated, within the time guidelines. There are two locked boxes located by Human Resources for drop off. One is at the H.R. window and the other is outside at the East entrance to Building 13-1. All deliveries are to be done on the employee’s own time.
“OriginaF documentation is required to be submitted to Human Resources, not copies of the original.
3)	Employees are required to see the doctor on the first day of the illness to be excused. The three (3) exceptions are:
A)	For consecutive days of illness, if an employee cannot see the doctor on the first day due to the illness and sees the doctor on the second day, then it is excused if acceptable documentation is provided per the guidelines. In these cases the doctor must specifically identify that due to medical reasons, the employee was unable to work and missed the first day due to illness.
B)	If an employee cannot see the doctor on the first day due to the illness and is not sick the second day, and, the employee sees the doctor on the second day, the previous sick day may be excused if acceptable documentation is provided per the guidelines. Also, in these cases, the doctor must specifically identify that due to medical reasons the employee was unable to work and missed the first day due to the illness. The employee must see the doctor on the second day on their own time.
C)	If an employee is sick the last day of their work schedule, and is too sick to see the doctor on that day, the employee may see the doctor the following day providing acceptable documentation is provided per the guidelines. Also in these cases, the doctor must specifically identify that
145
due to medical reasons the employee was unable to work the previous day due to the illness. The employee must see the doctor on their own time.
Employees should schedule medical appointments during off shift times or at the start or the end of their shifts whenever possible.
4)	It is the employee’s responsibility to be at work in time to clock in and to be on their job and ready to begin work at the start of the shift. Furthermore, it is the employee’s responsibility to work up to the end of their shift and clock out as soon as possible after their shift ends. If an employee plans on leaving work, it is the employee's responsibility to obtain permission from Supervision before punching out otherwise the employee is leaving the plant without permission. Such permission will not be unreasonably withheld.
Note, “on the button'* punches are tardy.
The Trane Company time clock is the "basis of standard” for all Trane Company time and Attendance Policies and Procedures.
5)	If employees have problems clocking in or out at their designated clock, it is their responsibility to go to the next nearest clock and again repeat the clocking process. If the second clocking does not take, the employee must notify their-Supervisor immediately. Supervision is to then check out the problem with the employee. If there is a system or power failure, employees are to contact their Supervisor (or Steward if the Supervisor is not available) to report the system is down.
Note: Security access into a building or plant is not part of the time and attendance system. To be considered at work, and on time, employees must punch-in using the time clock system. Access into the building does not fulfill the clocking procedures as outlined in the Labor Agreement.
146
6)	Voluntary, non-mandatorv and extra curricular activities are not excusable absences. Mandatory meetings for such activities as parent-teacher conferences are excused provided the employee follows the Attendance Policy requirements.

Employees will be paid double-time if scheduled to work on a day observed as a Birthday Holiday, scheduled or non-scheduled (as identified above), provided the employee advises their Supervisor that the day requested to be worked is being observed as a Birthday Holiday, therefore paid at double-time, for that employee prior to the employee being scheduled to work. Consistent with past practice, if an employee inadvertently works their Birthday Holiday, or is on vacation, or is being required to work, the entire week in which the birthday occurs, the employee will be able to reschedule the Birthday Holiday to the next soonest day as approved by Supervision, based on production needs.
Other: If an employee’s birthday falls on a day being observed as a holiday, the Birthday Holiday will be considered as occurring on the employee’s following workday.

11)	Negotiated vacation language changes allow for all vacation time to be taken in single day increments. As a reminder, the intent behind half (1/2), single, and random day vacation is so employees can utilize vacation time for personal business and emergencies, while at the same time ensuring consistent weekly checks.
Regarding “Random Dav” Vacation: For all employees, vacation time is converted into hours in accordance with the
150
Labor Agreement. Employees on the Variable shift, who qualify per the Labor Agreement, are entitled to four (4) days ten (10) hour shifts of “random" vacation while employees on the Capacity shift who qualify per the Labor Agreement, are entitled to have three (3) days twelve (12) hour shifts - charged at 13.3334 hours per shift of “random" vacation.

Carry over vacation is not considered part of the eighty (80) hours “entitlement”. As a point of clarification, employees are not entitled to random vacation days unless they are entitled to two (2) weeks’ vacation, not including carry over vacation.
All “random" day vacations must be reported (completed and saved) on the EARS system prior to the start of the shift, otherwise, it is an unexcused “no report".
Regarding Half-Dav (1/2) Vacation Language: All half-day (1/2) vacations must be pre-scheduled per the Labor Agreement for all shifts. Employees that are eligible for haff-day (1/2) vacation may split up to three (3) days of vacation into half (1/2) days. The Variable shift may split three (3) days’ vacation into six (6) half-day (1/2) vacations (one half-day (1/2) equals five (5) hours vacation). The Capacity shift may split three (3) days vacation into six (6) half-day (1/2) vacations at the accelerated rate, (one half-day equals 6.67 hours of vacation, one (1) day equals 13.3334 hours of vacation, and three (3) days equals forty (40) hours of vacation.) The Monday through
151
Friday schedule may split three (3) days vacation into six (6) half-day (1/2) vacations (one half-day (1/2) equals four (4) hours of vacation).
To be eligible for half (1/2) day vacations, an employee must have met the vacation entitlement requirements identified in the Labor Agreement and have three (3) or more years of service. Half day (1/2) vacations must be pre-scheduled with the employee’s Supervisor per the Labor Agreement, Employees that become entitled to two (2) weeks vacation, as the result of an anniversary date are eligible for half day (1/2) vacation increments.

12)	Perfect Attendance: Perfect Attendance by definition and policy will remain - as perfect. Employees are required to have perfect attendance for all scheduled work, including overtime shifts. As in the past, employees on paid vacation, holidays, bereavement, and jury duty, as defined in the Labor Agreement, are not scheduled for work therefore, such absences do not impact Perfect Attendance.
