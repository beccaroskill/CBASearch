The parties acknowledge that it is in the union's interest that it be granted access to University facilities for the purposes of ascertaining whether the terms of this Agreement are being met; engaging in the investigation, preparation, and adjustment of grievances; conducting union meetings; explaining to bargaining unit members their rights and responsibilities under the Agreement; and informing bargaining unit employees of union activities. In the interest of facilitating these purposes, and in accordance with local campus/Laboratory/hospital procedures, the parties agree to this Article.

2.	UPTE will furnish the University with a written list of all UPTE representatives, UPTE designated employee representatives and officers who are authorized by the union to conduct union business. This list shall be maintained in a timely manner by UPTE and any changes, additions or deletions to the list must be made in writing to the University.

C.	EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES
1.	The University shall recognize UPTE designated employee representatives who are members of the bargaining unit.

2.	For the purposes of receiving paid release time as provided in this section, UPTE may designate four (4) unit employees as "UPTE designated employee representatives" at each campus/Laboratory/hospital. Additionally, in the event a campus/hospital/ laboratory has more than two-hundred employees, UPTE may designate one (1) additional UPTE-designated employee representative for each additional one hundred (100) bargaining unit members thereafter, up to a maximum of seven (7) UPTE-designated employee representatives. UPTE shall not designate more than one (1) UPTE designated employee
DRAFT COPY - Subject to Edits - Pending Final Review by UC and UPTE
representative per department of 100 employees or less. For each additional 100 employees, or fraction thereof, in a department UPTE shall be allowed one (1) additional representative in that department.
a.	The total cumulative use of paid release time for the UPTE designated employee representative shall be limited to ten (10) hours in any one (1) month. University-convened meetings pursuant to Article 10, Grievance Procedure, shall not be deducted from this block of time.

d.	At its sole discretion, the University may authorize use of release time for more than ten (10) hours in a month per department. The exercise of this discretion and/or the enforcement by the University of the ten (10) hour maximum shall under no circumstances establish a precedent for the UPTE designated employee representative or department involved nor shall the allowance of greater than ten (10) hours in a month for a UPTE designated employee representative have any effect or bearing on the ability of the University to enforce the ten (10) hour maximum on any other UPTE designated employee representative.
e.	Should a question of possible abuse of these release time provisions arise, the University will so notify UPTE, and the parties will attempt to resolve the matter. If a question remains, the University may take corrective action when warranted.
f.	In the event that release time granted under Section C.2.a. above is not sufficient for the representative’s duties and additional time is not granted under Section C.2.d above, the employee representative may elect to use vacation time in accordance with Article 43, Vacation, or leave without pay in accordance with Article 17, Leaves for Union Business.

All arbitrability disputes, substantive or procedural, shall be subject to arbitration under this Article 3 including disputes arising from University claims that UPTE has lost the right to pursue arbitration of a pending grievance because of untimely processing or that the grievance is ineligible for further processing.
8.	The process set forth herein to pursue an arbitrability hearing when the University claims that UPTE has failed to select an arbitrator in a timely manner shall be the exclusive process for such purpose, superceding and/or replacing any other claimed process.

1.	Unless there is an agreement by both parties to modify the scope of the hearing, the issue(s) to be heard by the arbitrator shall solely and in its entirety be restricted to the issue(s) stated by Step 3.

2.	When practicable, the University shall inform UPTE in writing of its intent to assert the issue of arbitrability prior to the selection of the arbitrator in its Acknowledgement of receipt, according to A.8.b above. The issue(s) of arbitrability shall be resolved in a hearing prior to and separate from the hearing (if any) about the substantive facts and/or allegations in dispute, except as provided in Section E.3., below. In such case, the parties shall use the selection process described in Section D above to select two arbitrators. The first arbitrator will be selected to hear the issues of arbitrability, and the second arbitrator will be selected to decide the merits of the case if the issues are determined to be arbitrable. Unless either party requests a full and complete arbitration proceeding on the arbitrability issue, the first arbitrator shall issue either a bench decision, or upon either party's request, a written decision within seven (7) calendar days of the completion of the arbitrability hearing. In the event that the first arbitrator, as a result of the hearing referenced above determines a matter to be arbitrable, the first arbitrator shall have no authority to decide the issues pursuant to the merits of the case. A hearing on the merits of the case will be scheduled with the second arbitrator, unless the parties agree otherwise.
3.	If, following the University's acknowledgement of UPTE's appeal to arbitration in A.8.b, the University raises for the first time issue(s) of arbitrability a single hearing on the issue of arbitrability and the substantive facts will be held, unless the parties agree otherwise. If the arbitrator finds the grievance to be not arbitrable, the substantive facts of the case need not be heard and the grievance shall be denied. If the arbitrator finds in favor of arbitrability, the hearing shall proceed to the substantive issues raised.
4.	Section E.1. and Section E.2. above shall not prevent the parties from agreeing in writing to combine the arbitrability hearing with the hearing on the merits of the case.
5.	If the union requests a postponement of the scheduled arbitration hearing following the University's raising issue(s) of arbitrability, the hearings on arbitrability and facts, if any, shall be separate, and the provisions of Section E.3. above, shall apply.
F.	ARBITRATION PROCEEDING
1.	The parties will attempt to agree on a location for the arbitration hearing.
2.	The arbitration hearing shall be closed to anyone other than the participants in the

6.	The arbitrator shall consider the evidence presented and render a written decision within thirty (30) calendar days of the close of the record of the hearing.
7.	In all cases appealed to arbitration pursuant to the terms of this Article and this Agreement, UPTE has the burden of initiating the steps in the procedure. With the exception of those cases in which the issue is that of actions taken by the University pursuant to Article 7 -Corrective Action / Discipline and Dismissal, UPTE shall have the burden of proof. The burden of proof in cases in which the issue is that of actions taken by the University pursuant to Article 7 - Corrective Action / Discipline and Dismissal, shall be the University's.
8.	Prior to the hearing, the parties may endeavor to exchange the names of known witnesses and relevant materials to be introduced at the hearing.
G.	AUTHORITY OF THE ARBITRATOR
1.	The arbitrator's authority shall be limited to determining whether the University has violated the provision(s) of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, amend, modify, nullify or ignore in any way the provisions of this Agreement and shall not make any award which would, in effect, grant UPTE or the employee(s) any terms which were not obtained in the negotiation process.
2.	The arbitrator shall have the authority to subpoena documents and to require the attendance of witnesses upon the reasonable request of either party but not upon his/her own motion.
3.	The expense of service and appearance fees, if any, shall be borne entirely by the party requesting the subpoena of witnesses and each party shall, in advance of the hearing date, inform the other party of the identity of witnesses it subpoenaed.

E.	LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY
A.	Position-related programs are directly related to the work assignments or conditions of the employee’s current position. In improving performance or mastering responsibilities in the present job, the supervisor takes the lead by identifying development objectives along with corresponding action plans. This is done in conjunction with the employee performance evaluation process. All career employees are eligible for position-related programs. Employees in non-career appointments are eligible for position-related programs only when such training is specifically necessary for such employees to perform their respective assignments.
B.	Career-related programs are related to the development of skills, knowledge, and other qualifications that prepare an employee for other positions within the Laboratory for] which an employee (as evaluated by the supervisor, department head, and Human Resources Operations Manager or designee) might be an effective competitor. In career planning and development, the employee takes the lead by self-assessing skills, values, career interests, and choices. After completion of the self-assessment, the employee discusses with the supervisor areas of interest to be developed. The supervisor is encouraged to act as the coach and advisor to the employee, helping to map out agreed-on developmental objectives along with corresponding action plans. All career employees are eligible for career-related programs. Employees in non-career appointments are not eligible for career-related programs.
C.	Educational enrichment programs are related to an employee’s personal or career interests outside the Laboratory that are not related to Laboratory positions for which an employee might be an effective competitor. For example, a course such as music would be considered an educational enrichment program. Educational enrichment programs are the employee’s responsibility and are not eligible for benefits under this policy.
D.	Attendance at all courses, seminars, and conferences of an instructional nature given by accredited universities and colleges, institutes, professional associations, and commercial training organizations is considered part of the Laboratory’s education and training activities and may be part of a formal employee development plan. For administrative purposes, attendance at scientific meetings, professional society meetings, research conferences, and industrial conventions and shows is considered a work assignment and is not necessarily part of a development plan.
E.	Every career employee is eligible to request a formal development plan. A formal development plan is developed by the employee and his/her supervisor and should be realistic and state job or career goals that are attainable within the Laboratory’s job classification structure. Plans should be structured so that completion of the development program should result in greater employee capability. Formal plans often include a time frame longer than one year. When an employee takes
DRAFT COPY - Subject to Edits - Pending Final Review by UC and UPTE
	three or more Laboratory-supported courses or training programs in a fiscal year, the development plan must be formalized by using the Employee Development Plan form. At a minimum, the plan should include developmental objectives and corresponding action plans for improving or mastering performance in the current position, qualifying for other Laboratory positions, or obtaining a specific degree or specialty certificate of value to the Laboratory's mission.
F.	On-Site Training: A division director or department head is responsible for arranging specialized training with a department or division. Assistance or advice in any phase of a desired program may be obtained from the Training Administrator in the Human Resources Department. Various organizational units within the Laboratory, including the Environment, Health and Safety Division, Computing Sciences Directorate, and Human Resources Department, are responsible for developing and/or providing training programs to Laboratory employees in their areas of expertise and that are required by law or will enhance employee performance. Procedures for attending interdepartmental training may be found on the Employee Self Service Web site. The Workforce Diversity Office is responsible for administering apprenticeship training programs, other special skills training, and internships.
G.	Off-Site Training: With the approval of his or her supervisor and department head or division director, an employee may attend off-site training (e.g., outside seminars and workshops) that will be of direct benefit to the employee's assignment. The division director or department head will approve attendance at off-site training only when the benefits to the Laboratory will, in his or her judgment, more than offset the costs involved, when the required skill or knowledge is not readily available through Laboratory training resources, and when the employee's time away from the Laboratory will not adversely impact current work demands. The division will pay course fees, travel, and all other expenses as necessary.
H.	College Degrees, Specialty Certificates, and College Level Courses: Career employees who have passed probation may take college-level, specialty certificate, and continuing education courses as described below. Satisfactory job performance is a prerequisite to participation in these Tier 1 and Tier 2 programs. The employee must have an Employee Development Plan approved by his or her supervisor, division director, or the Operations Department Head, and the Human Resources Operations Manager or designee. Approval is based on: •	Relevance to the Laboratory’s mission •	Mutual benefit to the employee's career and the long-term interests of the Laboratory •	Whether there is a reasonable expectation that the employee shall remain in the employ of the Laboratory for a sufficient period of time to provide a fair return for the training costs •	Whether the proposed curriculum and timetable are realistic •	Whether the department/division’s work needs can be met during any employee absences due to attending class Employees may be reimbursed as noted below for tuition, laboratory fees, educational fees, and other fees required for registration when the employee submits proof of successful course completion and receipts for payment of fees to the Training Administrator in the Human Resources Department. Nonresident tuition is not reimbursable. Successful completion is receipt of a grade of at least a “C” for undergraduate work or “B” for graduate work if the institution uses the “A-F” system of grading. If there is a choice between receiving a letter grade or a “Pass/Fail” evaluation, the employee must take the letter grade. Reimbursement is also allowed when an employee is forced to withdraw from a course because of work requirements, provided he/she submits evidence from the instructor that the employee’s work in the course was satisfactory at the time of forced withdrawal. When necessary, the Human Resources Operations Manager or designee may advance payment of the costs provided the employee agrees to return the payment if the employee is unable to provide evidence of satisfactory completion. Employees who are eligible for the University of California Reduced-Fee Enrollment Benefit must take advantage of that benefit. Employees who terminate employment before the end of the quarter or semester are not eligible for reimbursement of fees unless the termination is due to an involuntary layoff and when the employee was notified of layoff after the beginning of the class. Employees whose fees have been paid through an advance agreement must repay the advance at termination. Time off with pay may be granted when the employee’s absence will not adversely affect progress of work, in accordance with the following provisions: •	The employee must remain in career status during the entire quarter or semester. •	The course or courses must be listed on the Employee Development Plan and approved before registration for each academic quarter or semester. •	Time off to attend and register for approved courses may be allowed only when such courses cannot reasonably be taken outside the employee's scheduled working hours.
DRAFT COPY - Subject to Edits - Pending Final Review by UC and UPTE
•	Time off with pay may not exceed six hours per week, including time for travel and registration. Time off with pay is not allowed for study, library, or faculty consultation time. Additional time required must be accounted for by an adjusted work schedule or by use of vacation credit.
•	Time off with pay to take Web/Internet based courses is not allowed.
1.	Tier 1:
College-level courses leading to an academic degree (A.A., B.S., Ph.D., etc.) or a specialty certificate (Certified Compensation Professional, Certified Cisco Network Technician, Integrated Circuit Engineering, etc.). Degree courses must be offered by an accredited college or university. Specialty certificate courses must be offered by an accredited college or university, university extension program, or recognized professional society. Continuing education units (CEUs) may be reimbursed under Tier 1 when they are part of an approved degree or specialty certificate program. These may be either position- or career-related programs. The employee must exhibit satisfactory progress towards attainment of the degree or certificate for continued eligibility under Tier 1, with the understanding that unanticipated department/division work needs may affect that progress. Employees may be reimbursed 100% for tuition, laboratory fees, educational fees, and other fees required for registration when the employee submits proof of successful course completion and receipts for payment of fees to the Training Administrator in the Human Resources Department.
2.	Tier 2:
Career-related academic programs not leading to an academic degree or a specialty certificate. Courses must be offered by an accredited college or university. Continuing education units (CEUs) may be reimbursed under Tier 2 only when offered by a university or college continuing education program. Employees may be reimbursed two-thirds for tuition, laboratory fees, educational fees, and other fees required for registration when the employee submits proof of successful course completion and receipts for payment of fees to the Training Administrator in the Human Resources Department.
I.	Government Licensing and/or Professional Certification:
For the purposes of this section, government licenses and/or professional certifications are those licenses and certifications required by the employee to hold his or her current position as documented in the position description. Continuing education credit (CEU) courses required for the maintenance of a professional license or certification as noted above are considered position-related courses. The course must be approved by the licensing or certifying agency. The request for course fee reimbursement is the same as for all other position-related training. Fees for license or certifications renewals as defined above are an allowable expenditure. The request is made in writing to the Financial Services Department and must include:
•	Request for Issuance of Check form with valid project ID and approval;
•	Endorsement by the cognizant division director that the cost is allowable as cited; and
•	Copy of the license renewal or issuance documentation.
J.	Professional Research or Teaching Leave
1.	To promote the continuing professional growth and competence of senior administrative and scientific staff members, the Laboratory Director may, with prior written approval of DOE, grant Professional Research or Teaching Leave to a limited number of employees. Approval and recommendation from the division director are obtained before submitting the request to the Laboratory Director. DOE approval for such leave will be based on evidence that the Laboratory will benefit from the proposed work and that the candidate will continue employment with the Berkeley Lab or another DOE-funded employer for a reasonable period following the leave. The leave may be spent at appropriate institutions either within or outside the United States.
2.	Qualifications:
The candidate must have outstanding professional ability and propose a firm plan of study, teaching, or research that is clearly relevant to the interests of the Laboratory and within the individual’s competence.

Failure by UPTE to reactivate the grievance within the ninety (90) day time limit (except in the case of sexual harassment where it shall be one-hundred-eighty (180) days) following agreement by the parties that it be held in abeyance will render the grievance ineligible for arbitration and the last preceding University written answer shall become final.
D.	GRIEVANTS WHO HAVE RESIGNED
Grievants who voluntarily resign or retire their employment with the University shall have their pending grievances immediately withdrawn and will not benefit by any subsequent settlement or disposition of any individual, union, or group grievance.
DRAFT COPY - Subject to Edits - Pending Final Review by UC and UPTE
However, if the group or union grievance is related to the implementation of a compensation provision negotiated in a UC/UPTE Agreement, the grievance may be continued if it has moved to Step 2 before the date of the employees' resignation or retirement. The foregoing provision shall not apply to LBNL.
E.	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE - INFORMAL REVIEW
Before commencing the formal grievance procedure, an individual employee, or group of employees, with or without their representative, may first attempt to resolve informally the grievance with the immediate supervisor.
F.	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE - FORMAL REVIEW
1.	Step 1:
a.	All grievances (individual, group, or union) must be filed either by U.S. mail or hand delivery, and received by the Labor Relations Office at the campus/hospital/laboratory which employs the grievant(s) within 30 calendar days after the date on which the employee or UPTE knew or could be expected to know of the event or action giving rise to the grievance. Informal attempts of settlement to resolve shall not extend time limits including the initial thirty (30) day filing limit.
b.	Grievances received after the filing deadline will be processed solely for the purposes of determining whether the grievance was untimely. Any formal grievance which is not received in accordance with Section F.1., or this section, shall be reviewed only in accordance with the review procedures in Section Q.
c.	University Review:
1)	The University's written response will be issued to the grievant and the representative, if any, within fifteen (15) calendar days after the formal grievance is filed. If the response is not issued within this time limit, or if the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the grievance may proceed to Step 2.
2)	Resolution of the grievance at Step 1 or earlier, although final, shall not be precedent-setting.
d.	Sexual Harassment Complaint Resolution Procedures:
1)	An employee alleging sexual harassment may elect to substitute a campus/hospital/laboratory Sexual Harassment Complaint Resolution Procedure for Step 1 of the Grievance Procedure. An employee who elects to use the Sexual Harassment Complaint Resolution Procedure may return to the grievance procedure only if they filed a grievance within the thirty (30) day time limit for filing. An employee who elects to resume the regular grievance procedure in place of the Sexual Harassment Complaint Resolution Procedure shall do so by sending written notice to the University. The University's Step 1 Grievance response will be issued within fifteen (15) calendar days after the notice is received by the designated University official. If the second step of the grievance is not invoked by the grievant or UPTE, the University will hold the grievance in abeyance for up to one-hundred-eighty (180) days.
2)	Grievances that allege a violation involving sexual harassment may, at the grievant’s option, enter the grievance procedure at Step 2.
3)	If no report issues from the sexual harassment process or the employee elects to use the sexual harassment process and for any reason the grievance is in abeyance for more than one-hundred-eighty (180) days, the case will be considered withdrawn by the grievant, unless expressly confirmed in writing to be in abeyance. Any request for extension of the abeyance will be subject to new deadlines pursuant to this Section.
2.	Step 2
a.	If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the grievant or the Union may proceed to Step 2 by filing a written appeal with the Labor Relations Office within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date the written response is issued or, if not issued, is due.
b.	Unless the parties agree otherwise, the designated University local official shall convene a meeting with the grievant(s) and the grievant's representative, if any, to attempt to resolve the grievance. The meeting shall be convened no later than
DRAFT COPY - Subject to Edits - Pending Final Review by UC and UPTE
fifteen (15) calendar days following receipt of the appeal to Step 2. During the Step 2 meeting, the parties shall discuss information and contentions relative to the grievance.
c.	During the Step 2 process, the parties may agree in writing to amend the alleged violations stated in the original grievance.
d.	If requested by the grievant, a second UPTE representative may participate in the Step 2 meeting. In the event a second UPTE representative attends, only one representative may actively participate in the grievance meeting, and the University shall pay release time for only one representative.
e.	If a grievance that alleges a violation of Article 7 - Corrective Action/Discipline and Dismissal only is not satisfactorily resolved at Step 2, UPTE may appeal directly to arbitration in accordance with Article 3 - Arbitration Procedure.
f.	A written decision shall be issued within fifteen (15) calendar days following the Step 2 meeting, or receipt of the Step 2 appeal if it is agreed that no meeting will be held.
3.	Step 3
a.	All grievances that are not satisfactorily resolved at Step 2 may be appealed to Step 3. The appeal must be filed with the Director of Labor Relations in the Office of the President within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date the University’s Step 2 written answer was issued or, if no University answer was issued, within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date the University’s answer was due.
b.	The Step 3 appeal shall identify all unresolved issues, alleged violations and remedies and shall be signed and dated by the grievant or their representative. The subject of the grievance as stated at Step 2 shall constitute the sole and entire subject matter of the appeal to Step 3.
c.	The Office of the President Office of Labor Relations official shall issue the University's written answer to a Step 3 appeal within thirty (30) calendar days of the receipt of the appeal. The answer will be issued to the grievant when selfrepresented, or to the employee’s representative.
d.	By mutual agreement between the University and UPTE, Step 3 may also be the first step in the Grievance Procedure when UPTE is filing a grievance on behalf of employees at more than one location. Such a grievance must be filed within thirty (30) calendar days of the action that gave rise to the grievance and follow all other requirements of Section A.3 - Filing, above.
4.	Appeals to Arbitration
If an appeal to arbitration is not postmarked or hand delivered within thirty (30) calendar days of the issuance of the University's Step 3 answer, Section C of this Article shall apply.
G.	UNION GRIEVANCES
UPTE shall have the right to present grievances under this procedure on behalf of an individual employee, on behalf of a group of employees, or on behalf of itself. It shall be the Union’s responsibility to inform an employee that it is bringing a grievance.
H.	GROUP GRIEVANCE
A group grievance is defined as a grievance that covers more than one employee, and that involves like circumstances and facts. A group grievance must be so identified on the grievance form at Step 1. If an employee wishes to withdraw from a group grievance represented by UPTE, the employee shall notify UPTE. UPTE shall in turn notify the University in writing if the employee is to be withdrawn.
I.	CONSOLIDATION OF GRIEVANCES
Grievances of two or more employees, as well as multiple grievances by or related to the same employee, or which relate to the same incident, issue, alleged violation, facts, or course of conduct, may be consolidated. Consolidation or severance of grievances shall occur by mutual written agreement.
J.	OFFERS OF SETTLEMENT
DRAFT COPY - Subject to Edits - Pending Final Review by UC and UPTE
Settlement offers made at any stage of this procedure, including informal resolution, shall not be introduced as evidence in subsequent steps, and shall not be precedent setting.
K.	RETROACTIVITY
Settlement of grievances may or may not be retroactive as equities of a particular case may demand. In any case where it is determined that the settlement shall be applied retroactively, except for the correction of mathematical, calculation, recording or accounting errors relating to the payment of wages, the maximum period of retroactivity allowed shall not in any case be made retroactive to a date earlier than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the initiation of the written grievance in Step 1.
L.	EXCLUSIVE PROCEDURE
The Grievance Procedure set out in this Article shall be exclusive and shall replace any other grievance procedure for adjustment of any disputes arising from the alleged violation of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated within this Agreement, any previous grievance procedure or other procedure in existence or adopted by the University shall not apply to employees covered by this Agreement for any purposes whatsoever.
M.	RELEASE TIME AND PAY STATUS FOR GRIEVANTS, EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES AND/OR WITNESSES
1.	University-Convened Meetings
a.	If the University convenes a meeting involving the parties to a grievance for the purposes of resolving the grievance and/or completing the steps of the Grievance Procedure, the grievant(s), witness(es), if any, and UPTE-designated employee representatives eligible to attend such meeting pursuant to this article and Article 1 - Access, Section C. shall be in without-loss-of-straight-time-pay status during the meeting provided:
1)	such meeting occurs during the regularly scheduled hours of work of the grievant(s), UPTE-designated employee representative, and/or witness(es); and
2)	advance request is made and approval is received from the supervisor of the grievant(s), the witness(es), and/or the UPTE-designated employee representative. Approval to attend shall be made on an operational needs basis and shall not be unreasonably denied.
b.	A grievant or the representative may request the availability of bargaining unit employee witnesses for University-convened grievance meetings. The availability of bargaining unit employee witnesses shall be determined by their immediate supervisor(s) on the basis of operational needs, and such requests shall not be denied unreasonably. Witnesses shall be in a without-loss-of-straight-time-pay status if the information they provide pertains to the subject of the grievance and the criteria enumerated above (Section M.1.a.1. and Section M.1.a.2.) are met. Grievants and UPTE agree that every effort shall be made to avoid the presentation of repetitive witnesses and the absence of any or all witnesses shall not require the meeting to be recessed or postponed.
c.	The University is not responsible for any travel or lodging expenses or any other expenses incurred by the representative, grievant or union witnesses.
d.	Paid release time for UPTE designated employee representatives for purposes other than University convened meetings shall be provided in accordance with Article 1 - Access.

Records involving the processing of an employee's grievance, such as the grievance form, step appeals/responses, and settlement documents, will be kept in a file separate from the employee’s personnel file. It is not the intent of this section to exclude from the employee's personnel file final disciplinary action documents, including those that result from a settlement agreement.
Q.	REVIEW OF GRIEVANCES CLOSED FOR PROCEDURAL DEFECTS
When the University determines a grievance is ineligible for further processing due to procedural defects, including but not limited to timeliness, UPTE may make a written appeal to the Office of the President Labor Relations within thirty (30) days of the postmark of the notification to the grievant(s). This appeal is solely limited to a review of the procedural issue(s). If the Office of the President denies this appeal UPTE may appeal the issue of the closure of the grievance directly to arbitration per Article 3, Arbitration, within thirty (30) calendar days of the issuance of the denial of the appeal.

Employees are expected to work overtime when such work is assigned.
b.	The University will assign overtime work by rotation based on departmental seniority of those employees on the same shift who normally perform the work involved. For purposes of this Article, rotation means that the last employee to work overtime will be the last considered for new overtime assignments. For the purposes of this Article, departmental seniority may be defined by each department at the campus/hospital/laboratory. Such seniority is applied in the following manner:
1)	When there are employees volunteering to work the overtime, assignment of that overtime shall be based on greatest seniority, provided the employee(s) have the required skills, knowledge and ability to do the job.
2)	When no employee volunteers to work the overtime, assignment of that overtime shall be based on inverse order of seniority, provided the least senior employee has the skills, knowledge and ability necessary to perform the job.
c.	The University shall assign overtime to employees irrespective of their place on the seniority or rotation list(s) when the necessary skills, knowledge or abilities are not possessed by the employee who would otherwise be assigned in accordance with the above provisions.
9.	Overtime Definition
Overtime is time actually worked that exceeds forty (40) hours in a workweek. For the purposes of calculating overtime, actual work does not include time in non-work status such as sick leave pay, vacation pay, holiday pay, military leave, compensatory time off and administrative leave with pay. Overtime hours do not count toward accumulation of sick leave, vacation, holiday or retirement system credit. Overtime hours are not compensated at one and one-half times the straight time rate unless the conditions described in Section B.10. below, are met.
10.	Overtime Compensation
At the option of the University, overtime shall be compensated at the appropriate rate either by pay or by compensatory time off, if the department offers a compensatory time program, in accordance with this section.
a.	Unless the employee and the University agree otherwise, overtime will be paid. An employee may, upon hire and thereafter during the month of June, file a written indication of preference for either compensatory time off or pay with his or her immediate supervisor. The University shall grant the preference indicated. If no preference is indicated to the department in the annual June period for changes, the employee’s previous election shall continue.
b.	Compensatory time shall be paid or scheduled by the University in accordance with departmental needs. Accumulation of compensatory time is limited to a maximum of two hundred forty (240) hours. An employee shall be paid for hours of overtime which exceed this limit in accordance with location practice. An employee may request to schedule the use of compensatory time. An employee's request for the scheduling of compensatory time shall be granted subject to the needs of the University and shall not be unreasonably denied.

c.	Employees in classes designated as non-exempt in Appendices A. and B. of this Agreement are eligible for overtime at one and one-half times the straight-time rate (OT(P)) Code (N) shall be compensated at the straight-time rate for hours of overtime not exceeding forty (40) hours of actual work in a workweek and shall be compensated at one and one-half times the straight-time rate only for those overtime hours which exceed forty (40) hours of actual work in a workweek.
d.	When an employee is employed at more than one rate of pay, overtime earned at the time-and-one-half rate may be calculated based on the employee's average hourly rate or based on the rate in effect when the overtime is worked, at the option of the University.
11.	Call-Back
When an employee is called back to work after completing a work day and leaving the premises, the employee shall be paid for the time actually worked upon return or a minimum of three hours, whichever is greater. Call-back time, whether worked or not, is considered time worked for the purpose of calculating hours of overtime.
12.	On-Call
The University retains the right to determine the need for, and the assignment of, on-call time. An employee is not considered in on-call status unless assigned on-call by the University. Employees in on-call status are required to inform the employer how they can be reached or to carry a pager in order to receive a call to work. An employee in on-call status is not eligible for minimum call-back payments. An employee in on-call status who is called to perform work or to return to the work site will be paid at the regular rate of pay for the time worked. Payment for on-call time paid at the on-call rate is included as part of compensation in calculating the regular rate when determining premium overtime pay.
a.	Unrestricted on-call is time during which an employee is free to engage in activities for their own purposes but is required to be available for work or timely return to the work site when called to work. Time in unrestricted on-call status is not counted as hours worked or time on regular pay status when employees are not required to be at the work location or to actually perform work from a location other than the work location. Unrestricted on-call will be compensated at the on-call rate, as listed in Appendix A.
b.	Restricted on-call is time during which the employee is required to restrict personal activities so that time cannot be effectively used for their own purposes. Restricted on-call will be considered hours worked and will be paid at the employee's normal pay rate (or overtime if appropriate).
c.	If the University proposes to establish an on-call rate for a title in the unit at a location where no rate is listed, the University shall meet and confer with UPTE. When employees in this unit at the location are assigned to work on-call, they shall be paid according to Appendix A. Current on-call rates where established will remain the same for the duration of this contract.
13.	Travel Time
Travel between an employee's home and the workplace is not considered time worked. Travel on University business during an employee's normal working hours (including travel during those hours on the employee's day off) is considered time worked. Travel outside normal working hours is considered time worked when it occurs on a scheduled day of work and is to or from a work location outside the normal commuting area of the assigned workplace.
C.	GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.	This Article shall not be construed as a guarantee of or limitation on the number of hours per workday or workweek.
2.	There shall be no duplication, pyramiding, or compounding of any premium wage payments in this Agreement.
3.	The University will provide notice to UPTE (at UCSD) after the research ships return if any bargaining unit members were required to work more than twelve (12) hours consecutively in a twenty-four (24) hour period.

An eligible employee is entitled to up to 26 workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave during a single 12-month leave period. The employee must be a spouse, domestic partner, parent, son, daughter or next of kin of the covered servicemember to be eligible for this type of leave and must meet the eligibility requirements for Family Care and Medical Leave set forth in Section B.2.a.
2.	Definitions
a.	“ Covered servicemember” means (a) a current member of the regular Armed Forces (including a member of the Reserves; a member of the National Guard; or a member of the Armed Forces, the National Guard, or the Reserves who is on the temporary disability retired list) who has a “serious injury or illness” incurred or aggravated in the line of duty on active duty for which he or she is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy; is otherwise in outpatient status; or is on the temporary disability retired list or (b) a veteran of the Armed Forces (including the National Guard or the Reserves), provided that the veteran is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for a “serious injury or illness” that was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty on active duty within five (5) years of the date on which the veteran left the Armed Services.b.

D.	PARTIAL-YEAR APPOINTMENTS
1.
General Provisions
DRAFT COPY - Subject to Edits - Pending Final Review by UC and UPTE
Partial-year appointments are career appointments established with regularly scheduled periods during which the incumbents remain employees but are not at work. These scheduled periods during which employees are not at work are designated as furloughs and are without pay. Furlough periods are not to exceed a total of three (3) months in each calendar year.
When calculating time in pay status during a calendar year the University shall include any period of time for which an employee receives pay for time worked, or for time on paid leave. Paid leave time includes compensatory time off, sick leave, extended sick leave, vacations, holidays, or military leave with pay. Lump-sum payments for terminal vacation do not represent time on pay status.
2.	Pay
Employees with partial-year career appointments may choose either to receive paychecks during pay periods worked only, or to distribute their pay so that they will receive twelve (12) (or the bi-weekly equivalent) paychecks throughout the year. Employees who occupy partial-year career positions and who elect the pay-over-twelve (12) months option must occupy the partial-year career position at least nine (9) months (or the bi-weekly equivalent) before receiving pay during the furlough period.
3.	Benefits
An employee in a designated partial-year career appointment shall be provided the University's contribution to the cost of applicable University-sponsored benefits in accordance with the provisions of Article 4, University Benefits. For health plans which require an employee contribution, employees on furlough must remit the amount of the employee's contributions in accordance with the applicable plan rules to remain in force.
4.	Benefit coverage, including all types of insurance coverage, shall be in accordance with applicable plan rules.
5.	Time on furlough is not qualifying time for vacation leave, sick leave, holiday pay, or service computation for seniority or retirement.
E.	REHIRED RETIREES
Rehired Retirees working in positions covered by this unit will be eligible to elect to waive future retirement accruals to the same extent that other rehired retirees in staff positions are eligible.
F.	LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY
1.	The definitions of career, limited, term and rehired retiree appointments that are currently in effect at the Laboratory shall remain in effect.
2.	When a vacant position is designated as a term appointment, the Laboratory shall provide a notice to UPTE at least five (5) working days before the proposed date of posting. The notice to the union shall include the business reason(s) for the term appointment designation. Upon UPTE’s request, the parties shall meet to discuss the union’s concerns. If a meeting is requested during the notice period but cannot reasonably be scheduled prior to the proposed posting date, posting may be delayed up to two weeks to allow time for such a meeting to occur.
3.	Term appointments apply to staff hired to work on a specified project of clearly limited duration for six (6) months to three (3) years. If the initial appointment is between six (6) and twelve (12) months, the individual must be on a fixed 100% schedule. If the initial appointment is one (1) year or more, the appointment must be fixed at 50% time or more. Time spent in term appointments is cumulative.
4.	Extensions of term appointments beyond three (3) years, to a maximum of five (5) years, will be considered on a case-by-case basis and require an explicit written agreement between LBNL and the President of UPTE local 184 or designee.

7.	The layoff and severance provisions described in Article 16 and Appendix F of this agreement do not apply to term employees.
8.	Employees in term appointments are automatically terminated as of the last day of their appointment unless there is a written notice of extension of the appointment. Employees in term appointments may be terminated before the end of their appointment for disciplinary reasons or substandard performance. The appointment may also be terminated early for lack of funds, lack of work, or changes in operational/business needs in which case, whenever possible, an employee should be given at least 30 days' advance written notice that his/her appointment will be terminated. The early termination of a term appointment is not grievable or arbitrable.
9.	Once a position has been designated as a term appointment per #2 above, the posting of any additional term appointments supporting the same project requires an explicit written agreement between LBNL and the President of UPTE local 184 or designee if the appointment dates of the positions overlap.

For the purposes of this provision, "same appointment" means an appointment in the same department/unit and with the same duties as the appointment to which the individual was assigned prior to conversion, and which reports to the same supervisor as did the previous limited appointment.
3.	A non-career employee in a limited appointment who has at least six (6) months of continuous service at 50% time or more in a non-career appointment and who is appointed or is converted in accordance with Article 31 - Positions/Appointments, Section B.2. to a career position with substantially similar job duties shall have three (3) months service credit toward completion of her/his probationary period in the new career position.

1.	When an employee with a disability needs an accommodation to enable him or her to perform the essential functions of the position.
2.	When an employee with a disability needs an accommodation to enable him or her to gain access to his or her workstation; and
3.	When an employee with a disability needs an accommodation to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment.
2.
B.	THE INTERACTIVE PROCESS
1.	Upon receipt of an employee’s request for an accommodation, the parties
will engage in the interactive process, which is an ongoing dialogue between the employee and appropriate representatives of the University about possible options for reasonably accommodating the employee’s disability. Options may include, but are not limited to: assistive devices; modification of existing facilities; and restructuring the job. Both the University and the employee are expected to participate in the interactive process, so as to ensure timely, good faith communications and a reasonable accommodation, if any, for the employee with a disability. The employee may have his or her representative participate in this dialogue.
During the interactive process the University considers information related to: the essential functions of the job; functional limitations; possible accommodations; the reasonableness of possible accommodations; and implementation of a reasonable accommodation. This information will be used by the University to determine what, if any, reasonable accommodation will be made.
2.	a. The University will process requests for reasonable accommodation and provide accommodations where reasonable and appropriate and in as short a time frame as reasonably possible. The parties recognize, however, that the time necessary to process a request will depend on the nature of the accommodation requested and whether it is necessary to obtain supporting information.
b. Should an employee wish to receive an update as to the status of his/her request, he/she may contact the assigned University representative. The University representative will respond to the employee’s request for updated information in a timely
manner.
C.	MEDICAL DOCUMENTATION
The employee is responsible for providing medical documentation to assist in understanding the nature of the employee's functional limitations.

No sick leave pay shall be payable to an employee unless the employee's immediate supervisor or designee is notified of the illness/disability and the probable duration thereof as soon as possible, but in no event later than the beginning of the employee's work day except when the University determines that the employee's failure to notify is due to extreme circumstances beyond the control of the employee. Subsequent to an employee's notice of illness/disability, no time for which the employee has requested and/or received sick leave authorization may be charged to accumulated/anticipated compensatory time, leave with pay, vacation, or holiday time, except as provided in Article 18, Leaves of Absence.
2.

3.	The University may require reasonable documentation of an employee's sick leave absence when an absence exceeds three (3) consecutive scheduled days of work, or for shorter periods when:
a.	it appears to be justified and,
b.	notice has been provided to the employee prior to his or her return to work, that documentation will be required, or
c.	the employee has been given advance written notice that documentation will be required.

6.	The University may have an employee claiming disability examined by a physician or physicians of its choosing, in accordance with Article 18, Leaves of Absence. The University shall pay the reasonable costs of any such medical examination and, when practical, shall send the employee to a physician of its choosing on the employee's work time.
7.

ARTICLE 40 SUBCONTRACTING
A.	GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.	The University retains the right to subcontract all or any portion of operations. When the University decides to subcontract, and such subcontract will result in the layoff of employees in the bargaining unit, the University will provide UPTE with a copy of the Request for Proposals (RFP) seven (7) calendar days after it is issued. In the event no RFP is issued and the subcontract will result in bargaining unit employee layoffs, the University will give at least sixty (60) calendar days notice prior to the commencement of work by the contractor.
2.	Prior to the commencement of the work that has been subcontracted and following receipt of a timely request from UPTE, the University shall meet with UPTE to discuss the effects of subcontracting upon bargaining unit employees who may be laid off. Failure to conclude such discussions, if any, prior to the date on which the subcontracted work begins, shall not preclude the University from implementing the subcontracting on the date agreed upon by the University and the subcontractor or the layoff of employees pursuant to Article 16, Layoff and Reduction in Time.
B.	DISPLACEMENT OF EMPLOYEES
1.	Except as provided below, the University of California will not contract out services that result in the layoff of non-probationary career bargaining unit employees.
2.	Examples of instances in which a contract for such services may be appropriate include:
a.	The need to obtain special services and equipment that are not available internally;
b.	The need to obtain special expertise or efficiencies that are better provided through
an outside contractor than by the University; and
c.	Financial necessity.
3.	Where financial necessity is the reason for the exception, before contracting for work which is fully or partially supported from state funds, including those at the teaching hospitals, the University shall first seek funding from the Legislature to address the financial necessity.
4.	When the University has determined to contract for services it will provide UPTE with a copy of any RFP within seven (7) calendar days after it is issued pursuant to Section A.2., above. Such notice shall demonstrate the appropriateness for the contract, in accordance with Section B.2., above.
a.	If UPTE asks to meet with the University about the proposed contract for services, such a meeting will occur as soon as practicable following the University’s receipt of the request. The meeting will not delay the commencement of the contract.
b.	If UPTE believes that the University failed to comply with the provisions of Section B., above, it can file a formal complaint with the Office of the President, Office of Labor Relations. The Office of the President shall make the final determination as to whether the contract meets the conditions in Section B. The Office of the President decision is not grievable or arbitrable.
C.	EFFECT OF CONTRACT ON EMPLOYEES
To minimize the effects of layoff, when a non-probationary career bargaining unit employee is notified of layoff because the University entered into a contract for services that the employee performed, the University will make available another bargaining unit position for which the employee is qualified. The position will be at the same campus/hospital/Laboratory from which the employee was laid off. Where the provisions in this article are inconsistent with the provisions of Article 16, Layoff and Reduction in Time, the provisions of this Article and Section shall control.
1.	The available position shall be offered at the same duration, percent time, and appointment type held by the employee when displaced.
2.	The available position shall be offered at the same base rate of pay earned by the employee when displaced.
3.	The right to be offered a position pursuant to this section shall begin on the date an employee is notified of layoff (displacement).

4.	The right of the displaced non-probationary career employee to be offered a position pursuant to this section shall terminate upon acceptance or refusal of the offered position at the same base rate of pay.
5.	A displaced non-probationary career employee who refuses an offered position at the same base rate of pay shall be placed in layoff status.
D.	Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prohibiting action, which must be taken to establish or maintain eligibility for any federal program, contract or grant - including the contract requirements contained in the agreement between the University and the Department of Energy - where ineligibility would result in a loss of federal funds to the University of California.

This Article defines the application of sick leave and vacation for employees who are unable to work due to a work-incurred injury or illness compensable under the California Workers' Compensation Act, and provides extended sick leave benefits for such employees when sick leave is exhausted and employees are still unable to work because of such injury or illness.
1.	An employee unable to perform the normal duties of her/his job due to a work-incurred illness or injury compensable under the California Workers' Compensation Act may be granted leave for the duration of a verified disability but not to exceed twelve (12) months or a predetermined date of separation,_whichever comes earlier.

3.	An approved leave of absence for work-incurred illnesses or injuries shall not be
considered a break in service.
4.	Employees who are unable to work due to a work-incurred injury or illness compensable under the California Workers' Compensation Act are eligible to use accrued sick leave and vacation as provided below. When sick leave is exhausted and when employees are still unable to work because of such illness or injury, employees may use extended sick leave or leave without pay as provided below.
5.	An employee shall notify her/his supervisor of the need for leave for a work-incurred injury or illness, or any extension of such leave, as soon as practicable after the need for such leave or extension is known. This notification shall include written medical certification of the need for such leave or extension, and the anticipated return to work date.
B.	EXTENSIONS OF WORK-INCURRED INJURY OR ILLNESS LEAVE
In the event an employee requires an extension to her/his work-incurred injury or illness leave, s/he shall provide the University with a statement from her/his licensed health care practitioner of the need for the extension and the anticipated return to work date.
1.	Such a statement must be provided ten (10) calendar days prior to the date the employee was previously scheduled to return to work.

1.	Prior to returning to work, an employee granted a work-incurred injury or illness leave must provide the University with a statement from her/his licensed health care practitioner of the employee's ability to return to work. When possible, an employee granted a work-incurred injury or illness leave must provide the University with ten (10) calendar days notice of her/his ability to return to work. If a return to work specifies restrictions, the University will consider what accommodation, if any, will reasonably be made.

3.	An employee who elects not to use all sick leave is not eligible for extended sick leave benefits.
F.	EFFECT ON PAY STATUS
1.	Supplemental Leave
An employee who is receiving temporary disability payments and supplemental sick leave or vacation as described in Section D. above is considered on regular pay status for purposes of application of provisions of this Agreement, except completion of the probationary period. Sick leave and vacation accrued during this period may be used as soon as they accrue.
2.	Extended Sick Leave
An employee who is receiving temporary disability payments and extended sick leave benefits as described in Section E. above is considered to be on regular pay status for purposes of application of provisions of this Agreement, except completion of the probationary period.

However, if an employee separates without returning to work, the employee shall be paid for vacation accrued during the period the employee received extended sick leave payment.
3.	Leave Without Pay
An employee on leave without pay and receiving temporary disability payments accrues sick leave and vacation on the same basis as if regularly employed, but such accrual is credited to the employee only upon return to work. If an employee separates without returning to work, no payment shall be made for such vacation credit.

An employee shall not use vacation, sick leave, or extended sick leave to supplement Workers' Compensation payments beyond a predetermined date of separation or leave without pay. Any vacation credit remaining on the date of separation shall be paid on a lump-sum basis.
H.	LIGHT DUTY
Subject to operational considerations and budgetary constraints, the University will endeavor, on a case by case basis, to modify duties consistent with documented medical restrictions, for employees who have experienced work related injuries.

CAMPUS GRIEVANCE RESOLUTION COMMITTEE (CRC)
PROGRAM GUIDELINES
1.	General
The parties agree that a Campus Grievance Resolution Committee Program (“CRC”) may be implemented at campuses, where they do not already exist. Except for the general guidelines set forth in this sideletter, the particular elements governing the CRC will be negotiated at each participating campus.
The procedures to be used by each campus CRC shall be determined by agreement between the local parties. While the CRC is intended to be an informal process, individual campuses may agree to use a formal process of testimony including, but not limited to, examination of witnesses.
2.	Obligations Of Parties
The parties at each campus may meet and confer separately over the specific terms of the CRC.
3.	Subject Matter Excluded From CRC Review
The parties agree that the subject matter of the grievances suitable for the CRC shall be determined by the parties at each location. CRC is not suited for grievances involving complex contractual interpretations.
4.	Composition Of The CRC
Upon submission of a written grievance to the CRC, a panel composed of four members, two chosen by each side, shall be convened. To foster an impartial panel, the parties shall not select panel members from the same control unit or individuals who are involved with or have a vested interest in the outcome of the grievance. The union may only select bargaining unit employees to serve on the CRC.
5.	Decisions Of CRC
The CRC has final and binding authority to adjudicate a grievance only if it reaches a unanimous decision. Such unanimous decisions by the CRC will only address the specific issues and remedies stated on the grievance form. The CRC shall issue either a unanimous decision in a written statement that sets forth the reasoning behind their decision or a written decision that the CRC failed to reach unanimous consensus. The record and findings from the CRC may not be introduced as evidence in any other proceeding.
6.	Limitations On CRC's Authority And Remedy
The CRC's authority and ability to fashion a remedy shall be subject to the same limits placed on an Arbitrator authority as set forth in Article 3, sections G(1) and (4) and H (1)(2)(3) and (5).
7.	Return To Grievance Procedures
The CRC shall lose jurisdiction over any grievance following the issuance of its decision but no later than ten (10) days after the close of the CRC meeting.

SIDE LETTER: SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT - UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGES
LBNL IS EXCEPTED FROM THIS SIDE LETTER
SF-CE-877-H
UPTE agrees to withdraw this ULP in exchange for the following:
•	Effective the first pay period following sixty (60) days from the date of ratification or 7/1/10, whichever is later; a one-time payment of $1000 will be paid to each full-time employee who is in the RX or TX unit on the date of ratification and on the date of payout. The $1000 payment will be pro-rated based on the appointment percentage (pre-START appointment percentage), is not base building or covered compensation for retirement, etc.
•	All TX and RX employees who would have been subject to the systemwide furlough/salary reduction plan and who have not yet been temporarily laid off in relation to this program in order to effectuate the State Budget shortfall for FY 09-10, will:
1.	Have the opportunity to enroll in the START Plan at their location to effectuate the savings required by the system-wide furlough/salary reduction plan.
2.	This understanding does not cover temporary layoffs of RX and TX unit employees for reasons other than the temporary budget shortfall.
3.	Employees who opt to do this will begin such START reduction on the pay period following the date of ratification through 12/31/10.
4.	As an example, if an employee would have received a 4% reduction in pay and 11 days of furlough then the employee would need to effectuate the annual equivalent of the 4% reduction in pay through the START program. ($40k, 4% equal to $1600 annual savings so this would need to be spread out among the months remaining from date of ratification to 12/31/10.)
SF-CE-896-H
UPTE agrees to withdraw the portion of this ULP related to Blue Cross health plan participants. The portion related to paybands will continue through the process.
