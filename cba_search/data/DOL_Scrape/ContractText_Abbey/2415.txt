Provision for this remedy herein does not make such remedy the exclusive remedy available to the Union for violation of this section; nor does it make the same or other remedies available to the Union for violations of other sections or articles of this Agreement.
ARTICLE XXVIII DRUG TESTING
The Employer may require employees to submit to testing for alcohol or controlled substances to the extent and in the manner required by applicable law or by a project owner or in any reasonable manner for the purpose of promoting safety in the following circumstances; When there is reasonable cause to believe that an employee has used or is under the influence of such substances during working hours, when an employee has been involved in an accident involving personal injury or property damage on the job, or at random providing that an Employer may not require random testing of any one employee more than twice in any calendar year. Positive test results indicating the presence of non-prescribed marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines or phencyclidine in any quantity or blood alcohol of 10/1 OOth of one percent or more by weight or failure to submit to the drug and alcohol screen test may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.
In order to enforce this policy it may be necessary to require appropriate biological specimens from both job applicants and/or current employees. When this activity is required, all testing will be conducted by a company approved medical testing laboratory that has been licensed by the state. The company will bear all cost for drug and alcohol testing of employees. If an employee’s test results show positive results, all retesting costs are to be paid by the employee.
ARTICLE XXIX PREVAILING WAGE REPORTING
The Employer agrees to provide the Union with a prevailing wage report once a month. The report will be on a form acceptable to the parties and shall include the county of the job location, number of employees who worked on the job and the total number of hours worked on the job for that month.
