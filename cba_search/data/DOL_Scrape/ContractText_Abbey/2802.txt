This Agreement has as its purpose the joint commitment to achieve the University's goals of teaching, research, and community service; promotion of harmonious relations between the Employer and the Union; the establishment of an equitable and peaceful procedure for the resolution of differences; and the expression of the full and complete understanding of the parties pertaining to all terms and conditions of employment.
The term "employee" when used hereinafter in this Agreement shall refer to employees represented by the Union in the bargaining unit unless otherwise stated.
The term Human Resources Department shall mean "appropriate" Human Resources Department: coordinate campus or University Human Resources Department.
Any member of University management referenced in this Agreement may specify a designee.

ARTICLE 3
UNIVERSITY LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE AND OTHER LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES
STATEMENT OF PHILOSOPHY The University and the Union share a belief that many concerns between the parties can be resolved through a mutually constructive, cooperative, participative, and either joint problem solving or joint decision-making approach. The parties encourage managers, supervisors, and employees to resolve concerns in a manner which emphasizes employee involvement. Decisions which are reached through this approach will benefit the University, the Union, and employees. In this spirit, the University will provide appropriate information, upon request, and consider Union input during the budget planning and organizational planning process. This statement shall not be grievable nor shall either party use this Section as evidence or argument in arbitration.
SECTION 1.	PURPOSE To help promote a mutually constructive and cooperative relationship, the parties agree to establish that this bargaining unit shall participate in the University-wide joint Labor Management Committee (ULMC) with AFSCME Council 5 and Locals 3260, 3800 and 3937. The Committee shall have the following specific objectives:
A.	Foster communication between the parties;
B.	Serve as a forum to discuss issues of mutual concern;
C.	Work to build consensus for joint problem solving and planning where the parties recognize it is best to have a shared position;
D.	Assess the need, if any, for sub-committees of this Committee and/or additional labor management committees at the collegiate or equivalent administrative level;
E.	Promote and support the creation of additional labor management committees;
F.	Inform and educate the University community about the concept and benefits of labor management partnership;
G.	Communicate and share the activities of the Committee with the University community; and
H.	Make recommendations to the appropriate University bodies and monitor the progress of such
actions.
SECTION 2.	AUTHORITY Labor management committees will have no authority to modify the terms of the Agreement between the parties. Disputes over alleged contract violations should be pursued through Article 21, Settlement of Disputes.
When a recommendation is reached by any of the committees, it shall be forwarded to the appropriate administrative level with recommendation that the appropriate administrative designee(s) consider it for implementation.
2
SECTION 3.	MEMBERSHIP The Union and the University shall each be permitted eight (8) representatives on the Committee. The Union and the University will each designate one member to serve as co-chair. The co-chairs, along with other Committee Members, will carry out all functions of the Committee, plan the agenda and arrange meeting dates and times.
SECTION 4.	MEETINGS The Committee shall meet monthly or as the Union and University mutually agree. Members may attend meetings during regular business hours after providing reasonable notification to their supervisors. Any paid time shall be subject to the paid time provisions in Article 31. However, the University shall have no obligation to reimburse employees for related expenses. Committee meetings will usually be held on University property unless the Committee agrees to other accommodations.
SECTION 5.	ACTIVITIES Among other activities that Committee members may mutually agree to pursue, Committee members will pursue the following:
A.	A plan to encourage schools/colleges, or equivalent administrative units, to establish their own local committees. Such committees shall be established when there is a joint request from the union and the employer in the area. Those units electing to establish local committees will determine an appropriate mix and number of participants and may seek advice from the ULMC in establishing and facilitating committee operation.
B.	A plan for joint training of supervisors and stewards on the contract.
C.	A plan for the Union's consultation in the planning and budgeting process of the University comparable to opportunities for consultation available to other employee groups.
Upon written request by the Union, the University will provide readily available data to the Union regarding the number of University employees in various categories of employment and the Human Resources Department will meet with the Union to discuss the information provided.
ARTICLE 4
DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITION
STATEMENT OF PHILOSOPHY The University of Minnesota and the Union are committed to recognizing and acknowledging the healthy and positive diversity that we have on the University campuses. Further, the parties recognize that all employees have the right to work in a productive environment in which there is no verbal or physical intimidation, or discrimination or harassment based on the criteria provided in Section 1, Discrimination Prohibition, and Section 2, Sexual Harassment. It is in this spirit that the parties agree to the provisions of this Article. This statement shall not be grievable nor shall either party use this Section as evidence or argument in arbitration.
SECTION 1.	DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITION Discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed or religion, sex (including sexual harassment), marital status, affectional preference and/or sexual orientation, public assistance status, disability, age, national origin, veteran status, or political opinions, is prohibited. The Union shall share equally with the University the responsibility for applying this provision of the Agreement.
SECTION 2.	SEXUAL HARASSMENT The parties agree that all employees have a right to a workplace free from sexual harassment. The Union recognizes its responsibility to assist in maintaining a workplace free of sexual harassment. Whether sexual harassment has occurred will be determined in each situation. For purposes of illustration and example only, the definition contained in
3
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines, the 1984 "Policy Statement on Sexual Harassment," defines sexual harassment as follows:
Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment or academic advancement; (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions or academic advancement affecting such individual; (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work or academic performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working or academic environment.
SECTION 3.	UNION ACTIVITY The Union and the University agree not to interfere with the rights of employees under the Public Employment Labor Relations Act. There shall be no discrimination, interference, restraint, or coercion by the Employer against any employee because of union activity or lack of activity or Union membership or refusal to join the Union. The Union recognizes its responsibility as bargaining representative and agrees to represent all employees in the bargaining unit without discrimination, interference, restraint or coercion and without regard to union activity or lack of union activity or Union membership or refusal to join the Union.
SECTION 4.	NEPOTISM Relatives may work for the University provided there is no immediate supervisory relationship or substantive administrative relationship. Relatives include: (1) by blood or adoptive relationship: parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, brothers, sisters: or (2) by marriage relationship: husbands, wives, brothers- or sisters-in-law, fathers- or mothers-in-law, sons-or daughters-in-law, stepparents, stepchildren or (3) by registered domestic partnership: registered same sex domestic partners, brothers or sisters of registered same sex domestic partners, fathers or mothers of registered same sex domestic partners, sons or daughters of registered same sex domestic partners.
Any employee who has passed an initial probationary period and who is required to resign from a position in order to comply with this section shall have rights to the layoff list as though the employee had been laid off. Any employee still serving a probationary period shall be discharged from the position if necessary to comply with this section.
The parties agree that issues of nepotism are appropriately discussed in a meet and confer situation where the issue arises, or at the ULMC on policy issues.
SECTION 5.	POLITICAL ACTIVITY No employee shall be required to pay or be allowed to solicit or receive any assessment, contribution, or subscription for political purposes whatsoever during work hours. No employee shall directly or indirectly use the employee's authority or official influence to compel any employee to apply for membership in or become a member of any political organization; or to pay or promise to pay any assessment, subscription, or contribution; or to take part in any political activity.
SECTION 6.	COMPLAINT PROCEDURES Upon request, the University will make available to employees copies of the various non-discrimination and Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action (EO/AA) policies.
Information on University discrimination complaint procedures, which are also the vehicle for sexual harassment complaints, is included in Appendix A. Should an employee decide to grieve alleged discrimination or sexual harassment through Article 21, Settlement of Disputes, the employee shall
4
not have the right to use the University complaint procedure on the alleged violation in question. Should an employee decide to use the University procedure, then the employee shall not have the right to grieve using Article 21 of the Agreement on the alleged violation in question.
ARTICLE 5
RECRUITMENT AND EMPLOYMENT
SECTION 1.	VACANCY POSTING When the Employer determines there is a continuing or temporary vacancy to be filled, the hiring Department shall submit a personnel requisition to the appropriate Human Resources Department. Announcements of vacancies shall be posted on the official Human Resources Department web page and shall include cross campus postings as feasible. The posting shall state the first day of listing, shall remain open for applications from the first day it is officially posted for at least seven (7) calendar days and shall state the date at which bargaining unit consideration ends. The appropriate Human Resources Department shall provide copies of postings to the Union. In addition, the appropriate supervisor(s) shall notify bargaining unit employees in the department, by means of the supervisor's choosing, when a bargaining unit vacancy in the department is to be posted. Disputes regarding supervisory notification may be grieved under Article 21 but remedies shall not require reversal of the hiring decision.
Postings shall include, at least, the classification, campus and work location of the job, salary and/or salary range, shift and hours of work, whether overtime or consecutive Sunday work are conditions of employment, a summary of the duties and essential qualifications for the job, and measurable, job related qualifications as determined by the Employer. There shall be no essential qualifications or selection criteria which require four years or greater college degrees for vacancies in the bargaining unit.
SECTION 2.	APPLICATION Employees shall apply by submitting official application materials to the appropriate Human Resources Department or, when the option is available, by notifying the appropriate Human Resources Department that they wish a current application already on file to be considered for a particular vacancy. The application, to be considered for the posted position, must be received in the appropriate Human Resources Department by the close of the business day of the last day of the posting period.
Within a reasonable time after receiving and evaluating an employee's application for a vacancy, if it is determined the employee is not qualified for the position, the employee shall be notified of the results of the evaluation.
An employee may not apply or be considered for promotion to a vacant position during an initial probationary period unless initiated by the Employer. Employees in an initial probationary period may be promoted as the result of an employer supported job reclassification.
SECTION 3.	APPLICANT HIRING Hiring of applicants who apply for vacancies and who have been certified by the Employer as meeting the qualifications for a vacancy, and as meeting the measurable, job related selection criteria as applied by the Department shall be in the following order:

PROBATIONARY PERIOD
SECTION 1.	INTENT OF PROBATION Each employee selected to fill a vacancy for a continuing position or a Temporary posted position shall serve a probationary period which is an extension of the selection procedure. The intent of probation is to give the employee an opportunity to demonstrate his/her ability to perform the duties of the position.
A Department Head may decide to waive an employee's probationary period requirement with written notice to the employee, if the employee is hired to a formerly held classification in which s/he has previously passed probation in the Department.
Any absences without pay shall automatically extend the probationary period. Absence covered by Workers' Compensation will not count towards completion of the probationary period.
SECTION 2.	SIX MONTH PROBATIONARY PERIOD A probationary period of six (6) months shall be served by every employee hired in any continuing or Temporary posted position on an original appointment, promotion, or demotion, and shall be successfully completed before the employee can be given a continuing appointment. A probationary period of employment of six (6) months shall be served by an employee who transfers 1) in the same class between Collegiate/Administrative Units or 2) to a different class.
9
Should an employee be promoted, including a promotion by reclassification, from a position in which s/he is serving probation to a position in a higher classification in the same department prior to completion of the probation, and the employee subsequently passes probation in the higher class, the employee shall be also considered to have passed probation in the class from which s/he was promoted.
SECTION 3.	FOUR MONTH PROBATION A four (4) month probationary period shall be required of an employee who has already passed probation in that class in the following situations:
A.	If the employee transfers or bumps to a class in which s/he has previously passed probation but in a different Department in the same Collegiate/Administrative Unit.
B.	If the employee is rehired from the layoff list to a class in which s/he has previously passed probation but not in the rehiring Department.
SECTION 4.	NO PROBATIONARY PERIOD No subsequent probationary period shall be required of an employee who:
A.	Is assigned to a different position in the same classification, same Department.
B.	Bumps back into any classification in which the employee has previously passed probation in the same Department.
C.	Is rehired off the layoff list to the same Department in any classification in which s/he has passed probation in the Department.
D.	Is recalled following layoff to the same classification, same Department.
E.	Is reclassified in the position currently occupied and in which position the employee has passed probation.
F.	Has been serving in a temporary posted position in which s/he passed probation and is hired for that position when it is reposted.
G.	A Department Head, at their discretion, may count time worked in a Temporary No Post (TNP) position towards completion of the probationary period, when the employee moves to a posted temporary or continuing appointment which is the same position and classification with no break in service.
SECTION 5.	PROBATIONARY REVIEWS AND RATING During the probationary period, the supervisor shall conduct a minimum of one (1) performance appraisal of the employee's work performance at the approximate midpoint of the probationary period, discuss it with the employee, furnish the employee with a written copy of the evaluation, and provide a copy to the appropriate Human Resources Department. The appraisal shall be based on the job description provided (see Article 9, Section 1.)
Failure to provide the above appraisal(s) does not mean the employee passes probation, nor does such failure extend the period of probation. There is no obligation to provide a performance appraisal if the employee is terminated before the approximate midpoint of the probationary period. An employee on probation may be terminated at any point during the probationary period. An employee who is not on an initial probationary period may have rights to a prior position. (See Section 6 below.)
SECTION 6.	TERMINATION OF PROBATION If the Department Head or immediate supervisor determines during the probationary period that the employee will not pass probation, the employee shall be given written confirmation with a copy to the appropriate Human Resources Department.
New hires (original appointments) who fail to pass probation shall be discharged. Employees serving a subsequent probationary period shall be given fourteen (14) calendar days notice of failure to pass
10
probation. In both an initial and subsequent probationary period, an employee does not pass probation if s/he is notified in writing of failure to pass probation before the end of the probationary period.
Failure to pass probation may not be grieved. An employee who fails to pass probation may allege a violation of Article 4, Discrimination Prohibition, and may proceed only through Step 3 of Article 21, Settlement of Disputes.
An employee who does not pass probation in a position within or outside the bargaining unit but has held a prior continuing position shall have the right to return to the prior continuing position, if it exists, to the extent permissible under the governing terms and conditions of employment in the bargaining unit where the prior continuing position resides. Before an employee can return to the prior continuing position, the employee must first take a vacancy in the class to which the employee would return, as provided in Article 5, Section 3 (A). If there is no vacancy for which the employee qualifies and can go to based on his/her seniority, then the employee may bump the individual occupying the prior continuing position provided that: (1) s/he has more University seniority than the individual in the position; and (2) the individual occupying the prior continuing position has not passed probation in the position. If there is no vacancy, or if the employee can not bump as provided above, the returning employee shall go on the layoff list. Any employee about to be bumped because of this provision shall receive seven (7) calendar days' notice.
This return must happen within fourteen (14) calendar days after notifying the Department Head in charge of the prior continuing position, provided the employee:
A.	Has successfully completed the probationary period for the prior continuing position; and
B.	Was promoted or transferred from the prior continuing position; and
C.	Notifies the prior Department Head in writing by the termination date of the currently held probationary position of the intent to return to the prior continuing position.
The prior continuing position referred to is the continuing position an employee last held and in which the employee successfully passed probation, if probation was required, before being transferred or promoted to the position requiring the probationary period.
If the prior continuing position exists, and the employee chooses to return to it in accordance with the above, the employee may be placed on a leave of absence without pay and/or use accrued compensatory time and/or accrued vacation credit during the fourteen (14) day period. Compensatory time shall be paid at the rate earned; vacation pay shall be at the rate of the lower position. Use of paid time does not mean the employee has passed probation; and does not extend the period of probation.
If an employee's prior continuing position no longer exists (has been abolished or reclassified), or if the employee chooses not to return, the employee shall notify the appropriate Human Resources Department of his/her intent to be placed on the layoff list.
S/he must give notification in writing to the appropriate Human Resources Department on or before the anticipated date of discharge from the probationary position.
A probationary employee who is discharged from the University for disciplinary reasons shall forfeit rights to return to the prior position or to the layoff list.

ARTICLE 8
PERFORMANCE APPRAISALS
STATEMENT OF PHILOSOPHY The University and the Union share a belief that the purposes of the performance appraisal system include the following: to clarify both management's goals for the position and the employee's goals; to monitor the employee's achievements and any areas of needed improvement; to facilitate communication between supervisors and employees about the employee's job duties and establish a framework for open, constructive feedback; to encourage and develop plans for employee development and growth. This statement shall not be grievable nor shall either party use this Section as evidence or argument in arbitration.
SECTION 1. EMPLOYEE APPRAISALS Performance appraisals for each employee shall be submitted at least once each year using either a standard University evaluation form or one that is an approved substitute for that standard form.
Employees shall be evaluated by their appropriate administrator/supervisor. Employees shall be given a minimum of three (3) work days notice prior to the evaluation meeting. If a performance review meeting becomes disciplinary in nature in the employee's judgment, the employee shall have the right to adjourn the meeting and reschedule it with a union steward present.
At the time of such appraisal, the employee's specific job description, job duties and performance, and performance appraisal standards, shall be reviewed by both the employee and the supervisor to discuss patterns of performance for the past year and expectations for the upcoming year.
Each employee has the right to add written comments regarding the performance appraisal on the performance appraisal form, at the time of any review, and subsequently if any changes are made. The employee's signature on the performance appraisal form signifies that the performance appraisal has been reviewed with the employee, but does not signify that the employee agrees with the appraisal.
Each employee shall have the right to see any changes, deletions, or additions to the performance appraisal made by the immediate supervisor, a higher supervisor, department head, or administrator. Such changes shall be discussed with the employee. The employee shall be provided with copies of the completed performance appraisal.
The performance appraisal shall be placed in the employee's official personnel file. Any appraisals which are not in the official file shall not be part of the official record of the employee in considering discipline or future performance reviews. Employees have the right to review their official personnel files upon request per Article 23, Personnel Records.
A referral to employee assistance programs shall not be referenced on a performance appraisal or evaluation, nor shall supervisors use the performance appraisal as a substitute for disciplinary action as defined in Article 22.
ARTICLE 9
CLASSIFICATION AND RECLASSIFICATION
SECTION 1.	CLASSIFICATION OF POSITIONS The University shall classify and/or reclassify all
12
positions in the bargaining unit according to the nature and difficulty of duties assigned to and performed by the employee, based on a current and accurate job description, and shall assign to each position in the bargaining unit a classification title, number, and salary range.
An employee new to his/her position will receive a copy of his/her job description upon hire. The appropriate administrator/supervisor will review the description with the employee.
Materials used in determining classifications and reclassifications, such as class specifications and reclassification interpretation manuals, shall be readily available to the Union and employees on request.
SECTION 2.	RECLASSIFICATION The employee may submit, through supervisory and administrative channels, a properly completed job evaluation questionnaire (JEQ) when changes in the tasks, duties, and responsibilities of the position are caused by reorganization of work, new staffing requirements, technology, or when s/he believes his/her position is inappropriately classified. Such requests may be submitted no more than twice per fiscal year, unless the employee's supervisor or the Human Resources Department agrees a new job evaluation questionnaire is warranted.
SECTION 3.	JOB EVALUATION QUESTIONNAIRE TIMELINES The supervisor, Department Head, and Dean shall have thirty (30) calendar days to complete and forward a job evaluation questionnaire to the appropriate Human Resources Department. A supervisor cannot change or require the employee to change the employee's responses on a job evaluation questionnaire. At the request of the employee, the supervisor shall discuss any changes to the JEQ with the employee. Once the JEQ has been finalized for scoring, a copy shall be forwarded to the employee which identifies the changes and the person who made the changes.
Upon receipt of a completed job evaluation questionnaire, the appropriate Human Resources Department shall complete a review of the position, and render a decision on the request in writing to the employee, the Department, and the Union within forty-five (45) calendar days.
If the employee does not agree with the decision, s/he may request in writing within fourteen (14) calendar days the scoring of his/her responses on the JEQ. If after receipt of both scores, the employee requests in writing to be interviewed by the Human Resources Department, s/he will be interviewed. During such an interview with the Human Resources Department and the department involving reclassification issues, and any mutually agreed subsequent follow up meetings, an employee shall have the right to have a Union representative present. Employee union representatives shall participate in such meetings on paid leave time as provided in Article 31, Section 1, I.
SECTION 4.	APPEAL OF JOB EVALUATION QUESTIONNAIRE The decision of the Human Resources Department may be appealed by the employee within forty five (45) calendar days of receiving the decision. Appeals must be made in writing to the appropriate Human Resources Department. The classification appeal process provided in this Section is the sole and exclusive process for the appeal of classification and reclassification actions.
A classification appeal hearing date will be agreed upon no later than sixty (60) calendar days from the date the appeal was received. A neutral party mutually agreed to by the Union and the University will hear the classification appeal. If the scores of the administration and the employee do not agree after information from the interview has been evaluated, both scorings shall be presented to the
13
neutral party. The neutral party will issue a decision no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing. The decision of the neutral party is final.
SECTION 5.	RECLASSIFICATION EFFECTIVE DATE The reclassification of any position shall normally be made effective on the first day of the payroll period after receipt of a properly completed job evaluation questionnaire by the appropriate Human Resources Department, or in cases where the form has been delayed in coming to the appropriate Human Resources Department, on the first day of the payroll period following the sixteenth work day after submission of the completed form by the employee to the supervisor.
Reclassifications resulting in a demotion and a reduction in salary will be made effective on the first day of the payroll period following notification of the decision by the appropriate Human Resources Department to both the employee and the Union.
Departments must comply with the appropriate Human Resources Manager's decision or the decision of an appeal, within twenty (20) work days after receipt of the written notice of the decision.
SECTION 6.	PERIODIC SURVEY If the employer requires a review of a position in the bargaining unit, the review shall be submitted as a Periodic Survey using a job evaluation questionnaire. Employees whose positions are being reviewed shall be informed of the reason for the review. If the employee(s) desire to have a meeting with the supervisor about the Periodic Survey, such a meeting shall be held.
Once a job evaluation questionnaire has been finalized for scoring, a copy shall be forwarded to the affected employee(s). If such a Periodic Survey appears likely to result in a demotion, upon the request of the employee, an on site audit of the position shall be conducted by Human Resources. Changes in classification resulting from Periodic Surveys will become effective on the first day of the payroll period mutually agreed to by the appropriate Human Resources Department and the Department. However, no demotions as a result of a Periodic Survey shall be retroactive.
If an employee is demoted as a result of a Periodic Survey, the employee shall be entitled to have his/her name placed on the layoff list for the class from which s/he was demoted.
Periodic Survey decisions may be appealed by the employee within fourteen (14) calendar days after receiving the decision. Periodic Survey appeals must be made in writing to the appropriate Human Resources Department. Appeals shall follow the procedures identified in Section 4 above.
ARTICLE 10
EDUCATIONAL AND CAREER OPPORTUNITIES
SECTION 1.	PURPOSE Employees shall be allowed the opportunity, within the limits of this Agreement, to continue their education, improve their performance and expand their promotional possibilities by taking courses.
SECTION 2.	WORK RELATED EDUCATION If an employee is required by the Employer to take a course, attend conferences, seminars, workshops, professional and scientific meetings or training as a condition of continuing employment, the Employer shall pay for the course and the time attending shall be treated as paid work time and associated expenses shall be reimbursed in accordance with
14
existing University policy. Employees shall be granted paid time off to be trained in new technology or equipment required in the employee's current job.
Employees attending conferences, seminars, workshops, professional and scientific meetings, or training shall be compensated for attendance and travel time in conformance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
The appropriate administrator/supervisor has the discretion to determine whether a leave of absence with pay will be granted for:
A.	Attendance at conferences, seminars, workshops, professional and scientific meetings and other approved educational activities.
B.	Educational leave during work hours for not more than four (4) hours per week (or more if make-up schedule for additional time is approved by the appropriate administrator/supervisor) to be used for such purpose as attending class at the University of Minnesota. Proposals to use flexible hours to make up the time and work while attending class shall be considered by the supervisor based on staffing needs, availability of supervision, hours of operation, and other legitimate business reasons. If a supervisor determines it is necessary to limit the number of employees who can be gone for classes, approval, which is at the supervisor’s discretion, shall be in the order of University seniority.
SECTION 3.	CAREER DEVELOPMENT Information on University career development programs which may exist shall be provided at employee orientation programs.
Employees shall be granted four (4) hours paid time per year to be trained in the technology and skills required to be qualified for University-wide promotion.
The appropriate Human Resources administrator and the Union agree to meet and confer, upon request, at a mutually agreed time to review information on current career development programs and to hear Union reactions.
SECTION 4.	TUITION WAIVER, REDUCED TUITION PROGRAMS When University reduced tuition/tuition waiver programs exist, the following guidelines apply:
A.	Employees shall be granted the opportunity to make application to enroll, under existing program policies, in University courses held during non-work hours.
B.	Departments shall establish written guidelines for how employees may utilize these programs.
C.	These guidelines shall be provided to employees at the time of hire or upon request.
Proposals to use flexible hours to make up the time and work while attending classes shall be considered by the supervisor based on staffing needs, availability of supervision, hours of operation, and other legitimate business reasons. In addition, supervisors should give extra consideration to those circumstances where the employee’s request is for the final course required for completion of a degree. If a supervisor determines it is necessary to limit the number of employees who can be gone for classes, approval, which is at the supervisor's discretion, shall be in the order of University seniority.
ARTICLE 11
CHILD CARE
The Employer shall continue to provide tax sheltered dependent care accounts for employees' payroll deduction use, if allowable under state and federal statute.
15
Each campus shall provide to employees information that is available on child care referral services existing for both well and sick child care. This information will be provided at employee orientation and upon employee request by the appropriate Human Resources Department. Additional child care information is included in Appendix E.
Whenever the University establishes an active Child Care Committee on a campus, the Union shall be offered representation on that Committee.
ARTICLE 12
HOURS OF WORK
SECTION 1.	WORK SCHEDULE Hours of work (work week or period, shift, and day) are established by the Department. Supervisors may reschedule hours of work for reasons consistent with the mission of the University. Temporary changes in the hours of work (two weeks or less) require two (2) calendar days notice, unless the supervisor and the employee(s) mutually agree to shorter notice. Changes in the hours of work which extend beyond two (2) weeks require fourteen (14) calendar days notice unless the supervisor and the employee(s) mutually agree to shorter notice. The Union and the employee(s) affected by the change may discuss the change with the supervisor.
The full-time work week shall be forty (40) hours per seven (7) calendar day week. If possible, the forty (40) hours shall be consecutive work days with two (2) or more consecutive days off.
A work shift is a regularly recurring period of work with a starting and ending time exclusive of overtime. If requested by the employee, the employee may change days, shifts, or hours of work with the approval of his/her supervisor provided such change does not result in the payment of overtime.
SECTION 2.	FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULE Once each six (6) months, if requested by employee(s), a Department shall hold a discussion with the employee(s) at a time and place determined by the Department regarding flexible work time in the Department as a whole. This provision does not apply to Departments where a flexible scheduling policy is already accessible to employees or where a discussion with employees has occurred in the past six months and has resulted in a decision not to implement flexible scheduling. A representative from the appropriate Human Resources Department and the Union may attend such discussions. Other staff and faculty, at the discretion of the Department, may also attend.
Discussion involving flexible scheduling may focus on work productivity, effective and efficient delivery of quality services, administrative costs, staffing needs of the work areas involved for hour and function coverage, and other areas that may concern the employee(s), staff, faculty, supervisors, and Department. Elements of flexible schedules may include variable length of work days, variable starting and ending times (while insuring that core periods of necessary coverage are maintained), variable work week and variable appointment percentages.
Once the Department makes the determination regarding the viability and nature of flexible scheduling, the Department's determination and any arrangements for flexible work schedules shall be communicated in writing with reasons for the decision to employees in the Department. If there is disagreement regarding the viability or nature of the flexible scheduling, the Department's decision shall prevail and neither the decision nor the reasons given may be grieved. However, no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after the decision is communicated to the employee(s), the decision may
16
be appealed by employee(s) to the next level supervisor who did not have an active role in making the final scheduling decision.
The employee(s) shall be given the opportunity to personally present their arguments about the installation or change of flexible schedules to the manager designated by the Employer to hear the appeal. The manager hearing the appeal shall consider the factors enumerated above and whether the department has fairly considered whether flexible scheduling is workable. There shall be a written decision denying or affirming the installation or change of a flexible schedule with an explanation of the reasons for the decision within fourteen (14) calendar days of completion of the information gathering. Appeals of Employer decisions to terminate or change established flexible schedules may be appealed only through the procedure set forth in this section.
Flexible work schedules may affect an employee's eligibility for fringe benefits. University fringe benefit rules and regulations will apply. Nothing in this section prohibits a Department's right to review, modify and schedule hours of work, or to hold additional discussions pertaining to scheduling.
SECTION 3. PAID REST PERIODS Employees are entitled to and shall be granted a fifteen (15) minute paid rest period during four (4) hours of work. Special arrangements for paid rest periods should be made between the employee and the supervisor when workload or staffing requirements prevent a regular schedule, or a schedule around the middle of the four (4) hour period. Employees who work beyond their normally scheduled work shift shall receive a fifteen (15) minute rest period before they continue work if their work will extend four (4) hours or more. Paid rest periods for employees working regularly scheduled long shifts (12 hours, for example) should be extended proportionally. Paid rest periods are not cumulative from one day to the next.
SECTION 4.	UNPAID LUNCH PERIOD Scheduled unpaid meal periods interrupting a work shift shall not be less than thirty (30) minutes nor more than sixty (60) minutes in length unless there is mutual agreement between the supervisor and employee to extend beyond the sixty (60) minutes for special occasions.
SECTION 5.	UNAUTHORIZED ABSENCE FROM WORK When an employee is absent from work without authorization such absence shall be grounds for disciplinary action. An employee absent for three (3) consecutive work days without authorization has resigned. Immediately after the third day of unauthorized leave the employer shall send notice to the employee, by certified mail, of their resignation due to the unauthorized leave. However, a person may subsequently apply for a retroactive leave of absence without pay to cover the unauthorized time off, and such a request, made within ten (10) calendar days of the commencement of the unauthorized time off, shall receive reasonable consideration, particularly in those cases where a documented disability caused the absence and that fact is supported by a statement from a medical practitioner as defined in the Family Medical Leave Act which is to be submitted along with the leave of absence request.
SECTION 6. PERCENTAGE OF APPOINTMENT An employee who works an average of ten (10) percentage points or more beyond his/her appointed percentage time or a supplemental employee who works regular, predictable, scheduled hours, for three (3) or more consecutive payroll periods shall have the right to have his/her appointment percentage and employment status as defined in Article 6 reviewed by the supervisor. The Employer will not be required to raise the percentage time worked or change employment status if there is clear evidence that the employee will not be working beyond his/her previous appointment percentage time on a regular basis in the future.
If there is clear evidence that the employee will continue working beyond his/her current percentage
17
appointment, or continue working regular, predictable, scheduled hours, the appointment percentage will be raised to the average percent time worked, or to the employment status reflected in the three (3) previous payroll periods. If at any time after the subsequent three (3) payroll periods the supervisor determines that the employee will not continue working beyond his/her previous appointment percentage time or continue working regular, predictable, scheduled hours on a regular basis in the future, the supervisor may reduce the appointment to the percentage time assigned prior to the employee's request, or return the employee to supplemental status with five (5) days prior notice given to the employee.
If the employee has served six (6) or more consecutive months in the higher percentage appointment, the layoff and bumping provisions of this agreement shall apply unless the employee is working to cover another employee's paid or non-paid leave. In such a case, the layoff and bumping provisions shall not apply unless the employee has served nine (9) or more consecutive months in the higher percentage appointment.
Any appointment percentage time adjustment made under the provisions of this Section shall be effective on the first pay period after the adjustment request is received by the Employer or the notice is received by the employee.
Changes in the percentage time of an appointment may affect an employee's eligibility for fringe benefits. University fringe benefit rules and regulations will apply. Such modifications may result in Article 25, bumping and layoff provisions, applying. Nothing in this section prohibits a Department's right to review and modify the percentage time of appointments.
ARTICLE 13 OVERTIME
SECTION 1.	OVERTIME HOURS AND RATES Overtime is the time worked in excess of forty (40) hours per work week for employees scheduled in a seven (7) day work period, on one or more University jobs.
All hours worked by an employee greater than twelve (12) consecutive hours in any work day shall be paid at time and one half the employee's regular rate of pay. Compensation shall not be paid more than once for the same hours under any provision of this agreement. Overtime worked with the prior approval of the supervisor shall be compensated by pay or by compensatory time off, at the option of the employee, unless payment in cash is prohibited by funding source or availability of funds as determined by the Department. Each department shall identify in writing more than one (1) person authorized to approve overtime. If payment of cash overtime is prohibited, the employee should be informed of that fact before working the overtime, or at the time of hire, or when funding source or availability of funds as determined by the Department requires a change in the compensation method.
All employees shall be paid or receive compensatory time at time-and-one-half (1.5) the employee's regular rate for overtime as defined above. An employee may use compensatory time, subject to the approval of the supervisor, within a reasonable period of time after a request to do so unless the use would unduly disrupt the operation of the department.
Requests to use compensatory time shall be given reasonable consideration.
18
Departments have full discretion to limit (in accordance with written Department policy) the amount of compensatory time off that can be accumulated and the length of time a compensatory time off balance can be carried forward, except that maximum limits imposed by statute (i.e., 160 hours of straight time, 240 hours at time and one-half) will be strictly followed. Upon request of the employee and the approval of the department, compensatory time may be cashed out.
The payment for paid overtime shall be processed without undue delay when possible. Departments are encouraged to process all overtime in the pay period in which it was worked.
Upon leaving the University or upon transferring from one Department of the University to another Department, an employee whose funding source does not prohibit a cash payment may cash out compensatory overtime on the following complete payroll abstract with fourteen (14) calendar days written notice. If payment is prohibited, arrangements will be made by the Department to handle the remaining compensatory overtime obligation.
SECTION 2.	DISTRIBUTION OF OVERTIME
A.	Overtime as a Condition of Employment. Certain positions will require overtime as a condition of employment. Employees in these positions may be required to work pre-planned, scheduled overtime which may not be reassignable to others. Employees required to work this overtime should be informed of this condition of employment at the time of hire, or when the Department requires this overtime as a condition of employment.
B.	Reassignable Overtime. The Employer shall offer and distribute reassignable overtime to employees as soon as the need for the overtime is anticipated. When reassignable overtime is required; the employee who usually performs the work shall be given first opportunity to work the overtime (including holidays). If the employee chooses not to accept reassignable overtime, or if there is more than one (1) employee in the same classification who normally performs the work and the need for the overtime is known more than twenty-four (24) hours in advance, the Employer shall inform employees of the available overtime by memorandum or posting, and other employees who are qualified and able to perform the work and wish to work overtime shall be permitted to work such overtime in classification seniority order with the most senior employee in that classification within the work unit in the Department being given first consideration.
When there is twenty-four (24) hours or less notice of the reassignable overtime, the Employer shall assign the overtime according to the distribution system. In such cases, the Employer shall attempt to notify employees by memorandum, posting, or other means. If all such employees decline to work the reassignable overtime, the employee with the least amount of classification seniority within the work unit in the Department, who is qualified, shall be required to work the overtime.
If the employee chooses not to accept reassignable overtime, or if there is more than one (1) employee in different classifications who normally perform the work and the need for the overtime is known more than twenty-four (24) hours in advance, the Employer shall inform employees of the available overtime by memorandum or posting, and other employees who are qualified and able to perform the work and wish to work overtime shall be permitted to work such overtime in University seniority order with the most senior employee within the work unit in the Department being given first consideration. When there is twenty-four (24) hours or less notice of the reassignable overtime, the Employer shall assign the overtime according to the distribution system. In such cases, the Employer shall attempt to notify employees by memorandum, posting, or other means. If all such employees decline to work the reassignable overtime, the employee with the least amount of University seniority
19
within the work unit in the Department, who is qualified, shall be required to work the overtime. Overtime distribution shall be completed in time to provide the employee who will work the overtime four (4) hours or one half shift of notice.
With the prior approval of the supervisor and to the extent compatible with a particular overtime assignment, an employee may be allowed to work the overtime at hours that are amenable to the employee's work schedule and personal commitments.
The Employer shall not be required to interrupt a specific project in progress in order to distribute overtime. Neither shall this Article require additional overtime to orient or train an employee to do the overtime work.
ARTICLE 14
REPORTING AND CALL IN TIME
SECTION 1.	REPORTING TIME A full-time employee who is required to report to work for full-time service (eight hours) shall be given a minimum of four (4) hours of work on the day of reporting. In the absence of at least four (4) hours of work, the employee shall receive four (4) hours of pay at the employee's regular straight-time hourly rate or overtime, whichever is applicable. A part-time employee who is scheduled for six (6) hours of work, or more, shall be given a minimum of two (2) hours of work on the day of reporting. However, an employee who reports for work, and who because of illness or physical disability cannot be employed for the protection of either the employee's own well-being or that of others, shall receive pay only for actual hours worked.
SECTION 2.	CALL-IN TIME A full-time employee who is called in because of an emergency shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours of pay at time-and-one-half (1.5) the employee's regular rate or compensatory time off (at the employee's option, unless payment in cash is prohibited by funding source or unavailability of funds as determined by the Department)	provided the employee:
A.	Has completed a regular work day and left the work	place for	at least thirty (30)	minutes; or
B.	Is called in on a non-work day; or
C.	Is called in early but will not work a continuous shift.
If compensatory time off is granted, the dates selected must be approved by the supervisor.
SECTION 3. EMERGENCY CAMPUS CLOSINGS Compensation for hours not worked or for extra hours worked due to University-wide or individual campus closings for weather or other emergencies is covered in emergency closing policy and procedures. Contact the appropriate Human Resources Department or your Chancellor's office for a copy of the current document.
ARTICLE 15 HOLIDAYS
SECTION 1.	OBSERVED HOLIDAYS Employees (including those on temporary appointments) who are appointed at a designated percentage time shall be entitled to a total of eleven (11) paid holidays each fiscal year. The holidays shall be seven (7) "observed" and four (4) "floating/personal."
The seven (7) "observed" holidays are:
20
Martin Luther King's Birthday Independence Day

New Year's Day Memorial Day Labor Day Christmas Day
There shall be four (4) "floating/personal" holidays scheduled annually.
A.	On the Twin Cities campus, three (3) of these holidays shall be scheduled by the University. One (1) will be designated as a personal holiday to be taken at the employee's discretion, with the supervisor's approval, in accordance with the University's guidelines on the use of personal holidays.
B.	Coordinate campuses, Minnesota Extension Service, and CUHCC shall establish their own policies for these days.
Observed holidays that fall on Saturday shall be observed on the preceding Friday. Observed holidays that fall on Sunday shall be observed on the following Monday. For employees whose schedules include Saturdays and/or Sundays, the observed holiday shall be on its actual day of occurrence instead of on the preceding Friday or following Monday.
SECTION 2.	HOLIDAY WORK An employee entitled to a paid holiday leave who is required to work on a holiday shall receive regular pay for the day plus additional pay or time off at the rate of time-and-one-half (1.5) the employee's regular rate of pay for the hours worked. Employees may choose between time off or pay for these hours unless payment in cash is prohibited by funding source or availability of funds as determined by the Department.
SECTION 3.	HOLIDAY TIME OFF When a holiday falls on an employee's day off, the employee shall receive an additional day off, or proportionate time off (based on the percentage time of appointment) as agreed upon between the
employee and the supervisor. If the employee and the supervisor cannot agree on the day to be taken within the pay period, the time shall be converted to compensatory time or paid in cash at the discretion of the Employer.
SECTION 4.	HOLIDAY PAY ELIGIBILITY To qualify for holiday pay, an employee must either work or be on an approved paid leave (such as vacation) on the employee's regularly scheduled work day before or following the holiday.
SECTION 5.	RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS When a religious holiday, not an "observed" holiday as provided in Section 2 of this Article, falls on an employee's regularly scheduled work day, the employee, using a personal floating holiday, vacation leave, or compensatory time off, if available, or leave without pay, shall be entitled to that day off to observe the religious holiday. An employee who chooses to observe such a religious holiday shall notify the employee's supervisor in writing at least twenty-one (21) calendar days prior to the religious holiday. Requests in excess of three (3) days per calendar year shall be granted at the discretion of the supervisor.
ARTICLE 16 VACATION

31 plus years (all hours after 62,401)	6.75 minutes/hour	468 hours
*Accrual rates and maximum accumulation rates are exclusive of time converted from sick leave, in accordance with Article 17, Sick Leave, Section 3, Sick Leave Conversion.
Employees shall accrue vacation leave for all straight-time paid work hours. A year of continuous service shall consist of two thousand eighty (2,080) straight time paid work hours or proportionate part thereof. Paid vacation is available for use the pay period in which it is earned, and each year of continuous employment, shall be extended by adding to such periods the number of work days the employee has been absent without pay. Vacation leave shall not accrue during periods of unpaid leave, except as provided for in Article 31, Union Rights, Section 5, Unpaid Leave Provisions.
The maximum amount of unused vacation an employee may accrue is two (2) years worth at the employee's current earning rate. Employees who change to a different accrual rate will maintain their higher maximum accumulation.
Each employee shall be informed of their current vacation accumulation and maximum accrual allowed on each pay check, or if that is not possible, a monthly written report of current accumulation and maximum accrual allowed shall be provided to the employee.
When any leave accumulation rate period of service ends within a pay period, the new vacation accrual rate starts the following pay period.
SECTION 3.	VACATION PERIODS Vacation shall be taken at times selected by employees, subject to supervisory approval. Within a Department, choice of available vacation time shall be determined by time in the Department provided the request is submitted at least thirty (30) days in
22
advance of the vacation period. Once a vacation request has been approved that request shall be honored and, an employee with more time in the Department shall not bump another employee from taking an approved vacation. Specific vacation request procedures may be implemented by Departments. While the Employer may limit the number of employees who may be gone at any one time based on staffing needs, the Employer shall not limit by procedure or rule the amount of earned vacation leave any one employee can take at any one time. The designated or appropriate administrator shall give reasonable consideration to vacation requests and shall respond promptly to any request and respond to any request submitted at least thirty (30) days in advance within five (5) calendar days of receipt of the written request.
Any employee who is about to lose vacation leave because s/he has been denied a vacation request made in accordance with a department's leave policy and will therefore reach the maximum accumulation, shall be entitled to take one (1) week of vacation to prevent such loss upon advance notice of seven (7) calendar days to his/her supervisor or shall be allowed to cash out one (1) week of vacation.
SECTION 4.	WORK DURING VACATION PERIOD Once a vacation has been approved, unless the circumstances present at the time it was approved have changed, it can be rescinded only by the Department head. If an employee is called to work while on approved vacation leave, the employee must be paid at time-and-one-half (1.5) the employee's regular rate for the hours worked.
SECTION 5.	VACATION RIGHTS An employee shall not be required to reduce below ten (10) days of vacation before using leave without pay.
Any employee with vacation eligible for use who leaves University employment shall be compensated for accumulated, unused vacation.
If a date of expected return from layoff is included in the layoff notice, an employee shall be allowed to leave his/her vacation accruals intact. If an employee does not return to employment within the one year specified in the notice of layoff, the accumulated vacation will be paid out at the salary rate in effect on the last day worked. If an employee fails to give at least two (2) weeks advance notice of a voluntary termination, compensation for accumulated, unused vacation shall be made as soon as possible.
Any employee who changes to a work schedule of less than 50% time shall be entitled to be paid for any unused portion of vacation leave.
ARTICLE 17 SICK LEAVE
SECTION 1.	ELIGIBILITY Employees (including those on temporary appointments) who are employed in one Department on a 50% time or greater appointment shall accumulate sick leave with pay.
SECTION 2.	ACCUMULATION
Sick leave shall accrue at the rate of three (3) minutes per straight time hour paid to a maximum of eighty (80) hours per pay period. Leave shall not accrue during periods of unpaid leave except as provided for in Article 31, Union Rights, Section 5, Unpaid Leave Provisions.
23
Sick leave accumulated for any one pay period is not available for use until the following pay period. An employee with available sick leave, who leaves University employment or who changes to a work schedule of less than 50% time shall lose unused sick leave. If an employee who has earned sick leave reduces his/her appointment because of a layoff situation, that employee shall keep the sick leave s/he has accrued and be able to use that leave according to this Article, even though that employee may not be eligible to accrue more sick leave.
Employees shall be informed of their total accumulated sick leave on each paycheck, or if that is not possible, shall be given a written report each month of their total accumulated sick leave.
If the supervisor and employee agree, an employee shall be allowed to use leave without pay for purposes identified in this Article rather than using accrued sick leave. If sick leave is exhausted, an employee shall be allowed to use vacation leave or overtime accruals for the reasons sick leave use is provided in this Article, unless the employee has discipline for abuse of sick leave in his/her personnel file, in which case the employee may use vacation and overtime accruals subject to the provisions of Article 16, Vacation and Article 13, Overtime.
SECTION 3. SICK LEAVE CONVERSION When a sick leave accumulation of four hundred (400) hours has been reached, one-quarter (1/4) of any sick leave accumulated thereafter may be credited to the employee's vacation accumulation if the employee's sick leave accumulation is maintained at four hundred (400) or more hours; three-quarters (3/4) of sick leave accumulated thereafter may be credited to sick leave. Sick leave accumulated prior to July 1, 1970 cannot be transferred to vacation under the provisions of this Article.
When a sick leave accumulation of eight hundred (800) hours has been reached, one-half (%) of any sick leave accumulated thereafter may be credited to the employee's vacation accumulation if the employee's sick leave accumulation is maintained at eight hundred (800) or more hours; one-half (%) of sick leave accumulated thereafter may be credited to sick leave.
SECTION 4. UTILIZATION Approved sick leave may be used by an employee who is unable to perform duties because of illness, injury, or pregnancy; or who would expose others to contagious or infectious diseases; or who must keep medical or dental care appointments.
Accumulated sick leave may be used to supplement Workers’ Compensation benefits during periods of lost work time due to compensable on-the-job illness or injury.
Approved sick leave may be used to care for or arrange care for an employee’s child, and up to five (5) days per incident may be used by an employee to care for or make arrangements for the care of an ill member of the employee’s immediate family. A department may approve an additional five (5) days of sick leave to care for or make arrangements for the care of an ill member of the employee’s immediate family provided this illness is covered by the FMLA. Immediate family as used in this portion of the Article shall mean spouse or Cohabiter, children (including foster children and stepchildren), parents, or parents-in-law or siblings of the employee and registered same sex domestic partner, children of the registered same sex domestic partner, or parents of the registered same sex domestic partner.
Accumulated sick leave, as approved by the supervisor, of up to two (2) days per year can be used by an employee to participate in a personal health maintenance program (e.g., weight control, stress management, stop smoking).
24
Five (5) days of accumulated sick leave shall be granted for bereavement leave per Article 18, Leaves of Absence, Section 2. Additionally, with the approval of the supervisor or department head, employees may use sick leave to serve as pallbearers or to attend funerals of individuals not identified above.
A designated or appropriate administrator may require an employee to leave the workplace:
1)	If the employee is unable to perform job responsibilities in an up-to-standard manner because of what appears to be a health condition; or
2)	If the employee may expose others in the workplace to illness or disease. Such time shall be charged against sick leave, if available.
Abuse of sick leave shall be one form of just cause for disciplinary action. Abuse shall be defined as use of paid sick leave for reasons other than those listed in this Article. Use of paid sick leave in a pattern such as Mondays, Fridays, or the day after payday is an example of a use of sick leave that may constitute abuse.
SECTION 5. REQUESTING SICK LEAVE
A.	Employees must request and receive approval for use of sick leave from the designated or appropriate administrator in the Department as soon as possible after the onset of illness.
B.	While supervisors must be informed of the general nature of an illness, such information shall be treated by the supervisor with appropriate confidentiality.
C.	In the case of extended or chronic illness, the designated or appropriate administrator in the Department may require statements from a physician or dentist which includes the anticipated date of return.
Upon request of the Employer, when the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that an employee has abused or is abusing sick leave, employees utilizing leave under this Article may be required to furnish a statement from a medical practitioner as defined in the Family Medical Leave Act stating that the practitioner finds the employee unable to work due to illness. Requests to furnish a statement from a medical practitioner may be oral or written. Oral requests shall be reduced to writing as soon as practicable. The written requests shall state the reason(s) for the request as well as the period of time that the employee will be required to furnish the statement. If an employee does not bring a medical practitioner's statement of illness when requested, the supervisor may deny the use of sick leave.
D.	If an employee becomes ill while on vacation leave and presents satisfactory proof of illness or injury, the designated or appropriate administrator in the Department may approve the use of sick leave in lieu of vacation leave.
NOTE: For information on disability leave without pay, see Article 18, Leaves of Absence, Section 6.
ARTICLE 18

In the case of emergencies, the request should be made as soon as possible after the emergency arises. Authorization for or denial of a leave of absence shall be furnished to the employee in writing by the immediate supervisor. All
25

SECTION 4.	LEAVES WITHOUT PAY
A.	Military leave shall be granted in accordance with statutory requirements.
B.	Appearance as an individual rather than as an officer or an employee of the University, whether voluntary or in response to a legal order, to appear and testify in private litigation. If an employee has vacation or compensatory time off available to use, the employee may choose to use that leave for this purpose.
C.	In accordance with the University’s policy on the Family Medical Leave Act, an employee shall be granted up to twelve (12) weeks unpaid leave to care for a family member. During this period of time, the Employer shall continue to make the Employer's contribution to the employee's health insurance as though the employee were on payroll. An employee may also be eligible to use sick leave under the provisions of Article 17.
26
D.	An employee shall be granted up to sixteen (16) hours unpaid time per year for business connected to children's schooling (i.e., conferences).	If an employee has vacation or
compensatory time off available to use, the employee may choose to use that leave for this purpose.
E.	Other personal leaves may be granted at any time to any employee for any period of time for personal purposes with department head approval. This leave may include personal unpaid educational leave to attend a University educational program leading toward a university degree.
Should more than one (1) employee in a work location request personal leave at the same time and staffing not allow approval of more than one (1) employee on leave, the employee with the most University Seniority shall get the leave. However, personal or educational leave may be denied if other previously approved leaves do not allow staffing flexibility to grant additional leaves.
SECTION 5.	PARENTAL LEAVE
A.	A two (2) week paid parental leave of absence compensated at the employee’s current percentage appointment shall be granted to employees who are biological or adoptive parents, when requested in conjunction with the birth or adoption of a child, or employees whose registered same sex domestic partners are biological or adoptive parents.
The employee must have completed nine (9) consecutive months of employment at an average of twenty (20) hours or more paid work time per week. This parental leave shall not be charged against the employee’s vacation or sick leave.
The employee must give notice of intent to use parental leave to his/her supervisor at least four (4) weeks in advance of the anticipated leave, except under unusual circumstances.
The parental leave shall begin at a time requested by the employee, although the leave may not begin more than two (2) weeks prior to the due date or anticipated adoption or six (6) weeks after the birth or adoption. In the case where the child must remain in the hospital longer than the birth mother, the leave must begin no later than six (6) weeks after the child leaves the hospital. This leave must be consecutive and without interruption and must be taken during the term of appointment.
A female biological parent may also use up to twenty (20) days of accumulated sick leave immediately following the parental leave.
When a woman is unable to perform the duties of her job due to pregnancy, additional accumulated sick leave may be used. If no sick leave is available, an employee may use accumulated vacation leave in accordance with Article 16, Vacation.

SECTION 6.	DISABILITY LEAVE A designated or appropriate administrator may grant a leave of absence without pay for periods of temporary disability due to sickness or injury and shall grant a leave of absence without pay as required under the Family Medical Leave Act. During this leave, the designated or appropriate administrator may periodically require the employee to submit a certificate from the attending physician or from a designated physician. If the employee fails or refuses to
27
supply such certificate, or if the certificate does not clearly show sufficient disability to prevent the employee from performing assigned duties, the designated or appropriate administrator may cancel such leave and require the employee to report for duty on a specified date.
Sick leave without pay may be granted to an employee who is considered permanently and totally disabled according to any disability insurance program in which the University participates. Should employees on such leave recover to the point that they are employable, they shall be treated as though they were laid off and will be eligible to compete for vacancies in accordance with the layoff provisions of this Agreement. An employee on this type of leave will not be allowed to replace or "bump" an incumbent from the employee's most recently held position, unless approved by the hiring authority.
SECTION 7.	REINSTATEMENT AFTER LEAVE Except as provided in this Agreement or by Minnesota law, an employee who returns from a leave of absence without pay has the right to return to employment in the same Department and in the same classification at the expiration of the leave. An employee who is laid off before the leave expires shall be entitled to the layoff provisions of the Agreement.
An employee returning from an unpaid leave of absence shall be compensated at the same rate of pay received when the leave commenced plus any non- discretionary increases which became effective during the time of the leave. For increases requiring a specific length of service in order to be eligible, any time off the payroll of four (4) consecutive months or more will extend the eligibility date for the next increase by the entire time off the payroll.

The UPlan will make a UPlan Summary describing these coverages available to all insurance eligible employees. The UPlan Summary shall be provided no less than biennially and prior to the beginning of the insurance year. New insurance eligible employees shall receive a UPlan Summary within thirty (30) days of their enrollment in the plan.
SECTION 2.	ELIGIBILITY FOR GROUP PARTICIPATION This section describes eligibility to participate in the Group Insurance Program.
A.	Employees - Basic Eligibility. Employees may participate in the University of Minnesota Employee Insurance Plan if they are scheduled to work at the University with an appointment of at least fifty percent (50%) time and lasting at least three (3) months in duration.
B.	Employees - Special Eligibility. The following employees are also eligible to participate in the Group Insurance Program.
1.	Employees with a Work-Related Injury/Disability. An employee who was off the University payroll due to work-related injury or work-related disability may continue to participate in the Group Insurance Program as long as such an employee receives Workers' Compensation payments, or while the Worker's Compensation claim is pending.
2.	Totally Disabled Employees. Consistent with Minn. Statute 62A.148, certain totally disabled employees may continue to participate in the Group Insurance Program.
3.	Retired Employees. An employee who retires from University service, at age 55 with five (5) years of service, age 50 with fifteen (15) years of service or at any age with thirty (30) years of service, who is eligible to maintain participation in the UPlan, may indefinitely maintain medical and dental coverage with the University at his/her own
30
expense. Medicare coverage is primary for retirees over 65, and for totally disabled employees who qualify for Medicare, and must coordinate with the UPlan Retiree Medical plan options. If retired or totally disabled employees elect not to continue coverage in the UPlan at the time they leave employment, they may not elect to do so at a later date. (see also Section 5E.)
C.	Dependents Eligible dependents for the purposes of this Article are as follows:
1.	Spouse. The spouse of an eligible employee (if not legally separated). For the purposes of medical coverage, if that spouse works full time for an employer other than the University and elects to receive either credits or cash (1) in place of medical coverage; or (2) in addition to a medical plan with seven hundred fifty dollar ($750) or greater deductible through his/her employing organization, s/he is not eligible to be a covered dependent under medical coverage for the purposes of this Article. If both spouses work for the University, one employee may elect family coverage and cover the other employee as a dependent.
2.	Domestic Partner. For purposes of medical, dental and optional coverages, to the extent possible the registered same-sex Domestic Partner of an eligible employee, who meets the criteria in the University’s Domestic Partner Registration process, shall be offered the same coverage as an employee’s Spouse.
3.	Children and Grandchildren. An eligible employee's unmarried dependent children and unmarried dependent grandchildren: (1) through age twenty-four (24) or (2) a handicapped child or grandchild, regardless of age or marital status, who is incapable of self-sustaining employment by reason of mental retardation, mental illness or physical disability and is chiefly dependent on the employee for support. The handicapped dependent shall be eligible to continue coverage as long as s/he continues to be handicapped and dependent, unless coverage terminates under the contract. Children or grandchildren of current employees who become handicapped after they are no longer eligible dependents under (1) above do not become eligible dependents due to their change in health status. Handicapped children or grandchildren of a newly hired University employee will be considered eligible dependents if there has been no break in coverage between the employee’s coverage through the previous employer and the coverage under the UPlan.
"Dependent Child" includes an employee's: (1) biological child, (2) child legally adopted by or placed for adoption with the employee, (3) foster child, (4) stepchild, and (5) dependent child of the employee’s registered same-sex Domestic Partner. To be considered a dependent child, a foster child must be dependent on the employee for his/her principal support and maintenance and be placed by the court in the custody of the employee. To be considered a dependent child, a stepchild or dependent child of a registered same-sex Domestic Partner must maintain residence with the employee and be dependent upon the employee for his/her principal support and maintenance.
"Dependent Grandchild" includes an employee's: (1) grandchild placed in the legal custody of the employee, (2) grandchild legally adopted by the employee or placed for adoption with the employee, or (3) grandchild who is the dependent child of the employee's unmarried dependent child. Under (1) and (3) above, the grandchild must be dependent upon the employee for principal support and maintenance.
If both spouses or registered same-sex Domestic Partners work for the University, either spouse or registered same-sex Domestic Partner, but not both, may cover their
31
eligible dependent children or grandchildren. This restriction also applies to two divorced, legally separated, unmarried or registered same-sex Domestic Partner employees whose partnership has been terminated who share legal responsibility for their eligible dependent children or grandchildren.
D.	Continuation Coverage. Consistent with state and federal laws, certain employees, former employees, dependents, and former dependents may continue group medical, dental, and/or life coverage at their own expense for a fixed length of time. As of the date of this Agreement, state and federal laws allow certain group coverages to be continued if they would otherwise terminate due to:
1.	Termination of employment (except for gross misconduct);
2.	Layoff;
3.	Reduction of hours to an ineligible status;
4.	Dependent child becoming ineligible due to change in age, marital status, registered same-sex Domestic Partner status, or financial support (in the case of a foster child or stepchild);
5.	Death of employee; or
6.	Divorce.
SECTION 3.	ELIGIBILITY FOR EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION This section describes eligibility for an Employer Contribution toward the cost of coverage.
A.	Full Employer Contribution - Basic Eligibility. The following employees covered by this Agreement receive the full Employer Contribution:
1.	Employees who are scheduled to work at least thirty (30) hours weekly for a period of three (3) consecutive months or more in any twelve (12) consecutive months.
2.	Employees who are scheduled to work at least thirty (30) hours weekly for at least nine (9) months in duration during any twelve (12) consecutive months, are eligible for the full employer contribution for the entire twelve (12) month period.

2.	Work-Related Injury/Disability. An employee who receives an Employer Contribution and who is off the University payroll due to a work-related injury or a work-related disability remains eligible for an Employer Contribution as long as such an employee receives Workers' Compensation payments.
C.	Maintaining Eligibility for Employer Contribution.
1.	General. An employee who receives an Employer Contribution maintains that eligibility as long as the employee meets the Employer Contribution eligibility requirements, and appears on a University payroll for a least one (1) full working day during each payroll period. This requirement does not apply to employees who receive an Employer Contribution while on layoff as described in Section 3B1, or while eligible for Workers' Compensation payment as described in Section 3B2.
2.	Unpaid Leave of Absence. If an employee is on an unpaid leave of absence, vacation leave, compensatory time, or sick leave cannot be used for the purpose of maintaining eligibility for an Employer Contribution by keeping the employee on a University payroll for one (1) working day per pay period.
32
3.	School Year Employment. If an employee is employed on the basis of a school year and such employment contemplates absences from the University payroll during the summer months or vacation periods scheduled by the employer which occur during the regular school year, the employee shall nonetheless remain eligible for an Employer Contribution, provided that the employee appears on the regular payroll for at least one (1) working day in the payroll period immediately preceding such absences and returns to work in the pay period following the normal scheduled absence.
4.	An employee who is on an approved FMLA leave or on a Voluntary Reduction in Hours as provided elsewhere in this Agreement maintains eligibility for an employer contribution.
SECTION 4.	EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION For employees eligible for an Employer Contribution as described in Section 3, the Employer Contribution amounts and rules in effect on June 30, 2007, will continue through the 2007 insurance contract year. The amount of the Employer Contribution will be determined as follows beginning on the first day of the 2008 insurance contract year. For purposes of this Article, the 2008 insurance contract year shall be the period beginning January 1, 2008 and ending December 31, 2008.
A.	Contribution Formula - Medical Coverage.
1.	Employee Coverage The employee’s cost for employee-only coverage will be ten percent (10%) of the employee-only rate for the Base Medical Plan. If the employee chooses a plan other than the Base Medical Plan, the employee’s cost will be the standard employee rate established for that plan (i.e., the rate applicable where it has not been modified to be a zone’s Base Medical Plan.)

ARTICLE 21 SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES
STATEMENT OF PHILOSOPHY The University and the Union recognize that from time to time work related problems will arise in employment relationships not specifically addressed in this agreement. Because solutions to these problems enhance the quality of work for employees and the effectiveness of the University's programs, the parties wish to encourage the expeditious resolution of such problems in the spirit of partnership and mutual respect.
In pursuit of this joint understanding, the parties encourage resolution of such problems consistent with the following principles:
•	Employees and supervisors are encouraged to seek resolution of work-related problems at the lowest possible level.
•	Given that open communication between those involved is essential in trying to reach solutions acceptable to all involved, and since confidential treatment of information fosters open communication, it is imperative that those who participate in problemsolving respect the privacy of individuals involved and agree to treat issues in a confidential manner to the extent provided by law.
•	Those directly involved in the matter have an opportunity to be heard when participating in a problem-solving process.
•	The process of problem resolution is intended to be flexible and should encourage the use of all resources appropriate to the specific issues including existing University committees or conflict resolution/problem-solving resources.
•	Employee assistance programs available at the University may be helpful for employee(s) experiencing problems. The parties should inform employee(s) about employee assistance programs available at the University.
These statements of philosophy are not subject to the grievance procedure nor shall either party present this statement to an arbitrator as evidence or argument in connection with any disputes that may go to arbitration.
SECTION 1.	GENERAL PROVISIONS
A.	A grievance shall be defined as an alleged violation of the expressed terms of this Agreement. B.	The term "days" as used in this Article shall mean calendar days.

The Union shall request arbitration within 90 calendar days of the filing of the letter of intent to go to arbitration. Within ten (10) calendar days from the Union's request for arbitration the Union and the University shall select an arbitrator from an agreed upon list of arbitrators. The University and the Union may mutually agree to an arbitrator outside their agreed upon list. If the parties are unable to agree on a list of arbitrators, then the parties shall select, within ten (10) calendar days of the Union's request for arbitration, an arbitrator from a panel provided by the Bureau of Mediation Services or the American Arbitration Association. The parties shall have ten (10) calendar days following receipt of the list to select an arbitrator in the following manner: The Union shall have the right to strike one name from the list, the University shall then strike one name, and the process will be repeated and the remaining person shall be the arbitrator.
The arbitrator will then be jointly notified by the parties of selection with a request for available hearing dates. The parties agree that arbitration hearings involving possible monetary liabilities shall be given first priority in scheduling.

Should the Union fail to appeal a decision within the time limits specified, it shall be considered settled on the basis of the Employer's last answer and all further proceedings shall be dropped.
Unavailability of the designated Union representative shall not waive the time limits herein except as provided. If the University fails to respond to a grievance within the time limits specified, the grievance shall be considered denied at that Step and may be appealed to the next Step within the time frame specified. The time limits and sequence of steps provided in this Article shall be strictly observed but may be extended or modified by prior written agreement of the parties.
SECTION 7.	PROCESSING All preparation and investigation of grievances shall be held when the grievant and Union representative are on non-work time. The designated Union representative and the grievant may attend grievance, and problem solving, per Article 31, Section 1H, meetings with the University administrative designee(s) during working hours without loss of pay.
ARTICLE 22 DISCIPLINE
STATEMENT OF PHILOSOPHY If supervisors notice work-related behavior problems, they are encouraged to bring these problems to the attention of the employee. When such communication takes place before disciplinary action is initiated, it may often be sufficient to correct the work-related
45
behavior problems. Employees or supervisors are encouraged to consult Union or Human Resource representatives in order to help solve the problem.
These statements of philosophy are not subject to the grievance procedure nor shall either party present this statement to an arbitrator as evidence or argument in connection with any disputes that may go to arbitration.
SECTION 1.	DISCIPLINE FOR JUST CAUSE Disciplinary action shall be taken only for just cause, however probationary employees may be discharged without just cause and shall have no right to grieve discharge (see Article 7, Probationary Period). Disciplinary action, except discharge, shall have as its purpose the correction or elimination of incorrect work-related behavior by an employee.
Supervisors may not take disciplinary action against an employee who, in good faith, reports a violation of any federal or state law or regulation to a governmental body or law enforcement official. Disciplinary action may not be taken against an employee who is requested by a public agency to participate in an investigation, hearing, or inquiry, as well as an employee who refuses to participate in any activity that the employee, in good faith, believes violates state or federal law.
SECTION 2.	COACHING The normal corrective disciplinary procedure shall consist of three (3) steps, except that initial minor work deficiencies will normally be privately brought to the employee's attention through coaching. Coaching may include, but is not limited to instructions, directions, or prompting to the employee. Coaching provides feedback on job performance and is intended to be corrective and constructive. Coaching shall not be considered disciplinary.
SECTION 3.	INVESTIGATORY MEETING Twenty four (24) hours notice of investigatory meetings shall be given to the employee whenever possible. Supervisors are encouraged to give such notice in writing. The employee is entitled to a Union representative at an investigatory meeting which may result in disciplinary action against the employee. However, neither the refusal of the employee's Union Steward or Union representative to participate nor their unavailability shall abridge the Employer's right to conduct an investigation. The Employer shall provide a written summary of the investigation results to the employee, and the Union if it is involved in representing the employee during the investigation, within seven (7) calendar days of the conclusion of the investigation. Investigation results may include, but are not limited to, exoneration of the employee or the conclusion that disciplinary action is not to be taken at this time. Where a change in policy or procedure is made as a result of the investigation, the Employer will provide written notification of the change to all affected employees.
SECTION 4.	DISCIPLINARY MEETING Supervisors shall give employees a forty-eight (48) hour notice, whenever possible, of planned disciplinary meetings. Supervisors are encouraged to give such notice in writing. If the Steward and the employee agree, the disciplinary meeting can be held less than forty-eight (48) hours after notification, but the Steward or employee cannot refuse to hold an immediate meeting if circumstances require it. Supervisors shall give employees the opportunity to have a Union Steward present for an oral warning, a written warning, a notice of suspension, or a notice of discharge. Employees shall be given an opportunity to hear the evidence and respond to the evidence supporting suspension or discharge while still in pay status. Non supervisory coworkers, other than a Union Steward of the employee's choice, shall not be present in another employee's disciplinary meeting.
In cases of immediate suspension or discharge, the supervisor will meet with the Steward and employee prior to the employee being required to leave the facility. However, neither the refusal of
46
the Union Steward to participate nor his/her unavailability shall abridge the Employer's right to take disciplinary action.
SECTION 5.	CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF DISCIPLINE Disciplinary action taken by the Employer should be conducted away from coworkers and the public, except that action taken in accordance with Section 5 of this Article shall not be a violation of this provision. Disciplinary investigations and meetings are to be treated confidentially by all concerned. The University may release public information on disciplinary action(s) per the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act and/or other applicable law. Grievances citing violation of only this section shall not result in a remedy that overturns the disciplinary action.
SECTION 6.	CORRECTIVE DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE The normal corrective disciplinary procedure shall consist of three (3) steps, except that initial minor work deficiencies shall be privately brought to the employee's attention through coaching. Both parties agree that the order of discipline below is the progressive order of discipline; however, situations may arise where it will be appropriate to depart from this order.
A.	An oral warning shall be given to the employee specifying the nature of any incorrect work-related behavior and pointing out that non-correction will result in further disciplinary action. Oral warnings shall be documented by use of a standard University form that shall be sent to the department/administrative unit file with a copy provided to the employee.
B.	A written warning shall be given to the employee specifying the nature of any continuing incorrect work-related behavior and pointing out that non-correction will result in further disciplinary action.
C.	A notice of suspension shall be given to the employee with a written explanation specifying the nature of any continuing incorrect work-related behavior and pointing out that non-correction will result in further disciplinary action.
Discipline shall be documented in writing to the employee. Discipline beyond oral warning will be copied to the employee’s official personnel file. The employee shall sign the disciplinary letter to acknowledge discipline has occurred and shall receive a copy of the disciplinary letter. However, refusal of the employee to sign the letter will not invalidate the disciplinary action. Such letter shall include a statement of the rationale for the disciplinary action taken. A copy of the disciplinary letter will be provided to the Steward when written warning, suspension or discharge is involved.
SECTION 7.	DISCHARGE Any demand by the Employer for an employee's resignation shall be considered a discharge.
The Employer shall have the right to discharge an employee who:
A.	Is judged by the Employer to be guilty of continuing non-correction of improper work-related behavior after suspension as specified in Section 6C above;
B.	Endangers in a willful or careless manner, the safety of students, patients, the public, himself/herself or other employees;
C.	Causes a liability for the Employer by willful or careless violation of University procedures or policies;
D.	Is judged by the Employer to be guilty of serious violations of generally accepted standards of employee conduct such as, but not limited to, theft, fraud, willful or careless destruction of Employer property, gross insubordination or falsifying of documents;
E.	Fails to pass probation except as provided under Article 7, Probationary Period;
F.	Engages in behavior other than A-E above which in the Employer's judgment meets accepted just cause termination tests.
47
Should the Employer feel there is just cause for immediately discharging an employee who has passed probation, the employee may be placed on a paid leave during which the Union and the employee shall be notified immediately and be given an opportunity to hear and respond to the evidence supporting the discharge.
SECTION 8.	DISCIPLINE RECORDS IN FILE Written allegations of improper employee behavior shall be purged from departmental files after one (1) year whether or not those allegations have resulted in coaching or discipline. Such allegations would only be placed in an official personnel file if they are part of an official disciplinary action. If no disciplinary action is taken against an employee for one (1) work year following an oral or written reprimand, all records of such oral or written reprimand shall be removed from the employee's personnel file and destroyed. If no disciplinary action is taken for two (2) years after a suspension or three (3) years after a suspension for patient abuse, sexual harassment, or physical assault, all records of those suspensions shall be removed from the employee's personnel file and destroyed. For suspensions for patient abuse, sexual harassment, or physical assault, the record as a whole and the totality of the circumstances therein shall be retained.
SECTION 9.	APPEAL All disciplinary actions taken by the Employer may be processed through the procedure for Settlement of Disputes per Article 21, except for an employee's failure to pass probation, as provided in Article 7, Probationary Period. The Union shall have the right to initiate a grievance involving discharge of an employee who has passed probation at the second step of the grievance procedure in accordance with the provisions of Article 21, Settlement of Disputes.
ARTICLE 23
PERSONNEL RECORDS
The official personnel file is the file maintained by the University Human Resources Department or by the appropriate Human Resources Department of the coordinate campuses. No written documentation of prior disciplinary action shall be used as the basis for disciplinary action unless it has been entered into the employee's official personnel file, or the employee has been provided written notification of recent disciplinary action. Written allegations of improper employee behavior that have not been used as a basis for coaching or are more than one (1) year old shall not be used as the basis for disciplinary action, nor shall they be placed in the official personnel file. Disciplinary action documents shall be sent to the appropriate Human Resources Department, where they shall be date stamped upon receipt, and shall be given priority in filing.
Any employee shall be allowed to review all documents held in his/her official personnel file. Requests for such review shall be in writing and addressed to the appropriate Human Resources Department. Following receipt of such request, arrangements shall be made for the employee to review his/her file in the presence of a Human Resources Department representative. No one may remove material from an employee's official personnel file unless authorized to do so by the head of the appropriate Human Resources Department or his/her designee.
Upon receipt of written authorization by the employee, his/her Union representative may schedule an appointment to review the employee's file. Copies of any document in the file related to a disciplinary action will be made upon request by the Union Representative. There will be no charge for the first ten (10) copies; a charge for all copies greater than ten will be at the departmental rate.
48
Employees have the right to include or update a reasonable amount of information in their personnel files that may be pertinent to their job performance. Employees shall also be able to respond to performance appraisal or disciplinary materials placed in their official file. (See Article 22, Discipline, Section 6, regarding employee signature on standard University form attached to the written discipline.)
Materials related to job performance or discipline that are placed in an employee's official personnel file by management must be copied to the employee. Materials placed in the official file by the employee must be copied to the employee's immediate supervisor. Materials that are designated for an employee's official personnel file should be filed promptly.
ARTICLE 24 SENIORITY
SECTION 1.	SENIORITY DEFINITION Seniority is defined as the length of service in continuing or temporary positions. In certain situations, time in supplemental positions may count towards seniority, as provided for in Article 6, Section 3A.2. Time in designated percentage appointments of 36% or greater will be counted for all forms of seniority defined in this article. Seniority will be counted for time acquired both before and after the certification of the bargaining unit. For temporary appointments see Article 6, Temporary Appointments.
SECTION 2.	CLASSIFICATION SENIORITY Classification seniority is length of service in a particular classification in the bargaining unit per Section 1. An employee accumulates and retains classification seniority in each of the classifications in which the employee has served. Classification seniority under the new classification system implemented on March 6, 2006, includes all classification seniority earned in any of the classifications grouped together into each new classification.
SECTION 3.	UNIVERSITY SENIORITY University Seniority is an employee's length of service in positions per Section 1. University Seniority shall be used as a tie breaker in seniority, in overtime distribution, in hiring off the layoff list, and in being considered for vacant positions. (Article 5, Recruitment and Employment, Section 3A and 3C).
However, time spent outside of the bargaining unit shall not count as University seniority for employees in computing seniority for hiring off the layoff list.
SECTION 4.	BREAKS IN SERVICE/RESTORATION OF SENIORITY The seniority record of an employee having a percent-time appointment shall be interrupted at any time the employee's employment with the University ends.
No seniority is accrued during the period of a break in service. Except as provided in Article 24, Section 5, an employee's seniority shall be reinstated whenever the employee returns. Prior service shall be added into all types of seniority.
SECTION 5.	REINSTATEMENT Employees who are hired off the layoff list, or former employees who are hired within three (3) years of their termination, who were employed on a percentage appointment of at least 50% and who are re-employed in a position of at least 50% time shall have these items reinstated: unused sick leave per Article 17; vacation leave accumulation rate and
49
eligibility per Article 16. Former employees whose employment with the University was terminated pursuant to a settlement agreement are not eligible for reinstatement of seniority.
SECTION 6. SENIORITY ROSTERS The Employer agrees to furnish the Union each January 31 and July 31 with rosters of all employees who accrue seniority, their current and prior classifications, and start date in each classification and University start date per Section 1. Employees who have accepted positions outside the bargaining unit do not accrue class seniority in the bargaining unit when employed in positions outside the bargaining unit, but retain prior seniority earned in the bargaining unit. When two (2) or more employees have the same classification seniority date, ties shall be broken by recognizing the employee with the greater University seniority first. If a tie still continues, the employee's seniority position shall be determined by lot.
A roster shall be posted on line at http://www1.umn.edu/ohr/er/rosters/index.html. Collegiate/Administrative Units and departments shall provide notification to employees where the roster is available for review. Work Units shall maintain a hard copy that is made available to employees upon request.
SECTION 7. APPEALS Employees shall have thirty (30) calendar days from the date of notice in Section 6 or from return to work after a leave of absence of more than fourteen (14) calendar days to notify the appropriate Human Resources Department in writing of any disagreements over the Seniority Roster. Appeals are limited to changes since the previous posting. The challenges shall be limited to a review of official University documents located in the employee's file.
After the close of the appeal period, the Employer shall post an addendum of any changes to the Seniority Roster.
The Employer may make corrections to the Seniority Roster during the thirty (30) calendar day appeal period. Between postings, the Union and the Employer may agree in writing to changes after the appeal period. Such changes shall be incorporated in the next Seniority Roster and be so identified.
ARTICLE 25
LAYOFF AND RECALL
SECTION 1.	LAYOFF POLICY The Employer may lay off an employee because of abolition of a position or involuntary reduction of an employee's appointment due to shortage of work or funds, or other reasons beyond the employee's control which do not reflect discredit on the employee, or offer alternatives to layoff as provided in the Memorandum of Understanding, Alternatives to Layoff.
The Employer shall not lay off a bargaining unit employee and subsequently assign the majority of the work of that position to students or supplemental employees.
SECTION 2.	ELIGIBILITY FOR LAYOFF RIGHTS An employee who has passed probation in a continuing position of 36% or greater appointment and who, as determined by the Employer, is qualified for the position into which s/he is exercising bumping rights, is eligible for layoff rights defined below. Employees in Temporary appointments, see Section 7G.
An employee who is laid off while on disability leave, parental leave, family leave, or leave for workers' compensation shall receive layoff notice at the time as provided in this article. When an employee returns from disability leave, parental leave, family leave, or leave for workers'
50
compensation to a position that has been eliminated, the employee shall have the right to exercise bumping and layoff rights as provided in Article 25. Employees on parental leave shall have the right to go on the layoff list any time after receiving layoff notice until the expiration of the approved leave. An employee returning from parental leave shall have the right to exercise bumping and layoff rights at the time s/he returns from parental leave. In the case of disability leave, family leave, or workers' compensation, the employee shall have the right to exercise bumping and layoff rights at the time the employee is able to return from disability leave, family leave, or workers' compensation.
SECTION 3.	DEFINITION OF LAYOFF The layoff procedure for those eligible under Section 2 shall come into effect when any of the following occurs:
A.	When the Employer implements a continuing reduction of the percentage appointment of an employee appointed at 100% time or abolishes the position. The Employer may reduce the appointment of an employee appointed at 100% down as far as 90% without layoff protections coming into effect.
B.	When the Employer implements a reduction of a twelve (12) month appointment by more than four (4) weeks.
C.	When the Employer implements a continuing reduction of the percentage appointment of an employee appointed at less than 100% time which reduces the employee's current percentage appointment below benefit line: this means a reduction below 75% for a 75-99% appointment or below 50% for a 50-74% appointment or below 36% for a 36-49% appointment.
D.	For employees in positions identified as less than twelve (12) month appointments whenever the period of working time is reduced by more than four (4) weeks.
SECTION 4.	PRELIMINARY TO LAYOFF REASSIGNMENT PROVISIONS.
At least twenty-eight (28) calendar days before the effective date of a layoff, the Union will receive notice of the approximate number of positions and probable classes affected by the impending layoff, except in emergency situations.
Upon request of the Union, the Department shall meet with a Union representative and affected employee(s), and other participants the Department deems appropriate, to discuss the impending layoff and possible alternatives to layoff and advise employee(s) of their rights under this Article. This discussion is not subject to the grievance process and shall not delay the effective date of the impending layoff.
The Employer and the Union agree that employees in the affected Department may volunteer for layoff or hour reductions but this shall not require extending the effective date of the layoff. Employees may also have options available under the Memorandum of Understanding, Alternatives to Layoff.
Departments may offer vacancies or reassignments in the same class, transferable classes, or lower class, in those units where layoffs have been announced and/or have occurred to remaining qualified employees in order of University seniority before these vacancies are posted.
SECTION 5.	LAYOFF NOTICE Employee(s) whose positions have been abolished or reduced as described above shall be notified in writing at least twenty-eight (28) calendar days before the effective date of an employee's layoff, except in emergencies. Employees who will be bumped by another employee shall be notified in writing at least twenty one (21) calendar days before the effective date of the bump, except in emergencies. A copy of the layoff notice, which must identify the specific position(s) to which an employee has rights to bump, will be sent to the appropriate Human Resources Department and to the Union and shall include the reasons for the abolition or
51
reduction of the position as per Section 1, an explanation of the employee's bumping rights, and a reference to the possible impact of layoff on unemployment benefits should bumping rights not be exercised. Should a layoff notice fail to include the specific position to which an employee has bumping rights or fail to identify if there are no bumping rights, then a new layoff notice of twenty one (21) or fourteen (14) days shall be issued, and a new deadline is established for the decision whether or not to bump.
Once layoff notice has been issued, affected employees shall be granted up to one and one-half (1.5) straight time paid hours per week to interview for other University positions. Time in excess of one and one-half (1.5) hours may be charged to accumulated vacation leave or compensatory time or be taken without pay. The employee must request such time off from his/her supervisor.
If an employee with a continuing appointment is not hired in a vacancy per Article 5, Recruitment and Employment, Section 3A, or does not take one of the Alternatives to Layoff identified in the MOU, the bumping procedures detailed below shall come into effect upon the effective date of the layoff. (See also Section 7D and Section 10, paragraph 2).
SECTION 6.	BUMPING PROCEDURES Employee(s) shall bump in the following order (with respect to the “applicable definition of layoff,” please see (E) below):
A.	The employee shall bump in the same Department, to the position occupied by the least senior employee that is in the same class, immediate geographic area, and within the applicable definition of layoff or, if the employee has no bumping right and chooses to do so, to a definition of layoff which provides less work time, per Section 3A-D, that is held by the least senior employee by University seniority within the class. If no such position exists,
B.	The employee shall bump in the same Collegiate/Administrative Seniority Unit to the position occupied by the least senior employee who is in the same class, immediate geographic area, and within the applicable definition of layoff or, if the employee has no bumping right and chooses to do so, to a definition of layoff which provides less work time, per Section 3A-D that is held by the least senior employee in the class by University seniority. If no such position exists,
C.	The employee shall bump in the same Department to the position in a lower class in which the employee has passed probation in the Department, in the same immediate geographic area, and within the applicable definition of layoff or, if the employee has no bumping right and so chooses to do so, to a definition of layoff which provides less work time, per Section 3A-D that is held by the least senior employee in the class by University seniority. If no such position exists,
D.	The employee's name shall be placed on the layoff list.
E.	For employees who have voluntarily reduced their percentage appointment since July 1, 2002 and who did so in response to a lack of department or college funds, the employer will provide the following. If such employees are laid off within two years of the date of their voluntary reduction, such employees shall be allowed a one-time option to exercise their layoff rights at either their former, or their current, definition of layoff. This option shall be available only to those employees laid off from the department in which they took the voluntary reduction.
F.	Immediate Geographic Area. Each of the distinct geographic areas listed here shall be separate immediate geographic areas:
1.	Twin Cities campus and the surrounding metropolitan areas including Rosemount, Chaska, Excelsior, and Navarre, and Bethel.
2.	Duluth campus.
3.	Crookston campus and Northwest Research and Outreach Center.

Extension - Immediate Geographic Area - see attached MOU (pg 85)
SECTION 7.	LIMITATIONS ON VACANCY, BUMPING RIGHTS AND PROCEDURES
A.	Prior Class Rights. If an employee is eligible to bump to more than one previously held classification, the bumping options shall be applied to those classifications in the inverse order in which they were held.
B.	Rights of Bumping Employees. Employees who are bumped may also have bumping rights as defined and covered under this Article.
C.	Qualifications. An employee may only bump to positions for which the employer has determined s/he is qualified, that is, that the employee meets the essential qualifications and existing measurable, job related selection criterion as applied by the Department based on the duties currently assigned to the position.
D.	Acceptance of Vacancies. Before bumping, and in accordance with Article 5, Recruitment and Employment, Section 3a, an employee must take a vacant position for which the Employer has determined s/he is qualified in the same classification, Collegiate/Administrative Seniority Unit and immediate geographic area, within the applicable definition of layoff per Section 3A-D which provides the same salary. If such a vacancy is not accepted the employee will no longer be eligible to exercise bumping rights, but may have layoff list rights per Section 10, paragraph 2. The hiring department shall offer salary to the employee as provided in Section 11.
E.	Acceptance of Bump. An employee shall bump to any continuing position for which the Employer determines the employee is qualified, in the same classification and immediate geographic area per Section 6, and within the applicable definition of layoff per Section 3A-D or be placed on the layoff list (see Section 11).
F.	Probationary Employee Limitations. An employee only has bumping rights to classes in which s/he has passed probation in the Department.
An employee who has not passed probation in the abolished or reduced time position shall not have rights to bump. The employee may have rights to a previously held position as detailed in Article 7, Probationary Period, Section 6.
G.	Rights in Temporary Positions. Employees on Temporary appointments are eligible for layoff rights only as specifically provided under this Article.
Employees on continuing appointments may not bump employees on Supplemental or Temporary appointments. Employees on continuing appointments may be reassigned to Supplemental or Temporary appointments only at the discretion of the Employer.
If an employee on a continuing appointment is reassigned into a posted or non-posted temporary position, the employee will retain the status of a continuing employee and will continue to accrue all seniority and maintain other contract rights of a continuing employee.
If an employee on a posted temporary appointment is reassigned into a non-posted temporary position, the employee will retain the status of a posted temporary employee and will continue to accrue all seniority and maintain other contract rights of a posted temporary employee.
53
After successful completion of probation, employees on temporary appointments whose appointments have been reduced or abolished or who are bumped due to the reassignment of a continuing employee shall not have bumping rights but shall have the right to be placed on the layoff list.
H.	Layoff Right Retention. In bumping, and in rehiring from the layoff list, employees may have to serve probation as required in Article 7, Probationary Period. However, in this bump or rehire situation, if the employee fails to pass probation, the employee shall be placed on the layoff list per Section 8, paragraph 2. This option may be exercised twice. Failure to pass probation a third time will exclude the employee from all rights to return to the layoff list. (See Article 7, Probationary Period.) A right to return to the layoff list is forfeited if an employee is discharged from the University for disciplinary reasons.
I.	Retraction of Bump. An employee who has elected to bump may not retract that election if the incumbent of the position into which the employee would bump has left the position prior to the effective date of the bump.
SECTION 8.	LAYOFF LISTS The University shall maintain a list of all employees who have been laid off from their positions. Names shall be placed on the list by classification in order of University seniority or as mutually agreed. An employee's name shall be on the list for all classes in which the employee has served.
These conditions must be met before an employee's name is placed on the layoff list: 1) The employee must have received a written notice of layoff, or notice of failure to pass probation, per Section 7H; 2) the employee must submit an updated application to the appropriate Human Resources Department; and 3) the employee must request in writing to have his/her name placed on the layoff list per Section 7H and Article 5, Recruitment and Employment, Section 3A.
SECTION 9. RECALL In accordance with Article 5, Recruitment and Employment, Sections 3A and 3B, an employee on the layoff list must be recalled by the Department in which layoff occurred if the Department has a vacancy in the classification or a lower class in the related series and appointment type (temporary or continuing) from which the employee was laid off and for which the employee is qualified as determined by the Employer. When reemployed in the same class and layoff condition, the employee's name shall be removed from the layoff list.
After receiving the recall notice from the Department, the employee has seven (7) calendar days during which to indicate in writing to the Employer his/her intent to return; and twenty-one (21) additional calendar days to report to work. Failure to accept recall to a position shall constitute a resignation and the employee's name will be removed from the layoff list.
SECTION 10. LAYOFF LIST RIGHTS The employee's name shall remain on the layoff list for a period not to exceed two (2) years or three (3) years outside the seven (7) county metropolitan area, from the effective date of layoff, or until the employee has returned to work at the University within that time, unless the employee returns to a lower class or layoff condition from which s/he was laid off, in which case, the employee’s name shall remain on the layoff list so s/he will be offered vacancies in the same class from which s/he was laid off for two (2) years from the date of layoff. Once an employee is actually laid off, the employee may turn down reemployment to the first two (2) positions in the same class, immediate geographic area and within the applicable definition of layoff per Section 3A-D and appointment type (temporary or continuing) at a salary ninety (90) percent or more than the employee’s salary at the time of layoff and still remain on the layoff list. The employee must accept the third position or have his/her name removed from the layoff list.
54
During the time between receiving notice and being laid off, an employee's name can be put on the layoff list at his/her written request per Section 8. During the time between receiving notice and being laid off, the employee applies per Article 5, Recruitment and Employment, Section 3A, may turn down reemployment to the first two (2) positions as provided above (see Section 10). However, the employee must accept a vacancy per Section 7D, or the employee will no longer be eligible to exercise bumping rights. During this time, an employee may refuse a referral on a job interview and this shall not count as a turndown.
Employees have rehiring rights as specified in Article 5, Recruitment and Employment. Bargaining unit employees whose names are on the layoff list will be offered temporary positions, excluding temporary no post positions, for which they are qualified, in University seniority order.
An employee's name may remain on the layoff list if s/he is re-employed in a position outside his/her applicable definition of layoff per Section 3 A-D and/or appointment type (temporary or continuing) or in a lower class as in Section 10, but this shall not extend the two year or three (3) year maximum. An employee who has exhausted his/her rights on the layoff list shall be considered as having resigned in good standing.
SECTION 11.	SALARY An employee who is recalled or who bumps or is rehired from the layoff list to a position in the same class, shall maintain the same salary as at the time of the layoff. When an employee bumps to a lower class, their salary shall be treated as a demoted employee in the Salary Article.
SECTION 12.	RIGHTS OF EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES ENTERING THE BARGAINING UNIT Employees who have accepted positions outside the bargaining unit do not accrue seniority in the bargaining unit when employed in positions outside of the bargaining unit, but may retain prior seniority earned in the bargaining unit. Employees who are laid off from a position outside the bargaining unit shall have bumping rights into a position in this bargaining unit in a class or equivalent class in which the employee previously served or in a position for which the employee is determined to be qualified by the Employer only under the following conditions:
1.	The employee shall have exhausted all layoff rights within his/her own bargaining unit, or, if not in a bargaining unit, within the applicable terms or conditions governing their employment. The employee may bump only in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of his/her employment.
2.	The employee shall exercise rights to a vacancy in a class or equivalent class in which s/he has previously passed probation and for which there are no bargaining unit applicants prior to bumping in this bargaining unit.
3.	Bump.
a.	In order for a returning employee to exercise bumping rights into the bargaining unit, the employee must have greater seniority in the classification or equivalent classification than the employee who would be laid off.
b.	The employee may bump only into a position in the same Department or Collegiate/Administrative Seniority Unit where the layoff occurred. If the employee has less than two (2) years seniority in the Collegiate/Administrative Unit, s/he may bump in the same Department. If the employee has two (2) or more years seniority in the Collegiate/Administrative Unit, s/he may bump within the Collegiate/Administrative unit.
SECTION 13.	BENEFIT ELIGIBILITY FOR LAID OFF EMPLOYEES Employees subject to layoff are eligible for benefits as specified under the terms and conditions of this Agreement (See Article 16,
55
Vacation and Article 20, Insurance) and may be eligible for other benefits that may be offered to bargaining unit employees through special University programs to aid workers dislocated or in career transition due to layoff. (See MOU on Alternatives to Layoff.)
ARTICLE 26
SUBCONTRACTING
The Union waives the right to bargain over the decision to subcontract bargaining unit work. In the event the University elects to subcontract and its decision results in the displacement of bargaining unit members, the University agrees to attempt to give the Union ninety (90) days advance notice and shall give the Union sixty (60) days advance notice and to meet with the Union upon request, at a mutually agreed time, to discuss the effect of subcontracting, if any. Employees affected by subcontracting in a manner which meets the definition of a layoff shall be provided the protections of Article 25, Layoff and Recall.
ARTICLE 27 SAFETY
STATEMENT OF PHILOSOPHY The University and the Union are committed to establishing and maintaining a safe and healthful workplace. The parties encourage managers, supervisors, and employees to increase their efforts to reduce the number of potential safety and health hazards in their workplaces. They are also encouraged to work towards establishing and maintaining programs to inform and educate all employees on potential workplace hazards in order to reduce and prevent accidents and injuries. The University and the Union recognize the value of building and coordinate campus safety efforts which include union representation.
This statement shall not be grievable nor shall either party use this section as evidence or argument in arbitration.
SECTION 1.	GENERAL POLICY It shall be the policy of the Employer that the occupational safety and health of its employees, the protection of work areas, and the prevention of accidents are continuing and integral parts of its everyday operating responsibility. The Employer is committed to providing a safe and healthful working environment for employees. The employees shall have the responsibility to use any provided safety equipment and procedures in their daily work and shall cooperate in all safety and accident prevention programs. The University agrees to abide by all relevant required local, state and federal safety and health standards, and no employee shall be disciplined or suffer any retaliatory action for, in good faith, exercising legal rights to a safe and healthful workplace.
SECTION 2.	EMPLOYEE SAFETY
A.	Any employee who is injured or who is involved in an accident during the course of his/her employment, no matter how slight the injury, shall file an accident report with the designated supervisor, as soon as possible after the injury and prior to the conclusion of the employee's work day, whenever possible. While the initial report may be given orally, it must be followed up within 48 hours with a written report on the First Report of Injury form which shall be submitted to the appropriate administrator/supervisor who shall then submit it to the appropriate Human Resources Department.
56
B.	The University agrees to assess any unsafe or unhealthy working conditions in a timely manner and will take remedial action, as appropriate. Results of such assessments shall be reported to the employee(s) who reported the condition.
C.	The University will make available information about hazardous substances in the workplace as required by Minnesota Employees Right to Know Act (MERTKA) and the Minnesota Occupational Safety and Health Act (MOSHA).
D.	The Employer agrees to supply the equipment necessary to do work safely and to avoid injury to workers. When proper equipment is determined by the Employer or law or regulation, every effort shall be made to provide and use it in a timely manner to prevent injury.
E.	Employees have the right to refuse work consistent with M.S. 182.654, Subd. 11.
SECTION 3.	BUILDING SAFETY Fire and disaster plans and plans for improvement of air quality shall be developed by the University. Copies of the plans will be posted in each building and available in appropriate departmental offices for employee inspection. All buildings in which bargaining unit employees work shall meet applicable state and federal health, environmental, safety and fire codes.
SECTION 4.	LABOR MANAGEMENT SAFETY SUBCOMMITTEE(S) The University Labor Management Committee (ULMC) shall establish a safety subcommittee(s) that may propose policies, programs, and guidelines, as appropriate, in the following areas:
A.	Compliance with applicable federal and state health and safety standards.
B.	MERTKA based activities.
C.	Creation and implementation of safety orientation programs for new and transferring employees.
D.	Timely and appropriate training to accommodate changes in equipment or practice.
E.	Examination of specific safety problems that have implications for the University community in order to recommend solutions as appropriate.
F.	Development of a recommended policy that, if adopted, would be posted to instruct the University community in the proper handling of medical emergencies.
G.	Additional issues of mutual concern.
The ULMC Safety Subcommittee(s) shall make recommendations to the University's Director of the Department of Environmental Health and Safety. The Subcommittee(s) shall convene quarterly or as the Union and University mutually agree. Subcommittee members may attend Subcommittee meetings up to two (2) hours quarterly during regular business hours after providing reasonable notification to their supervisors. Subcommittee members shall lose no pay for attending Subcommittee meetings which are held during the employee's scheduled work time (up to two hours maximum, unless mutually agreed otherwise). However, the University shall have no obligation to reimburse employees for related expenses. Subcommittee meetings will usually be held on University property unless the subcommittee agrees to other accommodations.
SECTION 5. UNIVERSITY-WIDE SAFETY COMMITTEE AFSCME Local 3800 shall be entitled to a representative on the University-wide Safety Committee and shall be represented on safety committees at UMM and UMC. AFSCME Local 3801 shall be entitled to a representative on the UMD Safety Committee.
ARTICLE 28
WORKERS' COMPENSATION
Any employee who is injured or who is involved in an accident during the course of his/her employment, no matter how slight the injury, shall file an accident report with the designated
57
supervisor, as soon as possible after the injury and prior to the conclusion of the employee's work day, whenever possible.
Employees whose on-the-job injury prevents them from performing their regular duties, but who are physically and mentally able to perform duties in a satisfactory manner, shall be hired in a vacant position for which they are qualified, at the same or lower pay range, ahead of all other applicants, except those having received layoff notice, laid off employees and employees determined to be disabled under pertinent provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), in accordance with Article 5, Recruitment and Employment.
Employees injured on the job who cannot be re-employed in an AFSCME Unit 6 position may be given temporary assignments in non-union positions without jeopardizing their union status.
Upon request, the University will give the Union a periodic status report about return to work and accommodations for employees on Workers' Compensation and, upon request, shall meet with the Union at a mutually agreed upon time to discuss accommodating the return to work of employees on Workers' Compensation.
Time for which Workers' Compensation benefits are received is not considered "work time." Therefore, any time on Workers' Compensation does not count toward completion of the probationary period or eligibility for holiday pay or vacation or sick leave accrual. Only actual time worked or the time charged to vacation or sick leave is used to determine eligibility for such benefits.
When an employee on Workers' Compensation benefits has decided to use sick leave and/or vacation to supplement his/her Workers' Compensation benefits the following procedure applies: The employee shall notify the appropriate payroll office that s/he wishes to supplement his/her Workers' Compensation check through use of sick leave and/or vacation leave. The University shall obtain from the University Workers' Compensation Insurance Administration Office the amount of the benefit check and authorize a payroll check in the amount of the difference between the benefit check and the employee's regular gross pay for the employee's normal pay period. The employee's sick leave and/or vacation balance shall be reduced by the amount of the payroll check divided by the employee's hourly rate of pay at the time the payroll check is issued.
An employee who uses sick leave and/or vacation leave while awaiting the Workers' Compensation determination shall return that part of the Workers' Compensation check which covers the waiting period to the University. The University shall credit back to the employee sick leave and/or vacation leave the number of hours equal to the amount of the Workers' Compensation check divided by the employee's hourly rate.
An adjustment could require reimbursement from the employee to the University if the combination of compensation payments and sick leave and/or vacation payments exceeds his/her normal salary.
Health, life, and dental insurance benefits provided under Article 20, Insurance, shall continue as long as an employee meets the eligibility requirements; makes timely payment of the employee's contribution; is off the University payroll due to a University work-related injury or work-related disability and is receiving or is eligible to receive Workers' Compensation payments.
When an employee has incurred an on-the-job injury or disability and has filed a claim for Workers' Compensation, medical costs connected with the injury or disability shall be paid by the Health
58
Maintenance Organization or the Health Insurance Carrier pursuant to the provisions of Minn. Statute, 176.191, Subdivision 3.
If employees who are receiving Workers' Compensation benefits secure employment outside the University instead of accepting a position at the University of Minnesota, their Department may terminate them at the beginning date of employment or when the employee is eligible for health insurance with their new employer or after six (6) months leave of absence, whichever comes first.
If an employee becomes physically, mentally, or emotionally handicapped to the extent that s/he cannot perform regular duties, the employer shall make a reasonable effort to place the employee in a position that s/he is physically, mentally, or emotionally able to perform. The employer does not have to create a new position solely to provide employment for the employee.
ARTICLE 29 WORK RULES
The Employer may establish and enforce reasonable work rules which are not in conflict with the terms of this Agreement. Such rules may be established on an organizational unit basis such as a work location, Department, Coordinate Campus, Collegiate/Administrative Unit, or University-wide and shall be the same rules for all Unit 6 employees in an area, but may vary according to what is appropriate for the work assigned to employees, and shall be applied uniformly to all employees who are affected within these organizational units. The rules shall be posted and/or distributed to directly affected employees.
Whenever new or amended rules are established, the organizational work unit shall inform affected employees prior to the effective date of the rule, whenever practicable. The University shall make a reasonable effort to discuss, and upon request, shall meet with the Local Union, explaining the need for the rules, and shall allow the Union reasonable opportunity to express its views prior to placing the rules in effect. For the purposes of this Section, the Local Union for issues related to rules at the local level shall be the local Union Steward, or in his/her absence the Area Steward or Chief Steward, and for issues at the campus or bargaining unit wide level it shall be a Union Officer.
ARTICLE 30 UNION SECURITY
SECTION 1.	CHECK-OFF The University agrees to deduct Union membership dues from the earnings of any employee covered by this Agreement, provided the Union submits to the University a written request for such deductions, signed by the employee. Upon submission by the Union of a written request, signed by the employee, the University also agrees to deduct contributions as part of the total dues deduction to the Union's political action fund, PEOPLE. Such requests must be received by the University no later than fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the end of the payroll period for which the deductions are to be effective. The University shall remit the total deductions, with an itemized statement of the deductions, to the Union as soon as possible.
SECTION 2.	CHECK-OFF CANCELLATION Union membership dues deduction for an employee, once authorized, shall continue until the University receives a written request from the Union to discontinue such deductions.
59
SECTION 3.	EXCLUSIVITY Check-off of Union dues shall be granted only to the exclusive representative for employees covered by this Agreement.
SECTION 4.	EMPLOYEE LISTS At the Union's expense, the University shall quarterly provide the Union with payroll information, as permitted by applicable law; and monthly provide a list of employees deleted from or added to the bargaining unit, plus any classification changes within the bargaining unit, and shall provide available work phone numbers and work locations for bargaining unit employees. The Union and the University will meet to determine the details of these reports.
SECTION 5.	INDEMNITY The Union agrees to indemnify and hold the University, including its individual Regents and their agents, harmless against any and all claims, suits, orders and judgments brought or issued against the University as the result of action taken or not taken by the University or its agents in complying with Sections 1-2. Fair share deductions and remittances are included in this indemnification.
SECTION 6.	EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION Each supervisor shall be responsible for the orientation of each employee. The employee shall be provided with a University orientation packet, which will include an explanation of insurance benefits and information on child care programs and shall be informed when Human Resources is holding orientation sessions, and shall be allowed to attend such an orientation session. During such an employee orientation, a Union representative may be present and shall be permitted a reasonable time to address bargaining unit employees. All newly hired bargaining unit employees shall be provided at the time of hire a letter signed jointly by the Union and the University.
SECTION 7.	STUDENT EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION At the Union's expense, the University shall provide student employment information to the Union quarterly as provided by applicable law. The University agrees to meet with the Union and discuss concerns, if any, regarding student employment.
ARTICLE 31 UNION RIGHTS
SECTION 1.	GENERAL PROVISIONS The Minnesota Public Employee Labor Relations Act (PELRA), Minn. Statutes 179A.subd.6, provides that a public employer must afford reasonable, unpaid time off to elected officers or appointed representatives of the exclusive representative to conduct the duties of the exclusive representative.
All Union business shall be conducted on leave without pay, accumulated vacation, or accumulated compensatory time. What follows are the only exceptions that provide for Employer paid leave:
A.	The Union Steward's activities per Sec.2C and Article 21;
B.	Attendance of the designated Union representative and the grievant at grievance meetings with the University administrative designee(s) per Article 21, Settlement of Disputes, Section 6;
C.	Participation on a joint labor-management committee per Article 3, University Labor Management Committee, Section 4 or 5; Article 27, Safety, Section 4;

60
F.	Participation of a Union representative in employee orientations offered by the Human Resources Department.

H.	Attendance of the designated Union representative and the affected employee at problem solving meetings per Article 21, Section 2.
I.	Attendance at meetings to discuss the results of a reclassification per Article 9, Section 3.
Except for time to provide representation in emergency disciplinary actions, time off for Union business must be scheduled and approved by supervisors in advance.
In no event, except for a Steward's presentation of grievances, in meetings with the University administrative designee(s) during working hours, shall any Union Activist's (Steward, or officer or committee member's) paid time off for Union business (per Section 1 A, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I above) exceed eight (8) hours per month.
If the performance of Union business is on non-work time as provided in this section, the Activist shall not be paid. If the performance of union business as provided in this Section, and including the presentation of grievances, is during the employee's normal work day or week, those hours shall be counted as work time.
On a quarterly basis, the Union must provide to the appropriate Human Resources Department the name of each Union activist, the Department in which s/he is employed, and the Units that s/he represents or the official Union business involvement expected.
SECTION 2.	UNION ACTIVITIES
A.	Problem Solving and Grievance Presentation. It is recognized and accepted by the Union and the Employer that problem-solving efforts and the processing of grievances are limited by the job duties and responsibilities of employees and shall therefore be accomplished during normal working hours only when consistent with such employee duties and responsibilities in accordance with Article 3, University Labor Management Committee and Article 21, Settlement of Disputes.
The aggrieved employee and a Steward shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time without loss of pay for the presentation of a formal grievance to the University, and for problem solving subject to the terms of Article 21. The presentations may be during normal work hours provided that the employee and the Steward have notified the designated supervisor(s).
B.	Officers' Activities. Up to five (5) Union Officers for Local 3800 and up to four (4) Union Officers for Local 3801 whose names have been provided to the Employer on a quarterly list, may be granted up to eight (8) hours of time off with pay in each calendar month to conduct Union business (per Section 1 c, d, e, i above) with advance notice to their supervisors. The Union shall provide a minimum of two (2) days notice to the department prior to the use of this time off with pay for Union business, whenever possible.
C.	Steward's Activities. The University acknowledges that the Union Steward is expected to perform such duties as: a) posting Union notices and announcements; b) transmitting communication authorized by the Local Union or its officers to the Employer; c) procuring grievance-related documents from the Employer.
61
If such activities cannot be accomplished during off-duty time, the designated Union Steward may be allowed reasonable time off with pay with notice to the Steward's supervisor in accordance with the following guideline. Stewards who are responsible for the administration of the Agreement may be granted up to one (1) hour of time off with pay in each calendar month for these activities. The Employer recognizes that procuring grievance related documents may occasionally require additional paid time beyond the one (1) hour per month.
D.	Accredited Representatives. Accredited representatives of AFSCME shall have access to the premises of the Employer at reasonable times during working hours to conduct Union business related to administration of the Agreement, as may be required, after first informing the supervisor of the unit they wish to visit.

In accordance with MPELRA, a Union officer shall be granted leave without pay to serve on the negotiating committee for a new contract, to attend an AFSCME council convention, to attend a Council 5 executive board meeting, and to conduct all other Union business of the exclusive representative. The employee may elect to use accumulated vacation time or accumulated compensatory time as scheduled with his/her supervisor in advance. Any Union leave, one (1) day or less in duration, shall be requested as soon as possible. Any Union leave in excess of one (1) day shall be requested in writing at least fourteen (14) calendar days in advance of the effective date.
SECTION 3.	LOCAL UNION MEETINGS The Employer agrees that Union members may attend the regular monthly Local Union meeting during working hours on leave without pay, after notifying the employee's immediate supervisor at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance. The Employer may limit the number of employees who may be gone from the work location at one time. The employee may elect to use accumulated vacation time or accumulated compensatory time as scheduled and approved by his/her supervisor in advance.
SECTION 4.	BULLETIN BOARDS In accordance with the policy of each University building, the Union shall be granted posting rights for Union meeting notices and other official Union publications on specifically designated Department bulletin boards at mutually agreeable locations. Space shall be designated on those bulletin boards which will be exclusively for Union materials.
SECTION 5.	UNPAID LEAVE PROVISIONS. While Union officers, stewards, or committee members are using unpaid leave for the purpose of contract negotiations, as well as conducting Union business as referenced in Section 1, paragraph 1 of this Article, the employees will continue to accrue vacation and sick leave as though working their normal appointment, have their anniversary dates for progression increases and vacation accrual advancement unaffected, and be considered in pay status on the days before and after holidays.
SECTION 6.	OFFICE SPACE At the Duluth and Twin Cities campuses, the employer agrees to provide office space, if available, for AFSCME Local 3801 and 3800. If office space is available, the Employer agrees to provide it to the Local Unions at the customary rental rate.
ARTICLE 32
MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
Except as expressly limited by this Agreement, the University reserves unto itself all rights, powers, and privileges heretofore exercised or granted to it by law including but not limited to the following:
62
A.	The right to manage and control the University's business. Adopt rules and regulations, determine financial and budgetary policies (including all accounting procedures) and all matters pertaining to public relations. Determine the size of the management organization, its functions, authority, amount of supervision and table of organization.
B.	Continue its rights and past practice of assignment and direction of work of all of its personnel, determine the number of shifts and hours of work, starting and ending times, length of the work year, and scheduling of all the foregoing, and the right to establish, modify or change any right or practice, but not in conflict with the specific provisions of this Agreement.

This Article shall not be used to avoid any of the provisions of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 33 SAVINGS
This Agreement is intended to be in conformity with all applicable and valid federal and state laws and those rules or regulations promulgated thereunder having the force and effect of law which are in effect on the effective date of this Agreement. Should any Article, Section, or portion thereof of this Agreement be held unlawful and unenforceable, such decision shall apply only to the specific Article, Section, or portion thereof directly specified in the decision, and all other valid provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
Should the implementation of any provision or portion of this Agreement be delayed or withheld because of an applicable federal law, Executive Order, or regulation regarding wage and price controls, only such specific provision or portion shall be affected and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. Any portion or provisions of this Agreement thus delayed or withheld shall become effective and be implemented at such time, in such amounts, and for such periods, retroactively and prospectively, as will be permitted by law at any time during the term of this Agreement or any extension thereof.
ARTICLE 34
NO STRIKE/NO LOCKOUT
SECTION 1.	NO STRIKE The Union and the University subscribe to the principle that differences shall be resolved by peaceful and appropriate means without interruption to the University. The Union therefore agrees that it shall not authorize, ratify, promote or support any unlawful strike under the Minnesota Public Employment Labor Relations Act.
63
A strike is lawful if conducted as provided under the provisions of the Minnesota Statutes 179A.18 Subdivision 1. A strike is defined under the Minnesota Public Employment Labor Relations Act as a "concerted action in failing to report for duty, the willful absence from one's position, the stoppage of work, slowdown, or the abstinence in whole or in part from the full, faithful, and proper performance of the duties of employment for the purpose of inducing, influencing or coercing a change in the conditions or compensation or the rights, privileges, or obligations of employment" (Minnesota Statutes 179A.03, Subdivision 16). Any employee who violates the provisions of this section may be discharged or otherwise disciplined. Any employee so disciplined may elect to grieve the discipline under Article 22 of this Agreement.
SECTION 2.	NO LOCKOUT The University agrees it will not lock out employees during the term of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 35
ENTIRE AGREEMENT
This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire existing Agreement between the parties. This Agreement is subject to amendment only by a subsequent written agreement between, and executed by, the University and the Union. The waiver of any term or condition of the Agreement by either party shall not constitute a precedent unless the parties specifically agree in writing.
64
ARTICLE 36 DURATION
This Agreement shall be effective as of the 4th day of December 2007, except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, and shall remain in full force and effect until the 30th day of June 2009.
It shall be automatically renewed from year to year thereafter unless either party shall notify the other in writing at least one hundred fifty (150) calendar days prior to the expiration date that it desires to modify this Agreement.
In the event that such notice is given, negotiations shall begin not later than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days prior to the expiration date. All time limits contained herein may be extended by mutual written agreement. This Agreement shall remain in full force and be effective during the period of negotiations and until notice of termination of this Agreement is provided to the other party in the manner set forth in the following paragraph.
In the event that either party desires to terminate this Agreement, written notice must be given to the other party not less than ten (10) calendar days prior to the desired termination date which shall not be before the expiration date set forth in the preceding paragraph.
In witness whereof, the parties have set their hands this 4th day of December 2007,
65
APPENDIX A
DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT INFORMATION
Complaints of discrimination may be resolved by the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (EO/AA) without using a formal grievance procedure. In the case of employees not located in the Twin Cities area, employees have the right to discuss with or submit a complaint to the local Human Resources Department, the Office of Equal Opportunity, or Grievance Officer.
The EO/AA Office has the responsibility and authority to assist individuals with complaints of discrimination, including sexual harassment. They will help resolve problems primarily through informal channels; the help is available to faculty, staff, and students with problems related to employment and education. The EO/AA Office reserves the right to change its policies and procedures.
The Employer agrees that the complaint procedure for discrimination complaints shall be opened to Union participation at the request of the complaining employee and that EO/AA personnel shall inform a complaining employee of this right. The complaint procedure shall include the following:
1.	An employee who believes s/he has a discrimination complaint should discuss his/her situation with an EO/AA Office staff member, who will inform the person of various options.
The equal opportunity officer determines whether or not the complaint warrants investigation. The person may be asked to complete a complaint form. When a complaint is initiated, at the request of the employee, a notice of the complaint in progress will be sent to the Union. If in filing a complaint an employee states that s/he is unable to perform in the work site from which the complaint arose, the EO/AA staff member shall conduct a preliminary review in a timely manner concerning the urgency of the situation. If this preliminary review establishes that a reasonable basis for the employee's concern about continuing in the work situation exists, the EO/AA shall take intervening action, when appropriate, to defuse the situation which may include temporarily reassigning either party until such time as the complaint is fully investigated, there is a finding, and corrective action, if required, is implemented.
2.	If the complaint warrants investigation, an EO/AA Office staff member shall attempt to conduct the investigation within thirty (30) days of the original complaint to determine if University policy has been violated. The staff member shall prepare a written report at the conclusion of the investigation. If there is an EO/AA recommended action, that recommendation should be included in the report. If the complaining employee has requested the Union's involvement in the complaint, the Union's representative as well as the complainant shall be provided a written summary of the EO/AA's final disposition of the complaint. If EO/AA ceases their activities on a complaint in which the Union has been involved, the EO/AA office shall notify the employee and the Union in writing that their office is no longer investigating and/or working on mediating the complaint. The Union and the Employer agree that all hearings and records shall be confidential as provided by law and that retaliation against an aggrieved employee or witness is prohibited.
If it is determined that University policy was violated, a remedy to the problem will be offered.
If it is determined that University policy was not violated, the complainant will be informed, and other options will be explained, including where complaint procedures may be filed under state and federal law.
66
In assessing the existence of sexual harassment in a particular case, the record as a whole and the totality of the circumstances, such as the nature of the sexual advances and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred, will be considered. The determination of conduct which violates this policy will be made from the facts on a case by case basis.
Neither the procedure outlined above, nor any complaint which is not resolved by this procedure is subject to Article 21, Settlement of Disputes.
3.	Incidents of harassment should be reported as follows:

Seniority:
University seniority was unaffected by this process. Classification seniority under the new system includes all classification seniority earned in any of the classifications grouped together into each new classification.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ALTERNATIVES TO LAYOFF
When, due to budget reductions, program changes, attempts to improve efficiency or service to the public, or for other reasons, the University reorganizes, consolidates, reduces the size of, or merges, current organizational units, the parties agree it is desirable to minimize employee disruption by considering alternatives to layoff and by involving employees in the planning process.
In seeking those ends, the parties agree the following actions should happen:
1.	Full information should be provided to employees and the Union as early as possible in the process of organizational changes.
2.	Input from employees and the Union should be sought regarding the implications of possible changes on future operation of the unit, work efficiency, and employee concerns.
3.	Input from employees and the Union should be sought in considering alternatives to layoff which could accomplish the stated goals of the contemplated action.
4.	Input from employees and the union should be taken about any possible use of subcontracting, while changes affecting current employees' employment are under consideration.
5.	By mutual agreement of the parties, any or all of the above matters shall be discussed in a
79
Labor/Management committee forum, provided one exists at the local level. If there is no local labor management committee, the Employer will meet and confer with the union on any of the above matters upon request of the union.
It is expected that changes due to program consolidation, attempts to improve efficiency and/or service, programs or functions, or due to mergers, should be planned well in advance and in detail so that notice beyond the requirements provided in Article 25 should be given to employees who may be subject to layoff. It would be anticipated that in such advance planning situations, the Employer should give sixty (60) days advance notice of the pending changes.
At that time, if it has not already happened, the affected department(s) shall meet with employees and the Union to discuss the following:
1.	Reasons for the proposed changes
2.	Possible alternatives to position elimination to accomplish desired goals
3.	Proposed classifications of and numbers of positions affected by the proposed changes.
Individual employees affected by the elimination or reduction of their positions shall be notified in the manner prescribed in Article 25.
Departments are encouraged whenever possible to provide notice up to six (6) months in advance to allow utilization of retraining. The employer agrees to provide information about available retraining opportunities to any employees affected by these reorganizations or layoffs.
At the time employees are given notice, all affected employees shall be informed of what the number, classification, and duties of the bargaining unit positions in the altered work unit will be.
Because the goal is to keep employees who want to stay at the University, any employee in the affected department may take the options provided below in order to open up positions, except for the vacancy-bumping and retraining options, which are only available to employees whose own position is abolished or reduced. These options are available only to employees in departments affected in the manner described above, and to all employees in departments where budget reductions of relatively short notice causes positions to be abolished or reduced in a way which meets the definition of layoff in Article 25:
1.	LAYOFF/NON-RENEWAL PROGRAM
Eligibility:
Employees are eligible if they have received a notice of layoff and hold at least a 75% time continuing appointment. Temporary employees are not eligible. While employees who previously have participated in termination severance programs are eligible for the Layoff/Non-renewal program, time included in previous programs shall not be included in any subsequent programs.
Benefits:
(1)	Eligible employees receive a lump-sum payment equal to one week of pay per full year of continuous service with the University, up to a maximum of 52 weeks of pay. One week of pay is equal to the regular hourly rate times the number of hours per week the employee was regularly scheduled to work on the last day of employment.
(2)	Employees' medical and/or dental coverage may be continued for up to 18 months following termination of employment (but not after the last day of the month in which the employee
80

The employer reserves the right to terminate this leave of absence with thirty (30) calendar days notice, at which time the employee may be recalled or be laid off pursuant to Article 25. An employee returns from LOA to a position in the same class and department, but not necessarily to the same position occupied prior to the LOA.

In no case shall such a leave extend beyond one (1) year unless specifically agreed between the employee and the Department Head.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING CONDUCT OF UNION BUSINESS
The University and the Union acknowledge the fact that the conduct of union business by Union presidents or chief stewards of the bargaining unit often requires him/her to be away from his/her work station(s) for either sporadic or extended periods of time.

FITNESS INCENTIVE LETTER
Date:	August 9, 2007
To:	Gladys McKenzie, Business Agent
Joyce Carlson, Business Agent
From:	Dann Chapman, Director of Benefits
Re:	Frequent Fitness Incentive
The University will provide an incentive to eligible UPlan members, provided that such programs are available through UPlan participating health plans, to encourage regular activity at a fitness center. The incentive will be up to $20 per month toward the cost of membership dues. It currently will be delivered through fitness programs administered by Medica (Fit Choices) and HealthPartners (Frequent Fitness). The incentive will be in addition to any discount to which the member is otherwise entitled.
There are at least three significant areas of differences between the two frequent fitness programs including:
•	Differences in the networks of fitness centers.
•	A difference in the number of incentives that can be paid per fitness center membership.
•	A difference in the number of visits per month required to qualify for an incentive.
The University is working with the health plans to determine where there is flexibility to resolve differences, where there is not, and whether changes should be made.
The University is working with Medica and HealthPartners to encourage the inclusion of University recreation centers in their programs, as well as other fitness centers that are located close to our coordinate campuses. We cannot, however, guarantee what centers will be included. As is the case with medical and dental plan provider networks, the health plans contract with the centers directly and control the network of facilities.
