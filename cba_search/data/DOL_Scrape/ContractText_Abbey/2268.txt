ARTICLE XI:	Hours of Work, Payment of Wages and Contributions
Section 1.	For the purpose of this Agreement and except as is otherwise provided herein,
10
the work week shall be determined to begin at 8:00 a.m. Wednesday and end at 4:30 p.m. on the following Tuesday. Except as herein provided, working hours are from 8:00 a.m. to 11:55 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. to 4:25 p.m. and no more than the regular hours shall be worked during the forenoon or afternoon at the regular rate.
From July 5, 2015 through May 31, 2021, flexible starting time may be based upon the decision of a majority of Employees on each job site, and in the case of days of inclement weather starting time and quitting time may be adjusted so long as the hours worked on such days do not exceed eight and do not extend beyond 4:30 p.m.; however, the Employee, at his option, shall not be required to work beyond the flex quitting time that had been set for his job site.
Further, in circumstances where the Employee or Employees have regularly been working overtime on a particular job site and/or have been scheduled to work overtime on a particular day or days, no adjustment in the starting time shall operate to deprive Employees of overtime pay which they would have otherwise received but for the change in the starting time. The parties understand that the application of the provisions of the preceding sentence will result in Employees receiving overtime pay even where they have not worked more than eight hours on a particular day.
Regardless of the starting time, the forenoon working hours shall end at 11:55 a.m. and the afternoon working hours shall begin at 12:30 p.m. and end 8 hours and 25 minutes after the starting time fixed by the Employer for forenoon hours.
None of the above provisions for a starting time earlier than 8:00 a.m. shall apply to refractory work and acid brick work.
Work performed by an Employee on a non-holiday Saturday, except as hereinafter provided, or at night or before or after regular working hours on a non-holiday weekday, shall be considered overtime work, for which Employees working during such time shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half times their regular hourly wage rate for each hour or fraction thereof, worked during such time. However, if during a work week as defined above in December, January, February, March, or April a Wednesday, Thursday or Friday on a particular job is lost in its entirety (i.e., no work performed by any employees covered by this Agreement) due to inclement weather, then the non-holiday Saturday occurring during that work week may be used as a make-up day on that job; or if during a work week in December, January, February, March, or April a Monday or Tuesday on a particular job is lost in its entirety due to inclement weather, then the non-holiday Saturday of the following work week may be used as a make-up day on that job if, but only if, the Employer notifies the Union of the intent to use a Saturday as a make-up day not later than 12:00 noon the preceding Friday by e-mail, fax or telephone. Weather permitting, the Saturday make-up day will be 8 hours. Where work in its entirety during a particular work week in December, January, February, March, or April is lost on a particular job for two or more days due to inclement weather, only one Saturday (either during that work week or during the following work week as the circumstances warrant) may be used as a make-up day. Thus, no banking of lost days is permitted. Provided that proper notice has been given and other requirements met, work performed on make-up, non-holiday Saturdays shall be compensated at $5.00 per hour above the normal wage rate for commercial work, and $2.50 per hour above the
11
normal wage rate for residential work. (Residential work shall be defined as work on singlefamily dwellings and residential multi-family dwellings of a single story and up to four units only.) The special rate for qualified make-up non-holiday Saturday work shall apply only to Employees who worked on the job within the seven calendar days immediately preceding the make-up Saturday, except that if there are insufficient volunteers from the crew of the Employees who worked on the job within the prior seven calendar days, then Employees from the Employer’s other crews may volunteer for this work. All employees on the job will receive the same rate of pay. No Employee shall be forced to work a make-up Saturday and shall not be disciplined or discriminated against for declining to do so.
For residential work, as defined in this Section, make-up days may be utilized from January to December. However, residential make-up days will be subject to all other conditions and limitations as set forth in this Section.
Work performed on a Sunday or on the following holidays: New Years Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day, shall also be considered overtime work for which the Employee shall be paid twice the amount of his or her regular hourly wage rate for each hour or fraction thereof worked on any such day.
Where shift work is required, no less than three shifts shall be worked. Each shift shall work 7-1/2 hours and be paid for 8 hours at the regular rate of pay.
Wages for the preceding work week shall be paid at the site of employment on Friday following the close of such work week before quitting time, providing the Employer has scheduled his Employees for the following work day authorized by the Union, and if inclement weather does not permit work on such Friday or if the Employer does not have work for the Employees for any reason, then payment shall be before noon on the Friday following the close of such work week.
When a legal holiday falls on a Friday, Employees shall be paid before quitting time on Thursday, except that if inclement weather does not permit work on such Thursday preceding the Friday legal holidays, then payment shall be made before noon on such Thursday.
In the event the Employer does not schedule his men for work on the following work day authorized by the Union, or in the event the journeymen or apprentice members shall be laid off for any cause and for any length of time, the Employer shall pay the Employees up to and including all time worked on the last day of scheduled work before quitting time.
Section 2.	Employer agrees that he will furnish the Union either with a bond, in which the Employer is principal and a qualified surety company is the Surety, or a Letter of Credit from a bank guaranteeing the payment of all wages and checked off dues of the Employees of the Employer and all payments to the funds, trust or association required of the Employer by the provisions of Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X of this Agreement, which accrue during the period of such bond or Letter of Credit, to the extent of the amount of such bond or Letter of Credit.
