N.	During negotiations the parties acknowledged that federal and Constitutional law requirements regarding union security provisions are unsettled. The parties understand and agree that the provisions set forth in Article 4 shall only be applied in accordance with applicable law.

5.	Management reserves the right to amend or alter any work rule, and agrees that prior to implementation of any such amendments, it will implement the provisions of paragraph C.2. above.
D.	Violence in the Workplace.
1.	The parties agree that violence in the work place is an issue of mutual concern. Therefore the parties agree that the Employer may, after notice to the employee and the Union, require the employee to undergo a psychiatric or psychological evaluation when there is a reasonable basis, based on objective and verifiable evidence, that the employee poses a threat to others in the work place or to citizens with whom the employee works.
2.	In the event that any witness(s) statement is utilized to establish such objective and verifiable evidence, the identity of the witness(s) shall be kept confidential throughout any ensuing investigation. If the investigation culminates in a disciplinary action, the identity of the witness(s) shall be revealed.
3.	The psychiatrist or psychologist administering the evaluation will be chosen by the Appointing Authority. The evaluation shall address the issues of whether the employee poses a threat to others in the work place and/or steps the Employer should take to minimize or eliminate such threats. All costs of the psychiatric or psychological evaluation shall be paid by the Employer. Only the findings or recommendations regarding whether the employee poses a threat to others in the work place or steps the Employer should take to minimize or eliminate such threats, shall be provided to the Employer and the employee. The Union shall be informed if the employee executes a written consent for release of medical information to the Union.
4.	In the event that discipline is imposed, reference to such evaluation may be made in the record of disciplinary action placed in the employee’s personnel file. In no event shall the findings be placed in the employee’s personnel file. The Employer shall not release or make public the findings unless the employee files a grievance protesting the disciplinary action. In that event, the findings or recommendations may be introduced by the Employer in support of the disciplinary action. Findings and recommendations shall be retained in accordance with Article 7, Section M.

Article 7
DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE AND PERSONNEL FILES
A.	The Employer reserves the right to reprimand in writing, suspend, discharge or take other appropriate disciplinary/corrective action against a unit employee for just cause.
B.	Allegations or other assertions of unacceptable unit employee conduct, by supervisors or members of the public or other unit employees, are not charges, but constitute a basis for investigation by the Employer.
C.	The Employer is solely responsible for conducting investigations into wrong-doing of unit employees, and that such investigation is management's sole prerogative. The parties agree that disciplinary action must be supported by timely and accurate investigation. For purposes of this Article, investigation to determine whether disciplinary action should be taken is timely when commenced within twenty (20) days following the date on which the Employer had reasonable basis to believe that such investigation should be undertaken.

A Step 1 grievance response, other than a denial, requires the review and final approval of the department/agency personnel office and the union staff representative.
E.	Step Two: Department/Agency Personnel Office. If the matter is not resolved at Step One, the Grievant may appeal the grievance to Step Two of the procedure by filing an appeal from Step One to the Department/Agency Personnel Office within ten (10) days from the date of the Step One answer.
1.	Management may establish a meeting for the Grievant and a Union representative, if requested by the Grievant or the Union, within ten (10) days following receipt of the appeal at Step Two.
2.	Management will provide a written response to the Grievant within ten (10) days following receipt of the Step Two appeal, or within ten (10) days of a meeting with the Grievant, if such meeting is held. Both management and the union agree to come to the Step 2 meeting fully prepared to effectively address the issues to facilitate a thorough Step 2 response within the time frame allotted. Nothing precludes the parties from holding a mutually agreed to follow up meeting as necessary.
3.	An initial service rating, reprimand, suspension or dismissal of an initial probationary employee (2,080 Hours) is not appealable beyond Step Two of the grievance procedure.
4.	An annual rating is not appealable beyond Step Two of the grievance procedure, unless the Annual Rating results in delaying reallocation of the employee's position.
F.	Step Three: Arbitration.
1.	Conventional Arbitration. If the matter is not resolved at Step Two, the Union may within ten (10) days of receipt of the Step Two answer, appeal the grievance to arbitration by filing written notice with the Office of the State Employer and the affected Department. Within 10 days of the receipt of the Union's notice the Office of the State Employer shall request arbitration in accordance with the

procedures specified herein. The Office of the State Employer shall provide copies of the request for arbitration to the affected Department and the Union. Before the arbitration hearing, the Office of the State Employer may schedule a meeting with MPES and the Department to review the grievance. An effort shall be made in such discussions to arrive at a fair and equitable grievance settlement. Any settlement shall be confirmed in writing when agreed to by the Union and the Office of the State Employer.
a.	During the negotiation of this Agreement the parties mutually agreed upon a panel of arbitrators which will hear all grievances appealed to arbitration. The Arbitrators on this panel are as specified below:

d.	Each request for arbitration shall require that the Arbitrator schedule and hold the hearing within sixty (60) days of receipt of the request for arbitration. The parties shall set aside normal business in order to schedule and hold the hearing within this time frame. By mutual written agreement, the parties may waive the sixty (60) day time limit. Upon receipt of notice from the Arbitrator that the sixty (60) day time limit cannot be met, the Office of the State Employer shall send a second request for arbitration to the next Arbitrator on the list.
e.	The Arbitrator will conduct the hearing in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement. Expenses for the Arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties; however, each party shall be responsible for the costs of its own representatives and witnesses.

In the event that both parties mutually request a cancellation or rescheduling, any associated costs shall be borne equally.

f.	The Arbitrator's authority will be confined to the specific written provisions of this Agreement. The Arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, subtract from, modify, ignore, or otherwise amend any term of this Agreement and Civil Service Rules and Regulations. The authority of the Arbitrator shall remain subject to and subordinate to the limitations and restrictions on subject matters and personal jurisdiction in the Civil Service Rules and Regulations.

G.	In the event that management does not respond to a grievance within specified time limits, the grievance may be advanced to the next step. Failure of the Grievant or Union to comply with the specified time limits contained herein will automatically terminate the grievance and preclude further processing.
H.	Time limits may be extended only upon mutual written agreement of the parties. The parties may mutually agree to bypass any step of this procedure for the purpose of expediting the processing of any grievance.

Agreement Between
The State of Michigan and The Michigan Public Employees, SEIU Local 517M
I.	Only the Union may advance a grievance to arbitration. No individual unit employee or group of unit employees shall have the right to advance any grievance to arbitration without the express authorization of the Union.
J.	There shall be no grievance filed which alleges a fact situation substantially similar to that alleged in any unfair labor practice charge filed by the Union against the Employer.
K.	Exclusive Procedure. The grievance procedure contained herein shall be exclusive and shall replace any other grievance procedure for the adjustment of any disputes arising out of the administration of this Agreement for all grievances permitted under Civil Service Rules and Regulations. The grievance procedure set out above shall not be used for the adjustment of any dispute for which the Civil Service Rules or Regulations require the exclusive use of a Civil Service forum or procedure.
L.	Prohibition of "Self-Help”. Unit employees will fully and faithfully perform the responsibilities of their position while pursuing redress of grievances, shall comply with all supervisory/administrative orders and/or instructions, and shall have no right to resort to "self-help" in lieu of filing and processing a grievance. The only exception to this provision shall be circumstances where compliance with a supervisory or other administrative instruction, direction, or order would, based on clearly objective criteria, immediately endanger the unit employee's health or physical safety, or where compliance would require the commission of immoral conduct or the violation of any statute.
M.	Grievance Preparation Time. Whenever possible, the Grievant and Union representative shall utilize non-work time to consult and prepare. Where such arrangement cannot be made, the Grievant and one (1) designated Union representative may utilize up to one-half (1/2) hour without loss of pay, for consultation and preparation immediately prior to any scheduled grievance meeting with management. Overtime is not authorized. The Employer is not obligated to compensate any unit employee for grievance processing outside of their regularly scheduled work hours.
N.	Grievance Committee Leave Bank. The Employer agrees to establish an administrative leave bank of two hundred (200) hours per calendar year to be used by the Union Grievance Committee. The Committee members shall be designated to the Office of the State Employer annually. The bank shall be used for working on the resolution of grievances. The Committee member must submit a written request to his/her supervisor at least two (2) weeks in advance. The request shall indicate the number of hours being requested. When such notice cannot be given, the release of the Committee member shall be contingent upon the operational needs of the Department, but shall not unreasonably be denied.
O.	Grievance Leave Time. Unit employees who are required to participate in any grievance meeting with management, including arbitration, as Grievant or as

Upon completion of the unit employee's participation in the meeting, he/she shall return to his/her work site and resume normal assigned duties.
P.	Grievance Representation. Unit employees shall be limited in their right to grievance representation during Steps One and Two to a Union staff employee or a designated representative who is also a unit employee. This precludes the use of attorneys or any other individuals who do not satisfy the criteria contained herein. This shall not prevent the Union from retaining outside counsel or any other outside individual to represent a Grievant's claim in an arbitration hearing conducted pursuant to Step Three of the grievance procedure.
Article 10

payroll during the first full pay period of October in each year. Such Administrative Leave which is not used may be carried forward to other years to cover absences from regularly scheduled work activities authorized by this section. The Union shall designate to the Employer in writing the names of its Executive Officers, Directors and duly authorized Union employees entitled to utilize the hours in this administrative leave bank. Administrative leave will be granted only in blocks of one (1) or more hours, not to exceed forty (40) hours per employee in any pay period. The unit employee and the immediate supervisor(s) will mutually agree on the scheduling of this time so as to minimize the disruption of work schedules. In addition, the Union will normally make a written request for release of the unit employees seven (7) calendar days in advance. The Union will send the request to the Appointing Authority or designee and the Office of the State Employer. The request will include:
a.	Unit employee name;
b.	Unit employee department;
c.	Dates for release;
d.	Number of bank hours to be used and,
e.	Whether the leave is for Union business or training.
2.	The Department may deny the request if operational needs preclude release. The Union may change the designation of the Executive Officers or Directors and duly authorized members by providing seven (7) days notice to the Office of State Employer.
3.	Up to 250 hours of the administrative leave bank will be available for stewards to use in order to represent bargaining unit employees from other departments during investigative interviews, disciplinary conferences and grievance meetings where no steward is authorized or designated within the employee’s department or a steward from another department is located closer to the employee to be represented. There is no requirement for a written request for release from the union when a designated steward uses leave from the bank for this purpose. Requests for time will be made to the immediate supervisor with as much advance notice as possible and subject to approval based on operational needs. The time will be promptly reported to the department, the Office of the State Employer and the Union. In the event that the Employer or the Union raises concerns regarding this use of the administrative leave bank by stewards, the parties agree to meet to resolve the concerns.
G.	Stewards. The Union may designate up to twenty-one (21) stewards, with no more than 1% of the unit employees in any department so designated with the following exceptions that may be exercised by the Union, as long as the total does not exceed twenty-one (21) stewards: 1) Any department with bargaining unit employees may have a minimum of one (1) steward; 2) the 1% of the unit employees may be rounded up to the next whole number, and 3) the Department of Environmental Quality may have 1%, rounded up, plus one additional steward.

Where no steward is authorized or designated within the department, or a steward from another department is located closer to the employee to be represented, the union may designate a steward from another department to represent the employee. In the sole discretion of the Union, the steward may be released on administrative leave in accordance with Section F.3 above, otherwise, the steward shall be released for such purpose on accrued leave credits subject to operational requirements and other criteria governing annual leave.
H.	Access to Union representatives. Employees shall have reasonable access to a union representative to consult about the rights and obligations provided for in this agreement, but such access should be confined to the non-work time of the employee and the representative and, in any case, such discussions shall not be held in such a place or manner, or for a duration, so as to disrupt the operations of the Employer.
I.	Union Information Packet. The Employer agrees to furnish all new employees in the Scientific and Engineering Unit a packet of informational materials to be supplied to the Employer by the Union. The Employer retains the right to review the material supplied and to refuse to distribute any partisan political literature or material ridiculing individuals by name or obvious direct reference or materials defamatory or detrimental to the Employer.
J.	Presentation. During a planned orientation of new Bargaining Unit employees, one Union representative and/or staff representative shall be given an opportunity to speak briefly about the Union and its rights and obligations as an exclusive representative. No partisan political material, nor materials ridiculing individuals by name or obvious direct reference or detrimental to the Employer shall be contained in the presentation. Violation of this prohibition shall be cause for suspension and/or revocation of this right by the Employer.
The Union representative making the presentation shall be a designated Union representative at the work location premises at which the presentation is made.
K.	MIOSHA Inspection. Effective October 1, 1990, when the Michigan Department of Consumer & Industry Services (MIOSHA), or the United States Department of Labor (OSHA), inspects state facilities in which bargaining unit employees are employed, a Union representative shall be released from work without loss of pay to accompany the inspector in those parts of the facility where bargaining unit employees are employed. Release of the Union representative shall be consistent with the operational needs of the Employer.
L.	Job Interviews. Union employees are entitled to administrative leave, and reasonable travel time for job interview(s) conducted within an employee’s current

Article 11
SENIORITY
A.	Definition. Seniority shall be defined to mean a unit employee's total number of continuous service hours in the state classified service. Hours paid in excess of eighty (80) in a biweekly pay period shall not be credited. No hours shall be credited for time in non-career appointments, on lost time, suspension, leave of absence without pay, or layoff. For transfers or layoff and recall, the definition of seniority shall not include military service time earned prior to appointment to the state classified service, or service in any excepted or exempted position as provided for in Civil Service Rules dated May 1983, Sections 2-1 and 2-2 in state government which preceded entry into the state classified service, or service granted in accordance with Civil Service Rule 2-16, Assumptions.
B.	Annual Leave. If a unit employee leaves the state classified service and later is rehired, he/she shall accrue annual leave at the same rate as a new hire. However, once a rehired unit employee has been in continuous pay status for five (5) years, all previous state classified service time shall be credited for annual leave accrual.
C.	Military Service Time or Time in Excepted or Exempted Positions. Up to five (5) years of military service hours and/or time spent in any position specified in Civil Service Commission rules dated May 1983 earned prior to entry into the state classified service shall be counted as continuous service hours for determining eligibility for annual leave accruals and, for military service only, longevity pay.
D.	Break in Service. A unit employee's continuous service hours shall be broken and not bridged when the unit employee leaves state classified employment for reasons other than layoff, suspension, lost time, or approved leave of absence. A unit employee who leaves the state classified service because of layoff, suspension, lost time, or approved leave of absence shall have continuous service hours bridged for the time of such absence but only for a period of absence up to five (5) years. A break in service is any period of continuous absence, for one of the reasons cited in this paragraph, of more than five (5) years.
E.	Seniority Ties. Ties in seniority shall first be resolved by considering the total continuous service hours in the unit employee's current class series. Ties which cannot be resolved on this basis shall be resolved by considering the total continuous service hours served at the current level. If ties still remain, they shall be resolved by adding the last four (4) digits of the unit employee's identification number, with the lowest sum indicating the greatest seniority.

F.	Seniority Lists. Seniority lists, utilizing the definition of seniority contained in paragraph A above, shall be prepared at the end of the first pay period in October and at the end of the first pay period in April showing the continuous service hours of all unit employees in a department on the payroll on the preparation date. An electronic copy of the seniority list shall be provided to the Union.
1.	The list prepared in October shall be in effect from November 15 through May 14; the list prepared in April shall be in effect from May 15 through November 14.
2.	Each unit employee's seniority for each of the six (6) months periods shall be that which is indicated on the appropriate list.
3.	Unit employees shall notify the Appointing Authority of any error in such seniority list within fifteen (15) days of the date unit employees are notified that the list is electronically available for review. If no error is reported within the fifteen (15) days, the list will stand as prepared and shall thereupon become effective. Any error reported shall be corrected promptly; however, errors reported more than fifteen (15) days after the list is made available for review shall not be effective until the next seniority list is prepared.
4.	When a layoff is being implemented, the Appointing Authority shall update such seniority lists no more than six (6) weeks prior to the effective date of the layoff. The updated list shall be used to determine the layoff and bumping rights of unit employees scheduled for layoff.
G.	Probationary Employees. Initial probationary unit employees shall not be granted, and shall not exercise, any seniority rights. Upon successful completion of the initial probationary period (2,080 Hours), such unit employees shall receive credit for the hours accumulated during the probationary period.
H.	MDOT Civil Engineer and Construction Tech Co-op. After three consecutive years of service in a Scientific and Engineering Bargaining Unit position within MdOt, a unit employee who had previous employment in the MDOT Civil Engineer and Construction Technician Co-op Program, shall have that time credited as continuous service hours for purposes of longevity and annual leave accruals only.

Article 12
LAYOFF AND RECALL
A.	The Union recognizes the exclusive right of the Employer to lay off Bargaining Unit employees for such reasons as lack of funds, lack of work, administrative efficiency, including the right to determine the positions to be abolished or to remain vacant, the extent, effective date and length of such layoffs.
1.	An Executive Order reducing Departmental spending and/or wage and salary appropriations, shall be conclusive as to the Employer's right to layoff unit employees.
2.	Instructions by the State Budget Director to Departments and Agencies to reduce spending in preparation for lapses of spending authorizations necessary to balance the state's budget shall be treated, for purposes of this Article and Agreement, as conclusive as to the Employer's right to layoff unit employees.
3.	Nothing in this Article or Agreement shall preclude the parties from mutually agreeing to any other alternative(s) to indefinite layoffs of unit employees. Paragraph P of this Article contains an alternative to indefinite layoff which may be invoked by the Employer.
4.	No Arbitrator may attach any conditions to the use of indefinite layoffs or options provided herein which are not expressly provided in the language of this Article.
B.	Definition. "Layoff from employment" shall be the term applied to a unit employee who is out of a job by virtue of being laid off or bumped, and who has exhausted or has no bumping rights.
C.	Layoff, bumping and recall of unit employees shall be exclusively governed by the procedures set forth in this Article and this Agreement. However, such procedures shall not apply to temporary layoffs, which shall be governed in accordance with the Section so entitled.
D.	Limited Term Employee. The expiration of a limited term appointment shall not be considered a layoff for purposes of this Article. A unit employee with status acquired in a limited term appointment, and separated because of the expiration of that appointment may be reinstated within three (3) years in any vacancy in any

Department and in the same class as that from which the unit employee was separated. Such reinstatement may precede employment of any person from a promotional list and any person with less seniority on a layoff list. This subsection shall not apply in the case of a continuing state unit employee who accepted an appointment to a limited term position at any level; in this situation the employee may exercise employment preference at the end of the limited-term appointment. Employment preference begins at the last classification level at which the employee achieved status in an indefinite appointment before accepting the limited-term appointment. Employment preference may be exercised only within the principal department or autonomous agency that appointed the employee to the limited term appointment.
A person who is recalled on a limited term basis is not eligible to exercise employment preference at the end of the limited-term appointment but shall be returned to all recall lists for which the employee is eligible.
E.	Notice to the Union. The Employer will, when indefinite or temporary layoffs are being planned, inform the Union as soon as practicable and, upon written request, discuss the impact of such layoff on unit employees.
1.	The Employer shall furnish the Union written notice of the name, class title, current assignment location, and seniority of unit employees holding positions scheduled for abolishment.
2.	It is recognized that unit employee choices and ultimate bumping rights preclude the Employer from providing information beyond what is required herein.
3.	When a reduction in force is implemented, the Union shall be entitled to request and receive a copy of all bumping and layoff notices that are sent to affected Bargaining Unit employees.
F.	List to the Union. When layoffs and bumping are completed the Union shall be entitled to request and receive a completed list of bumps and layoffs from employment.
G.	Voluntary Layoffs. When the Employer elects to reduce the work force, unit employees within the affected classifications and layoff unit may request, in writing, preferential and layoff out of line seniority. Such voluntary layoff shall be for at least ninety (90) days. After this period, the laid-off unit employee's name shall be placed on recall lists in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
H.	General Layoff Provisions. The Employer, in its sole discretion, shall determine those positions which are to be abolished or remain vacant. Layoff units and bumping procedures shall be defined for all bargaining unit positions within a Department/Agency as described in this Article.

d.	Excluded managerial, supervisory, confidential and eligible non-exclusively represented employees who have bumping rights into the Bargaining Unit shall exercise bumping rights in the same manner as unit employees. Specifically, an excluded managerial, supervisory, confidential and eligible non-exclusively represented employee shall be permitted to bump to a lower level in a class series if such employee has attained Civil Service status in a higher level in that class series.
e.	Excluded managerial, supervisory, confidential and eligible non-exclusively represented employees who bump into the Bargaining Unit, are subsequently promoted to an excluded managerial, supervisory, confidential and eligible non-exclusively represented position and then are again affected by a

C.	T ransfer. In order to enable unit employees to be considered for vacancies the Appointing Authority intends to fill, the Appointing Authority shall establish vacancy transfer lists in accordance with the provisions specified below.
1.	Transfer List. Unit employees shall be entitled to have their names placed on the vacancy transfer list by notifying the Personnel Office in writing during the months of May and November. All such requests must be made in accordance with departmental procedures. The list compiled as a result of the requests received in May shall become effective on July 1 and remain in effect through December 31. The list compiled as a result of the requests received in November shall become effective on January 1 and remain in effect through June 30.
2.	Transfer lists shall be maintained by county or division within a county, if applicable. Unit employees may make themselves available for transfer to up to five (5) counties, and may include a different division within the county in which they currently work. If a unit employee declines a transfer to a county which he/she has requested after being interviewed for a position, the Appointing Authority may remove such unit employee from the transfer list for that county. A unit employee may at any time remove his/her name from a transfer list by written notice to the Appointing Authority.
3.	When the Appointing Authority intends to fill a permanent vacancy, it is agreed that the Employer will select one of the three most senior journey level members from the transfer list to fill the initial vacancy. An initial vacancy is defined as a newly established position or a vacant position where the prior incumbent was separated or promoted. If less than three names appear on the list then the Employer may supplement the list. If less than three names appear on the transfer list, then those remaining employees will be guaranteed an interview. If more than three names appear on the transfer list and one or more employee(s) voluntarily removes his/her name from consideration, or is not considered as provided in Section C(4) below, the Employer will select one of the three most senior journey level members remaining on the list. This process is only for vacancies at the journey level, with the exception of the Departments listed and set forth below, and only refers to the initial vacancy. The parties agree that in the Department of State Police this process is only for vacancies at the 12 level.
In the Department of State Police, the parties further agree that where a position requires court testimony as an expert witness as an element of the job, the unit employee must possess the education, experience and training to be recognized by a court as an expert witness in the specialty area of the position.
In the Department of Agriculture, the parties agree that this process is also available for employees at the 12 level to transfer to a 12 level vacancy in the same classification, in the same program and in the same division of the department.

B.	Request Procedure. Any request for a leave of absence without pay shall be submitted in writing by the unit employee to the unit employee's immediate supervisor at least, except under emergency circumstances, thirty (30) calendar days in advance of the proposed commencement date for the leave. A request for a medical leave of absence may be submitted directly to the Appointing Authority. The request shall state the reason for and the length of the leave of absence being requested.
The immediate supervisor shall consult with the Appointing Authority and furnish a written response within twenty (20) calendar days of the request. If a request for a medical leave of absence is submitted directly to the Appointing Authority, a written response will be furnished by the Appointing Authority within twenty (20) calendar days of the request.
C.	Approval. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, unit employees may be granted a leave of absence without pay at the discretion of the Appointing Authority for a period up to six (6) months. The Appointing Authority shall consider its operational needs, the unit employee's length of service, performance record and leave of absence history in reviewing requests for a leave of absence. Appointing Authority determinations under this Section shall not be arbitrary, discriminatory or capricious. Only under bona fide mitigating circumstances may a leave of absence be extended beyond six (6) months. A unit employee may elect to carry a balance of annual leave not to exceed eighty (80) hours during a leave of absence. An annual leave balance in excess of eighty (80) hours up to a maximum of two hundred forty (240) hours may be carried with the written approval of the Appointing Authority. Such leave balances shall be made available to the unit employee upon return from a leave of absence but may be utilized only with prior approval of the Appointing Authority.
Payment for annual leave due a unit employee who fails to return from a leave of absence shall be at the unit employee's last rate of pay.
D.	Educational Leave of Absence. The Appointing Authority may approve an individual unit employee's written request for a full-time educational leave of absence without pay for an initial period of time up to one (1) year if the unit employee fulfills the following criteria.
To qualify for such an educational leave, the unit employee must be admitted as a full-time student as determined by the established requirements of the educational institution relating to full-time status. Before the leave of absence can become effective, a curriculum plan and proof of enrollment must be submitted by the unit employee to his/her Appointing Authority. At the request of the Appointing Authority, the unit employee shall provide evidence of continuous successful full-time enrollment in such curriculum plan in order to remain on or renew such leave. Such education shall be directly related to the unit employee's field of employment. Such unit employee may return early from such a leave upon approval by the Appointing

Authority. The Appointing Authority shall approve or deny the request for leave of absence without undue delay. Any denial shall include written explanation of the denial, if requested by the unit employee.
E.	Medical Leave of Absence.
1.	Approval. Upon completion of the equivalent of at least six (6) months of full-time employment, and depletion of accrued sick leave credits, a unit employee upon request may be granted a leave of absence for a period of up to six (6) months upon providing required medical information for personal illness, injury or temporary disability necessitating his/her absence from work, if that unit employee is in satisfactory employment status. The unit employee's request shall include a written statement from the unit employee's physician indicating the specific diagnosis and prognosis necessitating the unit employee's absence from work and the expected return to work date.
A request to extend a medical leave of absence for an additional six (6) months may be granted at the sole discretion of the Appointing Authority. The Appointing Authority, in considering requests for extension, will consider verifiable medical information that the unit employee can return to work at the end of the extension period with the ability to fully perform the job.
The Appointing Authority reserves the right to have the unit employee examined by a physician selected and paid by the Appointing Authority for the unit employee's initial request, extension and/or return to work.
2.	Medical Layoff. When a unit employee with five (5) or more years of continuous service is denied a medical leave of absence or an extension, at the unit employee’s request, a medical layoff shall be entered into the unit employee’s employment history rather than a separation for denial of medical leave. The appointing authority shall notify the unit employee in writing of his/her departmental recall rights in accordance with Article 12, Section L(1) and (2) upon providing medical certification within two (2) years from the date of denial of the medical leave of absence or its extension, that the unit employee is able to return to his/her regular job responsibilities. If the unit employee is unable to return to work at the end of the two (2) year period, the unit employee will resign or request a waived rights leave of absence.
This option may only be exercised once in a career. Unit employees recalled under this provision shall not have such time treated as a break in service.
F.	Military Leave. Whenever a unit employee enters into the active military service of the United States, the unit employee shall be granted a military leave of absence as provided under Civil Service Rules and Regulations, as amended throughout the term of this Agreement, and applicable statutes.

G.	Waived Rights Leave of Absence. An employee who terminates State employment may be granted a waived rights leave of absence of up to one year. This type of leave of absence is granted to protect the employee's continuous service, seniority, and any benefits connected with length of service. Unit employees do not have the right to return to State service at the end of a waived rights leave of absence but will have the continuous nature of their service protected, provided they return to work prior to the expiration of such leave. All requests for a waived rights leave of absence must be made to the unit employee's Appointing Authority in writing. A unit employee granted a waived rights leave of absence may not carry any annual leave balance during such leave.
H.	Layoff. Employees on a leave of absence who would be laid off if they were in active employment status shall not be exempt from layoff by virtue of being on a leave of absence.
I.	Maternity/Paternity Leave. Upon written request, a unit employee shall, after the birth of his/her child, or adoption of a child, be granted maternity/paternity leave for up to six (6) months. Maternity/paternity leave may begin upon conclusion of any paid sick leave to which the parent is entitled under Article 22 of this Agreement; however, such leave must conclude for each parent within twelve months after the birth or adoption of the child. In those instances where both parents are covered by this provision, maternity/paternity leaves may be taken either concurrently or consecutively. The Employer may grant an extension of such leave upon request of the employee based on operational needs of the Employer.
Upon the birth of their child, or adoption of a newborn or special needs child, an employee may certify the need to use up to two (2) weeks of sick leave prior to the beginning of a maternity/paternity leave. The Employer shall consider requests for annual leave immediately prior or subsequent to maternity/paternity leaves in the same manner as requests for annual leave at other times.
J.	Benefit Continuation. Unit employees who are granted a leave of absence may elect to continue enrollment in the Group Basic and Major Medical Plan (or alternative plan) at the time the leave begins. Such unit employees shall be eligible for continued enrollment during the leave of absence by paying the full amount (100%) of the premium. This provision shall be administered in conjunction with the LTD provisions of Article 24, Section E. Such unit employees may likewise elect to continue enrollment in the Group Dental Plan and/or Group Vision Plan for up to eighteen (18) months by paying the full amount of the premium.
K.	Family and Medical Leave Act Implementation. Except as otherwise provided by specific further agreement between the Union and the Office of the State Employer, the following provisions reflect the parties' agreement on implementation of the rights and obligations of employees and the Employer under the terms of the Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA” or “ACT”), as may be amended and its implementing

The Employer shall provide timely notice to the Union and opportunity for the Union to meet to discuss the planned changes. Such discussions shall not serve to delay implementation of any changes mandated by law.

6.	Complaints. Employee complaints alleging that the Employer has violated rights conferred upon the employee by the FMLA are not grievances under the collective bargaining agreement(s) between the Union and the Employer. Any such complaints may be filed by an employee directly with the employee's Appointing Authority. The Union may, but is not obligated to, assist the employee in resolving the employee's complaint with the employee's Appointing Authority. Complaints involving the application or interpretation of the FMLA or its Regulations shall not be subject to arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement(s) between the undersigned Union and the Employer.
7.	Eligible Employee. For purposes of FMLA Family Care Leave, eligible employees are those employees who have been employed by the Employer for at least twelve months and have worked at least 1,250 hours in the previous twelve months. An employee's eligibility for contractual leaves of absence remain unaffected by this Section, however, such leaves will count towards the employee's FMLA leave entitlement after the employee has been employed by the Employer for at least 12 months and has worked 1,250 hours during the previous twelve month period. Where the term "employee" is used in this Section, it means, "eligible employee". For purposes of FMLA leave eligibility “employed by the Employer” means “employed by the State of Michigan”.

9.	General Provisions.
a.	Time off from work for a qualifying purpose under the Act ("FMLA leave") will count towards the employee's unpaid leave of absence guaranteed as provided by an applicable collective bargaining agreement. Time off for family care leave will be as provided under the Act.
b.	Employees may request and shall be allowed to use accrued annual or personal leave to substitute for any unpaid FMLA leave.
c.	The Employer may designate a Leave of Absence under Plan C of the Voluntary Work Schedule Adjustment Program ("VWSAP") as an FMLA leave if the employee provides information to the Employer that the leave is for a qualifying purpose under the Act, prior to the end of the leave. A Plan A reduced work schedule under the VWSAP may be designated by the Employer as an FMLA leave if the employee provides information to the Employer that the leave is for a qualifying purpose under the Act.
d.	Employees may request to use accrued sick leave to substitute for unpaid FMLA leave for the employee's own serious health condition or serious health condition of the employee's spouse, child, or parent.

e.	The Employer may temporarily reassign an employee to an alternative position at the same classification and level in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement when it is necessary to accommodate an intermittent leave or reduced work schedule in accordance with the Act. Such temporary reassignment may occur when the intermittent leave or reduced work schedule is intended to last longer than a total of ten workdays, whether consecutive or cumulative. Whenever possible, the Employer shall make reasonable efforts to reassign employees within their current work location. For purposes of Layoff and Recall, employees shall be considered to be in the layoff unit applicable to the employee's permanent position. Upon completion of an FMLA leave, employees shall be returned to their original positions in accordance with the Act.
f.	Second or third medical opinions, at the Employer's expense, may be required from health care providers where the leave is designated as counting against an employee's FMLA leave entitlement in accordance with the Act.
g.	Return to work from an FMLA leave will be in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the collective bargaining agreement.
10	.Insurance Continuation. Health Plan benefits will continue in accordance with the Act.
11.	Medical Leave. Up to twelve work weeks of paid or unpaid medical leave during a twelve month period, granted pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, may count towards an eligible employee's FMLA leave entitlement.
12.	Annual Leave. When an employee requests to use annual or personal leave, and it is determined, based on information provided to the Employer by the employee or the employee's spokesperson (in the event the employee is incapacitated or otherwise designates a point of contact) that the time is for a qualifying purpose under the Act, the Employer may designate the time as FMLA leave and it will be counted against the employee's 12 work week FMLA leave entitlement if the time is either:
a.	To substitute for an unpaid intermittent or reduced work schedule; or
b.	When the absence from work is intended to be for five or more work days.
13.	Sick Leave. An employee may request to use sick leave to substitute for unpaid leave taken for a qualifying purpose under the Act. Contractual requirements that employees exhaust sick leave before a medical leave commences shall continue.

a.	To substitute for an unpaid intermittent or reduced work schedule; or
b.	When the absence from work is intended to be for five or more work days. Annual leave or personal leave used in lieu of sick leave may be likewise counted.
14.	Parental Leave. Except as specifically provided herein, contractual parental leave guarantees are unaffected by implementation of FMLA. An employee's entitlement to parental leave will expire and must conclude within twelve months after the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child. However, in accordance with the Act, an eligible employee is only entitled to twelve work weeks of leave for foster care placement of a child. Contractual parental leave extensions beyond twelve months shall be administered as provided in an applicable collective bargaining agreement. Up to twelve work weeks of leave will be counted towards the FMLA leave entitlement. An employee may request to substitute annual or personal leave for any portion of the unpaid parental leave. Intermittent or reduced work schedules may only be taken with the Employer's approval.
L. Disaster Response. A leave of absence without pay to provide disaster or emergency relief assistance in this state may be granted to a bargaining unit employee who is skilled in emergency relief assistance and certified as a disaster service volunteer by the American Red Cross.
A leave of absence with pay to provide disaster or emergency relief assistance may be granted to a bargaining unit employee who is skilled in emergency relief assistance and certified as a disaster services volunteer by the American Red Cross if the President or Governor has declared the disaster, and the American Red Cross has requested the services of the employee. The Governor must approve the paid leave of absence as provided in MCL 30.411a if the services are to be rendered outside this state; the Employer must approve the paid leave of absence if the services are to be rendered inside this state.
Denial of a bargaining unit employee’s request for a disaster response leave of absence, with or without pay, shall not be grievable.

B.	State Health Plan Provisions.
The Union shall continue to be entitled to participate as a member of the Labor Management Health Care Committee. The Committee will continue to review and monitor the progress of the actual implementation of the State Health Plan. It is understood that each exclusively recognized employee organization will be entitled to designate one (1) representative to participate in the Labor Management Health Care Committee.
The Plan consists of the following principal components: pre-certification of all hospital inpatient admissions; second surgical opinion; home health care; and alternative delivery systems.
1.	Pre-certification of Hospital Admission & Length of Stay. The pre-certification for admission and length of stay component of the plan requires that the attending physician submit to the third party administrator (TPA) the diagnosis, plan of treatment and expected duration of admission. If the admission is not an emergency, the submission must be made by the attending physician and the review and approval granted by the TPA prior to admitting the covered individual into the acute care facility. If the admission occurs as an emergency, the attending physician is required to notify the TPA by telephone with the same information on the next regular working day after the admission occurs. If the admission is for a maternity delivery, advance approval for admission will not be required; however, the admitting physician must notify the TPA before the expected admission date to obtain the length-of-stay approval. There will be no limitation on benefits caused by the attending physician’s failure to obtain preadmission certification.
2.	Second Surgical Opinion. An individual covered under the State Health Plan will be entitled to a second surgical opinion. If that opinion conflicts with the first opinion the individual will be entitled to a voluntary third surgical opinion. Second and third surgical opinions shall be subject to a $10 in-network office call fee or covered at 90% after the deductible if obtained out-of-network.
Effective 10-1-08, second and third surgical opinions shall be subject to a $15 innetwork office call fee or covered at 90% after the deductible if obtained out-ofnetwork.
3.	Home Health Care. A program of home health care and home care services to reduce the length of hospital stay and admissions shall also be available at the employee’s option. This component requires that the attending physician contact the third party administrator to authorize home health care service in lieu of a hospital admission or a continuation of a hospital confinement. The attending physician must certify that the proper treatment of the disease or injury would require continued confinement as a resident inpatient in a hospital in the absence of the services and supplies provided as a part of the home health care plan.

An annual open enrollment period shall be provided to all employees in July or August of each year of this Agreement.
H.	Flexible Benefits Plan.
A flexible benefits plan shall be offered to all bargaining unit employees during the annual enrollment process and shall be effective the first full pay period in the new fiscal year.
The plan will consist of the group insurance programs with various options available to bargaining unit employees. Financial incentives will be paid to employees who select: a catastrophic health plan rather than the standard health plan coverage, a preventive dental coverage rather than the standard state dental plan or reduced life insurance coverage (one times salary or $50,000 rather than two times salary). In addition, members who elect no health care or dental coverage will receive a financial incentive.
Changes in benefit selections may be made by employees each year during the annual enrollment process or when there is a change in family status as defined by the IRS.
Incentives are paid each year and are the same regardless of an employee’s category of coverage. For example, an employee enrolled in employee-only coverage electing the catastrophic health plan for FY05-06 will receive $1,300 as will an employee enrolled in full-family coverage electing the catastrophic health plan.
Incentives to be paid during each fiscal year will be determined in conjunction with the annual rate setting process. The amount of the incentive to be paid to employees selecting the lower-level life insurance coverage is based on an individual’s annual salary and the rate per $1,000 of coverage, and therefore may differ from employee to employee. Financial incentives under the flexible benefits plan to employees electing catastrophic health, no health care, and/or reduced life plan will be paid on a biweekly basis. Those choosing the preventive dental plan or

no dental plan will receive a lump sum payment.
I.	Insurance Premiums While On Layoff And Leave Of Absence.
An employee actually separated by reason of layoff from state employment, on an indefinite basis, may elect to prepay the employee's share of premiums for health, dental, vision and life insurance coverage for the two (2) additional pay periods after layoff, by having such premiums deducted from the paycheck covering the final pay period in pay status. The Employer shall pay the employer's share of premiums for health, dental and life insurance coverage for two (2) pay periods for any employee who elects this option.
Such coverage for health, dental, vision and life insurance shall continue uninterrupted for the two (2) pay periods referred to above. Election of this option shall not affect the eligibility of the employee to thereafter continue insurance coverage for the remaining period of continuation coverage by directly paying the entire premiums therefore in accordance with current practice.
The maximum continuation coverage period for each insurance program shall be as follows: health -- 3 years; dental -- 18 months; vision care -- 18 months; life -- 1 year.
Permanent full-time employees who do not use the entire two (2) pay periods because of recall, or otherwise returning to state employment on a permanent basis, shall retain this option for full use once in a fiscal (contract) year.
Nothing herein diminishes the rights of a laid-off employee under federal "COBRA" legislation.
J.	Group Insurance Premiums For Less Than Full-Time Employees.
Premium payment and eligibility for coverage for permanent intermittent employees shall continue in accordance with current practice.
Employees hired on or after January 1, 2000 who are appointed to a position with a regular work schedule consisting of 40 hours or less per biweekly pay period shall pay fifty percent (50%) of the premium for health, dental and vision insurance. This shall not apply to an employee appointed to a permanent-intermittent position. Eligibility for enrollment shall be in accordance with current contractual provisions.
Employees who have a regular work schedule of 40 hours or less per biweekly pay period who are temporarily placed on a regular work schedule of more than 40 hours per biweekly pay period for a period expected to last six months or more, shall be considered as working a regular work schedule of more than 40 hours for the period of the temporary schedule adjustment.
K.	Flexible Compensation Plan.
The Employer's pre-tax dollar deduction program is extended to bargaining unit employees. Under such a program, employee contributions for premiums for health

H.	Jury And Witness Duty/Fees. An employee is entitled to administrative leave (time off with full pay) while serving on jury duty. To be eligible for administrative leave, the employee must reimburse the Employer any compensation received, excluding travel/meal reimbursement. The employee may elect to use annual leave, accrued compensatory time, or lost time and keep the compensation paid by the court. Upon being notified of jury duty, an employee shall provide notice to the Employer and thereafter advise the Employer of the jury duty schedule on a daily basis. When not selected for actual service, and only on call, the employee shall report for work as scheduled. To receive administrative leave, the employee must:
1.	Provide a copy of the jury duty summons to his/her supervisor;
2.	Notify the supervisor of the jury duty schedule on a daily basis at or before the beginning of the employee’s scheduled work day;
3.	Certify, in writing, each period of time actually served as a juror for which administrative leave is requested;

Employees must reimburse the department for any witness fees received, up to the amount of their salary, and for any travel expenses allowed by the court. Employees will be reimbursed for any travel expenses in accordance with state standardized travel regulations.
If an employee is subpoenaed as a witness or appears in court in any capacity other than as a witness for the people, he/she will not be considered as being on duty, nor will administrative leave be granted. Any authorized absence shall be charged to annual leave and the employee may retain any expenses or monies received from the court. If any court appearance is required as a result of conduct occurring in the course of employment where the employee had a reasonable basis for believing the alleged conduct was within the scope of his/her authority, the employee will be considered as being on duty.
I.	Pharmacists. Effective October 1, 1996 all pay rates applicable to Pharmacist classes in the bargaining unit shall be increased by $1.00 per hour prior to implementation of the 1.0% general increase previously agreed.

Additionally, effective October 1, 2005 an optional signing bonus may be paid to attract eligible pharmacists who possess skills that are in high market demand. A one-time lump sum bonus of up to $2,500 may, at the employer’s option, be paid to new hires. Current employees are not eligible for the bonus. The bonus will only be paid to secure a commitment from a highly qualified candidate and when filling hard-to-fill positions. The employee must agree to pay back the entire bonus including tax withholding thereon, if the employee leaves the department within one year of the appointment. Payback remittances are owed and payable in full within 30 calendar days of the termination date. Such remittance shall be taken as a negative gross pay adjustment from the employee’s final pay warrant, if possible. The signing bonus is paid as a gross pay adjustment with the employee’s first pay warrant.
Pharmacists with five (5) or more years of service as of November 1, 2006, will receive a one-time retention bonus. Such payment will be the gross sum of $1,500 made on the first pay date in December 2006.

M.	Severance Pay / Department of Community Health. In recognition of the fact that the de-institutionalization of the Department of Community Health resident population has resulted and will continue to result in the layoff of a large number of state employees, and in recognition of the fact that such layoffs are likely to result in the permanent termination of the employment relationship the parties hereby agree to the establishment of severance pay for certain unit employees. The severance pay shall be administered in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Service Compensation Plan and these provisions are incorporated into this Agreement by reference in their entirety.

authorized administrative leave for the period of the general emergency, or seven (7) calendar days whichever is less, to cover their normally scheduled hours of work during the period of closure. This provision shall not apply to employees who can be temporarily reassigned to another facility or are able to perform appropriate job responsibilities away from the facility.
Individual unit employees working at facilities ordered closed may still be required to work to perform essential services during the period of closure. When such is the case, the unit employee shall be compensated in the manner prescribed for employees who work under conditions of declared inaccessibility.
D.	Compensation in Situation of Inaccessibility. If a state facility has not been closed but declared inaccessible in accordance with the Governor's policy, and a unit employee is unable to report for work due to such conditions, he/she shall be granted administrative leave to cover his/her normally scheduled hours of work during the period of declared inaccessibility.
A unit employee who works at a state facility during the declared period of inaccessibility shall be paid his/her regular salary and, if overtime work is required, in accordance with the overtime provisions of this Agreement. In addition, such employees shall also be granted compensatory time off equal to the number of hours worked during the period of declared inaccessibility. Compensatory time shall not accrue at the premium rate.
E.	Additional Timekeeping Procedures. If a state facility has not been closed or declared inaccessible during severe weather or other emergency conditions, an employee unable to report to work because of these conditions shall be allowed to use annual leave or compensatory time credits. If sufficient time credits are not available the employee shall be placed on lost time.
When an employee is absent from a scheduled work period, a portion of which is covered by declaration of closure or inaccessibility, annual leave or compensatory time credits may be used to cover that portion of his/her absence not covered by administrative leave. If sufficient credits are not available, the employee shall be placed on lost time. Employees who are absent due to sick or annual leave usage or who have previously scheduled annual leave during the period of closure or inaccessibility shall not be entitled to administrative leave. If an employee is scheduled to return to work while the building remains closed or inaccessible the employee shall then be eligible for such administrative leave.
Employees who suffer lost time as the result of the application of this policy shall receive credit for the completed biweekly work period for all other purposes.

E.	Nothing provided in this Section shall prohibit the Union from challenging the planned contracting or sub-contracting before the Civil Service Commission, nor from appealing a departmental action which it alleges violates Civil Service Rules and Regulations.

The Employer shall not assign bargaining unit work to employees outside of the bargaining unit except in the case of emergency, temporary work relief or to the extent that such work is a part of their duties as provided in the Civil Service class specifications or to the extent that such assignment is a matter of customary practice. In no event shall such assignments be made for the purpose of reducing or eroding the Scientific and Engineering bargaining unit.
Article 34
JOINT LABOR-MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
A.	Disability Management. The parties agree that the issue of Disability Management is a complex and difficult one which requires study. In addition, disability management policies and programs, when fully implemented, may require changes in some of the provisions of this Agreement. This project includes both the project director and the project labor-management work group. Nothing in this Section is intended to preclude the parties from working, jointly or separately, to learn more about disability management and implementing mutually agreed upon programs. The parties agree that, in the event the state adopts a disability management program, the contract may be reopened for negotiations on this issue by mutual agreement.
B.	The parties agree that the following topics are of importance to both the bargaining unit and the Employer. As such, the parties will establish a committee consisting of the same number of Management and Union representatives in order to discuss

Article 35
DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING
The parties recognize that drug and/or alcohol abuse by an employee often contributes to less than satisfactory attendance and job performance, and may needlessly endanger the safety and well-being of other employees and members of the general public. The parties also recognize that one purpose of this article is to assist employees who may have a problem with drug or alcohol abuse.
A.	Testing.
The employer may require an employee to submit to urinalysis drug screening or alcohol breath testing under the circumstances set forth below in sub-sections 1 through 5.
An employee may refuse to submit to a drug screening or alcohol test but the employee shall be warned that such refusal constitutes grounds for discipline equivalent to discipline imposed for a positive test result, and allowed an opportunity to submit to the testing as though the employee had originally complied with the order.
1.	Preappointment Testing: An employee not occupying a test designated position shall submit to a urinalysis drug screening if the employee is selected for a test-designated position. The employee shall not perform any duties of a test designated position until the employee has submitted to and passed a drug screening. If the employee fails or refuses to submit to the drug test, interferes with a test procedure, or tampers with a test sample, the employee shall not be appointed or otherwise placed in the test designated position and will be ineligible for appointment to or placement in a test designated position for a period of three years. Also, the employee may be disciplined if the employee fails a drug test, refuses to submit to the drug test, interferes with a test procedure, or tampers with a test sample.
2.	Random testing: An employee in a test designated position may be selected at random from a pool comprised of test designated positions covered by this

Agreement. The number of urinalysis drug screenings performed at random each calendar year may not exceed a number equal to 15% (See LOU or page 157) of the number of test designated positions in the pool. The number of alcohol breath tests performed at random each calendar year may not exceed a number equal to 15% of the number of test designated positions in the pool. (See Letter of Understanding, Drug and Alcohol Testing.) If an employee is selected more than twice in a calendar year, the employer agrees to meet with the Union to share specific information used to select that individual and discuss any concerns raised by the Union regarding this information.
3.	Reasonable suspicion testing: An employee may be required to submit to urinalysis drug screening or alcohol breath testing based on reasonable suspicion. Reasonable suspicion means a belief, drawn from specific objective facts and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts in light of experience, that an employee is using or may have used drugs or alcohol in violation of this agreement or a departmental work rule. By way of example only, reasonable suspicion may be based upon any of the following:
a.	Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of drug or alcohol use or the physical symptoms or manifestations of being impaired by, or under the influence of, a drug or alcohol.
b.	A report of on-duty or sufficiently recent off-duty drug or alcohol use provided by a credible source.
c.	Evidence that an individual has tampered with a drug test or alcohol test during employment with the State of Michigan.
d.	Evidence that an employee is involved in the use, possession, sale, solicitation, or transfer of drugs or alcohol while on duty, or while on the employer’s premises, or while operating the employer’s vehicle, machinery, or equipment.
The basis of support for the reasonable suspicion drug screening or alcohol test will be documented by a trained supervisor. An employee shall not be required to submit to a reasonable suspicion drug screening or alcohol test without the individualized expressed approval of the employer Designated Drug and Alcohol Testing Coordinator (DATC) or his/her designee.
4.	Post Accident Testing: An employee in a test designated position shall submit to a drug test or an alcohol test if there is evidence that the employee in the test designated position may have caused or contributed to a serious work accident. A serious work accident is defined as an on-duty accident resulting in death, or serious personal injury requiring immediate medical treatment, that arises out of any of the following:

The Employer may require an employee who is subject to follow-up testing to submit to no more than six unscheduled drug or alcohol tests within any twelve month period.
B.	Test Designated Positions.
For purposes of this article, test designated positions are:
1.	A safety-sensitive position in which the incumbent is required to possess a valid commercial driver’s license or to operate a commercial motor vehicle, an emergency vehicle, or dangerous equipment or machinery.
2.	A position in which the incumbent possesses law enforcement powers or is required or permitted to carry a firearm while on duty.
3.	A position in which the incumbent, on a regular basis, provides direct health care services to persons in the care or custody of the state or one of its political subdivisions.
4.	A position in which the incumbent has regular unsupervised access to and direct contact with prisoners, probationers, or parolees.
5.	A position in which the incumbent has unsupervised access to controlled substances.

8.	New classifications, or levels added to existing classifications, may include duties consistent with those identified for test designated positions in subsections 1 through 6 above. The Employer shall meet with the Union to review the new classification or level prior to requiring an employee in the new class to submit to testing under this article.
C.	Drug and Alcohol Testing Protocol.
The Employer will adopt the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs as the protocol for drug testing and the U.S. Department Of Transportation Procedures For Transportation Workplace Drug And Alcohol Testing Programs for alcohol testing.
After adoption of the protocol, and its implementation, the protocol shall not be subject to change except by mutual agreement of the parties and approved by the Civil Service Commission.
The parties agree to incorporate into this agreement the definitions contained in the U.S. Department Of Health And Human Services Mandatory Guidelines For Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs, as may be amended, and in the U.S. Department of Transportation Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing, as may be amended. In addition, the parties agree to define ‘credible source’ as:
”One who is trustworthy and entitled to be believed. One who is entitled to have his/her oath or affidavit accepted as reliable, not only on account of his/her good reputation for veracity, but also on account of his/her intelligence, knowledge of the circumstances, and disinterested relation to the matter in question. One who is competent to testify.”
D.	Union Representation.
Employees may confer with an available Union representative on site (if available on site), or through a telephone conference, whenever an employee is directed to submit to a reasonable suspicion alcohol or drug test, provided such contact will not unreasonably delay the testing process.
E.	Review Committee for Drug and Alcohol Testing.
A committee consisting of three (3) representatives of the SEIU Coalition and three (3) representatives of the Employer shall meet prior to the implementation of the drug and alcohol testing program to review and discuss the testing procedures, collection methods, quality assurance, and other matters pertaining to the operation of the testing program. The review committee will also meet, upon request of either

party, to review testing data and discuss problems related to the administration of the testing program. The committee may vote on matters it discusses. The committee’s recommendations, if any, will be submitted to the Employer for its consideration. Recommendations voted on by the committee will be reported as “without recommendation” if based on 3-3-tie vote and as a “unanimous recommendation” for any vote other than 3-3.
F.	Confirmation Alcohol Testing.
If an employee is tested for alcohol and is determined to have a blood alcohol level equal or greater than .02% in both the initial evidentiary breath test (EBT) and the confirmation evidentiary breath test, at the employee’s option and at the employee’s full cost, the employee may elect to have a second confirmation test carried out by drawing a sample of blood and submitting it for testing at an approved laboratory. This option is only available if the testing site where the two positive breath tests were conducted is equipped to draw the blood and either directly provide for its testing for level of blood alcohol or transport the sample to a laboratory which is certified to test the sample for level of blood alcohol. The protocol for such confirmation blood testing for alcohol (including but not limited to chain of custody, security, integrity and identity of sample, transportation to testing laboratory if required, reporting of results, etc.) shall be determined prior to initiation of alcohol testing under this article and shall be a topic for discussion in the committee established in this article. The employee shall remain off the job until the results of the second confirmation test are provided to the Employer and may use available leave credits, if desired.
G.	Self-Reporting.
An employee who voluntarily discloses to the Employer a problem with drugs or alcohol shall not be disciplined for such disclosure, if, and only if, the problem is disclosed before the occurrence of any of the following:
1.	For reasonable suspicion testing, before the occurrence of an event that gives rise to reasonable suspicion that the employee has violated this agreement or a department work rule.
2.	For preappointment testing, follow-up testing, and random testing, before the employee is notified to submit to a drug test or alcohol test.
3.	For post-accident testing, before the occurrence of any accident that results in post-accident testing.
After self-reporting, the Employer shall permit the employee an immediate leave of absence, subject to the provisions of Article 23, Leave of Absence, to obtain medical treatment or to participate in a rehabilitation program. In addition, the Employer shall remove the employee from the duties of a test-designated position until the employee submits to and passes a follow-up drug or alcohol

test. The Employer may require the employee to submit to further follow-up testing as a condition of continuing or returning to work.
An employee may take advantage of this provision no more than two times while employed in the classified service. An employee making a report is not excused from any subsequent drug or alcohol test or from otherwise complying in full with this article. An employee making a report remains subject to all drug and alcohol testing requirements after making a report and may be disciplined as the result of any subsequent drug or alcohol test, including a follow-up test.
Article 36
MISCELLANEOUS
A.	Supplemental Employment.
1.	Employees shall be permitted to engage in supplemental employment under the following conditions:
a.	The supplemental outside employment must in no way conflict with the employee’s hours of state employment or in quantity or interest conflict in any way with satisfactory and impartial performance of state duties.
b.	The employee must secure the written approval of the appointing authority on an annual basis before engaging in any supplemental outside employment.
c.	The employee must keep the appointing authority informed of contemplated changes in supplemental outside employment.
2.	Notification. Notification of outside employment shall be given the Employer at least ten (10) days before the commencement of said employment and prior to any changes in previously approved supplemental employment. Approval or disapproval, with reasons therefore, will be given by the employer within ten (10) days after receipt of the notification, or prior to the anticipated commencement date, whichever occurs first. Notification shall be made on forms prescribed by the department.
3.	Cancellation. Should the Employer determine that an employee’s supplemental employment interferes with his/her regular work, employment violates Civil Service Rules and Regulations, or is in violation of this Agreement, he/she will be given reasonable time to promptly terminate his/her supplemental employment before being disciplined, requested to resign state service, or involuntarily terminated.
B.	Safety Shoes. When the Department requires that unit employees wear approved safety shoes, the Department will provide such approved safety shoes in accordance with departmental regulations.

of approved safety shoes up to a maximum of $200.00 during any twenty-four (24) month period of time.
C.	The Employer will furnish protective clothing and equipment in accordance with applicable standards established by the Michigan Departments of Consumer & Industry Services and/or Community Health/Community Public Health Agency. The issue of the Employer providing other apparel, the purpose of which is to protect the health and safety of employees against hazards they might reasonably be expected to encounter in the course of performing job duties, shall be a proper subject for secondary negotiations.
D.	Safety Glasses. If the Employer requires an employee to wear safety glasses, and the employee needs corrective lenses, the Employer shall furnish such glasses after the employee has presented the Employer with the required prescription. The employee shall bear the cost of any eye examination.
E.	VDT/CRT Glasses. Employees who, while operating a VDT/CRT require prescription corrective lenses which are different than those normally used, shall be eligible for reimbursement for lenses and frames on an annual basis at the rates provided herein. Such reimbursement shall be made by the departmental employer. These lenses and frames are in addition to those provided under the vision care insurance. In order to be eligible for this additional reimbursement, employees must utilize a VDT/CRT more than 50% of the time.
F.	Printing Costs. The Union and the Employer agree to pay for the number of contracts each party requests.
G.	Pre-Tax Payroll Deduction For Parking or Transportation Expenses. The parties have discussed the parking/transportation benefit authorized by the Internal Revenue Code, which allows employees to pay parking or transportation expenses out of pre-tax income under certain circumstances. Among the factors discussed was that taking advantage of the parking/transportation benefit reduces an employee’s taxable income, and therefore could slightly reduce the amount of the employee’s social security benefit.
The parties agree as follows:
1.	For bargaining unit employees who pay for parking through payroll deduction, the Employer will implement the pre-tax payroll deduction benefit effective with the August 16, 2001 pay date. Prior to implementation, employees will be offered the opportunity to opt out of the benefit (i.e., to continue payroll deduction from after-tax income).
2.	As soon as administratively feasible, bargaining unit employees who do not have payroll deduction for parking will be offered the opportunity to establish an account for the purpose of reimbursing out-of-pocket parking expenses. The

employee determines the amount of pre-tax income to set aside, and then submits parking receipts for reimbursement from this account.
3.	If permitted under the IRS Code, the Employer will offer the opportunity to establish pre-tax reimbursement accounts to bargaining unit employees who use van pools, buses, or other forms of mass transportation to commute to and from work. Additional research is required to determine whether this benefit can be offered.
H.	Where employees are required to wear identification badges, the employer shall provide protective covers for the badges at no cost to the employee.
I.	Limited Term Appointments. When an employee has been in the same limited term appointment for 4,160 continuous service hours, the employee shall be made permanent, unless the employee is working in a project which has an established ending date. This provision shall not apply in the case of a continuing state classified employee who accepts an appointment to a limited term position, except as specified in Article 12, Section D.
J.	Before parking rates are increased for bargaining unit employees, the Office of the State Employer will meet with the Union and provide information explaining the increase.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING ARTICLE 35 Drug and Alcohol Testing
During the negotiations in 2004, the parties discussed reducing the percentage of employees who are subject to random drug and/or alcohol testing. The Employer agreed to reduce the number of random tests to 10% of the number of test-designated positions in the pool for a one-year period beginning in October 2005. If after one year there is a significant increase in the percentage of positive tests, the Employer reserves the right to return to 15%. If there is a significant reduction in the percentage of positive test results, the Employer will meet with the Union to discuss the issue of further reduction in the percentage of employees randomly tested.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING Union Use of State’s E-Mail System
Where access to the state’s e-mail system is otherwise available, the employer agrees to permit use of the state’s existing e-mail system by union staff, union officers and union stewards for legitimate union business. Any use of the state’s e-mail system by a bargaining unit employee for legitimate union business must take place on non-work time only, including the review of any such union materials transmitted.
All legitimate union business transmitted through the state’s e-mail system must be clearly identified as a union communication in the subject line, and must be of a reasonable size, volume, and frequency. The employer shall have no liability to the union or an employee for the delivery or security of such transmittals.
No partisan political, or profane materials, or materials related to union elections, or materials defamatory or detrimental to the state, to the union, or to an individual employee, may be transmitted through the state’s e-mail system. The employer reserves the right to block any and all such material. The state’s e-mail system is not private and may be monitored at any time.
In the event the office of the state employer determines that the union’s use of the state’s e-mail system violates provisions of this letter of understanding, upon notice from the office of the state employer, the union shall promptly take steps to correct the violation. In the event of a repeat violation, the office of the state employer and the union shall meet and resolve the issue.

The employee will be credited with a like number of banked leave time (BLT) hours for each biweekly pay period.
3.	Hours Eligible for Conversion to Program.
The number of BLT hours for which the employee receives credit shall be accumulated and reported periodically to participating employees.

4.	Timing of conversion of unused program hours.
Upon an employee’s separation, death or retirement from state service, unused BLT hours shall be contributed by the state to the employee’s account within the State of Michigan 401(k) plan, and if applicable to the Sate of Michigan 457 plan. Such contributions shall be treated as non-elective employer contributions, and shall be calculated using the product of the following: (i) the number of BLT hours and, (ii) the employee’s base hourly rate in effect at the time of the contribution.

If the amount of a projected contribution would exceed the maximum amount allowable under section 415 of the internal revenue code (when combined with other projected contributions that count against such limit), the state shall first make a contribution to the employee’s account within the State of Michigan 401(k) plan up to the maximum allowed, and then make the additional contribution to the employee’s account within the State of Michigan 457 plan.
5.	Insurances, Leave Accruals and Service Credits.

Before incurring unpaid Plan A or Plan C hours all BLT hours must be exhausted.

RE: EXECUTIVE ORDERS 1996-1 AND 1996-2
In discussing the issue of substantial adverse impact on bargaining unit employees resulting from Executive Order 1996-1 and Executive Order 1996-2, the parties have agreed to this Letter of Understanding. This Letter of Understanding shall become effective upon Civil Service commission approval, and shall remain in effect until the expiration of the current Secondary Agreements, unless otherwise provided. The parties agree that this Letter of Understanding does not establish any precedent for either party.
The parties agree that alternate work schedules will be continued for moved employees wherever possible. If changes are made, they will be made in accordance with contractual provisions, or the departmental policy or letter of understanding which initially authorized the alternate work schedule.
Methods of accruing compensatory time will continue in accordance with the provisions of Article 19.
Issues regarding vehicle usage and election of per diem travel expenses shall be determined in accordance with the Standardized Travel Regulations and/or departmental policy.
The parties agree that MPES represented bargaining unit employees moved through Executive Orders 1996-1 and 1996-2 will be covered by the departmental secondary agreement in effect within the department to which the employee was moved.
The parties agree that this exhausts the Employer’s duty to bargain over the issue of substantial adverse impact on bargaining unit employees resulting from Executive Orders 1996-1 and 1996-2.

Section 1:	General
The Department of Agriculture (MDA) and the Michigan Professional Employees Society (MPES) mutually agree the goal is to provide a safe and healthful working environment for all unit employees. Both management and unit employees shall cooperate to identify unsafe working conditions and practices and work toward their elimination. The Michigan Department of Agriculture shall make reasonable efforts to provide a safe work environment and eliminate recognized hazards in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations, and established industry standards.
Section 2:	Rule Compliance
All unit employees shall comply with written safety rules and procedures established by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and/or Division management, and with rules established on an emergency basis. Such emergency rules shall be committed to writing at the earliest practicable time.
Section 3:	Designation of MPES Safety Representatives
The Department agrees to establish a Departmental Safety Committee as specified in Appendix B. MPES shall be entitled to designate a unit employee as the MPES Safety Representative to serve on the Departmental Safety Committee and one alternate. This representative or the alternate is entitled, without loss of pay and with proper notice to his/her supervisor, to resolve safety issues with the Department managers on behalf of unit employees in accordance with the procedures outlined in Section 4 of this Article.
To maximum extent possible, the preparation of written requests in accordance with Section 4 will take place on the non-work time of both the MPES Safety Representative and the unit employee with the safety issue.
Section 4:	Procedure for Safety Issues
If a unit employee has a safety issue, he/she will discuss it first with his/her immediate supervisor. The supervisor will provide a verbal response as soon as possible but no later than five (5) days after the discussion.
If not satisfied with the supervisor's response, the unit employee shall, within 10 days of response, submit a written request for action to the Division Director, explaining the problem and a suggested solution. The Division Director will investigate and provide a written approval, denial, or plan of action to the unit employee within 10 days of receipt of the request, forwarding a copy to MPES.

the MPES Safety Representative and/or Society Representative. Any resolution of the safety request shall be confirmed in writing and signed by the Division Director, the requesting unit employee, and the Society. Such resolution shall not be grievable.
Failing resolution with the Division Director, the unit employee and MPES Safety Representative may submit a request for action to the Departmental Safety Committee with copies of the original written request, the Division Director's response and a statement on why the response was not acceptable. The Departmental Safety Committee will review the request and make a recommendation to the Department Director. The decision of the Department Director will be issued in writing. Upon mutual agreement of the Employer and the unit employee or the Society, time limits may be extended.
A unit employee who has reasonable cause to believe he/she is in imminent danger or loss of life or serious bodily injury may remove himself or herself from the situation to notify their immediate supervisor or higher authority, after taking reasonable measures to protect the public, other employees and/or Departmental property. The supervisor or higher authority will immediately correct the situation to the extent possible and/or temporarily reassign the employee to another location or work assignment.
Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted so as to prevent MPES or its designated safety representative from providing assistance in the filing of requests made under this Section, or to prevent the filing of a grievance where there is alleged violation of the agreement. The Department agrees that no retributive action will be taken against a unit employee who exercises his/her rights under this Article.
The Department's compliance with this Article is contingent on the availability of funds. If the Department is unable to immediately implement a safety measure, the Department shall make a positive effort to obtain the necessary funds.
Failure of the Department to implement safety measures agreed to under this Section shall be grievable in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 of the MPES primary agreement.
Section 5:	Safety Equipment and Protective Clothing
The Department reserves the right to require employees to use safety equipment properly and to wear required protective clothing. Failure to do so may result in discipline. Safety equipment and protective clothing that is required by the Department or the Division Director shall be furnished to the employee by the Department. The Department shall provide necessary training for the use of required safety equipment.

APPENDIX H LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING RE: P-RATE AND RETENTION/HIGH SECURITY
This Letter of Understanding is entered into between the State of Michigan, represented by the Office of the State Employer, and the Michigan Professional Employees Society, exclusive representative for the Scientific and Engineering bargaining unit.
1.	Article 2, Section A of the parties' current collective bargaining agreement incorporates by reference the Rules and Compensation Plan ("Plan") of the Michigan Civil Service Commission which were in effect on the effective date of the agreement, unless the subject matter of such rules and compensation plan is covered in the agreement.
2.	Section 4, IV of the Compensation Plan provides that employees who are currently receiving the forty cents ($.40) per hour prison rate (eligibility for which is provided in Article 25, Section I of the current collective bargaining agreement), who have two years of continuous service, and whose work stations are described in Section 4, IV, B.2 of the Plan shall be paid a "Retention/High Security" pay premium of an additional ten cents ($.10) per hour, for a total of fifty cents ($.50) per hour above regular rates. Retention/high security pay and prison rate shall not be applied simultaneously. All other provisions of Section 4, IV of the Plan shall apply in accordance with their terms.
3.	As full and final resolution of any and all grievances, claims, or other disputes regarding implementation of Retention High Security pay for members of this bargaining unit, the parties agree to implement the provisions of the Section 4, IV of the Compensation Plan effective upon ratification by the members of the Scientific and Engineering bargaining unit and approval by the Civil Service Commission of a voluntary economic agreement for Fiscal Year 1993-94.

APPENDIX I
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT NETWORK (HRMN)
During negotiations in 2001 the parties reviewed changes in terminology that resulted from the implementation of the new payroll-personnel system, HRMN. The parties have elected to continue to use terminology that existed prior to the implementation of HRMN even though that same terminology is not utilized in HRMN. The parties agree that the HRMN terminology does not alter the meaning of the contract language unless specifically agreed otherwise.
An example of this are the terms “transfer, reassignment, and demotion” which are called “job change” in HRMN. The HRMN history record will show each of these transactions as a job change, however they will continue to have the same contractual meaning they had prior to the implementation of HRMN.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
ARTICLE 24
The following Rules for Network Use will be used by the parties in determining in and out-of-network benefits. In addition, the parties agree to set up a joint committee for the purpose of creating any additional guidelines and reviewing implementation. The committee will also be charged with identifying situations in which access to non-participating providers may be necessary and developing procedures to avoid balance billing in these situations.
The parties have also discussed the fact that there are some state employees who do not live in Michigan. The following are procedures in place for persons living or traveling outside Michigan:
Members who need medical care when away from Michigan can take advantage of the third party administrator’s national PPO program. There is a toll-free number for members to call in order to be directed to the nearest PPO provider. The member is not required to pay the physician or hospital at the time of service if he/she presents the PPO identification card to the network provider.
If a member is traveling he/she must seek services from a PPO provider. Failure to seek such services from a PPO provider will result in

a member being treated as out-of-network unless the member was seeking services as the result of an emergency.
If a member resides out of state and seeks non-emergency services from a non-PPO provider, he/she will be treated as out-of-network. If there is not adequate access to a PPO provider, exceptions will be handled on a per case basis.
RULES FOR NETWORK USE
A member is considered to have access to the network based on the type of services required, if there are:
•	Primary care -- two primary care physicians (PCP) within 15 miles;
•	Specialty care -- two specialty care physicians (SCP) within 20 miles; and
•	Hospital -- one hospital within 25 miles.
The distance between the member and provider is the center-point of one zip code to the center-point of the other.
Member costs associated within in-network or out-of-network use
Deductible	In-Network $200/Individual $400/Family	Out-Of-Network $500/Individual $1,000/Family
Effective 1-1-09	$300/Individual $600/Family	$600/Individual $1,200/Family
Co-Payments Effective 10-1-08	Office Visits $10 Office Visits $15 Services 0% Or 10% Emergency 0%	Most Services 10% (See 2. Below)
Effective 10-1-08	Emergency room visit $50 co-pay if not admitted	Emergency room visit $50 co-pay if not admitted

provider refers the member to an out-of-network SCP the member continues to pay in-network expenses.
2.	If a member has access to the network, the member receives benefits at the out-of-network level when a non-network provider is used. The member is responsible for the out-of-network deductible (if any), and co-payment (if any).
•	If the non-network provider is a blues' participating provider, the provider will accept the blues' payment as payment in full. The member is responsible for the out-of-network deductible and co-payment. The member will not, however, be balance billed.
•	If the non-network provider is not a Blues' participating provider, the provider does not accept blues' payment as payment in full. The member is responsible for the out-of-network deductible and co-payment. The member may also be balance billed by the provider for all amounts in excess of the Blues' approved payment amount.
When a member has access to the network and chooses to use an out-ofnetwork provider, amounts paid toward the out-of-network deductible, copayment or out-of-pocket maximum cannot be used to satisfy the in-network deductible, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximum.
3.	If a member does not have access to the network as provided above, the member will be treated as in-network for all benefits. The member will be responsible for the in-network deductible (if any) and co-payment (if any).
4.	If a member does not have access to the network but then additional providers join the network so that the member would now be considered innetwork, the member will be notified and given a reasonable amount of time in which to seek care from an in-network provider. Care received from a nonnetwork provider after that grace period will be considered out-of-network and the out-of-network deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums will apply. If a member is undergoing a course of treatment at the time he becomes in-network, the in-network rules will continue for that course of treatment only pursuant to the PPO standard transition policy. Once the course of treatment has been finished, the member must use an in-network provider or be governed by the out-of-network rules.
If a member is under a course of treatment on January 1, 2003 when the new State Health Plan is implemented, the member will be treated as in-network until the course of treatment is concluded pursuant to the PPO standard transition policy. After that, the level of benefits will be governed by the in/out-of-network rules of the new State Health Plan.
