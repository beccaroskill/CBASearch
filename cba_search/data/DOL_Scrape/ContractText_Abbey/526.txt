PROVISION FOR SYSTEM OPERATING PERSONNEL
(Reference to System Operator applies to Transmission System Operator or Subtransmission System Operator as appropriate.)
1.	Station Manning: Supervision will determine the number of persons to be included n a shift rotation at a station. A normal rotation will consist of five or more System Operators.
A number of shift options have been made available to the System Operaton; as a part of this Paragraph M Agreement.
Voting: If the System Operators e t a station express an interest in changing from their existing shift rotation, the Union will conduct a vote of the affected Union members at the station.
Such voting will be conducted curing the first two weeks of October of each year to determine if a new shift will be implemented for the following year.
A 60% or greater majority of the votes cast will be required to implement a new shift ro tation.
2.	Fixed Graveyard Shifts
A.	Establishing a Fixed Graveyard Shift Rotation (FGS):
At stations where at least one crew member desires to fill a fixed graveyard strft, a vote may be conducted concerning the establishment of a FGS rotation. A crew that votes to establish a FGS must also vote to select an “alternate” regular shift rotation (from Item 3.B. or D. below) to revert to in the event that a position on the FGS rotation becomes vacant and goes unfilled and the vacancy can only be filled by a bidder for a regular rotating shift schedule.
Rev. 2006
Appendix
1
Appendix
B.	Filling a Vacant Fixed Graveyard Shift on a FGS Schedule:
If a FGS is established and the fixed graveyard shift is subsequently vacated, the senior System Operator at the station who so desires may move to the vacant fixed graveyard shift without the necessity of posting a job bid. If the vacant fixed graveyard shift is not filled from within the crew, it will be posted for bid.
C.	Filling a Vacant Rotating Shift Position at a FGS Station:
If a vacancy occurs in the rotating shifts, the fixed graveyard System Operator may elect to move to a rotating shift without the necessity of a job bid being posted. If the vacancy is not filled by the fixed graveyard crew member, it will be posted for bid.
D.	Posting Job Bids at Locations with a FGS Schedule:
A System Operator vacancy on a FGS that is not filled by a volunteer on the crew will be posted as follows:
(1)	A Fixed Graveyard vacancy will be bid as “System Operator — FGS — Fixed Graveyard Shift."
To expedite filling the vacancy at the station (in the event there are no qualified bidders for the fixed graveyard shift), the Company may simultaneously post a bid for “System Operator — Regular Rotating Shift schedule" with a note that the bid “will only be awarded if there is no qualified bidder for the FGS — Fixed Graveyard vacancy; i.e., Bid No.above.”

ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW PERMANENT SHIFTS — TSD/CMM
Concerning the establishment of new permanent shifts in the:
A.	Transportation Services Department
B.	Corporate Materials Management
During the negotiations for the 1989-90 agreement, it was agreed that the aforementioned departments would be allowed to reassign existing employees at a work base to fill a new permanent shift at their work location without use of the bid or the reduction of forces procedures of the agreement. This procedure would apply only to newly established permanent shifts and it is not to be used for the temporary assignment of employees to a shift.
Procedure:
1.	Vacancies on the new permanent shift will first be offered to volunteers in the classifications at the work base. Employees with the highest working unit seniority will be given preference.
2.	If volunteers are insufficient to fill the vacancies on the new shift, employees at the work base will be assigned to the new shift by classification based on low working unit seniority.
3.	Supervision on newly established shifts will be filled by job bid.
In the event a shift, which has been established under this procedure, is to be eliminated, the employees on the eliminated shift will be transferred to shifts at the work base, based on their working unit seniority.

BIDDING OF LINEMAN/SPLICE R VACANCIES IN THE DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS UNIT
Problems associated with the bidding of the Lineman/Splicer and Apprentice Lineman/Splicer vacancies in the Customer Service Department have been an ongoing topic of discussions since 1982. To ensure the opportunity for Journeyman to bid to all locations throughout the system while attempting to prevent having an unreasonably high number of apprentices at any given location, the parties have agreed to the following “high/low” bid system:
A.	Definition of Terms
1.	Apprentice
The term apprentice includes all active Apprentice Linemen/Splicers, first step through sixth step, inclusive.
2.	Journeyman
The term Journeyman includes all active Journeyman Linemen/Splicers and red circled Senior Cable Splicers in the Customer Service Department.
3.	High Ratio District
A high ratio district is a district whose ratio of journeymen to apprentices is equal to or above 2.25 to 1.
4.	Low Ratio District
A low ratio district is a district whose ratio of journeymen to apprentices is less thon 2.25.
B.	Determination of a District s Ratio at a Given Point in Time
1.	Each district shall determine whether it is a high ratio or low ratio district for each Journeyman
Rev. 2006
Appendix
35
Appendix
Lineman/Splicer bid posted. The calculation shall be based on the district’s status as of the date of the specific job posting. However, if at the time of the bid award the successful bidder’s district has become a low ratio district, due to a Journeyman Lineman/Splicer in the district being awarded a bid (includes Exhibit C and E jobs), the bid will instead be awarded to the next bidder from a high ratio district.
2.	For the purpose of determining a district’s status, an employee who has been awarded a transfer or bid but who has not yet reported to the new job assignment, will be considered as working at the new job assignment as of the date of the job award.
C.	Bidding of Customer Service Lineman/Splicer Vacancies
1.	The Customer Service Department will bid all Lineman/Splicer vacancies as journeymen with the following exception:
a. In high ratio districts every other Lineman/ Splicer vacancy may be bid as an apprentice.
2.	Lineman/Splicers in high ratio districts shall be awarded bids in either high ratio or low ratio districts.
3.	Lineman/Splicers in low ratio districts shall not be awarded journeyman Lineman/Splicer bids except:
The senior qualified journeyman bidder from a low ratio district will be awarded a job vacancy 1) over transfers or new hires; or 2) before the job is filled as an apprentice by a non-journeyman bidder from a low ratio district.

EXHIBIT “A” AGREEMENT
The Union and the Company hereby agree that the following principles shall be used to determine whether the relationship between the Company and a non-Edison entity shall be covered by Article Vll-K and the 1981 Letter of Understanding. Thus, where it is established that the Company is engaging in any of the following types of conduct in dealing with such an entity’s employees, Article Vll-K and the Letter of Understanding shall apply.
These principles shall not be applicable to owneroperators or to lessors of heavy equipment who provide heavy equipment along with an operator to perform work as directed by Edison personnel. Nothing herein shall apply to communications between Edison and a contractor in which Edison requests the assignment to or removal from its jobs of contractor personnel who are supervisors within the meaning of the Labor-Management Relations Act.
1.	Hiring — Edison shall not select or be involved in the decision to select specific craft personnel to be employed by a contractor to perform work for Edison.
2.	Discipline — Edison shall ;iot terminate or discipline contractor craft personnel or request that specific contractor craft employees be terminated or disciplined by the contractor based on Edison’s evaluation of the individual’s work performance for the contractor. Edison may comment about the quality of the contractor’s performance or report any breach of its site or facility rules in which it observes a particular contractor employee engaging. Edison may require a contractor to remove an employee from Edison jobs due to a breach of generally accepted rules of behavior (e.g., theft, drunkenness on the job, or other
Rev. 2006
Appendix
41
Appendix
behavior which is disruptive to or destructive of Edison’s operations or which creates a safety hazard).
3.	Supervision — Edison shall not direct the manner or means by which a job is to be performed by a contractor’s craft employees. Edison representatives shall not utilize a contractor foreman so as to be a mere conduit to directly pass on specific job directions to contractor employees on the manner or means by which a job is to be performed. Nothing herein shall prevent Edison employees from directly ordering contractor employees to leave restricted areas where they are not authorized to be present, or to give contractor employees safety directions where necessary to prevent injury. Edison may require the contractor to comply with Edison blueprints, specifications and quality standards and to coordinate with other contractors or with Edison so that project schedules can be met. Edison may change job specifications or scheduling requirements as it sees fit.
4.	Training — Edison shall not train contractor craft employees how to perform the tasks associated with the performance of a particular craft job. This shall not preclude Edison from (1) providing contractor employees with orientation necessary to the site or Edison requirements, or (2) providing safety tailboards to contractor employees at energized work locations.
5.	Movement of Contractor Crew Personnel — Edison shall not require a contractor to transfer a particular craft employee or group of craft employees to a particular job. Nothing herein shall preclude Edison from establishing priorities and deadlines for a contractor which may have the effect of requiring the contractor to move one or more of its crews from one job to another.
42
Appendix
Rev. 2006
Appendix
6.	Personnel Decisions — Edison shall not: (1) schedule the contractor’s craft employees; (2) determine which contractor craft employees shall work overtime; (3) schedule vacations; or (4) grant or deny time off. Nothing herein shall prevent Edison from establishing starting times, from requiring the contractor to obtain authorization prior to working overtime, or from requiring that the contractor perform its work in accordance with Edison deadlines and schedules.
7.	Tools — Edison shall not supply tools and equipment to the contractors’ employees. Nothing herein shall preclude Edison from supplying specialized Edison tools/equipment to contractors — providing such tools are made equally available to all contractors.

PROMOTIONAL TESTING
In conjunction with the 1991-1992 negotiations between the Southern California Edison Company and Local 47, IBEW, the Union’s proposal U-20, concerning promotional testing, wgs discussed. The issues raised by the Union involved the Company sometimes failing to provide employees with their job knowledge (promotional) test results in a timely manner, failing to provide test scores, and failing to identify areas of the test where improvement may be needed.
The Company is committed to reviewing the procedure for the transmittal of test results to employees with its line management. Improvements will be made, as determined by the Company.
Further, the Company will provide employees with their test results in a timely manner (normally test results will be provided to the employee within 10 working days). The Company will provide employees with their actual test scores when they fail to pass job knowledge tests. Finally, the Company will ensure that all employees who fail job knowledge tests are provided with an outline identifying I he subject areas where improvement is needed in order to be successful in future tests.
Nothing in this letter should be construed as limiting the Company’s rights under the collective bargaining agreement to determine job qualifications or utilize promotional testing, nor to prejudice the Union’s position in this regard.

NITE LINE CREWS
After studying customer needs, and trends in workloads, the Company has determined that customer demands for nighttime outages and the need for other nighttime work has increased significantly due to businesses’ increased reliance on computers and increased traffic congestion. The Company has concluded that it has a need to establish Nite Line Crews (Nite Crews) to help in controlling operating costs and in maintaining its ability to provide quality customer service. Thus, after several meetings with the Union, the following agreement was reached:
1.	In conjunction with reaching this Nite Crew agreement, the Company agrees that where a regular 4/10 work schedule is offered to Customer Service Line Crew personnel, it will be offered on a Monday through Friday coverage basis only. At locations where the employees vote to work a 4/10 schedule, the Customer Service Department may then post a bid for a Saturday Line Crew (Saturday Crew) to work a 4/10 Wednesday through Saturday daytime schedule in accordance with 4/10 Q & A No. 26 (the signing of such bids is strictly voluntary and no employee will be forced to change his/her regular work schedule to work a Saturday schedule).
2.	In addition to the above modification of the 4/10 agreement, employees working a 4/10 schedule will be given options to select the regular workday on which they will observe a regular holiday. (See the Letter of Understanding regarding Four Day/Ten Hour Work Schedules.)
3.	Nite Crews will be utilized to meet demands for pre-arranged outage work and other types of jobs which need to be accomplished during nighttime hours. (It is not the intent of the Company to establish
64
Appendix

Appendix
Nite Crews to do routine line construction and maintenance work on a frequent basis which can reasonably be done by regular crews.)
4.	Nite Crew Work Schedules:
a)	Nite Crews will work a 4/10 sc hedule.
b)	The regular work hours for Nite Crews on a 4/10 schedule will be 8:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. (it is understood that a regular Monday workday will start at 8:30 p.m. on Monday evening and end at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday morning, etc.).
c)	The normal work schedule for Nite Crews will be either Monday through Thursday nights (8:30 p.m. Monday-6:30 a.m. Friday, inclusive) or Tuesday through Friday nights (8:30 p.m. Tuesday-6:30 a.m. Saturday, inclusive).
5.	Nite Crews will eat lunch on Company time.
6.	Filling Nite Crew Vacancies:
a)	If the Company elects to fill a permanent vacancy on a Nite Crew, such vacancy will be filled using the bid process, except Groundmen positions will be filled via the transfer process.
(It is agreed that the Customer Service Department may elect not to accept transfer requests to fill Nite Crew Journeyman vacancies excep t that transfers will be honored consistent with the Agreement prior to hiring a new employee to fill the position.)
1)	If a permanent vacancy on a crew is expected to remain unfilled for two weeks or more, the Company may seek volunteers from the regular line crew personnel in the classification at the work base to temporarily fill the vacancy.
2)	If there are insufficient qualified volunteers, the Company may (with a minimum of Iwo weeks’ notice)
Rev. 2006
Appendix
65
Appendix
change the low seniority employee’s shift from days to nights and assign him/her to the Nite Crew for up to three weeks.
If the vacancy continues beyond three weeks, the next lowest seniority employee in the classification may (with a minimum of two weeks notice) be assigned to the crew for up to three weeks, etc.
b)	If the Company elects to fill a temporary vacancy (due to sickness, vacation, jury duty or other such absences from which the employee is expected to return to the crew) on a Nite Crew, such vacancy will be filled on overtime using the regular district “planned" evergreen overtime list where the crew is based. (The planned overtime list will also be used when filling Saturday vacancies on a Saturday Crew.)
7.	Employees assigned to a Nite Crew shall receive their regular contractual rates of pay plus the graveyard shift differential.
8.	Nite Crews will be regularly assigned to work within a Regional (vs. District) area. (Each Nite Crew will have a permanent work base.)
9.	Nite Crew personnel based within each Region will be on separate evergreen overtime lists.
a)	Nite Crew personnel may be assigned to work overtime in conjunction with jobs which they have been regularly assigned.
b)	Regular Line Crew personnel will be given first opportunity to work all planned and/or emergency overtime within their district boundaries, except as noted in “a)” above.

It is understood that a Nite (or Saturday) Crew member may continue working on the emergency job if the Service Center (District) has; gone through the callout list twice and has been unable to obtain the necessary personnel for the emergency job.
(Agreement on this Item No. 10 is related solely to the use of Nite [or Saturday] Crews and such agreement is without precedent or prejudice to either party's positions concerning the use of other crews throughout the Company.)
11.	It is agreed that no reduction in forces will result from the addition or deletion of a Nite Crew at a location. If a Nite Crew is subsequently eliminated, the crew members will be merged into the regular work force at the location where they are based.
12.	a) Initially, the Company posted bids for seven (7) regional five-man Nite, E Crews
b) In conjunction with posting the Nite Crew bids, the Company also posted bids for an additional eight (8) regular four-man E Crews in the Desert Springs Region. (All crews were added in the San Jacinto Valley, at the old Perris Service Center.)

PART TIME METER READERS SENIORITY AGREEMENT
As we have discussed, the situalion currently exists where Part Time Meter Readers do not acquire working unit seniority for their time of service spent as Part Time employees with the Company. To provide an equitable solution to this situation, the parties have agreed to the following:
The application of granting working unit seniority for time spent as a Part Time Meter Reader will be in accordance with Article VII K.2 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Current Regular Represented employees will be credited with additional working unit seniority for their time spent as Part Time Meter Reader. This time will be based on the length of time between the Part Time employee’s hire date and his/her date of conversion to a Flegular Full Time employee, not to exceed 12 months. The parties agree to establish 1-1-95 as the effective date for this change. Current employees who were Part Time Meter Readers will be credited with working unit seniority as described above.
Any Part Time Meter Reader who accepts a Regular Meter Reader position subsequent to the date of this Agreement will be credited for their time worked as a Part Time Meter Reader for purposes of working unit seniority, as described Jibove.
The parties further agree to implement these changes as soon as possible, but with the understanding that the review of employee work histories will take a substantial period of time to complete. It is anticipated that this; review and any subsequent changes to affected employees work histories will be completed between now and September 30, 2001. If the review is completed prior

PILOT PROGRAM FOR BARGAINING UNIT TRAINING FOREMAN
As described in this letter of understanding, the Company and the Union have reached agreement in creating a pilot program to test the concept of utilizing bargaining unit foreman on the Apprentice Lineman training crews. The term of this pitot program will be for 12 months commencing with the signing of this Agreement. If it is determined that after the initial 12-month Pilot Program that the Company desires to continue forward with his concept, this Agreement will be ongoing with either party having the ability to cancel the Agreement by providing the other party 60-day written notice of their intent. Trie parties will also utilize the Joint Apprentice Lineman Committee to discuss the effectiveness of this program.
Currently the Training School ct Chino has eight established training crews, which perform work to provide experience to Apprentice Lineman in all aspects of line work. This Pilot Program Agreement provides that the Company will create and establish the IBEW represented classification of Training Foreman to supervise the training c?ews. The Training Foreman classification will be an Exhibit E position, with a pay rate 5% above the Electrical Crew Foreman classification.
The Company will establish the Foreman’s reporting locations, which will be reviewed, on an ongoing basis and be subject to change.
In the absence of a Training Foreman, the senior qualified journeyman at the work location that the crew is working in will be offered the upgrade.
Crew size will be limited to no more than six apprentices on a single Training Crew.
Rev. 2006
Appendix
83
Appendix
The intent of this program is to provide developmental opportunities to the Training Foreman as well as provide guidance and direction to the apprentices. If the pilot program is determined to be successful at the end of one year, Training Foreman positions will be subject to re-posting annually based upon need. Existing Training Foreman will have the right to reapply for these openings. If current Electrical Crew Foremen are awarded the training opportunity, the vacancy created will be filled by shadow or upgrade as necessary, until they return from the Training Foreman position.
The initial openings created by this Pilot Program will first be offered to the existing Training Supervisors prior to posting the openings. If the need should arise to reduce or eliminate any of the Training Foremen or any the Training Foremen positions, the affected Training Foreman will be returned to the job classification last held without the use of the Reduction in Force procedure being enacted. If a Training Foreman’s work location is relocated, the option will be provided to the affected Training Foreman to either accept the new work location or be returned to the job classification last held without the use of the Reduction in Force procedure being enacted. Without precedence, bids for the training jobs will be posted in both the Transmission and Distribution Business Units.
As a pilot program this Agreement is meant to explore the value of a Bargaining Unit supervisor in a training role. The primary measure of success is to produce quality Apprentice Lineman. Another measure of the success of the program will be the safety performance of the crews. At the conclusion of the 12-month program, a review of all accidents on training crews will be done to assess the manner in which the pilot program has performed in safety.
84
Appendix
Rev. 2006
Appendix

Q&As TRAINING FOREMAN PILOT PROGRAM
Question: Will the Training Foreman classification be required to work overtime?
Answer: As part of the responsibilities of the Training Foreman classification, there is an expectation that the record keeping aspects of the position will necessitate the Training Foreman to be provided by management 30 minutes of overtime. This overtime would be available on workdays that the Training Foreman is working with the crew in the field and would be utilized to complete the required documentation pertaining to the Training crews.
Question: Will there be other Overtime opportunities for the Training Foreman to work? What evergreen list will they be on?
Answer: Training Foremen will not reside on any overtime list. The Training Foreman will be considered for overtime opportunities in the work location that they are reporting to after the work location’s evergreen list has been exhausted. When overtime is available it will be offered to the Training Foreman in accordance with the overtime provisions in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Question: What is the maximum crew size if they are performing energized work?
Answer: If the Training crew is performing energized work, the size limitation of the crew will be determined by the voltage level that the crew is working on. The Power Delivery Policy/Procedure Book, the Collective Bargaining Agreement and the SCE Accident Prevention Manual will be used for appropriate manning levels for the Training crew size. Additionally, appropriate consideration will be given to the apprentice’s level of skill and knowledge as well

as the established work limitations of such apprentice’s placement within the step progression.
Question: How long may an upgrade be utilized behind an E Crew Foreman who takes a Training Crew Foreman position?
Answer: The upgrade may remain in place for as long as the E Crew Foreman remains in the Training Foreman position, or until management posts the position.
Question: If I become a Training Foreman and the Company decides to move my existing reporting location, do I have a choice to move or return to my previously held position in the bargaining unit?
Answer: If the decision is macle to relocate the reporting location of the Training Foreman, the existing Training Foreman will be eligible to continue in the position at the new location. Otherwise, the Training Foreman would return to their last held bargaining unit position.
Question: Can the Company add or eliminate Training crews without negotiating such changes with the Union?
Answer: Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company can increase or decrease the number of Training crews utilized to meet their training requirements without negotiating such changes with the Union.
Question: Where are the reporting locations that the Company will be establishing the Training Foreman at?
Answer: The Company anticipates establishing initial reporting locations in Ontario, Thousand Oaks, Dominguez Hills, Santa Ana, San Joaquin, South Bay, San Jacinto and Covina.

Question: Will the Training Foreman be expected to Job Site Report?
Answer: Yes. The Job Site Reporting and Temporary Base procedures contained within the Collective Bargaining Agreement will continue to be utilized for this Agreement.
Question: If an E Crew Foreman has one or more Apprentice Lineman on his crew, does he receive the Training Foreman rate of pay?
Answer: No. Only the Training Foreman classification and the appropriate upgrades to the classification receive the increased rate of pay. Having Apprentice Lineman on a regular E Crew does not qualify for a change in the E Crew Foreman’s rate of pay.
Question: Can a Training Foreman elect to opt out of the Training Foreman position and return to their previously held position in the bargaining unit?
Answer: Yes.

REVISION TO THE GROUNDMAN“A”AGREEMENT
This Agreement will supersede and take precedent over the original Agreement for Groundman “A" classification dated September 28, 2001. As described in that letter of understanding, the Company and the Union reached an agreement to create the Groundman “A” classification, eliminating the Apprentice In Training job classification and returning to the 3-year Lineman Apprentice program. The reason for this change is to provide an improved career path for our employees and IBEW members, which will also support the Company and Unions mutual objectives. It should be recognized that the job description of the Groundman “A" a nd the Groundman classification would be the same as the job description of the existing Groundman classification.
The Groundman “A” classification will be filled with employees whose intentions are to promote into Apprentice Lineman. The existing Groundman classification will be considered cis a long term or career Groundman position. Employees in this classification will not be able to bid Apprentice Lineman positions, which constitutes the only change in the existing Groundman classification. The Company will determine the type and quantity of Groundman and Groundman “A” positions that will be filled and maintained. Both the Groundman and Groundman “A” classification will be maintained on the same evergreen list.
The prerequisite for an employee to sign a transfer into Groundman “A” position will be to have successfully completed the Groundman Aptitude Examination and the Introduction To Climbing Class. After being awarded the Groundman “A” position, the
Rev. 2006

employee will be required to successfully complete the Groundman Training Program. If in future, the “drop out” rate from the Apprentice Lineman classification is determined to be unacceptable due to failure of Apprentices to complete the Climbing School Certification program, the parties agree to discuss necessary changes to the entry requirements of the classification, including requiring satisfactorily completion of the Climbing School Certification program prior to being considered qualified to sign an Apprentice Lineman bid. It is also further agreed, that both parties commit to meet and discuss issues of interest raised by either party, which may occur in the future, relative to this Agreement.
Employees who enter into a Groundman “A" position will be eligible to bid Apprentice Lineman positions after 6 months of Groundman experience is completed, provided they have completed the Groundman Training Program. Groundman “A” will also have assignability as an Apprentice Lineman to other work locations located within a 35-mile straight-line radius of their Groundman “A" work location. When an Apprentice Lineman position is posted the most senior qualified bidder (with at least 6 months of Groundman experience), will be offered the position. All qualified Groundman “A” at the location of the Apprentice Lineman vacancy(s) are required to sign the bid posting. If there are no qualified Groundman “A” at the bid location, and no other Groundman “A” sign the bid posting, the senior qualified Groundman “A” within the assignability radius of the vacant bid posting location will be assigned the position. The assignability provision described in this Agreement pertains solely to the Groundman “A” classification, and has no effect on any other assignability applications outside of this Agreement.

Appendix
Rev. 2006
Appendix
If in either case the senior qualified Groundman “A” decides not to accept the position offered, they will be removed from the Groundman “A;’ classification and be required to find another position per Article VII B of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The vacancy will be offered to the remaining qualified employees until the vacancy is filled. If within 30 days of the Apprentice Lineman vacancy being filled an employee “drops out” of the Apprentice Linesman classification, the original bid posting can be utilized to fill the vacancy created by the “drop out” without the need to re-post the opening. This type of vacancy will be filled in the same manner as describee! above for regular job bids.
The Groundman classification wiill not be permitted to bid on Apprentice Lineman openings. Groundman and other employees may transfer into Groundman “A” openings. Employees who bid/transfer into the Groundman “A” classification will be required to successfully complete the prerequisites for the classification as provided above.
Effective April 1, 2003, Apprentice Lineman, during their first year (which includes 1st and 2nd step), will be allowed to change locations one time through the bid process provided they were assigned to a location (under the assignability clause oE the Agreement). Such Apprentices will be given preferential bid rights to the location of their choice. Existing Apprentice Lineman prior to April 1, 2003, will continue to be able to change locations as provided in the original Agreement. They will remain at the! same step in the Apprentice progression when such a bid is awarded. Bids may only be signed within the employee’s working unit. Any Apprentice Lineman signing a bid under this Agreement will be given priority over Groundman “A” and the bid will be awarded to the most senior employee.
Rev. 2006
Appendix

Appendix
Qualified Distribution Groundman “A”s will be considered eligible to bid Apprentice Lineman openings within the Distribution and Transmission/Substation work units. Jobs will first be awarded to qualified employees within the Transmission Work Unit. Once all qualified bidders and Groundman “A” who are assignable within the Transmission Work Unit are exhausted, qualified Distribution bids will then be considered. No Groundman “A”s will be forced to fill open Apprentice Lineman positions outside of their working unit.
Employees who are currently working as Apprentices In Training at the 2nd step of the wage progression will be placed into the Apprentice Lineman classification at the 1st step. Those employees in the Apprentice In Training classification at the 1st step of the wage progression will be placed the Groundman “A” classification at the 4th step of the progression. The wages for the Groundman “A" and the Groundman classification will be identical to the current wage progression of the existing Groundman classification as provided in Exhibit A of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

Re: Mapping Technician Revision “Pilot Program”
Dear Mike:
The following represents the agreement the Company and Union have reached regarding the changes in the Company's ability to fill the Mapping Technician position without the need for an employee to be an incumbent, or have previously held the position or have been a DA1 Who has passed the required promotional test.

In an effort to provide career opportunities and advancement, the party’s have agreed to revise the requirements as provided for in the April 17, 2002 Clerical Classification Agreement which required the Company to fill the Assistant Mapping Technician position if there were no qualified candidates for the Mapping Technician opening. Effective upon the Agreement date, the Company will now be able to fill the Mapping Technician classification through the bidding and transfer procedure, without the above listed limitations. Additionally, a fifth step will be added to the wage progression for the classification. This new wage progression will mirror the existing step progression already in place for the Construction/Maintenance Accountant classification.
All incumbents in the Mapping Technician classification as of the date of this Agreement will be provided preferential bid rights to any posted
