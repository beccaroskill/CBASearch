Upon transfer from one bargaining unit to another, employees shall retain their seniority. Relative seniority of all employees who have the same seniority date is determined in accordance with the last four digits of each employee’s social security number, i.e., the lowest number has the most seniority; when the four digits are identical the next previous digit which is not identical shall be determinative.
4.2	QUALIFICATIONS
In the application of principles of seniority as provided in this Agreement, consistent with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, the employee must have the qualifications and physical capability to perform the work involved. “Qualified” or “qualifications” for the purpose of filling vacancies means that the employee meets the requirements of the job description.

Upon reclassification, employees shall be given such guidance and orientation normally provided employees assigned to a particular classification or bonus pay job assignment.

A new employee and one who is re-employed after a break in his seniority shall not acquire any seniority under this Agreement until the expiration of 90 days of continuous service following employment. If such employee is continued in the employ of the Company after the expiration of the 90 day period, his seniority shall be computed from his last date of hire in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement. Any separations of employment during said 90 day probationary period shall not be made the basis of a claim or grievance against the Company and there shall be no obligation to re-employ such person; provided, however, that this provision shall not be used for the purpose of discrimination, as discrimination is defined in Article 2, Section 2.3.

4.5	PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEE ABSENCE
If a probationary employee is granted a leave of absence or is absent in excess of five workdays (40 hours) during his probationary period, the effective date of acquiring seniority shall be postponed by the period of time the employee has been absent or on leave.

4.6(c) Is absent for three consecutive workdays without reporting to the Company during the absence a reason which is sufficient to justify such absence, unless notification to the Company is beyond the employee’s control; otherwise, such absence shall be cause for termination. Compliance with this is not to be construed to mean that excessive absenteeism shall be tolerated.
4.6(d) Is absent due to layoff or medical leave of absence, or both, for a period equal to his length of seniority at the time of such layoff or leave of absence, but in no event in excess of five years.

4.7	INDEFINITE LAYOFF AND RECALL FROM LAYOFF
For the purpose of an indefinite layoff employees shall be laid off as follows:
4.7(a) Seniority employees with a layoff request on file will be laid off first. Then probationary employees in the line of progression affected shall be terminated, provided there are available seniority employees remaining in the classification affected who are willing and have the ability to perform the work of the probationary employees to be displaced.
4.7(b) Thereafter, seniority employees in the affected classification having the least seniority shall be laid off provided that an employee cannot be laid off in a lower classification while an employee is retained in his line of progression with less seniority, provided there are employees in the lower classification in the line of progression who have a status change request form on file at the time of the layoff and who are qualified for promotion to the higher classification. An employee notified of indefinite layoff has twenty-four (24) hours (excluding Saturday and Sunday) from time of notice to file a status change request form to compete for a higher job classification in his line of progression. Such employee who would otherwise be laid off shall, if he has the qualifications to perform the work, or if he previously successfully held the classification or bonus pay job, be allowed to:
4.7(b)(1) displace the least senior employee in the next lower classification in the line of progression; or
4.7(b)(2) displace the least senior employee in any classification he previously held; or
4.7(b)(3) displace the least senior employee in the lowest occupied classification in another line of progression; or
4.7(b)(4) elect a layoff and await recall to any job classification he is qualified to perform and for which he has filed a status change request. At the time an employee is given notice that he is being laid off from his classification, he must within 24 hours (excluding Saturday and Sunday) select one of the above listed options or he shall be laid off effective the date stated in the layoff notice. An employee’s personnel file as it exists at the time the Company issues the layoff notice except for qualifications acquired less than thirty days prior to the notice of layoff which must be submitted with his selection option, including on the job experience as shown in the personnel file, and the job description shall be the determining factor in the application of Section 4.7.
4.7(c) An Aircraft Technical/NDT Inspector downgraded to an Aircraft Mechanic classification or an Aircraft Mechanic displaced from a Flight Engineer or Flight Mechanic job assignment will be allowed to displace the least senior Leader or Flight
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO - Local Lodge 2003
Page | 8
Army Fleet Support LLC - Fort Rucker, Alabama Collective Bargaining Agreement - May 2011
Mechanic or he may displace a Flight Engineer if assigned to an aircraft requiring flight engineers provided he meets the requirements of the bonus pay job description. The Aircraft Mechanic Leader who is displaced will be permitted to displace the least senior Flight Mechanic if he previously held the job or displace the least senior Flight Engineer if he previously held the job on the respective aircraft.
4.7(d) When decreasing the work force in connection with an indefinite layoff, the Company shall give the least senior employee(s) in the classification and the Union at least 10 workdays notice. Affected employees on leave of absence or temporarily laid off may be notified of an indefinite layoff by certified letter or other documentable and verifiable means sent to their last known address as shown on the Company records. Employees actually laid off as a result of being displaced by a more senior employee under 4.7(b) are not subject to the 10 day notice provision but will receive at least 3 workdays notice.
4.7(e) Maintenance Test Pilot aircraft qualifications will not be cause for indefinite layoff, i.e., layoffs of Maintenance Test Pilots will be by seniority, however, a Maintenance Test Pilot who fails to qualify in a particular type aircraft after receiving the usual and normal training will be laid off provided other aircraft which he is qualified to fly are not available.
4.7(f) RECALL FROM LAYOFF - Notification of recall for the purpose of this shall be made by certified mail, telegram or other documentable and verifiable means addressed to the employee’s last known address as shown on the Company’s records. Failure of the employee to keep the Company informed of his current address shall relieve the Company of any obligations for recall of said employee. Failure to receive notice of recall shall be considered a satisfactory reason for not returning to work within five calendar days, so as to retain seniority, but shall not obligate the Company to hold the position open. An employee who fails to receive the notice, and is not otherwise aware of his recall, and therefore does not report to work within five (5) calendar days shall continue to accrue seniority, but there shall be no further duty to recall the employee until the employee notifies the Personnel section.
4.7(g) LAYOFF/RECALL LIST - The Company shall submit to the Union a list of Bargaining Unit employees laid off or recalled as soon as final determination is made, but in any event, not later than five (5) workdays after such layoff or recall.

ARTICLE 7	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
7.1	GRIEVANCE POLICY
The parties agree that all complaints and grievances, monetary or otherwise, should be resolved, whenever possible, with the immediate supervisor and the employee involved. It is the intent and purpose of the parties to provide a fair and equitable procedure for the orderly settlement of all grievances. Both parties will make every effort to resolve all issues in a timely manner. All monetary grievance settlements will be paid within 2 pay cycles of the settlement.
7.1	(a) DISCHARGE OR SUSPENSION - A grievance arising out of discharge or disciplinary suspension must be filed with the Manager, Labor Relations or designee, within five (5) workdays after such discharge or suspension, and shall be processed in Step III.
7.2	GRIEVANCE DEFINED
The term “grievance” as used in this Agreement means any dispute arising regarding the interpretation, application, claim of breach or violation of this Agreement. Employees who have a complaint regarding pay, facilities or status changes (reclassification, location transfer, shift change, or displacement) are required to file a complaint (on a form provided by the Company) with the appropriate department prior to filing a grievance on the same subject. If a grievance is filed on one of these subjects prior to filing the appropriate complaint form, the grievance will be returned to the grievant without action. Should the Company fail to respond to the complaint within ten (10) workdays, or the employee is dissatisfied with the response then the complaint shall be considered as a grievance at the third step of the grievance procedure.
7.3	STEP I
An aggrieved employee shall first present his grievance verbally to his supervisor, with or without his steward as the employee may determine within five (5) workdays after the grievance occurred, or the grievant should have diligently known. A grievance settled in Step I shall not be a precedent binding on other grievances. An employee having a grievance shall be given a reasonable time to take the grievance up with the shop steward during working hours without loss of pay to the employee. The supervisor must give the grievant (and steward if applicable) a verbal answer within five (5) workdays.
7.4	STEP II
If the employee is unable to resolve the grievance with his supervisor to his satisfaction, he may reduce it to writing on a form furnished by the Company, provided that the written grievance is signed by the employee and is filed with the employee’s manager within five (5) workdays from the date of the Step I answer. No wage claim shall be valid for a period of more than 12 months prior to the filing of the grievance.

Army Fleet Support LLC - Fort Rucker, Alabama Collective Bargaining Agreement - May 2011
7.4(a) The Company will schedule a meeting in Step II within five (5) workdays from receipt of the grievance, to be attended by the grievant, the shop steward, a Grievance/Negotiating Committee person and persons designated by the Company. The persons attending the meeting on behalf of the Company and the Union have the responsibility and authority to resolve and settle the grievance at the meeting, whether by concession, withdrawal or compromise. If the grievance is settled, such settlement shall be reduced to writing and signed at the meeting, and the grievance shall not thereafter be processed further. A grievance settled in Step II shall not set a precedent binding on other grievances. If the grievance is not settled in Step II, the Company shall give a written answer to the Union within five (5) workdays after the Step II meeting.
7.5	STEP III
If the grievance is not settled in Step II, a Grievance/Negotiating Committee person may process it to Step III by forwarding the grievance, and attachments or references, if any, to the Manager, Labor Relations (or his/her designee) through the Company’s messenger service within five (5) workdays after the Company’s Step II answer is received by the Union.
7.5(a) The grievance will be acknowledged, date and time of receipt indicated, and a copy will be returned to the Union Business Representative (or his/her designee) immediately. The grievance will be considered at the next Step III meeting of the Grievance/Negotiating Committee, provided the Company receives the grievance five (5) workdays prior to the Step III meeting. Grievances received by the Company after that time will be processed in the next following Step III meeting.
7.5(b) Step III meetings will be scheduled upon request of the Business Representative (or his/her designee) or the Manager, Labor Relations (or his/her designee). The requested Step III meeting shall occur within the next five (5) workdays.
7.5(c) The Union will request the grievant to attend the Step III meeting to discuss the grievance. The Company will ensure the appropriate manager/supervisor attends the meeting with the grievant. The grievant will then be excused from the meeting. Should the parties choose to caucus, they will then reconvene to discuss their positions and attempt to resolve the grievance.
7.5(d) The persons attending the meeting on behalf of the Company and the Union have the responsibility and authority to resolve and settle the grievance at the meeting, whether by concession, withdrawal, or compromise. If the grievance is settled, such settlement shall be reduced to writing and signed at the meeting, and the grievance shall not thereafter be processed further. It will be indicated on the grievance answer form whether or not such settlement will set a precedent binding on other grievances. If the grievance is not resolved, the parties may mutually agree to extend, or the Company shall give a written answer to the Union within five (5) workdays after the Step III meeting.

If the grievance is not settled, the Union may refer the grievance to arbitration, by filing a written notice to Labor Relations to arbitrate no later than the 16th calendar day of the month after the Company’s Step III answer. The Union will request from The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service a list of seven (7) impartial arbitrators provided however, that no grievance will be processed to arbitration unless written notice is received by the Company as noted above. Any notice to arbitrate not timely delivered to the Company shall be without effect, and the grievance process shall cease.
7.7	FORM OF GRIEVANCE
The written grievance shall set forth the complaint and remedy sought, the number of the article/section of the Agreement claimed as the basis of the grievance, and this, together with any accompanying statements, shall be dated and signed by the grievant and the shop steward presenting the grievance provided however, that the shop steward, a Grievance/Negotiating Committee person and the grievant may amend the grievance and the Company may amend the answer prior to the conclusion of Step III. After the conclusion of Step III, amendments may be made only by mutual agreement.
7.8	TIME LIMITS
Time limits may be extended only by written agreement of the Company and the Union prior to expiration of the time limitation. In computing time limits under this Article, except as otherwise provided, Saturdays, Sundays, non-workdays and holidays shall not be counted.
7.8	(a) Any grievance not timely filed shall be waived, and any grievance not timely answered in Step II may be forwarded by a Grievance/Negotiating Committee person to Step III. If the Company’s Step II or Step III answer is not timely, the grievant shall be paid an additional fifteen (15) percent of any monetary award resulting from resolution of the grievance.
7.8	(b) Step III grievances not involving monetary awards shall be automatically awarded to the grievant should the Company fail to answer the grievance in a timely manner.

7.11	POLICY GRIEVANCES
Policy grievances may be filed in Step III. A policy grievance is defined as a grievance involving the interpretation, application, claim of breach or violation of the Agreement affecting the wages, hours or working conditions of a group of employees, including claims of unilateral implementation of new contract language and new job descriptions, as distinguished from a grievance affecting individual employees.
7.12	PRIORITY GRIEVANCES

7.13	NO RETROACTIVITY

14.9	VACATION SCHEDULES
Before September 1, the Company will determine the number of employees by classification and overtime project who, based on program requirements, may be granted vacation for each week during the one (1) year vacation period beginning October 1.

14.10(a) In a classification with populations of four (4) or less employees on each shift in an overtime project at a location, the classification on the shifts may be combined, and the most senior of the combined group requesting vacation will be scheduled, so that at least one employee may be on vacation at all times during the months of June, July, August and September.

14.14	RESCHEDULING VACATION
Vacations will be rescheduled during the vacation year as follows:
14.14(a) Scheduled vacations will be approved four (4) weeks before the scheduled vacation dates and will not be subject to the rescheduling process in this section except when necessary due to production requirements or a bona fide emergency situation affecting employees and their availability for work. Shift changes will not be made solely for the purpose of permitting an employee to take his vacation during a preferred vacation date. Unscheduled vacations do not compete with scheduled vacations.
14.14(b) An employee transferring to a vacation (overtime) project may displace lower senior employees in that project to obtain preferred scheduled vacation slots. Affected employees will have the same rights.
14.14(c) Should the Company increase the number of scheduled vacation slots for one (1) or more weeks within a vacation (overtime) project or should vacant vacation slots become available for any reason, the slots will first be available to employees by seniority with scheduled vacation under Section 14.9 for a period of 15 days. An employee returning from TDY who did not take scheduled vacation while on TDY will compete for vacant slots under this section. After 15 days, the slots may be claimed by employees with reserved vacation under Section 14.11. Once claimed, it will be treated as scheduled vacation. Among employees with reserved vacation claiming available slots, longer vacations will receive preference over shorter vacations; vacation requests of equal length will be assigned to the most senior employee by classification and overtime project.
14.14(d) Should the Company reduce the number of scheduled vacation slots for one (1) or more weeks within a vacation (overtime) project, affected employees may displace lower seniority employees for preferred scheduled vacation slots. Likewise, such displaced employees will have the same rights.

Army Fleet Support LLC - Fort Rucker, Alabama Collective Bargaining Agreement - May 2011
14.14(e) Should an employee break a full week of scheduled vacation, only an employee with a full week of scheduled vacation may compete by seniority to displace that employee with the broken week. The employee with the broken week will be required to reschedule the broken week at a time which does not conflict with the desires of any employee with a full week.
14.14(f) Should the Company at any time find the vacation rescheduling process in accordance with the above guidelines to be impractical, the Company may at its option reschedule the total vacation (overtime) project following the same considerations as in the original scheduling.
14.15 LESS THAN FULL WEEK
Less than full weeks of vacation may be arranged outside the normal vacation schedule, as production requirements permit, on notice of one week or less, but will not be confirmed until the last workday before the first vacation day. When approving such vacations, priority will first be given to the longer period requests and then to employees with equal length requests in accordance with seniority.
14.15(a) Employees who are granted one (1) or more vacation days during unscheduled periods will identify which scheduled vacation week is to be adjusted.

When a vacancy occurs within a bargaining unit classification, other than as a result of layoff, it will be assigned to employees on the active payroll [i.e., an employee not on indefinite layoff, or an inactive employee (defined as an employee on a leave of absence of more than 30 calendar days)] by seniority who have the qualifications to perform the work involved and who have valid status change request forms on file in the Personnel section. If the vacancy involves adding a person on the payroll, employees on indefinite layoff compete for the vacancy, provided they have a valid reclassification request on file. An employee's personnel file as it exists at the time the vacancy occurs, including on-the-job experience as shown in the personnel file, and the job description shall be the determining factors in filling vacancies. An employee entering a classification which he has not held before may be temporarily assigned to a shift, location, or workweek for familiarization, where he would not work alone before he has completed 60 days in the new classification.
An inactive employee (defined above) with permanent medical restrictions, who is unable to perform all essential functions of his current classification may reclassify within 365 days from the date of his last day of active employment to another position (vacancy) if he:
•	Possess the qualifications required for the position;
•	Possess the seniority to obtain the position;
•	Able to perform all essential functions associated with the new position.
Inactive employees may not displace active employees and may only bid for positions which are not under competition by active employees.
Seniority employees with a valid request on file shall have preference for said vacancy prior to the company filling the vacancy with a new hire even if the vacancy is in a different center of operation than the senior employee with a valid request on file. The new hire will then be hired to backfill the vacant position of the senior employee.
35.1(a) An employee returning from a vacation of any length or from a leave of absence of 30 calendar days or less, or medical leave, whether paid or unpaid, who would have been promoted during such vacation, leave of absence, or medical leave of any length, shall be offered promotion according to seniority and qualifications, upon his return to work. The employee may decline such promotion/reclassification without penalty.
35.1(b) If the vacancy is not filled under Sections 35.1 or 35.1(a) it will be offered to employees on layoff by seniority who have the qualifications to perform the work involved and who have a valid status change request form on file in the Personnel section.

35.1(c) If the vacancy is not filled under Sections 35.1, 35.1(a), or 35.1(b) it will be filled by new hires or from any other source available.
35.1(d) An employee on layoff shall not be entitled to displace another employee from employment.
35.1(e) The rights of veterans and any persons returning from any type of military leave of absence of more than 30 calendar days will be governed by applicable federal or state law.
35.2	STATUS CHANGE FORMS
Status change forms shall be available in the Personnel section and in each work area. The right of classification change, shift change, center of operation change, or location change may be exercised no earlier than six (6) months from the date of honoring an employee's last request of the same type. If an employee is displaced during this six (6) month period, he may submit another request of the same type without penalty. However, reclassified employees can compete for bonus pay job assignments and higher classifications during this six (6) month period. Such employee can be displaced by another employee exercising his full seniority rights. This provision shall not prevent the employee from exercising his rights during personnel realignment.
35.2(a) Employees must file a separate status change form for each type change to include reclassification, bonus pay job assignment, shift/workweek, center of operation, or location transfer desired. Other forms used in personnel assignments are (1) bonus pay job relinquishment, (2) withdrawal of status change request, (3) displacement form.
Only those employees currently occupying the classification with the bonus pay assignment can request the bonus pay assignment.
If an employee is removed from a classification/bonus pay job assignment because of inability to perform, he is not eligible to return to the classification/bonus pay job assignment until he has completed additional training directly related to the classification/bonus pay assignment from which he was previously removed. The employee will advise the Company of completion of such additional training in writing on the status change request form.
35.2(a)(1) When filing status change requests, employees can specify the desired center of operation, location, and shift and will compete only for those vacancies. In the absence of a request, the least senior employee in the group will be assigned. Employees who specify any center of operation, location, or shift will compete for all status changes.

The Union will be notified in writing at the time the Personnel Section makes the written offer.
35.2(c) Bypasses: If the Company does not honor a status change request, it shall notify the employee in writing and shall state the reason. Any employee more senior than the employee reclassified may file a grievance provided that, if the issue is arbitrated, all grievances arising out of failure to honor the status change request will be consolidated for arbitration.
35.2(d) Status change requests and displacement forms are valid only in the classification and bonus pay job held at the time it is filed. Reclassified employees must file new status change requests and/or displacement forms after entering the new classification or bonus pay job to receive further consideration for reclassification and other status changes or displacement options.

35.18(d) Leaders compete with other employees in the same classification within their overtime project for vacation scheduling.
35.18(e) If a Leader is needed, Leaders compete first among other Leaders within the overtime project for assignment of overtime. Thereafter, Leaders will compete with other employees in the same classification within the overtime project; however, the Leader bonus will be removed during such assignment unless Leader status is a valid requirement of the overtime assignment, as determined by the Company.
35.18(e)(1) Should a Leader refuse overtime as a Leader, he is charged with the hours offered or worked. Likewise, when he competes for overtime within his classification, he is also charged with the time offered or worked. If he refuses the overtime as a Leader, and then again refuses overtime within his classification, he is charged with the hours worked or offered the second time. Leaders can be scheduled to work as a Leader or in his classification if he has the least number of overtime hours, and will be charged the third time for hours offered or worked.
35.18(f) Temporary Leader jobs, when required by the Company, will be offered first to senior qualified permanently assigned employees within the applicable classification and crew. Thereafter, the Temporary Leader assignment will be offered to other senior qualified permanently assigned volunteers within the applicable classification and overtime project.
35.18(f)(1) Temporary Leaders, when required by the Company, may function during the absence from the work location, and need for a regular Leader, or need for an additional Leader, for a period not exceeding 10 workdays, except the period can be extended because of vacation or by mutual agreement between the Company and the respective Grievance/Negotiating Committee person. Temporary Leaders will compete for available overtime on the same basis as regular Leaders after all regularly assigned Leaders in the overtime project have been offered the available overtime.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Subject: Early Retirement Program
The Company and the Union agree that, operational requirements permitting, the opportunity for early retirement should be offered again. The following criteria would apply to future early retirement program offerings unless modified by mutual agreement of the parties:
The program will be available to employees on the active payroll who are less than age 65 on the requested date of retirement, and
1.	are at the maximum pay rate of their rate range, and are accruing a minimum of five (5) weeks of vacation leave, or
2.	have 30 or more years of service on the Aircraft Maintenance contract at Ft. Rucker.
Employees must complete the retirement application form available at work sites and return it to Personnel at least 30 days prior to the requested retirement date. Upon approval by the Company, this application for retirement will be a binding contract between the employee and the Company.
If an employee retiring under this program is insured under the Company’s health insurance plan prior to retirement, the Company will pay the total cost of continuing such health insurance coverage for three (3) years or to age 65, whichever is earlier.
If the employee’s spouse and/or eligible dependents are insured under the Company’s health insurance plan prior to the employee’s retirement, the Company will pay the total cost of continuing such health insurance coverage for three (3) years or until the employee reaches age 65, whichever is earlier, provided that such spouse and/or dependent coverage will be governed by the normal age restrictions for coverage specified in the health insurance plan.
Employee, spouse or dependent coverage terminated under the above provisions may be continued under the COBRA provisions of the plan, if appropriate.
If an employee retiring under this program is insured under the Company’s health and life insurance plans prior to retirement, the employee can maintain basic life and optional life insurance by paying the full cost of the premium for three (3) years or to age 65, whichever is earlier.
