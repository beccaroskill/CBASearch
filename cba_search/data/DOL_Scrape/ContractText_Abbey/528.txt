Dear Mr. Wood row:
In conjunction with the Agreement of Amendment dated April 28,1967, incorporating the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station into the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Southern California Edison Company and Local Union No. 246 of the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, it is further understood that:
1.	At the time an employee classified as a Nuclear Plant Equipment Operator becomes qualified as a Nuclear Assistant Control Operator and is in the judgment of station supervision ready to take the NRC licensing examinations for a Reactor Operator’s license, supervision will with reasonable promptness, request the NRC to send an examiner to San Onofre.
2.	When the number of employees classified as Nuclear Assistant Control Operator exceeds the normal complement needed to operate the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, the normal rotation assignments of personnel in this classification may be adjusted to include Nuclear Plant Equipment Operator duties. Assignments will be made within the normal rotation sequence pattern for the number of operators involved without regard to seniority.
If the Union is in concurrence with the above proposal, please sign one copy of this letter and return it to us at your earliest convenience.

Provide that in the absence of the Supervising Station Clerk from the storeroom for one day or more a qualified Station Accounting Clerk will be upgraded to Supervising Station Clerk providing there are one or more other employees assigned in the storeroom requiring work direction. It is understood that the Supervising Station Clerk is considered absent from the storeroom when he is acting as Division Clerical Supervisor or off the job for one day or more due to vacation, illness or other reasons.
The following Practices will continue as before:
1.	If there are no qualified Station Accounting Clerks to be upgraded to Supervising Station Clerk and it is necessary to assign an employee to work alone in the storeroom during regular work hours on work days, a Records Clerk or Junior Clerk, if any, will be temporarily upgraded to Station Accounting Clerk. Such Records Clerk or Junior Clerk will be directly supervised by the Division Clerical Supervisor (Supervising Station Clerk).

Any upgrading in accordance with the foregoing will be by assignment.
2.	A Records Clerk or Junior Clerk will not at any time be upgraded to Supervising Station Clerk in the absence of the Supervising Station Clerk.
3.	Employees who work in the storeroom on nights or weekends will not be upgraded.
The above provisions supersede and cancel the Supplemental Agreement of May 22, 1956 between parties.

Dear Mr. Hillebrandt:
As a result of informal discussions on January 18, 1971, February 15, 1972, and March 7, 1972, between Messrs. Lundgren and Thomas for the Company, and Messrs. Dixon and Hillebrandi for the Union, relative to grievances 10-70-4,10-70-5, and 10-71-9, it is the Company's understanding that if a satisfactory clarification of Mr. Lundgren’s letter of June 4, 1971, is submitted to the Union, these grievances which are now appealed to arbitration will be resolved.
The Company, therefore, submits the following clarification: In order for a steward to be present when an employee wishes to review all or a portion of his personnel file the following conditions must exist:
1)	The employee would have filed a grievance relative to his personnel file based on some reference to the file by supervision.
2)	Items in the employee's personnel file would be open to such inspection based upon the scope of the remarks made by the supervisor which provoked the grievance, i.e., a) the specific documents referred to or shown to the employee by the
6
Appendix

supervisor or, b) the entire file if the supervisor had referred to the personnel file in general in a manner which caused the employee to become aggrieved.
It is understood that copies of any document which the employee previously had received or had seen and initiated more than 14 days prior to the reference made by the supervisor could no longer be the basis for a grievance about that document or its contents per se.
It is further understood that an employee who receives a memorandum which he signs as having received a copy, will be informed that any grievance filed regarding this memorandum must be submitted within 14 days.
If you concur with the above please sign and return one copy of this letter. Upon receipt of Union concurrence we will consider these grievances resolved.

Dear Mr. Galbraith:
This letter is to confirm the understanding in connection with the suspension of authorized payroll deduction of union dues or an agency fee under certain conditions reached between Local 246, Utility Workers Union of America and the Company, at the meeting of January 31, 1975 between yourself and William T. Murray for the Union and H. W. Thomas, G. A. Woodrow, M. A. Aurelius and H. F. Marshall for the Company.
It was agreed that when an employee, who is receiving Industrial Accident Compensation in the pay period of any month in which an authorized union dues or an agency fee deduction is taken, and when at the time such deductions are to be taken it is known that there will be insufficient earnings, the Company will automatically suspend the taking of such deduction forthat month. Such suspension will normally end when the Industrial Accident Compensation ends. However, if the employee does not then return to work the provisions below concerning the Comprehensive Disability Plan extended benefits will prevail.

It was further agreed that when an employee is on the extended benefits provisions of the Comprehensive Disability Plan, or is receiving compensation under the provisions of the Long-Term Disability Plan, and when at the time union dues or an agency fee is to be taken it is known that there will be insufficient earnings, the Company will automatically suspend the deducting of any such authorized union dues or an agency fee until such time as the employee returns to work.
If the Union concurs with the above understanding, please sign one copy of this letter and return it to me. The effective date of such understanding shall commence with the dues or fees deducted in the month following the month in which the Union concurs.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
In conjunction with 1980-81 negotiations between Local 246, UWUA and the Southern California Edison Company regarding the Letter dated March 31, 1978 between the parties with respect to the Employee Electric Discount Rate the parties agreed that the following modifies and supersedes that letter:
Employees whose established base is Mohave Generating Station or San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, whose residence is not served from Edison lines, and who upon retirement, are receiving Employee Electric Discount Rate shall continue to receive the Employee Electric Discount Rate in accordance with Article IX, Section I of the 1978 Agreement. This discount will remain in effect only if the retiree continues to live, following retirement, in the same community in which he or she was receiving the Employee Electric Discount Rate at the time of retirement.
Currently under the provisions of the tariff schedule employees and retirees, whose residences are not served from Edison lines, who are otherwise eligible to receive the discount, and who subsequently move to a residence which is served by Edison lines and which meets the conditions of the tariff schedule, are then eligible to receive the discount.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
In conjunction with the 1982 negotiations between the Southern California Edison Company and Local 246, UWUA, AFL-CIO, relative to the Company's need to establish provisions for the utilization of temporary employees, the parties agreed to the following:
1. The purpose of the Temporary Employee classification is to provide temporary manpower for short term absence relief, manpower needs such as required during overhaul and major outages, and projects requiring temporary manpower needs. It is not the intent of the Company to use this provision to erode the permanent work force but rather to supplement the work force on an as-needed basis.
a.	Temporary employees will not be hired during a period of layoffs or temporary curtailment of work so long as there is a full-time qualified employee available to do the work who is affected by the layoff or temporary curtailment. If there are no qualified employees available, then a temporary employee may be hired into the classification of the work to be performed.
b.	In the event of a reduction of forces, temporary employees within the working unit will be subject to displacement by a full-time employee affected by the reduction of forces. Such employee can displace a temporary employee in a similar or lower level classification if otherwise qualified. If
12
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
two or more employees desire to displace the same temporary employee, Company seniority will be used in making the determination. An employee who displaces a temporary employee will remain a full-time employee for the duration of the temporary assignment.
2.	Term of Employment:
a.	Persons employed under this Agreement will retain the status of temporary employee up to a maximum continuous period of five months.
b.	A temporary employee will not be eligible for seniority except as specifically provided for in this Agreement.
c.	Any qualified temporary employee who is employed beyond five continuous months will at his option automatically be instated as a regular employee.
d.	In addition at the Company's option a temporary employee with his consent may at any time during the five continuous months of temporary employment be hired into regular employee status.
e.	Any temporary employee terminated during the five month period cannot be rehired for at least thirty (30) days.
f.	If an employee converts (is changed from temporary to regular status without a break in service) to regular employee status under c. or d. above he/she will assume Company seniority back to the most recent date of hire as a temporary employee. Working unit seniority shall begin when he/she becomes a regular employee.
Rev. 2004
Appendix
13
Appendix
Such employee will then become eligible for all accrued benefits of regular employment based on seniority including but not limited to earned vacation and sick leave. It is understood such benefits are not to be applied retroactively.
3.	Temporary employees will receive the rate of pay equivalent to that of the same regular full time classification as set forth in Exhibit A of the Agreement between the parties.
4.	Within sixty days of date of hire every employee covered by this Letter of Understanding shall, as a condition of employment, become subject to the provisions of Article I, Sections Af3k A(5), A(7), A(8).
5.	Vacation: Temporary employees shall not be eligible to earn vacation.
6.	Holidays: Temporary employees will be eligible for all paid holidays, except floating holidays, as set forth in Article X, Section L of the Agreement between the parties.
7.	Health and Welfare Benefits: Temporary employees will receive only those legally required health and welfare benefits.
8.	Pension and Security Benefits: Temporary employees will receive only those legally required pension and security benefits.
9.	Grievance Procedure: The grievance procedure in force between the parties will be open to temporary employees except that the provisions of Articles IV, V, and VI shall not apply to the discharge or layoff of any temporary employee covered by this agreement. However, the Company
14
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
agrees to discuss with the Union the reason for such discharge upon timely request by the Union.
10.	Layoffs will be by management selection.
11.	Bid rights: Temporary employees will not be eligible to bid or transfer to vacant positions.
12.	Overtime: In accordance with Article X-J as modified by the Letter of Understanding dated May 27/28,1982, all regular employees in classifications held by temporary employees at the payroll location where the job is will be afforded an opportunity to work an overtime assignment before such assignment is offered to a temporary employee assigned to that job. However, qualified temporary employees will be assigned work declined by regular employees before assigning such regular employees in accordance with Article X-J as modified by the Letter of Understanding dated May 27/28, 1982.
13.	Beginning August 1, 1982 the Company will furnish the Union with bi-weekly listings of temporary employees working in the Bargaining Unit showing name, classification, payroll location, date of hire and date of layoff or termination.

3.	If the Union has general questions regarding the validity or other aspects of the testing program, arrangements can be made for the Business Agent and the President or Vice President to meet with one of the Company’s industrial psychologists for the purpose of discussing those questions.
4.	If the Union has specific questions regarding specific tests which cannot be answered by means of paragraph 3 above, the Company would be willing to permit an Industrial Psychologist who is a member of the Industrial Division of the American Psychological Association to meet with a Company Industrial Psychologist to review test

Mr Michael J. Feeney Business Agent
Local 246, UWUA, AFL-CIO 11455 East Carson Street Lakewood, California 90715
Dear Mr. Feeney:
The Company’s long standing practice in processing grievances involving Memorandums for File has been to provide the Union with all relevant and pertinent information, but not to provide a copy of such memorandum. It is recognized that in a few rare instances copies of memorandums have been provided, but again against established Company policy. The same situation holds true regarding an employee’s request for a copy of a memorandum for file, notwithstanding the agreement reached during the 1982-1983 negotiations where certain copies would be provided when an employee reviews his/her personal file.
In order to resolve our differences in this matter, the Company would propose that when a Memorandum for File is written that the employee would be provided a copy of the memorandum with the clear understanding that this is not disciplinary action as defined in Article III, J.(1) a. and a steward would not be provided.
The Union would also be entitled to copies of memoranda to file in connection with a grievance provided the Union first attempts to obtain such
Rev. 2004

copies from the aggrieved employee and provided the aggrieved employee authorizes its release. By agreeing to the Letter of Understanding, the Company is not waiving its right to challenge the relevancy of a specific request nor is there anything in this letter that constitutes a waiver of rights presently held by either party.
If the Union is in concurrence with this proposal, please sign one copy of this letter and return it to me at your earliest convenience.

Dear Mike:
In conjunction with the 1984-86 contract negotiations, the parties agreed to the following with regard to the assignment of station resident personnel to other locations:
The Company will first ask for volunteers among those employees at the station who are qualified and available. If there are no such volunteers, then employees will be assigned on the basis of working unit seniority with the qualified and available junior employees being assigned first.
In agreeing to the above the Union is not relinquishing its position that the Company does not have the right to make such assignments without Union concurrence.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
In conjunction with the 1984-86 negotiations between the parties the following was agreed to regarding leaves of absence under Article XI, Sections D and G.
The purpose of the Union leaves of absence provision is to provide the Union with the manpower to manage and staff the local. The Union agrees to the concept that full-time Union officials will take a leave of absence. It is not the intent of the Union to use Article XI, Section G as a method of bypassing the purpose and intent of Article XI, Section D and this Letter of Understanding.
Employees who are elected or appointed to full-time positions with Local Union 246 or an elected position with the National Union on assignment to Local 246 will be required to take a leave of absence in accordance with the provisions of Article XI, Section D. An employee will be considered to be in a full-time position and required to take a leave of absence if he is off on Union business under Article XI, Section G for more than the specified hours, as listed below, in a given year.
To phase in the leaves of absence requirement, two (2) employees, if full-time, will take a leave of absence effective two (2) years from the signing date of the 1984-86 Agreement. Effective January 1, 1987, an employee will be considered as being in a full-time position if he is off under Article XI,
Rev. 2004

Section G for more than 1500 hours in that year. In 1988 and thereafter, an employee will be considered as being in a full-time position if he is off under Article XI, Section G for more than 1,100 hours in a given year.
Upon completion of a leave of absence in accordance with Article XI, Section D, the employee will be allowed to bid any job in the working unit for which he has seniority and qualifications or displace the junior employee, if any, in his last classification held at his last work location. An employee will not be granted another leave of absence under Article Xi, Section D until a period of at least one (1) year has passed since the end of his last leave of absence under Article XI, Section D.
Effective January 1, 1987, no more than 2 consecutive 30 day leaves under Article XI, Section G will be granted to the same employee.

Dear Mr. Feeney:
With respect to the fixed shifts for certain maintenance classifications at the Mohave Generating Station, the following practices and procedures will be followed.
Shifts will initially be filled by Mohave maintenance employees on an in-house volunteer system utilizing unit seniority as the determining factor. The Company will assign junior seniority employees to complete shift manning as necessary. The initial manning of maintenance employees per shift will be approximately 55% day shift, 25% swing shift and 20% graveyard shift. This manning is subject to change as stated and defined in this Letter of Understanding.
The bid procedure for Maintenance openings at Mohave will be revised to allow each employee the opportunity to designate their individual shift preference, on a single bid sheet, for the opening they desire.
The revised PSSD 237 will indicate the specific opening and any possible subsequent opening resulting from the senior qualified bidder being awarded the job.
Rev. 2004
Appendix

Appendix
As in the past, the maintenance work schedule will be subject to temporary changes during equipment outages. Although temporary changes are not subject to the one year cancellation agreement, the Company agrees to provide for employee input in accordance with the July 26, 1978 Letter of Understanding. Shift changes to accommodate manning requirements will continue to be made as in the past.
It is agreed that all maintenance classifications with the exception of Insulators, Instrument Technicians and Test Technicians will be assigned on a fixed shift basis.
Mohave Maintenance Department employees will no longer be charged with “declined” overtime (except Instrument Technicians and Test Technicians).
The fixed shift schedule will be implemented within thirty (30) days upon receiving concurrence from the Union.
The attached procedure regarding the initial filling of fixed shifts and the subsequent bid procedure is a part of this Agreement.
If you concur, please sign and return this letter to the Manager of Labor Relations.
Very truly yours,

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
In conjunction with the 1987-88 negotiations between Local 246, UWUA and the Southern California Edison Company relative to the Letter of Understanding dated May 8, 1984 on the subject of the establishment of the Apprentice Nuclear Plant Equipment Operator (ANPEO) classification and operator manning at San Onofre, the parties agreed that the above letter is hereby superseded and cancelled by the following:
ANPEO ASSIGNMENTS
Employees becoming ANPEO’s at San Onofre will be assigned either to Unit 1 or Units 2 and 3 for licensing training and other duties. If vacancies occurs at both locations (Unit 1 or Units 2 and 3) simultaneously, employees may select, on the basis of seniority, the Unit to which they would be assigned.
ANPEO FUNCTION
The ANPEO classification is considered an apprenticeship. Primary job goal is successful training and qualification for progression to Nuclear Plant Equipment Operator (NPEO). An ANPEO can be assigned to shift work during his training program but will not fill a NPEO shift billet. An ANPEO can assist in, or perform by himself, operating evolutions as part of his on-the-job training under the guidance of qualified shift personnel.
32
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
ANPEO TRAINING
Training for the ANPEO will consist of classroom and on-the-job training. This program will prepare an ANPEO to fill all NPEO shift positions after successful completion of the program. Classroom instruction, written exams, field instruction, checkoff books and supervisory interviews will all be involved during the training period.
It is anticipated that completion of the program will take approximately one year for most employees. This can, however, be longer or shorter based on past experience, the development of new training techniques, or other such factors. Maximum time permitted to complete the program will be 18 months.
ANPEO PROGRESSION
Upon satisfactory completion of classroom and on-the-job training an ANPEO will automatically be reclassified to NPEO. An employee will not be promoted to NPEO if he cannot stand all NPEO shift positions. An employee who is not able to complete or show satisfactory progression will be handled the same way the Company has handled Apprentice Plant Equipment Operators.
NPEO POSITION
The NPEO position will provide a solid nucleus of employees to perform operator duties other than control room operations. If an employee NPEO/ANPEO bids or transfers out of the NPEO/ANPEO position as a result of not being
Rev. 2004
Appendix
33
Appendix
able to maintain satisfactory progress or failing the operations NPEO/ANPEO training program, a thirty-six month bid or transfer restriction to return to NPEO/ANPEO position will apply. This restriction will not apply during a reduction in forces.
Employees will be selected from the NPEO classification to pursue license training when new classes are necessary. Selection will be voluntary and in accordance with Article VIII, Section A(1) of the Agreement between the parties.
If voluntary selection does not fill the new license class, the Company will assign the senior, qualified NPEO, in accordance with Article VIII Section B(3)(d)2 of the Agreement. The employee will receive the Nuclear License Premium provided he/she is making satisfactory progress in the program. If an employee fails on his/her first attempt at an NRC license, the employee will receive a Nuclear NonLicense Premium until he/she re-enters the license path, at which time he/she will receive the Nuclear License Premium and will enter the next license class provided he/she is the senior, qualified employee in accordance with Article VIII, section A(1). If the employee fails on the second attempt, he/she will be assigned per Article VIII Section B(3)(d)2.

NACO POSITION
Upon successful completion of the qualification requirements, the senior qualified Nuclear Plant Equipment Operator, having been selected and acquiring an NRC Reactor Operator’s (RO) license, will be reclassified to a Nuclear Assistant Control Operator (NACO) and receive the applicable bonus for an RO license.
NCO POSITION
Promotion from NACO to Nuclear Control Operator (NCO) will be on a bid basis. When a vacancy occurs for NCO at San Onofre the job posting will be designated whether it is for Unit 1 or Units 2 and 3. Employees will be considered qualified for such a vacancy only if they have a valid NRC license for the unit(s) where the vacancy exists.

It is understood that opportunities to work unit outage project work and specific non outage projects will be rotated among qualified employees.
Special unit outage project work is defined as: diesel generator overhauls, RCP work, refueling crews, or other tasks mutually agreed to by the UWUA Business Agent and the Company.
(2)	Emergency work assignments between the units of short duration (less than 8 hours) will be manned as deemed appropriate by local supervision; if said assignment is expected to exceed 2 hours, the affected unit’s employees will be called out in accordance with Article X, Sections H and J.
(3)	Work assignments will be offered to those employees regularly scheduled on the shift where the temporary manpower is required, down to the operational minimum for the shift. The assignment will be offered to the senior employee first (on said shift) based upon unit seniority.
(4)	If this does not result in sufficient backshift manning, dayshift personnel will be offered the assignment as a temporary shift change, to the senior employee based upon unit seniority.
(5)	If the number of employees volunteering is not sufficient, employees regularly scheduled on the shift where manpower is required, will be assigned. Assignments will be made to the junior employee utilizing unit seniority down to the operational minimum for the shift.
Rev. 2004

(6)	If this does not result in sufficient backshift manning, dayshift personnel will be assigned as a temporary shift change. Assignments will be made to the junior employee utilizing unit seniority. Volunteers from day shift on temporary assignment are not exempt from this assignment to back-shift.
(7)	Manning the backshifts will be divided between personnel from the affected and unaffected units in proportion similar to the number of employees in the classifications in the respective units, if there are sufficient volunteers to fill a back-shift, the proportion need not be observed. The fixed shift letter of understanding shall continue to be used for backshift assignments of affected unit personnel.
B.	OVERTIME GUIDELINES
Employees shall be scheduled for overtime periods involving full shift coverage by Evergreen standing and the overtime policy delineated in the Letter of Understanding dated October 16, 1987, in the following sequence:
(1)	Overtime necessary to continue special unit outage project work will be offered/assigned to the employees currently assigned to those projects, regardless of the unit they are normally assigned to. Whenever practicable, such overtime will be offered to employees not currently assigned to projects prior to assigning overtime to the employees assigned to those projects.

Dear Mr. Wood:
As a result of the discussions held between the parties on January 29, 1992, regarding the possible closure of SONGS Unit 1 the following was agreed:
The Company has no intention of laying off or force reducing any employees from Unit 1 affected by this action. Upon shutdown of SONGS Unit 1, and as it becomes necessary to reduce the number of employees there, all Bargaining Unit employees will be provided an opportunity to transfer to SONGS Units 2&3 as Unit 1 manning levels are reduced. It is the Company’s intention to enter negotiations when required to establish specific requirements to allow these actions to be effected. This process will supersede the “request for transfer” procedure under Article VIII B(2) for entry into SONGS Units 2&3.
The Company will continue paying employees transferred to SONGS Units 2&3, the wage level

Unit I operators transferring into the Units 2&3 progression will stand 750 hours of secondary watch time after qualification, prior to being considered for primary system training. All hours spent working on shift after completion of secondary system training will be considered secondary watch time hours.
• Remaining NPEOs at SONGS Unit 1 will be provided adequate training to qualify for upgrade to "limited NACO." In the event the training is not provided by the time Unit 1 is shut down, these employees will be considered qualified for upgrade to “limited NACO" at Unit 1 for the purposes of establishing transfer pay rates.

Dear Carl:
In conjunction with the 1995-1996 negotiations between Local 246, UWUA and the Southern California Edison Company relative to modifications to the Letter of Understanding between the parties dated February 28, 1989 concerning coal handling equipment work, it is agreed between Local 246, UWUA and Southern California Edison Company that the switchyard operation and maintenance work will be transferred out of the UWUA Bargaining Unit. The parties further agree to the following:
1.	A new journeyman classification, Coal Handling Equipment Mechanic (title changed to Power Plant Mechanic A), will be established in the 1989-90 Collective Bargaining Agreement and paid the journeyman's rate. A copy of the job specification for the new classification has been provided to the Union.
2.	Forty (40) Coal Handling Equipment Mechanic (title changed to Power Plant Mechanic A) positions will be created at Mohave
Rev. 2004
Appendix
101

Generating Station. These positions will be assigned a fixed shift schedule and will be subject to the fixed shift Letter of Understanding for Mohave maintenance employees dated February 25, 1985.
3.	Prior to recruiting from the outside, at least ten (10) of the new jobs described in paragraph 1 above will be posted as day shift vacancies pursuant to Article VIII of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. For the initial filling of the vacancies, those existing top step B&C Mechanics and Maintenance Machinists who have previously worked for Combustion Engineering as coal handling equipment mechanics for at least one year will be considered qualified for the new positions. All other candidates must pass the promotional test for this job to be considered qualified.
4.	One additional Steward will be allotted to the group created by the new classification. Exhibit B of the 1989-90 Collective Bargaining Agreement will be modified accordingly.
5.	One additional bulletin board will be added for the coal handling group. Article XIV of the 1989-90 Collective Bargaining Agreement will be modified accordingly.
6.	The Company will not transfer coal handling equipment maintenance work from the Bargaining Unit represented by UWUA without first negotiating such transfer.
7.	The Company will not contract out routine coal handling equipment maintenance work except as
102
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
follows; nothing herein shall in any way be construed to prohibit, limit, or restrict the Company’s right to contract out coal handling equipment maintenance work in excess of the normal workload which is the work performed by approximately 40 new employees in this classification.
a.	Any qualified maintenance classification can perform work on coal pipes and screw gates.
b.	Any qualified maintenance classification can perform work on coal handling equipment if the unit is restricted and coal handling equipment to be worked on is causing that restriction.
8.	Article XIII.C.(2).(b) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement will be modified to read as follows:
"Employees who are assigned to temporary work bases within Zone 4 will be paid a flat allowance of $61.00 in 1989 and $64.00 in 1990. The allowance will be paid for all days the employee remains at the temporary working base except for: (1) vacation days and (2) regular days off not worked with vacation days attached thereto. If a holiday is attached to an employee’s regular days off not worked and the employee also attaches vacation days thereto, the allowance will not be paid for any of these days.”
9.	The overtime scheduling practices for Division Maintenance employees on seven (7) day coverage when on two (2) or three (3) shift operations will be modified to that of the Mohave Maintenance
Rev. 2004
Appendix
103
Appendix
employees on fixed shifts as identified in the current Fixed Shift Letter of Understanding for certain employees at the Mohave Generating Station dated February 25, 1985.
10.	The Company will cooperate with the Union in permitting the Union to recover its $50,000 undertaking posted in connection with seeking an injunction pending arbitration in Case No. CV. 86-8250 HCH (TX). The parties agree that the return of the undertaking is conditioned on the ratification of the 1989-90 Collective Bargaining Agreement by UWUA members.
11.	The approximate effective date for the assignment of the routine maintenance of coal handling equipment work at Mohave Generating Station to employees represented by UWUA will be January 1,1990.
12.	The parties agree that this agreement relieves the Company of any further compliance with the arbitration award in Grievance Nos. 10-86-186,10-86-202, and 2-86-77, insofar as the restoration of the switchyard maintenance work, as of the date of the execution of this agreement.
This agreement modifies the parties’ Collective Bargaining Agreement solely as to the switchyard operation and maintenance work and the new terms relating to coal handling equipment maintenance. Nothing in this agreement affects or waives the parties’ contracting out and force reduction rights.

1.	Prior to the start of a RIF:
a)	The Company will notify the Union Business Agent a minimum of thirty (30) days prior to the initiation of a RIF.
b)	Upon notification of a RIF, all employees potentially affected by the RIF will receive a personalized Worker Protection Benefits (WPB) package detailing the specific benefits available to him/her if severed.
c)	All UWUA job vacancies within the Company shall be posted for bid 30 days prior to the start of the reduction in forces. It is understood and agreed that where ability and qualifications are sufficient to meet the standards of the job to be filled, working unit seniority shall be used in filling these job vacancies. Employees that fill these vacancies will not be eligible for a vacancy premium under Section A.1 .f.(2) of this Agreement.
d)	Employee are presumed to be qualified for like classifications, within Steam Generation Division, Shop Services and Instrumentation
126
Appendix
Rev. 2004
18
Appendix
Division — Mechanical Services Shop and Nuclear Generation Site Department — San Onofre, for the purpose of bids, transfers, and in the event of a RIF.
e)	The Union may designate an observer for RIF related processing associated with this Agreement. The Company will pay a maximum of 20 regular normal time hours per week for the observer. Any additional hours utilized by the observer will be paid by the Union.
f.) The Company will offer vacancies which are not filled through the normal bid process during the 30 day pre-RIF posting period, including vacancies resulting from the original postings, to employees at the affected location. These vacancies will be filled by qualifications and company seniority, beginning with the most senior employee.
(1)	Affected employees that voluntarily fill a vacancy in a lower classification will maintain the wage rate they had prior to filling the lower classification vacancy. This wage rate will remain in effect (not to include any subsequently negotiated increases) until the rate of pay for the employee’s current job classification equals or exceeds the maintained rate or the employee declines to accept a vacancy offered under Sections A.4.(a) or A.4.(c) of this Agreement.
(2)	A vacancy premium, in the amounts specified in Appendix 2, will be paid to employees that voluntarily fill vacancies at the listed locations as a result of Subsection A.1.f of this Article I and retain
Rev. 2004
Appendix
127
Appendix 19
them through the conclusion of the RIF. The vacancy premium is in addition to any applicable relocation allowance and moving expenses provided for in Article VIII, Section E.(5) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
(3)	If an employee relocates to a new residence as a result of filling a vacancy under Section A.1 .f. or Section A.1.(3)(e) of this Article I of this Agreement, all moving expenses will be paid by the Company when all of the following conditions are met:
(a)	The employee's new permanent work location must be twenty (20) miles or more from the employee’s old permanent work location;
(b)	The employee’s new residence is closer to the new work location than his/her present residence;
(c)	The employee’s commuting time to the new work location from his/her new residence is less than the commuting time to the new work location from his/her old residence; and
(d)	The employee must move within one (1) year from the effective date of the transfer to qualify for moving expenses under this provision.
(e)	The Company will assign any remaining affected employees to vacancies in the employees’ classifications which are within forty (40) miles of the employee’s permanent base work location by Company seniority beginning with the least senior employee. A vacancy premium will not
128
Appendix
Rev. 2004
20
Appendix
be paid. Relocation and moving expenses will be paid in accordance with Section A.1.f.(3) of this agreement and Article VIILE.(5) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. If multiple vacancies exist, assignment will begin with the most senior employee to the nearest location.
2.	The RIF will be initiated as follows:
a) Any remaining unassigned employees at the affected work location who are in a job classification for which there are no existing vacancies within the Bargaining Unit will be considered excess employees. Individual WPB packages consisting of retirement and/or severance, depending on the employee’s eligibility, will be offered to these excess employees. The employees have the option of taking the WPB package or "bumping” according to Company seniority to a similar level or lower classification, in the Steam Generation Division, Shop Services Instrumentation Division — Mechanical Services Shop, or Nuclear Generation Site Department — San Onofre provided he/she has Company seniority over an employee then occupying such classification and is otherwise qualified. Any existing vacancies will be included as "bump” choices for employees involved in the RIF. In the event more than one (1) employee elects and is qualified to fill a vacancy offered during a RIF cycle, the vacancy will be offered according to company seniority, beginning with the most senior employee.
Rev. 2004
Appendix
129
Appendix 21
(1)	When an excess employee exercises his/her seniority rights and bumps an employee in his/her classification, an individual WPB package will be offered to an employee within the same bid location (see Appendix 3 for established bid locations) and in the same classification the excess employee has bumped into. This package will be offered by company seniority starting with the most senior employee. This process will continue until an employee accepts a WPB package If none of the employees accept a WPB package, then the junior employee in the classification where the excess employee bumped into, will be subject to the provisions of this Article 1, Section A.2.
(2)	When an excess employee bumps an employee at a combined bid location, per Appendix 3, the WP13 package will be offered to the most senior employee in that classification at that combined work location. Redistribution of manpower will be accomplished by an in-house offering based on Company seniority. If there are no volunteers, the junior employee will be assigned.
No vacancy premium will be paid. ALGS Operations is not included in this provision.
(3)	When an excess employee exercises his/her seniority rights and “bumps” an employee in a different classification, and vacancies exist for this classification in the Bargaining Unit, a WPB package will not be offered to the employees in the classification the excess employee bumped into. If
130
Appendix
Rev. 2004
22
Appendix
no vacancies exist for this classification in the Bargaining Unit, then a WPB package will be offered in accordance with Section A.2.(a)(1) of this Article 1.
b)	Any remaining unassigned employees at the affected work location in a job classification for which there are vacancies existing in the Bargaining Unit for their classification will be considered surplus employees. These employees can “bump” according to Company seniority to a similar level or lower classification, in the Steam Generation Division, Shop Services Instrumentation Division — Mechanical Services Shop, or Nuclear Generation Site Department — San Onofre provided he/she has Company seniority over an employee then occupying such classification and is otherwise qualified. Any existing vacancies will be included as “bump" choices for employees involved in the RIF. In the event more than one (1) employee is qualified to fill a vacancy, the vacancy will be offered according to Company seniority, beginning with the most senior employee. It is understood that as a result of the bumping process for surplus employees, an employee could become excess, and subject to the provisions of Section A.2.(a)(1) of this Article 1.
c)	Employees that “bump” or fill a vacancy in a lower classification will maintain the wage rate they had prior to filling the lower classification. This wage rate will remain in effect (not to include any subsequently negotiated increases) until the rate
Rev. 2004
Appendix
131
Appendix 23
of pay for the employee’s current job classification equals or exceeds the maintained rate or the employee declines to accept a vacancy offered under Sections A.4. (a) or A.4. (c) of this Agreement.
3.	At the conclusion of the RIF:
a) Employees that are faced with severance as a result of the RIF can elect one of the following three (3) options:
(1)	Option one: Allow the senior employee within the Bargaining Unit and in the same pre RiF classification as the employee facing severance, the option of taking a WPB package.
(a) If an employee elects option one, the Company will contact the most senior employee in the pre-RIF classification and offer a WPB package, If the senior employee declines the offer, the Company will continue the process until an offer is accepted. If an offer to take the WPB package is not accepted, the employee facing severance will be severed in accordance with the WPB Agreement. If an offer to take the WPB package is accepted, the employee facing severance must be willing to fill the vacancy created by the senior employee who accepted the WPB package. Vacancy premiums, relocation allowances, and moving expenses will not be paid. If the employee facing severance is unwilling to fill the vacancy created then he/she will be severed in accordance with this Agreement and the WPB package offered to the senior employee will be withdrawn.
132
Appendix
Rev. 2004
24
Appendix
(2)	Option two: Accept the WPB package.
(3)	Option three; Lay off with recall rights in accordance with Article 11 of this Agreement.
4.	Subsequent to a RIF, the following procedure will be followed in filling vacancies which occur in classifications from which employees have been reduced:
a)	In the event a job vacancy occurs in a classification and at a location from which an employee was forced reduced, the vacancy will be offered to this employee. In the event more than one (1) employee meets the criteria to be offered this vacancy, the vacancy will be offered according to Company seniority beginning with the most senior employee.
b)	The vacancy will be posted for bid in accordance with Article VIII of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
c)	In the event a job vacancy occurs for which there are no qualified bidders or transferees, the vacancy will be offered to employees reduced from that classification whose pre-reduction established working base was within fifty (50) miles of the location at which the vacancy occurs. In the event more than one (1) employee meets the criteria to be offered this vacancy, the vacancy will be offered according to Company seniority beginning with the least senior employee.

11. Recall Rights
A. A laid off employee will be recalled prior to the Company hiring a new employee in the same classification the laid off employee formerly held. Reemployment shall be in reverse order of layoffs, i.e., the last employee laid off shall be the first reemployed. The Company shall notify former employees who were laid off in writing by registered mail addressed to the last address of record to report back to work when jobs are available. If such a former employee does not report within ten (10) days (Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays excluded) after the sending of such notice, he shall lose his/her seniority, except that if the failure to so report is due to a substantiated illness, injury, or some cause beyond his control, the former employee shall be put back to work when he is able to report provided he notifies the Company within such ten (10) day period the approximate date when he/she will be able to return and there is on such date an available job for which he/she is qualified.
1.	It is the responsibility of the employee to see that the Company is advised of his/her current mailing address.
2.	All former employees so re employed must pass a physical examination and upon re-employment shall receive the prevailing rate of pay for the classification in which they are re-employed.

Flinihilitv*
To be eligible for this program, the employee must be:
•	Covered under a Worker Protection Benefits Agreement between the Southern California Edison Company and UWUA, Local 246.
•	A regular, full time employee (see note below).
Note: This includes UWUA regular employees who have temporarily converted to part-time status per the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) provisions, or are on a paid or unpaid leave of absence, but are not on long term disability (LTD) status.
Educational Programs:
Types of educational programs eligible for reimbursement are:
•	Degree (Associate, Bachelor, Master, Doctorate).
•	Certificate Programs (series of classes).
150	Appendix	Rev. 2004
Appendix
For example: Business oriented computer certificate programs.
•	Professional Credential.
•	Correspondence Programs that offer a certificate or degree.
•	Other non degree programs or classes that would provide vocational skill development that will advance the employee’s personal career objectives.
Current IRS rules do not allow for non-taxable educational reimbursements for classes or education involving sports, hobbies or games that are not part of a degree program. Reimbursements made for these types of programs must meet the criteria under this agreement, will be considered taxable compensation, and will not be part of the qualified educational reimbursements made according to IRS Code, Section 127.
Program Requirements:
•	Approved programs must relate to the employee’s personal career objective.
•	Employees must attend the programs/ class(es) on their own time, not during their normal work hours.
Acceptable Educational Institutions:
The educational institutions must be accredited by recognized agencies and/or associations (i.e., U.S. Department of Education, State of California License Board (Contractor/ReaI Estate), North
Rev. 2004
Appendix
151
Appendix
Central Association of Colleges and Schools (CACS) Federal Aviation Administration). Examples of valid institutions are four year colleges or universities, community colleges, correspondence, business or technical schools, and business oriented computer certificate providers (/.e., Novell, CompuServe).
Enrollment:
•	Complete the Educational Assistance Request form 19-383 prior to the start date of the program or class. Follow processing, approval, and reimbursement procedures indicated on form 19-383.
•	Complete the attachment form, "Worker Protection Educational Reimbursement Program Participation Approval” (see Attachment to this Agreement) to the 19-383, and obtain approval from the immediate supervisor. This form can be obtained from the Payroll Location Office.
Approval Requirements:
Applications: An employee's application forms (19-383 and the Worker Protection Educational Reimbursement Program Participation Approval) must be approved prior to commencement of class(es) by his/her immediate supervisor and second level supervisor/manager. (Classes that began after January 1, 1998 but prior to July 1, 1998, will not require prior approval but will require submittal of the proper forms.)
152
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
Reimbursements: Reimbursement requests after the completion of the class(es) can be approved by the employee’s immediate supervisor. The supervisor signature shows that he/she has validated the employee’s successful completion of the class and that the employee has provided all required receipts and documentation to be filed in the employee’s personnel file maintained at the Payroll Location.
If the employee has received educational reimbursements under the Corporate Educational Assistance Program (ESM 19.17.21) or other established educational reimbursement programs, the amount received under those programs plus the amount received under the Worker Protection Educational Reimbursement Program cannot exceed $5,250 in a calendar year unless his/her employment is severed under the Worker Protection Benefits Agreement provisions. See Program Disqualification section of this document.
All reimbursements over $5,250 in a calendar year will be considered taxable compensation and the employee will be responsible for paying taxes on applicable reimbursed expenses in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code, Section 127, which governs the taxability of educational reimbursements.
Reimbursable Expenses:
The following expenses are appropriate for reimbursement:
Rev. 2004
Appendix
153
Appendix
•	Tuition and registration fees. (e.g., SAT or GMSAT if required for acceptance to a school and only if the employee is actually accepted to the school).
•	Required enrollment and graduation fees (e.g., student body and health care fees, graduation request fees).
•	Books.
•	Parking.
•	Required exam or grade request fees.
•	Mandatory laboratory fees.
The following expenses are not appropriate for reimbursement:
•	Fees for exams taken to renew licenses or certificates.
•	License fees.

•	Paid receipts for all eligible expenses (Note: No reimbursements will be made without receipts for all eligible expenses).
Taxation of Reimbursement:
Employees are responsible for paying taxes on applicable reimbursed expenses. The Internal Revenue Code, Section 127, governs the taxability of educational reimbursements. Currently, the IRS Code allows reimbursement for undergraduate (Certificate, Associate, Bachelor) pro-grams/classes to be excluded from gross income. Reimbursement for graduate (Master, Doctorate) programs or classes are not excluded from gross income and are currently taxable. If appropriate, taxes on the reimbursed amount will be deducted from the employee’s biweekly paycheck and reflected on the W-2 Wage and Tax Statement.
Program Disqualification:
Employees will not be eligible to be reimbursed for educational expenses if any of the above requirements of the program are not met or if the employee:
Rev. 2004
Appendix
155
Appendix
•	Terminates his/her employment with the Company (voluntary or involuntary). See note below regarding employees who are severed under the Worker Protection Benefits Agreement.
•	Does not obtain prior approval. Classes that began after January 1, 1998 but prior to July 1, 1998, will not require prior approval but will require submittal of the proper forms.
•	Does not submit the request in accordance with requirements of this program.
Note: Employees who are severed by the Company under the Worker Protection Benefit Agreement, and are eligible to receive the post employment Worker Protection Educational Reimbursement Benefit, will continue to receive educational reimbursements as defined by the WPB Agreement.
Audits:
The Audits Department will periodically audit the Worker Protection Educational Assistance Program to ensure that policies are being applied correctly and consistently. The audit would include a review of documents pertaining to eligible receipts and satisfactory completion of classes, maintenance of documentation in the employee’s personnel file at the work location, etc.

Subject: Tool Purchase Program
Dear Mr. Turner:
The purpose ot this letter is to confirm the results of our discussions regarding modification of the Collective Bargaining Agreement’s Letter of Understanding involving the Tool Purchase Program.
Currently, and in accordance with the Letter of Understanding, titled “Tool Purchase Program,” eligible personnel may purchase specified job-related tools by means of interest free, extended payroll deductions with supervisory approval.
Recently, the Company has undertaken a comprehensive review of the program, a program begun in conjunction during the 1982-83 negotiations between Local 246, UWUA and the Southern California Edison Company. From the review, the Company has identified an area it believes will be of mutual interest to both the Union and the Company involving the classification of apprentice machinist. The Company is prepared to offer the following:
160
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
Effective September 1, 1998, the Company will raise the Machinist, Apprentice classification’s maximum unpaid balance to $2500.00. The repayment period will remain unchanged and continue to be 36 months.
Discussions between the Company and the Union will resume on other job classifications included in the Letter of Understanding at the conclusion of the Company's review. The Company anticipates conclusion of the review during the 4th quarter of 1998.
Based on our previous discussions regarding this subject matter and your subsequent concurrence, would you please sign below and return one copy to my office. Upon receipt of your signature, a letter will be forwarded to all affected payroll locations memorializing the modification to the Letter of Understanding.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
POWER PLANT MECHANIC “A” & “B”
I Introduction
Southern California Edison Company (hereinafter referred to as the Company) and the Utility Workers Union of America, Local 246 (hereinafter referred to as the Union), commenced Section M bargaining in December, 1998 to create and implement two new classifications and eliminate one existing classification.
The Company and Union have agreed to establish a classification known as a Power Plant Mechanic A (PPMA) to replace the existing classification of the Coal Handling Equipment Mechanic (Occupational Code L 9487). Upon ratification, existing employees in the Coal Handling Equipment Mechanic position will automatically convert to the classification of Power Plant Mechanic A at which time they shall assume conventional job specifications and duties in accordance with Attachments B & C.
In addition, the Company and Union have agreed to establishing a Power Plant Mechanic B (PPMB) classification. The PPMB will be a developmental classification containing a recognized progression into the PPMA position. The PPMB shall be required to complete a series of tests before promoting into the PPMA position including PPMB
Rev. 2004
Appendix
169
Appendix
training module tests and the promotional knowledge test for PPMA.
II.	Progression of Power Plant Mechanic B to Power Plant Mechanic A
The PPMB progression into the PPMA classification shall be for a period of two (2) years consisting of four (4) steps known as modules. Each module must be successfully completed within a maximum of six (6) calendar months.
A.	The Company will implement a four (4) step progression toward the development of personnel into the PPMA classification. During this four (4) step progression, the employee shall be designated a PPMB.
B.	Each of the progression’s four (4) modules will hold the same value relative to each step progression and equity increases. No module is nor will be designed to be more difficult than another.
C.	Module I shall be completed first during the PPMB progression. Upon completion of Module 1, an employee has the option to pursue either modules 2, 3, or 4 determined by the number of bidders, volunteers, and working unit seniority.
D.	Each module will consist of job-related knowledge and skills. Once a skill and knowledge is learned, the PPMB will be required to perform a proficiency check-off on each task. At the conclusion of each respective module, the PPMB will be required to pass a written examination involving the module’s curriculum.
170
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
E.	Once a PPMB begins a module, the PPMB shall complete the module prior to moving into a different module, unless certain operating or business conditions do not permit such completion. Should operating or business conditions interfere with the progression, the PPMB will be permitted to pursue other module related tasks to complete the training and shall not be penalized in the progression.
F.	Upon successful completion of an individual module, the PPMB will realize an equity increase in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement’s Appendix A. Successful completion of a module is dependent upon completing all necessary check-offs and passing the written examination.
G.	PPMB’s will be permitted to accelerate through the progression in a minimum of one (1) year providing check-off and testing requirements are satisfied, however, employees will not be permitted to accelerate through the first 6 month module.
III.	Progression Failures
A.	If management determines that an employee is failing or unable to meet the requirements of the PPMB progression and should be removed from the progression, the employee will be reassigned to either of the following classifications:
(1)	For employees unsuccessful in the PPMB progression; prior journeyman or employees of

Re: Horizontal and Downward Movement
Dear Jim:
During negotiations on the accelerated appren-tir'ochinc anrl wnrLar nrntartinn hanofitn HA/DO \ li W Wi Ml IM If VI i^VI V IWUk/l I MUI IVI I LkJ y T • I j the parties did not clearly outline the understandings relative to horizontal and downward movement after an employee completes the apprenticeship or accepts a vacancy during a reduction in forces. The following is provided for clarification.
As per the Letter of Understanding dated December 31, 1997 relative to accelerated apprenticeships within Power Production, there is a twelve month horizontal or downward move bid restriction from the date of award to a journeyman position. The letter further provides that the restriction does not apply if: 1) a fixed shift employee bids horizontally to a different fixed shift for the same job and at the same bid location, or 2) the employee is declared surplus or is displaced during a reduction in forces (RIF). As clarified by this letter dated March 1. 1999, the restriction also does not apply if there is no other qualified bidder to be considered.

Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
2.	The Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) is silent on whether the twenty-four month bid restriction for SONGS positions and Service Shop Mechanics positions in the Mechanical Services Shop applies when there is no other qualified bidder to be considered. As clarified by this letter dated March 1.1999. the restriction does not aooly in the aforementioned circumstance.
3.	The WPB agreement is silent on whether the six month bid restriction or twenty-four month restriction for SONGS’ positions and Service Shop Mechanic positions in the Mechanical Services Shop (MSS) applies to horizontal or downward movement after an employee has voluntarily accepted a vacancy through the RIF process. Based on the voluntary acceptance and associated vacancy premium for filling the vacancy, it is understood the horizontal or downward movement restriction will apply to a bid or transfer that occurs subsequent to the filling of that vacancy. The restriction does not apply if 1) the employee was assigned to the vacancy and received no vacancy premium, or 2) there is no other qualified bidder to be considered for the bid or transfer,
4.	As per Article VIII, sections C (1) and C (8)(b) in the CBA, the ineligibility to move horizontally or downward by bid or transfer shall be from the award date of the bidder’s current job to the removal date of the job posting on which the employee is bidding.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
MOHAVE OFF-SITE WORK ASSIGNMENTS
I.	Introduction
Southern California Edison Company (hereinafter referred to as the Company) and the Utility Workers Union of America, Local 246 (hereinafter referred to as the Union), commenced Section M bargaining in February, 1999 to amend the current Collective Bargaining Agreements Letter of Understanding, “Assignment of Station Resident Personnel to other Locations.”
The Company and Union have agreed to establish a rotation process for determining off-site job assignments for represented employees at Mohave Generating Station.
II.	Implementation
Upon ratification, the Company will setup an offsite work rotation list for each classification that will participate in off-site work. The senior-qualified employee within that classification will be placed at the top of the rotational list and shall initially be the first employee offered the assignment.
In offering future assignments, the first employee asked shall be the employee on the rotational list directly below the last employee who volunteered and worked the previous off-site work assignment.
Rev. 2004
Appendix
189
Appendix
For purposes of off-site work assignments, the Mohave station machinist and the Mohave mill machinist will be combined onto one classification list by the employee’s working unit seniority.
Ill,	Duration and Selection of Job Assignments
The duration of an off-site work assignment, nonavailability, or accepting or declining off-site work assignments will all carry the same weight before moving to the next eligible employee on the rotational work list.
If and when there are not enough volunteers within classification to meet the off-site job requirements, the Company will consider asking all other qualified and available employees outside the original classification requested. These employees will be offered the assignment and asked by working unit seniority before assigning personnel from within the original classification requested. It will not be the intent of the Company to assign qualified and available employees outside the original classification requested for the off-site work assignment.
Job assignments shall be scheduled for the complete job with allowances for cycling of employees for the purpose(s) of balancing shift skills and/or training of employees.
If and when there are still not enough volunteers, employees within the classification requested will be assigned on the basis of working unit seniority
190
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
with the qualified and available junior employees being assigned first.
Employees assigned to off-site work assignments shall be allowed to volunteer to rotate out of the assignment at the end of four (4) weeks. No more than 50% of these employees will be rotated out during any given four-week cycle. If the need arises to return only part of the off-site assignment crew, the crew will return on a "first in, first out” basis. If employees were sent to the work assignment at the same time, the Company would ask and return by unit seniority, with the senior employee being asked if he/she wishes to return, and the junior employee being returned first if no one volunteers.
Employees who do not wish to be considered for field assignments as volunteers may submit a memorandum to their immediate supervisor:
a) Such memorandums will remain in effect until withdrawn in the same manner, b) This action implies no exemption from being assigned to a field assignment.
IV.	Misassignment of Off-Site Work
If an employee is bypassed for an off-site work assignment, the employee will be considered eligible to be first asked for the next off-site work assignment.
V.	Transfers and New Hires
Employees transferring into the classification will be placed on the rotation list by working unit
Rev. 2004

seniority, with no affect on who is the next employee asked to work an off-site job.
VI.	Journeyman in Training
For the purposes of this Agreement, Journeyman in Training (JITS) are included in their respective classification by working unit seniority and will not be subject to the provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement’s Article VIII, Section B(6).
VII.	Overtime
An off-site Evergreen list will be established which will use unit seniority to initially establish the order for overtime at each field assignment; once established, the overtime list will be updated daily. If and when no supervision is assigned to the field assignment, the overtime list will be maintained and administered by the employees on the field assignment. Personnel rotated into the job assignment will be averaged into the existing job assignment overtime list being utilized.
Employees available and working at Mohave Generating Station during a field assignment will be considered available for overtime, provided such overtime does not interfere with the resumption of the field assignment.
Employees on field assignments will not be considered for overtime at the Mohave Generating Station. Employees on off-site job assignments within zones 1 and 2 will be considered available for RDO overtime.
192
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
VIII.	Vacation
Any employee with pre-arranged vacation days scheduled within the same time slot as a field assignment will not be normally be considered available for that work assignment, however, such employees will be given the option of postponing their scheduled vacation and will be canvassed for the assignment in the regular order.
IX.	Dispute Resolution
All disputes arising from the administration of this Agreement and/or any other concerns which may arise may be settled by discussion between the Company and the Main Union Office of Local 246, UWUA. These types of discussions are not to be misconstrued as a substitute of Article IV of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
X,	Duration
Either party may cancel this Agreement by providing sixty (60) days written notice. If canceled, the Collective Bargaining Agreement’s Letter of Understanding “Assignment of station resident personnel to other locations," will be enforced. The action will take effect within sixty (60) day following receipt of the written notification of cancellation.

Dear Jim:
In an effort to address an equity issue related to the rehiring of SCE retirees into regular UWUA-represented positions, the parties have agreed to the following:
The provision for the reinstatement of prior Company seniority after a reemployment period of one year (“bridging”) as defined in Article VIII Section A(J) shall not apply to individuals who have retired from the Company and are subsequently rehired into a regular UWUA-represented full-time position.
Likewise, the provision for the bridging of “working unit” seniority after a reemployment period of one year as defined in Article VIII Section A(2) shall not apply to individuals who have retired from the Company and are subsequently rehired into a regular UWUA-represented full-time position.
This modification is intended to affect seniority rights for bid, transfer, and reduction in force purposes. This modification does not amend our Benefits agreement nor does it amend any agreement between the parties related to the rehiring of formerly retired employees.

The vacancy will be offered to the senior qualified employee laid off or being laid off. The employee may accept or decline the offer without any impact to their recall rights.
OVERTIME ADMINISTRATION
For purposes of the SONGS Dry Cask Storage Construction Project agreement, Article X J. of the existing Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be modified to reflect the following:
J. Overtime work shall be distributed as equally as practicable among those employees qualified and available who normally perform such work without regard for classification. The Maintenance Helper — Steam (Project) and Attendant, Tool Room (Project) classifications will establish their own combined overtime list.

Rev. 2004
Appendix
Only overtime hours actually worked will be recorded on the overtime lists.
The following guidelines shall be used in applying this section of the Project Regular Agreement:
(1)	When practicable, the low person in overtime who is qualified, available, and who normally performs such work without regard for classification will be the first person offered the overtime.
(2)	When overtime work is to be offered to an employee, the contract will be made in person by telephone or writing by supervisor.
(3)	Employees shall be scheduled for prearranged and/or callout overtime in the sequence that pertains to their location and/or schedule. Employees may initially decline such overtime except as otherwise noted.
(4)	Employees will not normally be asked for overtime or subject to assignment when on days off in conjunction with vacation periods of two or more days’ duration.
(5)	Employees who return to their jobs after being off work because of illness, injury or leave of absence for more than thirty (30) days shall be given the option of either 1) taking the average overtime hours of their classification in their work group at the time of return or, 2) returning with the overtime hours they had before such absence.

ing like classifications found in Exhibit A of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement.
PROD UCTION/ALTERN ATE WORK SCHEDULES
Given the unique nature of the work, the SONGS Dry Cask Storage Fabrication Project will likely need to establish alternate work schedules (i.e., 4-10’s or 9-80’s) to meet manufacturing or production scheduling requirements. To increase business efficiencies, the parties recognize the need for flexibility and any alternate work schedule temporarily adopted for such work requirements will be in accordance with existing employment regulations and require the concurrence of the Company's responsible manager and the Union’s Business Manager.
The Company will establish shifts as necessary. Employees will initially be hired to work dayshift, with the understanding that they must be willing to work all shifts. Established shifts will be filled by qualified employees exercising their shift preference utilizing company seniority as the determining factor. The Company will assign junior employee’s shift (i.e., training, shift balance skills, long term illness or shift vacancies); management will notify the employee twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the starting time of the new schedule.

Subject: Extended Military Leave
Dear Mr. Dominguez:
Currently, the Company compensates employees for the difference between Edison base pay and military pay for up to two weeks (80 hours) annually (calendar year). This differential pay is paid upon the employee's return from military service.
Per our earlier conversation, in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Company decided to temporarily amend its military leave provisions by providing pay supplements up to their base pay and benefit subsidies for up to one year to employees who are involuntarily deployed on active duty between September 1, 2001 and August 31, 2002. Augmented payment will occur for up to one year from date of deployment within this timeframe. Employees who volunteer for military service fall under the provisions of the existing policy.
If you concur with this temporary amendment to the military leave provisions as stated above,

ADDENDUM TO LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING.
SAN ONOFRE — DRY CASK STORAGE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT — PROJECT REGULAR EMPLOYEE
■ AGREEMENT
After commencement of the Dry Cask Storage Construction Project, the Company determined a business and operational desire for tool room attendant personnel- As such, the Company would like to expand the existing classifications staffed for the Dry Cask Storage Construction Project to include the Attendant, Tool Room (Project) classification. Additionally, if the Company needs to backfill behind a Tool Room Attendant (Project) vacancy created by his or her absence, the Company would intend to use qualified Tool Room Attendants from SONGS 2 & 3. However, it would not be the intention(s) of the Company to use the SONGS 2 & 3 Tool Room Attendant for additional dry cask storage work in the “Helper” classification. All amendments needed to be made due to this addendum are indicated by BOLD print in the Letter of Understanding’s text.

When established program criteria are met, point awards will be made as follows to eligible full time regular and part-time UWUA represented employees:
Attendance:
Based on an existing annual maximum of $100 for this award, the maximum equivalent annual award points are 40, to be earned at 10 points per quarter.
Peer Recognition:
Based on an existing annual maximum of $100 for this award, the maximum equivalent annual award points are 40, to be earned at 10 points per award occurrence.

respectively.
Award Distribution;
Points awarded in the individual recognition programs will accumulate in a combined employee I account and will be deposited within four weeks of the end of the performance period.

If an offer to take the PWPB package is accepted, the employee facing severance must be willing to fill the vacancy created by the senior employee who accepted the PWPB package. Relocation allowances and moving expenses will not be paid. If the employee facing severance is unwilling to fill the vacancy created, then he/she will be severed in accordance with this Agreement and the PWPB package offered to the senior employee will be withdrawn.
(2)	Option two: Accept the PWPB package.
(3)	Option three: Lay off with recall rights in accordance with Article II of this Agreement.
(4)	Option four: If qualified, fill a temporary position in accordance with the provisions of the Letter of Understanding regarding Temporary Employees in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

Appendix 22
employee was forced reduced, the vacancy will be offered to this employee. In the event more than one (1) employee meets the criteria to be offered this vacancy, the vacancy will be offered according to Company seniority beginning with the most senior employee.
b)	The vacancy will be posted for bid in accordance with Article VIII of the Collective Bargaining Agreement
c)	In the event a job vacancy occurs for which there are no qualified bidders or transferees, the vacancy will be offered to employees reduced from that classification whose pre-reduction established working base was within fifty (50) miles of the location at which the vacancy occurs. In the event more than one (1) employee meets the criteria to be offered this vacancy, the vacancy will be offered according to Company seniority beginning with the least senior employee.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
As a result of the 2003 negotiations between Southern California Edison (hereinafter referred to as Company) and Utility Workers Union of America, UWUA, Local 246, (hereinafter referred to as Union) the parties agreed to the restructuring of certain clerical progressions within the UWUA Bargaining Unit. Conversion to the new structure will be implemented no later than ninety (90) days after the ratification of the 2004-2008 Collective Bargaining Agreement which includes this Letter of Understanding, except as provided in Section II.C below. The parties agree to the following:
I. Introduction
A.	The parties agree to restructure specific existing UWUA clerical classifications by closing twenty-six (26) current classifications in the “hired prior to 1984” and “hired after 1984” wage schedules. The affected incumbents in these classifications will be transitioned into four new classifications within two clerical levels, as shown in Section II, Table A — Closed Classifications and Section III, Table B — Reclassification of Affected Employees.
316
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
B.	Any omissions or terms and conditions not addressed involving the restructuring of the Clerical progressions in this Letter of Understanding will defer and be governed by the terms and conditions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between the parties.
II,	Clerical Restructuring
A.	Four new classifications will be created — Office Assistant 2 (OA2), Office Assistant 1 — Administrative Services (OA1-AS), Office Assistant 1 — Documentation Services (OA1-DS), and Office Assistant 1 — Access Authorization (0A1-AA). The OA2 classification is the entering level clerical position. The OA1 classifications are the senior level clerical positions.
B.	The twenty-six (26) clerical classifications listed in Table A will be closed. Incumbents in the Secretary Stenographer (UWUA) classification may elect to remain in that classification or transition to the new OA2 classification. If the employee elects to remain in that classification, they will have up to twelve months from the date of implementation to change their election and convert to the new OA2 classification. At the close of that twelve-month period, they will remain in the Secretary Stenographer (UWUA) classification until they promote, transfer or terminate.

IV,	Changes to the Clerical Progression Path
The existing twenty-six (26) clerical classifications (refer to Table A) will become two separate classification levels within a progression consisting of the new OA2 and OA1 classifications. The OA2 classification is the entry point into the clerical progression and consists of six steps, each step being 6 months. Entry into the OA2 classification is through bid and test. Employees reaching step 6 of the OA2 classifi
Rev. 2004	Appendix	321
Appendix
cation are considered at “top step’* and will remain at that step “thereafter”, or until they promote to an OA1 vacancy via bid and test.
A. The OA1 classifications are the senior level positions within the progression. Each OA1 classification consists of four steps, each step being 6 months. Entry into the OA1 classifications is through bid and tests that are specific to the knowledge, skills, and abilities of the particular OA1 classification.
V, Wages
A.	Employees transitioning into the OA2 or OA1 classifications will receive the 2004 General Increase to their hourly wage upon implementation of this agreement
B.	Employees transitioning into the new OA2 and OA1 classifications will be placed at an equivalent step to their current step wage. If the OA2 and OA1 classifications do not contain a progression step equal to their current step wage, employees will be placed at the nearest higher step wage of the classification into which they transition. If an employee’s current step is greater than the top step wage of the classification into which they transition, the employee will remain at their current hourly wage and continue to receive applicable wage adjustments as negotiated by the parties.
322
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
1.	An employee who currently has a higher step wage due to red circle provisions associated with a reduction in forces (RIF) will maintain that wage rate (not to include any subsequently negotiated increases) in accordance with Article VIII.E. (2) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, or any other applicable negotiated alternate reduction in forces procedure.
2.	An employee who currently has a higher step wage due to non-RIF related reasons will continue to receive any subsequently negotiated increases (“gold circled”) until the employee is no longer in the OA2 or OA1 classification.
3.	Wages for the OA2 and OA1 classifications are shown in Table C below.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
In conjunction with the 2003-2004 negotiations between Southern California Edison (hereinafter referred to as Company) and Utility Workers Union of America, UWUA, Local 246, (hereinafter referred to as Union) the parties agreed to restructuring of the Nuclear Instrument Technician (N9938) and Radiation Instrument Technician (N9959) classifications, inclusive of establishing new wage schedules and closing affected classifications.
I.	Introduction
A.	The duties of the existing Nuclear Instrument Technician and the Radiation Instrument Technician will be combined, and a new classification entitled Nuclear Instrument and Control Technician (referred to as Nuclear l&C Technician) will be established, with a corresponding adjusted wage schedule. The Nuclear Instrument Technician classification and Radiation Instrument Technician classification will be closed, and will no longer be used. The job title will be cancelled when the title is vacated.
B.	Since the Instrument Technician (N9931) classification in the Power Production Department (PPD) is considered a “like” classification to the Nuclear Instrument Technician classification, the classification will
332
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
also be closed, and incumbents moved to a new classification entitled Instrument and Control Technician-Power Production (l&C Tech — PPD), with the adjusted corresponding wage schedule.
C.	Transition to the new classifications will be implemented no later than thirty (30) days after the ratification of the 2004-2008 Collective Bargaining Agreement, except as provided in Section II. B. below.
D.	The wage schedule for the Control Room Operator, Nuclear Test Technician A, and Test Technician A classifications will be modified to correspond to the new wage schedule for the Nuclear l&C Technician.
II.	Reclassification
A.	Incumbents in the Nuclear Instrument Technician and Instrument Technician classifications will be moved to the new Nuclear I & C Technician and Instrument Technician Technician — PPD classifications as shown in Section III, Table A — Reclassification of Affected Employees and Table B—Appendix A Wage Schedule.
B.	Incumbents in the Radiation Instrument Technician classification at the time of ratification may elect to remain in their current closed classification or transition to the new Nuclear l&C Technician classification.
Rev. 2004
Appendix
333
Appendix
1.	If the employee elects to remain in the Radiation Instrument Technician classification, they will have up to twenty-four (24) months from the date of ratification of this agreement to change their election and convert to the new Nuclear l&C Technician classification.
2.	They will be exempted from any test requirements for the Nuclear l&C Technician classification if they wish to change classifications during the twenty-four month period. At the close of the twenty-four month period, they will not have an option to convert to the Nuclear l&C Technician classification, and must meet all bid and test requirements for the position.
HL Wages
A.	For employees transitioning into the new Nuclear I & C Technician and the l&C Technician — PPD classifications, the 2004 General Increase will be applied to their negotiated 2003 adjusted hourly wage (See Table A — Appendix A — 2003 Adjusted Wage Schedule and Table B — Reclassification of Affected Employees) upon implementation of this agreement. The 2003 Adjusted Wage Schedule will also be established for the Control Operator (P8713), Nuclear Test Technician A (P9887) and Test Technician A — UWUA (P9930) classifications.

At any time after the Company hires employees at any of the generating stations listed above, the Company will provide the names, addresses, and classifications of the employees at the location to the Union upon request by the Union at reasonable intervals as requested by the Union. At any time after the Company has staffed the re-acquired facility with a representative complement of its workforce, and upon request by the Union, the Company shall submit to an authorization card check to determine the desires of its employees to be represented by the Union for the purposes of collective bargaining. In the event the California Mediation and Conciliation Service verified that a majority of the employees then employed by the Company at the re-acquired facility have signed cards authorizing the Union to act as their collective bargaining representative, the Company shall recognize the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative of such employees and such employees will be covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the parties. The parties further agree that guards, supervisors, technical and confidential employees shall be excluded from the card check recognition process.

SONGS JOURNEYMAN SKILLS PREMIUM
A. OVERVIEW
a.	The Journeyman Skills Premium (hereinafter referred to as “the premium”) is established to pay for attaining and maintaining additional task qualifications beyond those required for the existing Journeyman Premium described in Article IX. For each Journeyman classification identified in section B. 1. b, a iisi of associated task qualifications consisting of two different categories Core and Discretionary must be obtained to meet the criteria for receiving an additional 2% premium. In order to gain the 2% premium, the employee must obtain 100% of the Core Task Qualifications and at least 50% of the Discretionary Task Qualifications.
b.	The Core and Discretionary Task Qualifications will be specified for each classification in the applicable SONGS Training Procedures. Core and Discretionary Task Qualifications may change based on operational needs. The selection of Discretionary tasks for each employee within the classification wilt reflect an effort to balance the skill sets of employees across the discipline. Management will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the training of employees in the different discretionary tasks will not impact the
358
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
equal distribution of overtime availability for employees in a given classification.
B, JOURNEYMAN SKILLS PREMIUM
1. To be eligible for the premium the employ* ee must meet all of the following requirements:
a.	Meet all Journeyman qualification requirements under Article IX C (2) and (3).
b.	Be at the top step in one of the following job classifications:

Appendix
employee will be required to complete. The selection of Discretionary tasks for each employee, will reflect an effort to balance the skill sets across the discipline. Every effort will be made by management to ensure that the training of employees in the different discretionary tasks will not impact the equal distribution of overtime availability for employees in a given classification. The list of both the Core and Discretionary Task Qualifications will be maintained in applicable SONGS Training Procedures.
4.	The premium will be paid beginning on the first day of the pay period following eligibility. Except as specified in Section (E), the premium will cease at the end of the pay period in which the employee no longer meets eligibility requirements as defined in Section B.(1) above.
C, TASK QUALIFICATIONS FOR INCUMBENT EMPLOYEES
1.	Within three months of ratification of this proposal and on an annual basis thereafter, the Company will develop and implement a training plan that will be communicated to each affected incumbent Journeyman who has not met the requirements for the premium. It will lay out the Core and Discretionary Tasks required to receive the premium, the status of each task with respect to the employee, and when the employee will be scheduled for the
Rev. 2004
Appendix
361
Appendix
training opportunities within that year. This will occur before December 1 of the year preceding the next years training schedule.
2.	At least one qualification opportunity for each Core Task and a qualification opportunity for a sufficient number of Discretionary Tasks to meet the program eligibility criteria will be given to each incumbent journeyman within a two year period, commencing upon ratification of the Agreement. If the employee has been offered and scheduled for a qualification opportunity as described above, but fails to attain the task qualification(s) for the premium, the premium will not commence until met.
a. If an employee is not able to avail themselves of an offered and scheduled qualification opportunity for any reason, except for vacation scheduled prior to December 18 of the previous year (i.e. vacationl, sick, failure to complete classroom, on the job training (OJT) or task performance evaluation (TPE)) the qualification opportunity will still be counted.
3.	If the Company has not provided the aforementioned qualification opportunity to an employee within the two year period after ratification, a premium will not be paid, but will commence accruing at the end of the two year period. The premium and any accrued monies will be paid on the first pay period following the attainment of the required task qualifications by the employee. If the employee has been

Appendix
The JHPT classification will be a closed “developmental” classification created as a “transitional” position for employees directly affected by the restructuring of the classifications within the Division.
B.	Under this agreement, only employees affected in the Division will be permitted to transition into the JHPT classification. The JHPT will assume the newly established job specification duties after transitioning from his/her previously held classification listed in section D. The Union’s Business Manager and the Company’s responsible Labor Relations Manager or his/her designated representative will determine the appropriate date for such transition to occur.
However, in no case will the transition date exceed ninety (90) days from the date of ratification of this Agreement.
C.	JHPT’s who complete the necessary training, step progression, and pass the promotional knowledge test(s) will be eligible to promote into the Health Physics Technician (HPT) classification by bid. Within thirty (30) days of a JHPT meeting all the requirements for HPT, the Company will post a HPT vacancy and subsequently fill the HPT vacancy (ies) in accordance with Article VIII B. of the CBA. All employees are eligible to bid such vacancy (ies). JHPT’s that have met all the requirements to promote to HPT and do not fill an HPT
Rev. 2004
Appendix
369

B.	Overtime Balancing and Retention
In an effort to retain qualified operators and to balance the overtime hours among those operators who are qualified and available, a bonus will be applied to “Earned Voluntary Overtime Hours Worked”. Those “Earned Voluntary Overtime Hours Worked” will be posted on a pay period basis for each operator to track his/her “Earned Voluntary Overtime Hours Worked”. They will be accrued and paid-out on an annualized basis. This program will be implemented starting with September of 2004 and ending December 2006. Management has the discretion to extend this program with 60 days notice to the union.
The following criteria must be met to qualify for the bonus:
1.	“Earned Voluntary Overtime Hours Worked” must exceed a hurdle of 100 voluntary hours.
396
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
Note: the volunteer OT hours counted toward the 100 hour hurdle does not include built tn OT hours that are part of the 12 hour work schedule nor non-Evergreen hours, but will nclude the approximately 70 hours of pre-shift brief
Example: A NCO’s annual earned voluntary OT hours worked of 479 includes 100 hours built in OT and 70 hours of pre-shift brief OT hours. Payout would be computed on: 479 hours minus 100 hours built in OT (bit), minus 100 hours (hurdle), equals 279 “earned voluntary OT hours worked”.
2.	“Earned Voluntary Overtime Hours Worked” will be paid out as a bonus equal to the base plus premium wage rate for that classification. For every “Earned Voluntary Overtime Hour Worked” that is over the hurdle, the base plus premium wage rate for that classification will be used to calculate the accrued annual payout, with a cap of 15% against the ndividual’s annual earnings. For purposes of this section, Table D shows an example of how the bonus would work in one of the affected classifications.
Rev. 2004
Appendix
397
Appendix

100 Hr Hurdle Plus BLT OT Hrs.....200
Bonus Earned Voluntary Hrs Worked............................279
Base Wage Plus Premium Rate.......$433.9641
Bonus Payout on Earned Voluntary Hrs Worked..............$12,265.82
1 Base wage plus premium rate will change based on any general wage increases
3.	The employee must be on the SONGS payroll as of the last day of each anniversary period.
a)	September 2004 thru December 2004 — During this transition period, the OT hurdle for 2004 will be 50 voluntary hours. The payout for this period will occur in the first quarter of 2005 for “Earned Voluntary Overtime Hours Worked” from September 1, 2004 thru December 31, 2004.
398
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
b)	January 1, 2005 thru December 31, 2005 — Based on 100 Earned Voluntary Hours Worked, the payout will occur in the first quarter of 2006.
c)	January 1,2006 thru December 31,2006 — Based on 100 Earned Voluntary Hours Worked. Fhe payout will occur in the first quarter of 2007.
V, Mohave Generating Station Operations
A.	Nuclear Operator Vacancies
1.	Twenty (20) nuclear operator vacancies will be declared if, and when, a MOGS RIF is declared. These vacancies will only be available to Mohave operators that satisfy the requirements of the nuclear classification.
2.	Responsible SONGS management will determine the appropriate job vacancy job itles, Apprentice Nuclear Plant Equipment Operator and/or Secondary Nuclear Plant Equipment Operator.
3.	Pre-testing for applicable nuclear operator ests will be conducted at the MOGS work loca-ion prior to start of the RIF. Study sessions will be provided to the Mohave operators that pass he POSS test at the nuclear level. Operators hat fail the knowledge test will be re-mediated and will re-test in accordance with the Company’s re-testing policy.
4.	MOGS operators may elect to fill the nuclear operator vacancies. They must satisfy
Rev. 2004
Appendix
399
Appendix
the requirements of the nuclear classification The job award will be based on qualifications and seniority, starting with the most senio employee.
B.	Operator Relief Rate
A Plant Equipment Operator or Assistan Control Operator qualified for upgrade to a higher MOGS operator classification will ge Step 2 as the relief rate for that classification when they satisfy the upgrade credit calcula tion and requirements for that step (per the existing provisions of the CBA), and are upgraded to perform the duties of the higher classification.
C.	Bid Posting Waiver
Effective from the date of ratification through 12/31/2005, the Company has the option, with UWUA Business Manager or designee concurrence, to waive bid postings for Assistant Control Operator or Control Operator vacancies at MOGS for purposes of filling the job(s) with a senior qualified MOGS operator.

Article VIII
(a)	Entry level jobs as designated in Exhibit A will be filled by transfers and new hires, if there are no qualified bidders within the working unit.
(b)	Requests for transfer to positions outside the UWUA working unit will be filled out by the employee. All copies will be presented to the employee’s Manager or his representative who will date and acknowledge receipt of same and return one (1) copy to the employee. This establishes the effective date of the request for transfer. Requests for transfer are limited to six different classifications at any given time for an unlimited number of designated locations.
A request for transfer shall be valid for one (1) year from the date submitted, or until the employee accepts a job in the classification for which a request for transfer had been submitted, whichever comes first. If the employee rejects a job which he is offered, all of the employee’s requests for transfer for that classification will be cancelled.
To be valid for a given job opening, a request for transfer must be submitted ten (10) working days prior to the date on which a department’s requisition for the job in question is received in the Personnel Office.

However, if an employee has not been actually transferred to the new job within thirty (30) days from the time the award has been posted, the employee shall be free to bid and receive an award for another new job or to withdraw the bid.
An employee who has submitted a valid transfer request as set forth in this article, and is performing satisfactorily in his/her present job, meets the Company’s hiring standards, and otherwise meets the qualifications of the vacant job, shall be awarded the job over a new hire.
Each month, the Company will post on the bulletin board a notice of all jobs within the Union awarded by request for transfer. This notice will include the name of the employee, job awarded, location and date the job was awarded.
(3)(a) The entry point into Operations shall be in the classification of Apprentice Plant Equipment Operator. Helpers transferring to Apprentice Plant Equipment Operator vacancies will receive credit in the Apprentice Plant Equipment Operator progression for time spent as a Helper up to but not exceeding six (6) months.

Control Operators and Assistant Control Operators transferring into the Apprentice Nuclear Plant Equipment Operator classification will receive a rate of pay equivalent to the Assistant Control Operator rate of pay during the time they are an ANPEO/SNPEO.
Maintenance journeyman transferring to APEO or ANPEO vacancies will receive six months credit on the wage schedule. They will hold at that step for one year before becoming eligible to progress to the next wage step based on qualifications.
(b)	Employees classified as Apprentice Plant Equipment Operators (APEO) may be assigned their initial training either in the classroom or on-the-job. When the classroom portion is the initial training, at its conclusion, each of the attending APEOs may be subject to the on-the-job training portion at other locations. Job vacancies for such assignments will be posted at the classroom location only and only said APEOs will be eligible to bid them. If any vacancies remain unfilled thereafter, the remaining APEOs at the classroom location beginning with the junior APEO will be assigned to fill the remaining vacancies.
(c)	In the event vacancies for Plant Equipment Operator occur and are not filled as the result of a bid and award, the junior “in-training” Plant

Equipment Operator will be subject to assignment to the job. However, when an "in-training" Plant Equipment Operator is already assigned to a location where such a vacancy exists, the junior “intraining” Plant Equipment Operator at that location shall be assigned the vacancy rather than the junior “in-training” Plant Equipment Operator in the working unit.
An “in-training” Plant Equipment Operator is hereby defined as a Plant Equipment Operator who has progressed from the classification of Apprentice Plant Equipment Operator, when qualified, who has not filled a regular Plant Equipment Operator job and who is carried as excess manning at a station. “In-training” Plant Equipment Operators when qualified, will be eligible to fill shifts the same as a regular Plant Equipment Operator.
(d)	Operators in the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station may move to other central control stations as follows:
1.	If an operator in any classification subsequent to qualifying and obtaining an NRC Operator’s license to operate a San Onofre Unit fails the annual requalifying examination for this license, he will still be subject to the provisions of subsection c(3) of this Article VIII. Such employee will be removed from control room duty and will be required to enter the requalifying program at once. During this period his monthly license premium will be held pending his requalification. Upon
Rev. 2004

Article VIII
requalification he will be paid the money held and his monthly license premium will be resumed.
Should such employee fail to be requalified, he will be subject to subsection (8) of this Section B.
2.	If an Operator is unable to maintain normal progress towards qualifying for or is unable to qualify for an NRC Operator’s license to operate a San Onofre Unit, or if subsequent to qualifying and obtaining an NRC license is unable to meet or maintain the NRC license requirements he/she:
a.	May convert, using working unit seniority, to a non-license path Operator position provided he/she is qualified for and otherwise capable of performing in the position. A Secondary or Primary Nuclear Plant Equipment Operator will remain in their current position, a Nuclear Control Operator will convert to a Primary Nuclear Plant Equipment Operator.
A non-license path operator may, using working unit seniority, elect to re-enter the license path program upon formation of the next available license path class and will receive the Nuclear License Path Premium when they declare their election to enter the license path program. An operator who has reentered the license path program, and who fails a second time to qualify for an NRC license, will not be eligible to re-enter the non-license path program or continue receiving the Nuclear Non-License path Premium without management approval. Additionally, the operator will not be eligible

Rev. 2004
Article VIII
for a Nuclear Non-License Path Premium for a period of one (1) year following the second failure. After the one year period, the operator will start receiving the Nuclear Non-License Path Premium provided he/she is eligible.
If a more senior operator qualifies for entry into the non-license path classification, and the number of operators in that classification is already at the maximum, then the least senior non-license path operator will be required to enter the next available license path class, or be subject to Subsection (8) of this Section B.
A license path operator, who is maintaining normal progress, may voluntarily elect with Supervisory approval, to enter the non-license path classification if the number of operators in that classification is not at the maximum. There will be a minimum of ten (10) positions at SONGS in this classification. An operator who enters this classification shall receive the Nuclear NonLicense Path Premium, provided he/she maintains qualifications for that position. A non-license path Operator will receive re-qualification training equivalent to that received by license path Operators.
b.	Shall be subject to subsection (8) of this Section B.

The junior “in-training” Electrician, Maintenance Machinist, instrument and Control Technician, Nuciear instrument and Control Technician, Nuclear Computer Technician, Welder or Test Technician “A” will be subject to assignment to fill a regular vacancy in his classification in the event there are no qualified bidders for such vacancy. Upon filling such a vacancy either by bid or otherwise, the “in-training” designation will be removed.
(5)	Apprentice Electricians and Apprentice Machinists during the last six (6) months of their apprenticeship will be temporarily assigned as extra manning to work at a station nearest their home. During the period or periods of assignment to work at a station as extra manning under this provision, no travel time will be allowed for reporting to that station for their regular scheduled work hours or hours connected thereto.

They will be placed on the applicable Evergreen overtime list at the appropriate location, based on their classification. At Mohave, “in-training” journeymen will be assigned to Monday through Friday day shifts; however, they will fill temporary back shift vacancies prior to assigning resident journeymen. Individuals will retain “in-training” designation until bidding a vacancy or assigned to fill a regular vacancy in accordance with the contract.
(7)	Maintenance journeymen and all operators, excluding Apprentice Plant Equipment Operators (APEOs) and Apprentice Nuclear Plant Equipment Operators (ANPEOs) transferring into maintenance apprenticeship vacancies will receive six months credit on the wage schedule for the apprentice classification. They will hold at that step for one year before becoming eligible to progress to the next wage step based on qualifications.
(8)	Any employee, except as covered under subsection (3)(d)(1) of this Section B, whose established working base is San Onofre and who is subsequently disqualified from continuing to work at that location as a result of an inability to comply with applicable regulatory requirements will be

Article VIII
given ninety (90) days to obtain another position for which he is qualified within the Company. Any such employee who fails to obtain another position after ninety (90) days, will be made aware of vacancies within the Bargaining Unit, if any exist. If the employee fails to select a job for which he is qualified and has seniority from these vacancies, the Company will assign the employee to a vacancy for which he is qualified and has seniority. If there are no vacancies or the employee fails to have the qualifications and seniority to fill an existing vacancy and the employee failed to obtain another position in the ninety (90) day period, the employee will be subject to Section E of this Article.
During the initial ninety (90) day period, the employee may continue to work at San Onofre if work is available for which he is qualified. If there is no work available at San Onofre for which the employee is qualified, he may be assigned to another work location within the working unit in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII, Sections B and C, However, the employee may elect in lieu of this assignment, to waive the ninety (90) day period as discussed above in this subsection (8).
Prior to assignment as provided in this subsection (8), a Nuclear non-licensed operator or licensed operator will be permitted to remain at San Onofre for a period of ninety (90) days provided he is otherwise qualified to perform an

C. (1) For a period of six (6) months after being awarded a job, an employee shall not be eligible to move horizontally or down by bid or transfer, except when there is no other qualified bidder to be considered. An employee will also be allowed to bid horizontally during the six (6) months after receiving a bid award to a fixed shift position if the bid is for the same job at the same bid location but for a different fixed shift. The employee is restricted to only two (2) such horizontal moves after the initial bid award. The six (6) months for the above ineligibility shall be from the award date of the bidder’s current job to the removal date of the job posting on which he is bidding.
(2)	New employees will be eligible to move only upward during the first six (6) months of their employment.
(3)	A licensed operator at San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station may bid a vacancy elsewhere in the Working Unit using his Working Unit Seniority provided at the time of the complement of operators holding NRC licenses excluding the said operator is at least sixteen (16) for San Onofre Unit 1 and at least thirty-six (36) for San Onofre Units 2 and 3.

In addition, the employee must be Red Badge qualified and capable of performing any job required of the classification anywhere within the plant site. In order to receive the Journeyman Premium, the employee must demonstrate, through the passing of a written test, that he has a thorough and acceptable level of knowledge regarding specific administrative procedures. Included in these procedures would be QA/QC Fundamentals, Verbatim Compliance, Control of Vendor Personnel, Equipment Control Process, Use and Control of Procedures, Design/Facility Changes, Work Authorizations and other similar procedures which may be required in the future. The Journeyman Premium is based on knowledge of the above and not for specific journeyman craft skills.
(3)	Specific training programs have been developed for each area, and employees will attend these training programs. In addition, packages of training materials and summaries of training program content will be provided to employees. The training for these administrative procedures will normally be up to five days in duration. Successful performance on a written exam covering the contents of these training programs will be the primary method of determining the eligibility for the Journeyman Premium.
In addition, eligible employees will be expected to demonstrate their knowledge of these procedures through requalification on a regular
4

Rev. 2004
Article IX
basis. It is expected that requalification tests and training will be conducted every two years, but the Company reserves the right to hold such requalification on an annual basis. In addition, specialized training will be provided if some new administrative procedure is required. Before an employee is required to attend requalification training, he/she will be given the chance to “challenge” the training by passing a knowledge test. The results of the test would determine the amount of requalification training, if any, necessary.
(4)	The Journeyman Premium is subject to being withheld if the employee can not demonstrate an acceptable level of knowledge in the right area. However, it will not be withheld as a disciplinary tool; and when withheld, it will be set aside to be paid pending eventual requalification. However, if an employee fails to become requalified in an appropriate period of time, he/she will be considered to be no longer eligible for the Journeyman Premium nor qualified to work at SONGS in his/her classification. The Journeyman Premium can be withheld for failure to pass the appropriate knowledge test. Performance problems on the job which indicate a lack of knowledge in these procedures will be dealt with through the normal disciplinary channels.
(5)	Mechanical Services Shop/SSID personnel assigned to SONGS to perform nuclear plant maintenance and repair will also be eligible to receive the Journeyman Premium if qualified. The

Journeyman Premium will be paid on the same basis as station personnel, and the smallest unit of premium paid will be for a period of one week.
D. Each employee shall be assigned his appropriate job classification and shall receive the rate of pay of that classification when performing the duties thereof, except that when an employee is temporarily assigned to work in a higher-rated job classification, he shall receive the temporary relief rate for such higher-rated classification for all hours worked therein. Said relief rate will be the lowest rate in the higher-rated classification, unless the employee's current rate of pay exceeds the lowest rate, in which case the relief rate will be the nearest wage rate above the employee’s current rate in the higher-rated classification. If an employee is temporarily assigned to perform work of a lower-rated job classification, his rate of pay shall not be changed. If an employee’s job classification is changed he will receive written notice of such change of status and the effective date thereof.
(1) It is the intent that an employee work six (6) months in each step of a step progression. In any case, where the time off from work within a six (6) month step amounts to thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or more, exclusive of time charged to vacation, such employee shall be required to remain in his present wage step for an additional period of time equivalent to the time lost.

Employees who are temporarily upgraded for periods of ten (10) or more consecutive regular work days (exclusive of days off) will receive credit on the progression ladder of the classification to which they are temporarily upgraded for each five (5) consecutive days worked in the upgraded classification. No credit will be given for less than ten (10) days. This credit will be applied when the employee is permanently upgraded to the classification.
E.	Any employee working as a leadman (defined as an employee temporarily assigned to supervise two (2) or more employees on a particular job) shall receive in addition to the rate of pay of his classification one dollar ($1.00) per hour for such time as he acts as a leadman.
Any employee temporarily assigned an upgrade to a management position shall receive in addition to the rate of pay of his/her classification one dollar and seventy-five cents ($1.75) per hour for such upgrade time.

If the Company and the Union do not agree on a wage rate for the position within five (5) days of the date the Company has proposed a rate, the rate proposed by the Company shall be in effect and the parties will continue to negotiate until a settlement is reached, with a maximum of sixty (60) days retroactivity.
H.	(1) No employee who is compelled to do jury duty shall lose any pay for the regular work time which he is compelled to lose by reason of said jury duty. As regards jury duty, such an employee shall furnish the Company with a statement from the Jury Commissioner or other officer of the Court setting forth the days on which he reported for jury duty.
a. Should jury duty pay increase from the amount in effect on January 1, 1976, the employee would be paid Company base pay while on jury duty during regular working hours less fifty percent (50%) of any such increase in jury pay.
(2)	In the event of a death in the immediate family of a regular employee, time off with pay as necessary may be allowed with the approval of supervision to make arrangements for and attend the funeral, but such paid time off shall not exceed
