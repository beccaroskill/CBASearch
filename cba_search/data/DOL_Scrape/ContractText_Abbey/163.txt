EXHIBIT 111 - A
Greetings:
This letter is designed to provide you with guidance in the deduction of dues. The text of this tetter has been reviewed and approved by the International Executive Board as an appropriate interpretive ruling under Article XIV of the United Steelworkers Constitution.
Finance
The initiation fees shall be Ten Dollars ($10.0(1), except where a higher initiation fee has been authorized.
Monthly dues for a member shall be an amount equal to 13% of said member's total earnings during the month provided that monthly dues shall not be less than $5.00 and provided further that monthly dues shall not be more than 2.5 limes the member’s average hourly earnings. An individual member shall be emitted to exoneration from the payment of dues for any month for which the member has not become entitled to five days' pay or its equivalent in wages and benefits in lieu of wages. For lump sum payments, dues shall be calculated separately by applying the 13% to such payments.
Vacation
Vacation pay should be handled in the following manner:
If a person has vacation coming and takes the vacation in the normal way. then the amount of wages and the amount of hours should be added to the amount of wages earned and the amount of hours worked for that month. For example, a person works three and one-third weeks in the month of July and takes one week vacation, then the wages for the vacation and the 40 hours should be added to the respective wages and hours worked in July.
page 10
Article Ui, Section 8 - Union Security txd Checkoff- Exhibit ill • A
On the other hand, if the person works the entire month of July and in addition is paid for three weeks vacation because he is selling the vacation back, to the Company, these totals should not be co-mingled. They should be kept separate and the vacation pay should be treated as a lump sum and multiplied limes the 1.3%. This amount would be sent in separately in addition to the regular dues calculated for wages earned in July,
Lump Sum Payments
Lump sum payments. such as grievance settlements and arbitration awards, profit sharing payments and other payments which are attributable to earnings outside the earnings period arc a part of "total earnings." but they are to be calculated separately; that is. the 1.3% is to be applied to them and the resultant figure deducted without reference to the dues maximum figure.
In the paragraphs which follow we shall assume that lump sum payments have been dealt with separately and accordingly we use the words "adjusted total earnings" to refer to all earnings other than lump sum payments which are subject to the dues calculation.
Dues Calculation Components
Dues are calculated by multiplying "adjusted total earnings" by 1.3% and comparing the result with the product of "average hourly earnings" times 2.5 (or other appropriate multiplier, if the earnings period is other than a one month period).
"Average hourly earnings" are "adjusted total earnings" divided by the hours with which they are associated. The adjusted total earnings figure consists of the total of all payments for both worked and unworked time divided by the combined totals of all hours worked and the appropriate equivalent hours for all unworked time for which payments are made and included io gross earnings. The resulting figure will be the gross average earnings or "total earnings."
The dues for the period will be the lesser of 1.3% times adjusted total earnings or average hourly earnings times the multiplier.
A different multiplier needs to be used where the earnings are for a different period. Thus, the multiplier is 1.25 where the earnings are for one-half a month. 1.1538 where earnings are on a biweekly basis, and .5769 where on a weekly basis. Examples of the use of these multipliers are attached.
page 11
Article ill. Section 8 - Union Security and Check Off - Eikibii HI - A
"The Earnings Period"
Dues may be deducted on a per pay basis using the earnings of each pay or the previous month's earnings as the base, as agreed by the International Union.
If it is elected to utilize the per pay basis, which we believe is in the best interest of our members and the employers, we suggest that you accumulate the dues until the end of the month. However, we request that you submit the dues payment no later than the ten (10) days following the last dues deduction of the month.
If you deduct on the basis of the previous month's earnings from the first pay period of the month, we request that you submit the dues payment no later than ten (10) days following the deduction.
The R-115 Form, a supply of which is enclosed, is to be completed and mailed along with your check within the same ten-day period to the designated lock bos address on the enclosed R-115 Form. The local Union financial secretary and servicing International representative are to also receive a copy of the R-l 15 Form within this ten-day period.
There will be a need for you to provide a monthly listing showing the name and employee identification number for all members for whom dues deductions wcic Kiaiiv. lugcijicr with appropriate data on hours and earnings, as well as the amount of such dues deductions.
The enclosed partial listing may be helpful in determining whether a particular payment is subject to dues deduction.
Should you have any questions or require further assistance, please contact Armenia lerovante. Comptroller of our Union at (412) 562-2330.
We appreciate your cooperation in this matter.
Sincerely yours,
James D. English

Wage Application Provisions
Section I
(a)The term "classification.’’ as used in this Agreement, means a type of work within a department and each classification shall be identified by an occupational title.
page 32
Article VI, Section I ■ Wage Application Proviiinns
(b)Tbe term "Basic Wage Rate," (DBWR/IBWR) as used in this Agreement, means the maximum hourly rate (or the corresponding term used at the local level) that is established as a result of an analysis of the job factors of a classification. For learners the term refers to the classification progression step hourly rate the employee has qualified to receive.
(e)The term "incentive" shall mean an incentive method of payment by which an employee earns one unit of payment for each unit of output.
The term "incentive rate" shall mean an incentive standard expressed in standard hours.
The term "incentive worker" shall mean an employee who has qualified to be compensated by incentive payments on a daywork-with-incentive classification which be holds.
(d)When a new classification is established in a department where daywork-with-ittccntive currently exists on operations similar to the operation under consideration (or in other situations where the patties at the local level believe that a daywork-with-incentive pay method may be appropriate under certain conditions), the Company will determine pursuant to paragraph (f) below whether the pay method on the new classification will be daywork or daywork-with-incentive.
(l)The Company will notify the Union of such determination one week in advance of the effective date of the new classification.
(2>lf it is a daywork-with-incentive classification, the employees in that classification will be paid the higher of their incentive earnings on temporary standards (established in accordance with Article Vli, Section 2), or the IBWR of that classification until such time that incentive standards are established.

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed, however, to require the Company to change an established day work classification to daywork-with-incentive.
(f) (sec Letter A-2) In determining under paragraph (d) or (e> above whether the daywork-with-incentive pay method will be used, an essential prerequisite for establishing a daywotk-with-incetitive pay method is the potential for the operator to significantly increase the output of the job through his own initiative. Today's manufacturing equipment may not provide the manual time necessary to allow employees to significantly affect the rale of product ion. of may not properly be operated at a varying pace due to product uniformity requirements, other quality considerations and/or shop floor processes. The following factors will be utilized in determining pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) above whether a daywork-wiih-incentive pay method is appropriate for the classification;
(i)	The lime accessary to perform the work can be accurately measured, and
(ii)	The work to be performed is repetitive; and
(iii)	The equipment is capable of being operated nt a variable pace; and
(iv)	Product uniformity requirements, other quality considerations, and shop floor processes will not be compromised if the equipment is operated al a variable pace: and

(c)ln cases where it is not possible to use rhe full time of a fully qualified dayworker, he will receive the established Basic Wage Rate of his classification, provided be satisfactorily performs the work that is assigned. However, if later it is possible to more fully use the time of the employee on work of his classification, consistent with reasonable effort for day workers (three miles per hour), he shall perform the added work without change in the Basic Wage Rate of the classification. It is understood that such an employee may be assigned work on another classification, for which he will be paid for the time worked either his incentive earnings, his Basic Wage Rate, or the Basic Wage Rare of that daywork classification, whichever is the highest.

(e)When an operation is being time studied for the purpose of establishing or revising an incentive standard, the job shall be completely set up and the employee shall be instructed as to all operations to be performed and methods to be used before operations are time studied for the purpose of establishing, or revising the incentive standard. The instruction will include a review of an operation description and sequence of elements. No one shall aid or instruct employees during a time study, which is being taken for the purpose of establishing or revising an incentive standard. Such studies shall be taken under normal working conditions using stock and material, which the operator can normally expect to receive.
(OThe term "regular time study practices at the local plant", referred to in Section 5 (b) above, relates to various procedures used by the Industrial Engineering Department at a particular plant for establishing and revising incentive standards for operations on incentive classifications in that plant in conformance with the
page 38
Article VI. Section 5 ■ Wage Application Provisions
provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, determination of elemental times by the use of stopwatch observation and performance rating for measurement of necessary work performed; use of other measuring devices for measurement of machine speeds, conveyor speeds, temperatures, material flow, or other such factors affecting output; and the use of applicable standard data. In addition, video recorders may be used, provided they are attended and record at real lime speed, and the real time is shown on the screen at all times during recording. It is understood that the aforementioned term "attended" means that a representative of the industrial engineering department is in the general work area of the study, and may be observing other pans of the operation. It is further understood that if this technique is employed, the videotapes used to establish or revise incentive standards will be available as necessary to explain the limes used. In the event there is a dispute between the parties, either party may use video recorder studies, stopwatch studies, or both, to argue their case.
(g)A time study audit is a study made by a Company Time Study Engineer, using a stopwatch ora video recorder, of an operation which is currently covered by an incentive standard for the purpose of determining if there have been any rearrangements of equipment or machinery, changes in method, materials, tools, equipment or machinery which affect the time per piece on existing incentive standards and to check the application of standards, allowances, tally and wage calculations.
(h)With respect to employees working on incentive operations, ii is the parties' intent that each such employee know whether or not the operation is covered by a current incentive standard and if an incentive standard is in effect, what the standard is and the method for which the incentive standard was established.
The above may be accomplished by different means in each of the plants and by different means in various departments within the same plant. However, the incentive specifications and elemental sequences shall be made readily available in the department to the Union and the employees who are working on the incentive operations.

□nd elemental sequence. Written operating procedures will be issued sufficiently in advance of the study to allow such operators to familiarize themselves with the manner its which the work is to be performed.
Bl.1.3	Elemental times shall be based on observations made by stop watch, although other measuring devices may be used io determine controlling factors such as machine speeds, conveyor speeds, temperatures, material flow, etc. Observed times for elements of manual work, including those which may be performed internally or externally in conjunction with machine or process controlled dements, will be performance rated using walking three miles per hour as normal or one hundred percent. Performance ratings will be recorded tn increments of five percent
Bl.1.4	Machine or process controlled
elemental times will be recorded as observed while running according to the operating procedures. Rheostats and controls shall be al the proper settings.
B1.2 Determining Allowed Times
BI.2.1	Machine controlled elemental times
will be levelled by applying a factor of 1,33-1/3.
B).2.2	Manually controlled elements will
be levelled io one hundred percent or normal performance.
BI.2.3	Where manual elements of work and a machine controlled element occur simultaneously, the controlling lime to be used as the elemental allowed time will be determined after times are levelled and fatigue factors applied.
Bl.2.4	Recurrent incidental work which can be measured accurately and measurable recurrent delays which
page 99
Article XV - Memoranda of Agreement, Memorandum D
are not compensable under the allowance plan contained in Article Vil of the Agreement will be determined and entered as elements, where practicable.
Bl.2.5	Where necessary, an allowance will be made, either as u percentage or as an elemental time for nonrecurrent delays which cannot be measured accurately and which are not compensable under the allowance plan, such allowance to be based upon time study observations of the operation and other operations on the same type of machine or equipment.
B 1.2.6 Data compiled by time study observations will be correlated for use as standard data, and will be applied in the final determination of Items Bl.2.1 through Bl.2.5 above. Standard data will be made up of elemental allowed limes which have been levelled, but to which fatigue factors have not been applied.
Bl.2.7	Elemental allowed times and any
allowance under Bl.2.5, above, will be totalled to arrive at a net allowed time for the operation.
B1.2.8	An operation fatigue factor determined for similar operations will he applied to arrive al a total allowed time for the operation. If such operation fatigue factor is inapplicable, an operation fatigue factor will be developed in the following manner:
Bl.2.8a	Fatigue factors determined
by "slotting", using the list of allowance bench marks attached, will be applied by element or group of similar elements.

Bl. 2.8b	For subsequent use in
setting incentive standards on similar operations, an operation fatigue factor will be computed by dividing the total time allowed in the operation for fatigue by the total of the levelled elemental times before application of the fatigue factors. In the event of a dispute concerning application of an operation fatigue factor, it will be resolved by applying the fatigue factors by element or group of similar elements.
Bl.2.9 The total allowed lime for the operation will be converted to total allowed time per one hundred units.

B2.1.2	When establishing incentive standards for pool operations, the principles set forth in Bl above, will be applied. However, if one pool operation is the limiting factor in determining the output of one or more other operations in the pool, elemental allowed times or total allowed times for operations so affected
page 101
Article XV - Memoranda of Agreement. Memorandum D
will be adjusted to reflect the extent of the limitation.
B2.2	Crew Operations
B2,2.1	A crew is a group of employees, usually carrying two or more different occupational titles, who work as a unit in producing the same production units.
B2.2.2	When establishing incentive standards for crew operations, the principles set forth in Bl, above, will be applied, with the exception of Bl.2.9, which will be applied us follows:
B2.2.2a. The total allowed time for the operation which is the limiting factor in determining the output of the crew will be converted to total allowed time per one hundred units, and will be used as the total allowed time for each of the crew operations in computing the incentive standards.

The application of the foregoing fatigue factors when lunch relief and/or personal relief is furnished is dependent upon the manner in which payment for output during such relief periods is credited. For example, if lunch and personal relief is furnished, und the operator being relieved is credited with output during the relief periods, the fatigue factors shown under "Lunch and Personal Relief Furnished" are applicable. However, if the operator being relieved does not receive credit for any output during such relief periods, the factors under “No Relief Furnished" are applicable,
It is recognized that in certain pool and crew operations, manning of the operations has been based upon members of the pool or crew furnishing relief, in which case fatigue factors shown under "Lunch and Personal Relief Furnished" are applicable.

The parties hereby agree to the following in regard to the application of Article IV, Section I (e) of the Master Agreement.
In the Russellville plant the date of December 17, 1969, will be applicable instead of April 22, 1967.
F.	ADDENDUM - PREFERENTIAL HIRING RIGHTS
Outlined below are die preferential hiring rights to which employees ore entitled under Article XII, Section 21(b) & (c) of die current Collective Bargaining Agreement and the procedures that must be followed in the exercise of these rights. Employees will be given a copy of the Procedure for Exercising Preferential Hiring Rights at the time of termination, or in the case of layoff, at the time they are laid off.
Employees Terminated Because of a Plant Closure
The preferential hiring rights set forth below are applicable only to such former employees who have not assumed the status of a retiree, accepted severance pay ora special distribution.
A,	Filing of Application
1.	A farmer employee requesting preferential hiring rights in other plants covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement will file an "application for employment" form or forms with the Labor Relations Office of the plant from which he is being terminated. He may complete the application forms in the Labor Relations Office during regular office hours or request such forms by certified mail addressed to the Labor Relations Office. A separate application may be filed within sixty calendar days of his termination for each such plant in which he is requesting employment.
2.	The application forms will be forwarded to the Labor Relations Manager of the applicable plant and will be considered for future permanent openings for which new employees are to be hired. Only those applications on file at the plant at the time the opening is available to be filled will be considered. Qualified applicants will be offered
page 113
Article XV- Memoranda ofAgreement. Memorandum F
openings in accordance with their Company service credit. Qualification requirements will be the same as those required if the applicant was being recalled from layoff at the hiring plant.
3.	Applications will be valid for a twelve month period unless canceled. Applications must be re-submitted during the twelfth month of each such period to the plant or plants in which the applicant desires to retain preferential hiring rights.
B.	Hiring Procedures
I.	When an opening is available the employment department of the plant in which the opening occurs will notify the former employee by certified mail or by telephone, (certified letter to be sent to verify contact even though he is reached by telephone) and assume responsibility for the necessary follow-up. If the former employee cannot be contacted by telephone, he will have seven working days from the dale of the certified letter in which to contact the employment department of such plant. Failure to make contact within such period will cause the former employee to forfeit his preferential hiring rights.
The former employee will be given twenty-four hours following the above-stated contact in which to notify the plant by telephone or wire of bis acceptance or rejection of the job opening.
If the former employee notifies the plant of his temporary inability toaccepl the opening because of illness or injury, the former employee will be by-passed for the current opening and be considered for future openings provided the former employee furnishes satisfactory medical evidence verifying (he disability and provided he notifies the plant promptly following recovery from the temporary disability of his availability for placement.
(a) Acceptance of Job Opening
page 114
Article XV-Memoranda of Agreement. Memorandum F
(i)	Upon acceptance of a job opening the former employee shall be informed of the arrangements for his physical examination.
Where possible, pre-cmployment physical examinations will be given in the general area of the plant being closed. The physical examination will be the same as that given to employees being recalled from layoff at the hiring plant.
(ii)	If he passes the physical examination he will be notified by telephone or telegram as «> the date and time he is to report for work. He will be granted a reasonable period of time in which lo report for work but not to exceed seven calendar days from the date of such notification.
(iiijThe former employee will be hired as a new employee without prior service credit for seniority purposes. For all other purposes he will be credited with the amount of service credit he had at the lime of his termination and, in addition, will receive credit for the amount of service credit for which he would have been eligible under Section I (h) of Article IV as if he was being recalled from layoff.
(iv)At the lime of hire he will forfeit his preferential hiring rights at other plants and his rights lo benefits under the Pension and Insurance Agreement because of his previous termination due to the plant closure, except that such prior rights shall be reinstated if he is laid off due to a reduction in force prior lo the completion of thirty calendar days' continuous service.
page 115
Article XV - Memoranda of Agreement, Memorandum F
(v) Notwithstanding Paragraph (i v) above, for sixty calendar days after hire an employee will receive a Separation Payment. Severance Award, or a Special Distribution to which the employee was eligible at the former plant, by submitting a written resignation and request.
(b)Rcfusal of Job Offer
(i) If the former employee refuses an opening in another planl, he shall forfeit his preferential hiring rights under Article Xii. Section 21. Such refusal will not prejudice his rights to benefits under the Pension and Insurance Agreement, provided he is otherwise eligible for such benefits.
Employees on Layoff with Recall Rights
The preferential hiring rights sei forth below are applicable only te employees on layoff with recall rights in case of a partial plant closure and/or other layoffs where at le«st ten percent of the total work force in a local bargaining unit is on layoff with recall rights or where it is determined there is no reasonable likelihood the employees on layoff wilt be recalled.
A.	Calculation of tbe Percentage of Employees on Layoff
I.	In the application of Article XU. Section 2) fc) the percentage of employees on layoff in a local bargaining unit with recall rights for any calendar month shall be determined by dividing the total number of such laid-off employees as of the close of business on the third Friday of the preceding month by the total work force (actual enrollment plus those on layoff with recall rights) in the bargaining unit as of such Friday.
B.	Fi ting of Application
L	A laid-off employee requesting preferential hiring rights in other plants covered by the Collective
page 116
Article XV - Memoranda of Agreement, Memorandum F
Bargaining Agreement will file an "application for employment" form or forms with the Labor Relations Office of the plant from which he was laid off. He may complete the application forms in the Labor Relations Office during regular office hours or request such forms by certified mail addressed to the Labor Relations Office.
2.	The application forms will be forwarded to the Labor Relations Manager of the applicable plant and will be considered for future permanent openings for which new employees are to be hired. Only those applications on file at the plant at the time the opening is available to be filled will be considered. Qualified applicants will be offered openings in accordance with their Company service credit. Qualification requirements will be the same as those required if the applicant was being recalled from layoff at the hiring plant.
3.	Applications wilt be valid subject to 4. below for a twelve month period unless cancelled. Applications must be resubmitted during the twelfth month of each such period to the plant or plants in which the applicant desires to retain preferential hiring rights.
4.	The Local Union President and International Union shall be notified when the plant's percentage of laid-off employees is at least ten percent or it is determined there is no reasonable likelihood the employees on layoff will be recalled. The notification should be repeated for each month in which such conditions continue to exist.
The Local Union President shall be notified each month in which applicants are eligible under Article XII. Section 21 (c) to exercise their preferential hiring rights at that plant.
The above notifications shall also be made for the first month that the above-stated conditions no longer exist.
Applications filed by employees on layoff with recall rights under the above-stated conditions shall not be considered for openings during the months in which such conditions are no longer applicable.

G.	LETTER - Family and Medical.Leave Policy
June 8. 2005
Mr, John W, Sellers
USW R/PIC Executive Vice President
Ave Gateway Center - 7th Floor
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222
Dear Mr, Sellers:
Effective February 5, 1994, eligible employees, as defined under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), are entitled to up to a total of twelve weeks of unpaid leave during any twelve-month period. FMLA leave may be taken by eligible employees for the following reasons:
I.	Birth or adoption of a child or the placement of a child for foster care;
2.	To care for a spouse, child or parent of the employee due to a serious health condition;
3.	A serious health condition of the employee.
Employees will have their own individual twelve-month periods, measured backwards from the date a requested leave would begin. The combined leave of a husband and wife who both work for the Company is limited to twelve weeks for leave due to the birth, adoption or placement of a child or to care for an ill parent (but not a parent-in-law).
The Company may require, or the employee may elect, to substitute for unpaid FMLA leave any accrued and unused paid leave, except that the Company will not require this substitution during the waiting period for A&S.
In Ihe event that such use of paid leave results in inadequate paid leave to cover scheduled facility shutdown(s). an employee will be deemed to be on voluntary unpaid vacation during such shutdowns. When paid leave is substituted, the FMLA leave period is not extended. FMLA leave runs concurrently with any substituted paid leave period. Any period during which an employee receives benefits such as A&S or workers' compensation benefits is treated as "paid leave" for purposes of
page 249
Article XV - Memoranda ofAftreement, Letter G
this Section and counted against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement.
Time on FMLA leave (other than where accrued and unused vacation is applied) will not be considered hours worked or days worked and thus will not be included in determining or calculating certain benefits, including vacation entitlement, plant-wide bonus plan or credited service calculations under applicable benefit plans (or eligibility for additional FMLA leave).
Seniority and/or Company service will accrue during FMLA leave during those periods for which paid leave has been substituted in accordance with this Section, subject to other maximum paid leave provisions under the contract or other applicable benefit plans. Seniority and/or Company service will accrue for unpaid FMLA leave in accordance with applicable unpaid personal leave of absence provisions.
Notwithstanding any contrary contract provision or provision of any employee benefit plan, the Company will continue medical coverage during Ihe period of the FMLA leave period, subject to any applicable contribution by the employee.
The Employee is required to provide the Company with nt least thirty calendar days advance written notice before FMLA leave begins if the need for the leave is foreseeable. If the leave is not foreseeable, the employee, is required ;0 gi™ notice a.-, soon as practicable.
The Company will require medical certification of a need for leave under this Policy. In addition the Company has the right to require a second opinion at Ihe Company’s expense. If the second opinion conflicts with the initial certification, a third opinion, at the Company's expense, may be sought, which shall be final and binding. The third health care provider must be designated or approved jointly by ihe employer and the employee after a good faith effort by both parties to agree on the provider. Failure to provide certification shall cause any leave taken to be treated as called for under the Attendance Program.
Employees may request FMLA leave for time periods other than consecutive weeks when medically necessary or with Ihe Company's agreement in the case of the birth, adoption or foster placement of a child. In these circumstances, the Company may assign the employee to another position (and. for employees represented by a collective bargaining agent, a job either inside or outside of Ihe bargaining unit) and/or adjust the employee’s schedule without unduly disrupting the employer's operations (subject to the approval of the health care provider) to better accommodate the leave request or eliminate the need for using FMLA leave.
page 250
Article XV - Memoranda of Agreement. Letter G
• • •
The Company may adopt reasonable procedures in accordance with the FMLA. including leave Tor planned medical treatment, periodic status reports (no more often than every 30 days, at the Company’s expense) and recertification of medical conditions while on leave. An employee's failure to follow these procedures or to fulfill his or her other obligations under this Section, including a failure to return to work as scheduled, will subject the employee to discipline, up to and including term mat ion.
To accommodate an employee's FMLA leave request the Company may temporarily transfer another employee. The temporarily transferred employee may be displaced to reinstate the employee returning from FMLA leave.
As a condition of returning lo work, an employee who has taken leave due to his/her own serious health condition must provide a certificate of fitness to return to his/her regular job.
An employee reluming from FMLA leave will be reinslated to the same or an equivalent position. consistent with seniority as permitted by the FMLA. However, employees on FMLA leave have no greater right to reinstatement to any position than if they had remained on active status.
Employees who choose nor to return to employment from leave will have their health insurance terminated and will be required to repay any health insurance premium paid on their behalf during any period of unpaid leave in accordance wilh applicable regulations.
The provisions of this Section are in response lo the federal FMLA. The Company shall grunt an employee any greater benefits provided under any state or local law. provided the employee satisfies all eligibility and other requirements of the applicable state law.
The Company shall have no obligation lo provide any medical or other confidential information to any person to the extent the Company deems such information to be confidential, unless the Company is presented with a valid release from the etnployee(s) whose records arc sought.

Except as otherwise provided in this Letter Agreement, the parlies' Collective Bargaining Agreement shall apply to Supplemental Workers in all respects.
I.	The number of Supplemental Workers employed al each plant shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the number of fulllime Master bargaining unit employees on the active payroll at that ptant ("Cap Number"). This Cap Number may change from time to time as the number of fulltime bargaining unit employees on the active payroll changes. The number of Supplemental Workers shall be calculated on a fulltime equivalency basis by dividing the total number of hours worked by Supplemental Workers in a two-week period by eighty (80) hours at plants working eight-hour shifts, or by eighty-four (84) hours at plants working twelve-hour shifts.
2.	Upon hiring, a Supplemental Worker shall have the same status as a probationary employee until such time as the Supplemental Worker completes one thousand (I .(XX)) hours worked, after which the Supplemental Worker shall be eligible to use the parties’ grievance and arbitration procedures to the same extent as a regular fulltime employee,
3.	Article IV will not apply to Supplemental Workers in any respect, including without limitation the provisions on seniority for

If a Supplemental Worker is not offered regular fulltime employment within this five year period, he shall be placed on a preferential hiring list at that plant for a period of one year or until an offer of regular fulltime employment is made, whichever comes first.
10.	If a Supplemental Worker is hired as a regular fulltime employee, his/her hours worked as a Supplemental Worker will be used to establish an adjusted hire date for benefit and seniority purposes.
