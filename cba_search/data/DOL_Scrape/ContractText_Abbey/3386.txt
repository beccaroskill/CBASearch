RECOGNITION AND BARGAINING UNIT
A.	The Authority recognizes the Union as the exclusive representative for the purpose of collective bargaining, with respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment and working conditions, for all employees of the Authority within the bargaining unit defined in Paragraph D of this Article.
B.	The parties agree that the term "employee" wherever used herein, whether singular or plural, means and applies only to those employees of the Authority included within said bargaining unit, and that this Agreement covers only said employees. The term "Authority" as used in this contract, refers to the LACMTA when it is acting in its capacity as a transit operator and exercising specific powers, duties, or rights to which the Authority succeeded as a result of the abolition of the SCRTD, pursuant to P.U.C.§J§130051.13. and 130051.16.
This contract applies only to the Authority's operating organizational unit, and only when the Authority is acting as a transit operator and not in any other capacity.
C.	The Authority and the Union agree that no employee shall be discriminated against on account of Union membership, or for any other unlawful reason. This Section of the Agreement shall not be construed to conflict with the employee's qualification provisions appearing elsewhere in this Agreement.
D.	The bargaining unit shall comprise all of the Authority's Non-Operating employees included within the classifications set forth in Article 1 of this Agreement.
12
CONTINUITY OF SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC
A.	It is recognized that the parties are engaged in rendering a public service and that they will comply with all applicable valid rules, regulations and laws of the governmental authorities; therefore, the parties contract that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to conflict or be inconsistent or incompatible with such rules, regulations or laws. To the extent that any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement shall be in conflict, inconsistent or incompatible with any such rules, regulations or laws presently in effect or to be enacted during the terms of this Agreement, they shall be void and invalid, but all other terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Such invalid terms and provisions will be reconsidered and renegotiated by the parties within seven (7) days of the effective date of any such rules, regulations or laws.
B.	During the term of this Agreement, neither the Union nor its members shall call or engage in any strike. The Authority will not require employees covered by this labor Agreement to cross a picket line which has been legally established by a labor union, whether such picket line is on Authority property or elsewhere.
C.	During the term of this Agreement, the Authority shall not cause or permit any lockout of any of its employees.
13
AUTHORITY PREROGATIVES/MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
A.	All matters pertaining to the management of operation, including the type and kind of service to be rendered to the public, the equipment used, the maintenance of discipline and efficiency, the hire, promotion and transfer of employees, and their discharge or discipline for proper cause, are the prerogatives of the Authority, subject to such limitations thereon as are set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.
B.	The Union recognizes that willful infractions of the Authority's Rules and Regulations that are necessary for efficient operation will constitute cause for disciplinary action. No rules or regulations at any time promulgated or enforced by the Authority shall be valid if they violate any provisions elsewhere set forth in this Agreement.
C.	The Authority's exercise of any prerogatives of this Agreement may be made the subject of a grievance or dispute.

The Authority shall determine if and when an ATU-represented employee is assigned to take the place of a supervisor. If the Authority chooses to so assign an ATU-represented employee, it will assign an employee who is working as a Leader on the shift in question. When so assigned, the employee (i.e., the Leader, Relief Leader or Temporary Leader) shall receive an additional five percent (5%) over the regular Leader rate of pay.

In addition to the basic rates shown in Article 1 of this Agreement, a shift differential of 3% of the regular rate of pay shall be paid to employees working assignments defined as “Second Shift”, and 5% of the regular rate of pay shall be paid to those working assignments defined as “Third Shift”.
Shift differentials will be subject to the overtime provisions of Article 3.
Employees who are required to work overtime before the beginning of, or at the end of their shift at a division or location that has regularly scheduled second and/or third shifts, will be paid the shift differential, if any, that is paid to other employees normally working those hours. There will, however, be no reduction in shift differential for an employee on the third shift who works over into the first shift.

OVERTIME
SECTION A	- REGULAR OVERTIME PROVISION
All employees shall be paid one and one-half (I A) times their straight time hours for all work they perform in excess of eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week, at their regular straight time hourly rate of pay.
SECTION B	- WORK ON DAYS OFF
All employees who complete their assignment when working on their regular or assigned days off shall be paid one and one-half (I A) times their straight time hours worked, with a minimum allowance of twelve (12) straight time hours, at their regular straight time hourly rate of pay provided the employee works their regularly scheduled five (5) day forty (40) hour work week.
All employees not completing their assignment when working on their regular or assigned day off shall be paid one and one-half (1A) times their straight time hours worked at their regular straight time hourly rate of pay provided the employee works their regularly scheduled five (5) day forty (40) hour work week.
No employee will be required to work on that employee's regular day off unless there are substantial abnormalities in service requirements; provided, however, this requirement for work will be mutually agreed to in advance between the Authority and the Union and the twelve (12) hour minimum allowance as referred to in the first paragraph of this section shall remain in effect, regardless of whether the employee completes his/her five (5) day, forty (40) hour work week.
SECTION C	- PROVISIONS AGAINST PYRAMIDING
Where more than one overtime provision is involved, only that provision which creates the greatest compensation will apply.
SECTION D	- EMERGENCY WORK ON DAYS OFF
An emergency work on days off roster will be established for the Facilities Maintenance Department at each shake-up. Employees who sign up are indicating that they will respond when called for emergency work. When an emergency occurs, the Authority will call workers on this roster by seniority order to work the emergency. If no employee is available or there is no
22
employee on the roster who is within the job classification to do the emergency work, the Authority is free to contract out the emergency work.
SECTION E	- COMPENSATORY TIME OFF (CTO)
The Authority will offer a program for compensatory time off (CTO) which shall be available for overtime worked.
The employee shall have the right, on a voluntary basis, to participate in the CTO program.
CTO shall be earned at the rate of one and one-half hours of CTO for each hour of overtime worked within the meaning of this Article. For example, a person who works two overtime hours would earn three hours of CTO. All shift and skill differential payments shall be paid to the employee in the pay period the overtime is worked and the CTO time is credited.
The employee shall request that he/she receive CTO instead of overtime pay at the time the employee performs the overtime work in question. The request shall be in writing submitted to the employee’s supervisor.
The maximum amount of CTO that may be earned during the twelve (12) month period between June 1 and May 31 of a given year is eighty (80) hours. If an employee has used the maximum amount of CTO during the twelve (12) month period, any overtime will automatically be paid to the employee consistent with the Authority’s present payroll practices.
If an employee has CTO time available to take off, he/she may request a particular day off. The employee shall give his/her supervisor at least twenty-four (24) hours notice of a request to use CTO. On days except Saturday or Sunday, one person per classification per work location per shift may take CTO. In addition, if there is an open vacation day or floating holiday available on any day, then CTO may be taken. Otherwise, CTO can only be taken with permission of the supervisor. For purposes of this section, “classification” is as defined in Article 10 Section B. A supervisor’s grant of a CTO day off cannot be changed, except with agreement of the employee. Requests to use CTO will be decided on a “first come, first serve” basis. Any current specific practice for allowance of CTO can continue but either party can cancel that practice on thirty days notice and thereafter this provision will apply.
The employee shall have the right, at any time, to cash out any accrued, unused CTO. The employee shall receive his/her base rate of pay for each hour of CTO that is cashed out.
All accrued CTO must be taken by the employee on or before May 31 of each year. Any accrued, unused CTO as of May 31 will be paid to the employee with the second paycheck in June.
23
ARTICLE 4
DISTRIBUTION OF OVERTIME
SECTION A	- ROTATING ROSTER
Overtime beyond the normal working periods shall be distributed equitably among qualified employees in their respective classifications when practicable on a rotation basis. Failure of an employee to accept overtime when offered will have the same effect as if that employee had worked as far as his/her turn in rotation is concerned.
For distribution of overtime worked by an employee on their day off, an individual seven (7) day rotating roster will be maintained for each shift. The individual rosters (one for each day of the week) will list all employees by classification and shift in seniority order. Employees desiring to work on their days off must sign up at least one (1) hour prior to the end of the shift preceding their days off. Failure to do so shall have the same effect as refusing overtime work. Employees selected to work overtime shall be posted no later than thirty (30) minutes before the end of their last regular shift before their scheduled days off. Complete seniority lists for each classification along with the overtime rosters will be posted at each location/division.
When a known vacancy (caused by an employee on vacation, absent, etc.) is to be filled by overtime, it shall be filled, if possible, by an employee on the same shift on his/her regular days off. This method shall also apply to scheduled overtime. Employee is to be notified as soon as is practical in advance of the extra day to work. This shall not prohibit employee from working overtime on an adjacent shift where requirement is not known in sufficient time to comply with the above, or when employee on the same shift is not available.
SECTION B	- PROTECTION OF SCHEDULE SHIFT DUTIES
No mechanic will be displaced from his/her shift duties by another mechanic who has been held over, or called in to fill a vacancy in the Utility or Service Attendant group.
SECTION C	- SELECTING EMPLOYEES FOR OVERTIME WORK
Shop Stewards, when available, will conduct the selection of employees to participate in overtime work that is required by the Authority.

SECTION B	- HOLIDAY WORK
The Authority shall determine the number of employees who shall work on holidays in each job classification. Employees at each location may bid for such holiday work on an ATU seniority and rotating basis, giving preference to the employee who would normally work on that day. In the event an insufficient number of employees bid for such work at their respective locations, the Authority shall select employees from the bottom of the ATU Seniority List in such job classifications to complete the necessary quota. Bids are to be posted a minimum of eleven (11) calendar days prior to the holiday and bidding shall be completed a minimum of seven (7) calendar days prior to the holiday.
SECTION C	- NORMAL BIDDING CYCLE

Assuming an adequate number of qualified applicants are available, 15% of the Mechanic positions at each location will be Master Mechanic positions. The MTA and ATU acknowledge that it will take several years for full implementation of the Master Mechanic positions. As per the applicable provisions of this agreement Master Mechanics will have Leaders and Regular Relief Leaders.
After the close of bidding, each Division Manager or designee shall meet with the Shop Steward for his/her division. The Division Manager shall determine the number of Master Mechanics necessary to meet the above-referenced minimum staffing requirements. The Shop Steward shall provide the Department Manager with the names of the Master Mechanics to be drafted pursuant to this procedure.
Bidding will commence during the first week of October and April, and will be completed no later than November 15 and May 15, respectively. The effective date shall be the first Sunday in December and June. The overtime provisions and the consecutive day off provisions of this Agreement shall not apply to employees in the rescheduling of their shifts.
Bids covering positions normally assigned to day inspection work will be identified as inspection assignments. An employee who bids an inspection assignment may perform other equipment maintenance work when no inspection work is available for that employee, except for Rail. (Rail Inspections are handled according to Article 43).
In the event an employee is not available to bid, or does not bid, when it is time to do so, the Union Steward shall bid for such employee an assignment as close as possible to that presently being held.
Shop Stewards shall work the day shift with Saturday and Sunday off. These positions will not be listed on the bid sheets; however, Stewards will be permitted to exercise their ATU seniority in the selection of work assignments.
29
SECTION D - BIDDING ON LOWER LEVEL ASSIGNMENTS
Employees will not be permitted to voluntarily bid to a lower classification except in meritorious cases and when mutually agreed upon by the Authority and the Union. It is understood that this section shall not apply to employees who have received benefits pursuant to Labor Code Section 139.5.
SECTION E - COPY OF SHAKE-UP BIDS TO UNION
A copy of each completed shake-up bid will be furnished to the Union as soon as practicable after completion of bid.
SECTION F - RETURNING FROM INDEFINITE LEAVE
In the event an employee returns to work in the same shake-up period during which the employee was placed on indefinite leave, he/she will be placed on the same shift with the same days off as held at the time of the commencement of disability.
In the event an employee returns to work after a subsequent shake-up has been held, such employee will be allowed to bid into the same division with the shift and days off equal to that which the employee's ATU seniority would have permitted had the employee been present to bid at such subsequent shake-up.
SECTION G - REMOVAL OF EMPLOYEES FROM SECTION
Employees will be removed from their section by inverse ATU seniority if there are no volunteers.
SECTION H - REPORTING LOCATION

30
SECTION J	- WARRANTY EQUIPMENT MECHANICS
Warranty Equipment Mechanics (WEM) will bid system wide within their classification, once per year, to be effective in June. WEMs bidding to a section where they have not worked before, will serve a 120-day trial period in that section. If at anytime during the trial period the employee is disqualified, the employee will return to their former section. The disqualified employee is free to grieve the matter. Such grievance will be decided by the Promotion Review Panel.
If the vacancy is to be filled, management will first seek volunteers using the prebid process and if no one volunteers, Article 7, Section G, will apply. When applying the terms of Article 7, Section G, a WEM cannot be forced into a section they were disqualified from.
Vacancies, which occur between shake-ups, shall be filled pursuant to Article 8.
31
ARTICLE 8
VACANCIES AND NEW POSITIONS
Qualifications being equal, the Authority agrees that it shall fill all vacancies and new positions on an ATU seniority basis, subject to an employee's right to present, through the grievance procedure, any evidence the employee may have to show that he/she has been unjustly discriminated against. The Authority, however, will notify the Union and discuss the bids with the Union representatives before the vacancy is filled. The procedure of filling such vacancies shall be as outlined below:
SECTION A - PRE-BID NOTICES
Employees desiring to change work locations may advise their department head of their desire on a prescribed pre-bid notice, in quadruplicate. One copy will be forwarded to the Department, one to the Union, one to the employee's file, and one to the employee. Such notice shall state the employee's name, badge number, ATU seniority date, classification, present location and location to which he/she desires to move. When a vacancy or new position occurs, the Authority will advise the Union business representative. The Authority and the Union representative will confer to consider applicable pre-bid notice. If there is more than one pre-bid on file, qualification and ATU seniority will govern the selection. If an employee is moved as a result of a pre-bid, all other pre-bids he/she may have on file will be nullified.
Employees accepting a pre-bid may not pre-bid again for a period of one hundred twenty (120) consecutive days.
New employees will not be permitted to change Divisions by pre-bidding prior to the expiration of their probationary period. The acceptance or rejection of a transfer as a result of a pre-bid must be submitted in writing in duplicate; one copy to the Authority and one copy to the Union.
Employees forced to transfer from their division, for operational needs, will have a onetime priority bid (by seniority order) to return to that division when an opening exists in the applicable classification. Then, existing pre-bids will be exercised to fill the remaining vacancies. This does not apply to employees not identified for transfer who volunteer to move or probationary employees at the affected division.
Warranty Equipment Mechanics (WEM) who prebid to a section where they have not worked before will serve a 120-day trial period in that section. If at anytime during the trial period the employee is disqualified, the employee will return to their former section.
32
The disqualified employee is free to grieve the matter. Such grievance will be decided by the Promotion Review Panel.
If the vacancy is to be filled, management will first seek volunteers using the prebid process and if no one volunteers, Article 7, Section G, will apply. When applying the terms of Article 7, Section G, a WEM cannot be forced into a section they were disqualified from.
SECTION B	- POSTING BIDS
If the vacant position is not filled by the pre-bid process above, the vacancy shall be posted for bid. The vacancy will be posted for four (4) working days on all bulletin boards throughout the Authority. A copy of such notice shall be furnished to the Union. All vacancies or new positions so posted shall be filled within six (6) calendar days from the close of the posting period, provided a qualified employee applies. In selecting the qualified applicant as a result of the above posting, the appointing department shall make the selection from qualified applicants in the following sequence:
Group 1. ATU employees within the department (as defined in Article 15). If there is a qualified applicant from the ATU-represented employees within the department which has the vacancy, the Authority must select the qualified applicant from this group with the highest ATU seniority.
Group 2. ATU employees in other departments. If there is no qualified applicant in Group 1, and there is a qualified applicant from the ATU-represented employees in the other departments, the Authority must select the qualified applicant with the highest ATU seniority.
Group 3. Other MTA employees. If there is no qualified applicant in Groups 1 and 2, above, the Authority may select qualified applicants who are not represented by the ATU.
Awards for all jobs posted will be placed on bulletin boards for four (4) working days.
SECTION C	- HIRING OF OUTSIDE APPLICANTS
If no qualified employee within the MTA applies, the Authority may advertise the vacancy to outside applicants.
For the duration of this Agreement, the Authority will not employ persons from outside the Authority for positions of Mechanic "C" if there are any employees classified as Utility "A", Utility "B", or Service Attendant who are qualified to perform the duties of Mechanic "C".
33
In the event there are no employees who have the necessary qualifications, the Authority may hire new Mechanic "C's" from outside the Authority. The Authority will not hire Laborer “B’s” from outside the bargaining unit.
This in no way restricts the employment of qualified Mechanic "A's" or "B's" by the Authority.
SECTION D	- REGIONAL REBUILD CENTER
When positions regularly assigned to a rate above the base rate become open for assignment at the Regional Rebuild Center, they will be posted for bid at the Regional Rebuild Center only. In the event no qualified employee applies for the vacancy, the procedure described in Section B of this Article will be followed. Position will be awarded to the qualified employee. Where qualifications are equal, ATU seniority shall govern.
SECTION E	- TEMPORARY VACANCIES
Notice of temporary vacancies shall not be posted provided it is understood that the term "temporary vacancy" refers to a vacancy caused by illness or injury or brief leave of absence, which would not exceed a period of ninety (90) days.
1.	If it is determined that additional time is required on temporary vacancy, such extension will be by mutual agreement between the Union representative and the Authority.
2.	a) If it is determined that the vacancy is to exceed ninety (90) days, the vacancy will then be open for bid, as provided above.
b) If a surplus exists upon the return of an employee from a leave of absence in excess of ninety (90) days, the least senior employee in the classification within that division shall be the employee displaced.
SECTION F - TRAINING PROGRAMS
The Authority has established a training program for employees in the ATU bargaining unit who desire to avail themselves of possible advancement to a higher classification.
The Authority will conduct two (2) classes during the term of this Agreement. Twelve students and two alternates will be selected for each class. The alternates will be available to begin the class in the event that one or two of the twelve selected students is not able to begin the class. A class will begin at least every eighteen months.
34
Such class(es) will begin concurrently with a shakeup, or such other dates as may be mutually agreed upon. The program will be offered to afford an opportunity for all employees.
Applicants for the program will be tested and interviewed and must demonstrate adequate ability to perform basic arithmetic, (including decimals and fractions), to read and follow work instructions and to comprehend mechanical systems. Applicants must have a good work record for the last three (3) years (or their period of employment, if less than three (3) years), including good attendance and punctuality, getting along with fellow employees, giving full attention to duties and a good driving record as confirmed by the D.M.V. All applicants must be and remain physically qualified to perform the duties of the higher classification for which the training is given. Qualified applicants will be assigned to training in ATU seniority order. Employees may be disqualified from the program if they are not demonstrating the new skills. Disqualifications from the program will be discussed with the ATU before any action is taken. Such disqualification would be subject to the grievance procedure but not to the arbitration procedure. Trainees will receive a written evaluation by the instructor or supervisor, at least, every two months. Evaluations are not subject to grievance or arbitration.
Applications will be reviewed and copies will be forwarded to the Union, along with the final selection of candidates. The Authority agrees to discuss these selections with the Union wherever a question may exist.
The Mechanic C training program is being increased to eighteen months. The training will include after work classroom training which the employee completes on their own time (not to exceed 240 classroom hours). The training will cover all major bus mechanical systems. Upon completion of the training program trainees will bid locations available by seniority. (Reference side letter #2000-01 attached to this CBA.)
The promotion review panel, (referenced in a side letter attached to this CBA) may not be used by employees who have completed the Mechanic C training program until they have been at 100% of the Mechanic C rate for at least one year.
Commencing with class number sixteen (16) the minimum rate of pay for classroom graduates will be eighty-five percent (85%) of Mechanic "C" rate for all "on-the -job" training time, provided that this paragraph of Article 8, Section F shall not be applied so as to reduce the pay rate of any employee.
After successful completion of "on-the-job" training, employees will remain on day shift, Monday through Friday, until the next shake-up.
While driving tow trucks, Utility/Service Attendant trainees will be paid the Mechanic "C" rate of pay.
35
SECTION G - PROMOTION
The Union shall have the right to appeal refusals of promotions to the Director of Maintenance and to the Chief Labor Relations Officer or his/her designee, whose decision will be final.
Upon request, an unsuccessful applicant for promotion shall have the right to be advised of his/her area(s) of needed improvement on the promotional test by a representative from the appointing department, who will advise the employee of suggested study materials and methods for improvement.
See side letter #2000-02 regarding the creation of Promotion Review Panel.
36
ARTICLE 9
TEMPORARY TRANSFERS
When an employee is transferred temporarily to a higher rated classification, that employee shall be paid at the regular rate of pay for the classification to which he/she has been temporarily transferred for each hour worked on the higher rated classification. If the temporary transfer is to a lower rated classification, the employee shall retain the original pay rate while filling such temporary vacancy.
An employee shall retain seniority in the former position while filling such temporary vacancy. If an employee fills a higher rated classification for ninety (90) consecutive work days, excluding absences on account of sickness, vacations, etc., such employee shall be considered as having qualified for such higher rate on a permanent basis. This shall not apply to a pre-bid move or a low-seniority forced move to another location.
37
ARTICLE 10
LAYOFFS
SECTION A - ORDER OF DISPLACEMENT
In the event of layoff in any of the Maintenance Departments, the employee with the least ATU seniority within the classification being reduced shall be the first to be displaced; however, after such employee has been displaced in his/her respective classification, such employee shall have the right to exercise his/her ATU seniority anywhere else where the employee is qualified.
SECTION B - CLASSIFICATION
For the purpose of this rule, the term "classification" refers to job classification as defined in Article 1 of this Agreement with the following exceptions:
1.	Mechanics shall be one classification.
2.	Property Maintainers shall be one classification.
3.	Utility "A”, "B" and Service Attendant shall be one classification.
4.	Road Janitor, Roving Janitor and Laborer "A" & “B” shall be one classification.
SECTION C - RATES OF PAY WHEN DISPLACING TO LOWER CLASSIFICATION
Senior employees within a classification displacing a junior employee within the same classification shall not have their rates reduced.
Employees in higher classifications displacing employees in lower classifications by the exercising of ATU seniority shall receive the rate of pay for the lower classification.
SECTION D - RIGHT OF QUALIFICATION AND RIGHT TO DISPLACE IN DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS
An employee promoted, changing location, or exercising seniority as a result of reduction of forces shall be considered to have qualified for such job if the Authority allows said employee to remain in the new job for ninety (90) days.
38
If the employee is displaced and unable to displace in his/her own classification, he/she shall have the right to displace in another classification in which he/she is qualified.
SECTION E - PROTECTION OF SENIORITY
Employees laid off or furloughed shall hold all ATU seniority rights for a period of twenty-four (24) months following layoff or furlough.
SECTION F - DETERMINING QUALIFICATIONS
The Authority will make every possible effort to utilize employees in the Maintenance Departments who are laid off or who are no longer required in their present occupation and location. In order to accomplish this, the Authority and Union will confer, when it is known that such layoff is imminent, for the purpose of determining if employees to be displaced are qualified to perform work in other classifications in Maintenance Departments. When mutual agreement is reached between the Authority and Union that employees involved are qualified for such other work, in another Maintenance Department, such employees will be permitted to displace the junior employees in the classification agreed upon as above. The junior employees being displaced may in turn exercise their full right of ATU seniority choice under this Agreement.
SECTION G - REINSTATEMENT

46
ARTICLE 13
LEADERS
SECTION A - DUTIES
A Leader directs an employee group assigned to his/her responsibility and need not be concerned with the work of any employee not in that Leader's group.
It is the Leader's responsibility to direct the employees in the progress of their work under the supervision of his/her immediate supervisor with whom he/she shall consult in all matters affecting such work.
A Leader has the same responsibility as all employees to report any circumstances affecting the safety of other employees or Authority property and shall exercise best efforts to assure that the employees he/she leads work safely at all times.
SECTION B - QUALIFICATIONS AND SELECTION
Seniority of equally qualified employees shall be the deciding factor in the promotion of an employee to a Leader or a regular Relief Leader position. This shall also apply to the selection of Temporary Leaders.
SECTION C - AWARD OF POSITION
LEADER:
This job is awarded to an individual on a Job Bid according to qualifications and/or seniority. The employee so awarded will retain the title of "Leader" until he/she voluntarily surrenders the job or is removed for cause, and will receive one dollar ($1.00) per hour additional pay for all time worked.
RELIEF LEADER:
This job is awarded to an individual on a Job Bid according to qualifications and/or seniority. As in the case of the "Leader", this person will retain the title of "Relief Leader" on the same basis as stated above. He/she is paid one dollar ($1.00) per hour additional only when acting as "Leader."
NEITHER THE "LEADER" NOR "RELIEF LEADER" JOBS MAY BE TAKEN WITH AN INDIVIDUAL WHO TRANSFERS FROM ONE DIVISION TO ANOTHER.
47
To keep the position of "Leader" and "Relief Leader" those employees must always bid the "Leader" and "Relief Leader" slots that are posted on the bid sheets. Failure on the part of the individual who has that title to bid that spot will indicate that the individual wishes to give up the position. An individual may also voluntarily give up the position between shake-ups at any time if the employee should so desire. In the event a "Leader" or "Relief Leader" voluntarily surrenders the position at a time other than at the end of a shake-up, the person surrendering the position will assume the days off and shift of his/her successor until the end of that shake-up period. In either of these cases, the position will be promptly posted for bid at the Division affected.
Once a "Leader" or "Relief Leader" is awarded the job, that employee may bid any "Leader" or "Relief Leader" (whichever position is applicable) position that is open on the bid sheets which his/her seniority (as defined in Article 15) will permit, regardless of which shift he/she may have been on when he/she first attained the position.
Leaders in Facility Maintenance can bump each other by seniority if they are qualified to do the job in the section they are bumping into. Leaders at the Regional Rebuild Center (RRC) can bump another leader in the various sections by seniority if they are qualified to do the job in the section they are bumping into.
A "Leader" receives one dollar ($1.00) per hour additional at all times because he/she holds the title of "Leader." A "Relief Leader", however, receives this one dollar ($1.00) only when he/she acts as the "Leader", which is generally when the "Leader" is absent (days off, sick leave, vacations, etc.).
A "Relief Leader" will always act in the "Leader" capacity on the normal days off of the "Leader" - EVEN IF THE "LEADER" IS BROUGHT IN TO WORK ON OVERTIME ON THOSE DAYS. A "Relief Leader" will also act in the "Leader" capacity when the regular "Leader" is taking the place of an absent Supervisor.
The Leader may be asked to work overtime to perform Leader duties. Any such overtime will be counted as overtime worked on the regular overtime roster.
SECTION D - NUMBER OF LEADERS
Unless there is a reduction in the number of employees in the bargaining unit, it is agreed that during the term of this Agreement, there shall be no reduction in the number of "Leaders" and "Relief Leaders" from that in effect on August 25, 1979. If there is a reduction in the number of employees in the bargaining unit, the number of "Leaders" and "Relief Leaders" will be determined by maintaining the same ratio of "Leaders" to employees that existed in the unit on August 25, 1979.
48
ARTICLE 14
PROBATIONARY PERIOD
SECTION A-LENGTH:
A new employee shall serve a probationary period of one hundred twenty (120) days. However, in the Rail Divisions, if the standard orientation training for the employee’s position includes four hundred (400) hours or more of formal instruction, the probationary period shall be one hundred eighty (180) days, or sixty (60) days after completion of the formal instruction, whichever is shorter. After qualifying for the new position, such employee shall then be given Authority seniority as of date of employment.
SECTION B - FALSIFICATION OF RECORDS
It is understood, however, that evidence of falsification of application for employment shall subject the employee to removal from service, if such evidence is discovered within twelve (12) months of date of employment. If such falsification is discovered after the expiration of the employee’s probationary period, the employee shall have the right of investigation and hearing as provided in Article 19 and 20 of this Agreement.
SECTION C - ORIENTATION PROGRAM
New employees shall receive orientation training which shall include approximately one (1) hour of instruction consisting of both Union and Authority presentations on discipline, the Maintenance Guidebook and this Agreement.

50
examination does not determine date and time such physical was made, the order of position on the seniority list for that date will be in alphabetical order.
SECTION F	- BLENDING
If work is transferred to or integrated with work in another department or division, employees may follow the work by seniority choice and will have their ATU seniority blended with seniority in the department or division to which the work is transferred. The number of employees permitted to transfer will be the number required to perform the additional work in the department after the transfer or integration is completed.
SECTION G	- PROMOTIONS
Any employee promoted into another classification which is covered by this agreement shall serve a one hundred and twenty (120) day trial period. At any time during this period, the employee may return or be returned to his/her former classification and position/Division. This provision does not apply to promotion within the following classifications: Mechanic (C to B or B to A), Property Maintainer (C to B or B to A) and Laborer (B to A). In addition, this provision does not apply to an employee who is promoted into a new classification after successfully completing an Authority approved training program.
Any employee covered by the terms of this Agreement who is promoted to a position not included within the scope of this Agreement shall, within one hundred eighty (180) days of such promotion, determine if he/she shall continue on such promotion or return to his/her previous job. In the event that the member has continued his/her membership in good standing in the Union, he/she shall be permitted to return to his/her former position without loss of ATU seniority. An employee who elects to remain in such new position or fails to continue his/her membership in good standing shall forfeit all ATU seniority. Provided further, that any employee who is promoted a second time will immediately forfeit all ATU seniority.

#2000-02 - PROMOTION REVIEW PANEL
The parties agree to establish a Mechanic Promotion Review Panel. The purpose of the panel is to review and resolve disputes regarding Mechanic promotions and Warranty Equipment Mechanic disqualifications (Mechanic C to Mechanic B, and Mechanic B to Mechanic A Leaders and Relief Leaders and WEM and WEM Leaders). This will be the only issue before the panel.
The panel will have three members; one from the Maintenance Department, one from the ATU and a third party chosen by the parties will serve as the third party neutral member. The parties have determined that Mr. Lou Zigman will be the third party, if he agrees.
Promotion from Mechanic C to Mechanic B, and from Mechanic B to Mechanic A will be based on the employee’s Ability, Attitude, and Attendance. The Division Manager prior to the panel meeting will judge these criteria and will verify the employee’s ability, attitude and attendance within the context of all classification tasks assigned. Seniority of equally qualified employees shall be the deciding factor in the promotion of an employee to a Leader or a regular Relief Leader position. This shall also apply to the selection of Temporary Leaders.
The panel will meet three times a year and review WEM disqualifications and promotion denials which have been processed through the first level and informal meeting steps of the revised grievance procedure. The meetings will be held at the Regional Rebuild Center and will be scheduled during the second week of February, June and October.
The employee and the Division Manager will make presentations to the panel. The panel may ask questions, request written documentation and may have the employee perform task demonstrations. After the presentations, the panel will confer and issue its decision. The decision of the panel will be final and binding on both parties.
The Maintenance Department and the ATU will share the reasonable costs of the neutral panel member if any.
Before any Mechanic C or Mechanic B may use the Promotion Review Panel, they must have one-year experience at MTA in the classification. This side letter is not intended to impact in any way the employee’s or the Authority’s return rights under Article 15 Section G of the CBA.
This side letter will expire concurrent with the CBA, unless otherwise extended by the parties.
