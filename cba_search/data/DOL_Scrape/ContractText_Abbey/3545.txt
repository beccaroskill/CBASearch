ARTICLE 7
Seniority
Section 7-1. Definition. Seniority is an employee's length of continuous service with the County, dating from his or her last date of hire and upon completion of the probationary period. Employees with the same date of hire shall have seniority standing among themselves based upon the chronological order in which they applied for employment. Applications will be time and date stamped when submitted.
Section 7-2, Probationary Employees. A new employee shall be considered a probationary employee for six (6) months after which seniority shall date back to the date of hire. During such probationary period, a probationary employee shall not have seniority and may be laid off, discharged, or otherwise terminated by the County and such action shall not be subject to the grievance procedure of this agreement. If deemed necessary and approved by a department director, an employee's probationary period may be extended for a period not to exceed three (3) additional months. An employee and the Union will be notified in writing of the decision to extend the probationary period prior to the end of the original six (6) months. During such time, an employee will not be considered "permanent" or be eligible for any benefits afforded permanent employees.
All Employees in clerical positions (class code beginning with a six (6), e.g. 6000 series) covered by this agreement who are hired in a trainee status will be required to obtain the education/experience/credentials that will allow them to meet the advertised minimum qualifications of the position prior to beginning the initial probationary period.
Employees who receive a promotion, or who transfer to a different classification, shall be on probation in that classification for a period of three (3) months after which, if they are not retained, they shall be returned to their former classification if it exists and there is a vacancy available. The position from which the employee has been promoted or transferred will not be permanently filled LIUCBAMANAGEMENT2013/2016 updated 8/25/14

for three (3) months unless operational needs require that it be filled.
If the promoted or transferred employee is not retained in his/her new position and the former job has been permanently filled, he/she may exercise the replacement procedure outlined in Article 7, Section 5 of this Agreement.
Section 7-3. Application of Seniority. In the event a job opening is to be filled by the promotion of an employee in the bargaining unit, the following factors shall be considered in selecting employees for promotion and to fill vacancies and new jobs:
(a)	ability and qualifications to perform the work, determined by written or work tests where possible (in which event the test will be monitored by someone from the Human Resources Office and the Union if so requested. The Union will be provided reasonable notice in advance of the occurrence of a performance based work test); and
(b)	performance reviews and disciplinary history over the previous three years; and
(c)	seniority.
Where, as among the employees concerned, factors (a) and (b) are relatively equal, factor (c) shall govern.
In the event the job opening is to be filled by consideration of applicants not employed by the County, applicants from the bargaining unit shall be compared with non-employee applicants and if factor (a) considerations are relatively equal, factor (c) shall govern selection to fill the job.
Section 7-4. Job Posting. Notice of a position vacancy in any existing or newly created position which may be filled by an employee covered by this Agreement shall be posted for a period of one work week on appropriate bulletin boards.
The County may elect not to post a vacancy if there is a qualified County employee who requests a lateral transfer or voluntarily seeks a lower rated position, or who is being reduced or disqualified from a higher rated position. The Union shall be notified in advance of a position being filled in this LIUCBAMANAGEMENT2013/2016 updated 8/25/14

manner. Any employee of the County who is interested in filling the vacancy shall apply in writing to the Human Resources Director or designee.
If a subsequent vacancy in the same classification occurs during the posting period or interview stage of the first vacancy, a department may elect to fill the subsequent vacancy without posting the position again. The department may select from the same pool of applications received for the initial vacancy. If the selected applicant is separated from employment within 60 days of hire, the department director may select from the pool of applicants received for the initial vacancy. Temporary transfers or assignments may be made until the position is filled, as well as at other times. All employees are encouraged to seek promotions to non-bargaining unit positions; however, it is understood that this Agreement does not require that bargaining unit employees be chosen to fill a non-bargaining unit position. The County agrees to formally notify employees who are not selected for promotional opportunities. Such notification shall be in writing and shall identify an employee’s opportunity for further discussion with the hiring supervisor(s) regarding the selection process.
Section 7-5. Layoff and Recall. In the event of a reduction in the work force, newly hired probationary employees in the classification and department affected shall be first laid off. If further reductions are necessary, non-probationary employees and employees who are on promotional or transfer probation in the affected classification shall be laid off from the classification and department affected. The order of such layoffs shall be based on seniority with the least senior employees in the classification and department laid off first, provided that factors (a) and (b) in Section 3 are relatively equal. In the event of the relative inequality of these factors, objectively determined as between employees in the same classification and department, the employee with the higher values of factors (a) and (b) shall be retained.
An employee who is reduced from a department shall have the right to exercise seniority to replace the most junior employee in the same classification, in all other departments, whose factor LIUCBAMANAGEMENT2013/2016 updated 8/25/14

(a) and (b) values are equal to or less than those of the reduced employee, and who is junior to the reduced employee. An employee who is unable to replace another employee in the same classification shall have the right to exercise seniority to replace the most junior employee in any lower classification in any department; provided that the reduced employee meets the entry level qualifications of the lower classification, is fully qualified to perform the work of the lower classification (determined by written or work tests where possible), and has relatively equal or greater performance evaluation ratings and is senior to the replaced employee. In the event of a layoff, the County will notify the Business Manager of the Union prior to sending formal notification to the employees affected by the layoff.
Laid off employees shall be recalled to the classification and department from which they were laid off in the reverse order in which they were laid off, provided that they have not been terminated under Section 6(e) below. It is understood that persons employed with, and paid by, federal or state grant funds will be laid off or terminated upon the elimination or cut back of such funds regardless of their seniority.
In the event any temporary or stand-by positions become available during a layoff, the County will first offer those positions to employees who were laid off in accordance with Article 7, Section 5 of this Agreement. Acceptance of a temporary or stand-by position will not affect an employee's recall rights under Article 7, Section 5.
Section 7-6. Loss of Seniority. Seniority and the employment relationship shall be broken and terminated if an employee:
(a)	resigns;
(b)	is discharged and not reinstated;
(c)	is absent from work for three (3) consecutive work days without notification to the County; unless notification would have been impossible;

(d)	is laid off and fails to return to work within seven (7) calendar days after having been recalled in writing by certified mail with return receipt requested, addressed to the last known address of record unless there is a reason, acceptable to the County, for such failure;
(e)	is laid off or is absent from work in the case of sickness or illness or injury incurred on
the job for twenty-four (24) consecutive months or one-half of the employee’s seniority at the time of layoff, illness or injury, whichever is lesser;
(f)	fails to report for work at the termination of a leave of absence or extension thereof; or
(g)	accepts gainful employment without permission while on leave of absence.
Section 7-7. Seniority During Approved Leave of Absence. An employee's seniority shall be retained during an approved leave of absence but shall accumulate further only during leave with pay and for sixty (60) days without pay, except for leave under Article 8, Section 7.

Leaves of Absence
Section 8-1. Sick Leave. All employees occupying permanent positions shall earn four (4) hours of sick leave with each bi-weekly pay period provided that the employee has been paid for at least three-fourths (3/4) of the work shifts in the pay period. Time spent in collective bargaining negotiations shall be considered as time worked for the purpose of sick leave accrual and employees on leave under Section 7 of this Article shall not lose sick leave accrual for up to two (2) calendar weeks per year of such Section 7 leave. Sick leave shall be earned as of the last day of the pay period. Permanent part-time employees who work at least twenty (20) hours per week shall earn sick leave in a pro-rated amount computed on a base rate of four (4) hours per bi-weekly pay period. At the end of each fiscal year, an employee shall have the option of converting up to ten (10) days of sick leave to vacation leave on a two (2) for one (1) basis. The conversion of sick leave will be approved only if the employee has a remaining balance of sick leave of at least eighty (80) hours after the conversion. All requests to convert sick leave must be received by Finance & Accounting prior to October 31st. Upon separation from employment after ten (10) years service, an employee will be entitled to be paid for fifty percent (50%) of his or her accrued sick leave at the current rate of pay.
Employee hired on or after October 1, 2011, upon separation from employment after ten (10) years of service, will be entitled to up to a maximum payout of 500 hours (1,000 hour accrual) for employees regularly scheduled to work forty (40) hour work weeks. Employees will be permitted to accrue sick leave beyond the sick leave payout cap, but will be limited to payout of500 hours (1,000 hour accrual).
Section 8-2. Utilization of Sick Leave. Paid sick leave shall not be taken prior to the time of its accrual and shall only be taken upon prior approval of the County. Sick leave may only be utilized for employee sickness, sickness in the employee's immediate family resident with him or LIUCBAMANAGEMENT2013/2016 updated 8/25/14

Section 11-7	Notice of Discharge - The County shall provide a notice of proposed discharge
to a regular, permanent, non-probationary employee and to the Union five (5) working days prior to the date of the meeting on the discharge.
The County and the Union agree that management will work with department heads to promote a cooperative effort between supervisors and Union shop stewards to allow stewards to discuss situations on the job that are of an urgent nature and require immediate action. It will be understood that discussions of this nature are to be held during working hours only when the matter requires immediate action and the discussions are to be brief and limited to the immediate action required.
The County and the Union acknowledge that it is a goal of management and the Union that discipline be imposed without an unreasonable delay after management has learned of the matter precipitating the discipline; and after the proper period for investigation, analysis, and evaluation. Management will notify an employee of pending investigation and/ or possible discipline within ten (10) workdays of management’s knowledge of an incident. The Union agrees that a claim of unreasonable delay in itself is not a grievable matter, but the Union may argue to an arbitrator in an appropriate case that there has been an unreasonable delay in the imposition of discipline in the particular case before the arbitrator.

Hours of Work and Overtime
Section 12-1. Purpose. This Article is intended only to provide a basis for calculating overtime and shall not be considered as a guarantee of work or hours. There shall be no pyramiding of overtime or other premium payments.
Section 12-2	(a) Workday; Workweek. The normal workday shall consist of eight (8) hours
exclusive of lunch and the normal workweek shall consist of five (5) eight (8) hour shifts. Some employees may be assigned to normal workdays of ten (10) hours each with a normal workweek of four (4) ten (10) hour workdays. Some employees may be assigned to normal work shifts of twelve (12) hours or sixteen (16) hours.
(b)	In addition, the County may assign employees to work any combination of work day hours in a workweek in order to ensure full coverage of County operations. However, in consideration of this provision, the County and the Union agree to meet at the written request of either party to discuss the adoption and implementation of work schedules covering bargaining unit employees. The Employer and the Union agree to reopen Article 12 in the event either party requests to do so by serving written notice on the other party. Negotiations shall begin within two (2) weeks of such written notice.
(c)	All employees will be provided with written notice of any change in their weekly work schedules at least two (2) weeks in advance, unless there is an emergency or extenuating circumstance that does not allow for advance written notice. Days and hours of work shall be scheduled consecutively without alteration where possible.
Section 12-3. Overtime Compensation. In the event an employee is required to work beyond a normal workweek of not less than forty (40) hours, he/she shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half the employee's regular straight time rate provided the employee actually works his or her normal LIUCBAMANAGEMENT2013/2016 updated 8/25/14

workweek. All payments for overtime must be authorized by the Division or Department Head. Employees who work more than the normally scheduled hours shall be offered the opportunity to flex hours within a work week, at the employee’s choosing, and with prior supervisory approval. In the event an employee works hours in excess of his/her regular schedule, the employee may request to take that number of hours off during that same work week, in lieu of overtime. The request to flex the hours within the work week must be approved by the employee’s immediate supervisor prior to taking the time off. It is also understood that the flex hours off will be approved only if operational considerations are met and overtime is not generated by allowing the employee to flex the hours. It is understood that this offer of flex time will not constitute an attempt by management to avoid payment of overtime and further that the disapproval of allowing an employee to flex these excess hours cannot be grieved. Holidays not worked shall count as hours worked for the purpose of determining overtime.
Section 12-4. Shift Work. The first shift, beginning between 5:00 AM and 2:00 PM will not receive shift differential. Employees assigned to work any shift starting between 2:00 PM and 11:00 PM shall receive second shift differential of .25 cents per hour. Employees assigned to work any shift beginning at 11:00 PM or later shall receive third shift differential of .50 cents per hour. Employees assigned to shifts beginning before 2:00 PM, but with more than 50% of the hours worked occurring after 2:00 PM, shall receive second shift differential for those hours worked after 2:00 PM. Employees assigned to shifts that cross second and third shift, shall receive the shift differential in effect at the time the hours are worked. See examples below:
Example 1:	Employee begins work at 12:00 noon and works until 9:00 PM. More than 50% of the hours worked occur after 2:00 PM; therefore, the employee will receive second shift differential of .25 cents per hour for the seven hours worked after 2:00 PM.
Example 2:	Employee begins work at 8:30 AM and works until 7:00 PM. Less than 50% of the

hours worked occur after 2:00 PM; therefore, the employee receives no shift differential.
Example 3:	Employee begins work at 12:00 noon and works until 12:00 midnight. More than 50% of the hours occur after 2:00 PM and work hours cross into the third shift; therefore, the employee receives second shift differential for the nine hours worked between 2:00 PM and 11:00 PM, and third shift differential for the hour worked after 11:00 PM.
Section 12-5. Procedure for Overtime Assignment. Each department in which overtime is regularly worked shall establish a fair and equitable basis for making overtime assignments so that, consistent with operational efficiency and practicable operations, the following guidelines can be achieved:
(a)	in cases of prescheduled overtime, all persons in the classification and on the shift who normally perform the work are provided with a reasonably equal opportunity to work the overtime, the process commencing with the senior employees being offered the work;
(b)	the time period over which equalization of opportunity is spread will depend upon the nature of the work and the frequency of prescheduled overtime;
(c)	a record will be maintained of prescheduled overtime worked, offered, declined, or not reached, and a current record will be posted on a bulletin board and a copy provided to the Union.
(d)	if insufficient volunteers are available to work prescheduled overtime, the most junior employees with sufficient qualifications and training to perform the required work will be assigned;
(e)	at the end of an equalization period, or at any time it is concluded that an employee was
not offered his/her fair share of overtime, employees shall receive prescheduled overtime assignments in amounts sufficient to equalize the time offered;

maintained, and provided to the union steward monthly.

Addendum B
DRUG FREE WORKPLACE AND DRUG TESTING POLICY
The County and the Union agree that drug abuse us a significant public health problem in our society. Drug abuse in the workplace negatively affects individual job performance and undermines the public’s confidence in Alachua County and the services we provide.
Both parties to this agreement acknowledge the importance of establishing and maintaining a drug free workplace; and complying with all federal, state, and local regulations related to drug use, including the Federal Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the State Comprehensive Economic Development Act of 1990.
As used herein, “drug abuse” includes the use of illicit substances or misuse of controlled substances, alcohol, or other psychoactive drugs.
Section 1.	Policy Statement. The manufacture, use, possession or distribution of illicit or controlled substances on the job is strictly prohibited. Employees are required to report to work in a fit condition for duty. Being under the influence of alcohol or illicit drugs, and being under the influence of legal drugs to the extent that normal faculties are impaired, is strictly prohibited. Employees who use or distribute drugs on the job are subject to disciplinary action, including dismissal. Any confiscated drugs will be turned over to local law enforcement officials. If an employee is under medical treatment with a drug that could alter his/her ability to do the job, (s)he is required to report this drug use immediately to his/her supervisor.
Drug abuse and alcoholism are recognized as illnesses or disorders, and the County accepts responsibility for providing channels of help. However, it is the employee’s responsibility to seek such help. If an employee seeks help on a voluntary basis, then confidentiality will be protected. But, if the employee does not seek help and a work performance or work conduct problem comes to the attention of the County, then disciplinary action will result.
Any employee who refuses to submit to a test for drugs or alcohol pursuant to this policy, shall be presumed, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, to be under the influence and will forfeit his/her eligibility for all worker’s compensation medical and indemnity benefits and will be disciplined.
Section 2.	Notice. The drug testing provisions of this policy become effective ninety (90) days following ratification of this Article. All other provisions are effective with the ratification of this Article.
The County will provide a one-time written notice to all employees as required by Section 440.102(3), Florida Statutes. The notice will be provided to all potential employees prior to any preemployment drug testing. Copies of this notice will be placed on all employee bulletin boards and a general statement that the County will test all job applicants will be included on vacancy announcements.
Section 3.	Confidentiality. The provisions of Section 440.102(8), Florida Statutes, shall govern the release of any information, interviews, reports, statements, memoranda and drug testing results received by the County through this drug testing program.

Section 4.	Types of Testing. The County will conduct the following types of drug testing:
(a)	Pre-employment - Any final candidate for a position within Alachua County shall be required to take a drug urinalysis and/or blood test prior to initial employment. Any applicant whose test results indicate present alcohol or drug abuse will not be hired.
(b)	Position Change - Any current employee who is the final candidate for a posted position, whether internal or external, shall be required to take a drug urinalysis and alcohol test prior to the final offer for the new position being extended. Any employee applicant whose confirmed test results indicate present alcohol or drug abuse will not be hired into the new position, and is subject to all other provisions of this policy.
(c)	Scheduled physical examination - Any employee who undergoes a full physical examination in accordance with Article XIV shall also be tested for drug and/or alcohol use as part of that examination.
(d)	Reasonable suspicion - Drug testing based on a belief that an employee is using or has used drugs in violation of this policy drawn from specific objective and articulable facts and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts in light of experience. Approval for such testing shall be authorized only by the Human Resources Director. Among other things, such facts and inferences may be based upon;
(1)	Observable documented phenomena while at work, such as direct observation of drug or alcohol use or of the physical symptoms or manifestations of being under the influence of a drug or alcohol.
(2)	Abnormal conduct or erratic behavior while at work or a significant deterioration in work performance.
(3)	A report of drug or alcohol use, provided by a reliable and credible source.
(4)	Evidence that an individual has tampered with a drug or alcohol test during his/her employment with the current employer.
(5)	Information that an employee has caused, contributed to, or been involved in an accident while at work
(6)	Evidence that an employee has used, possessed, sold, solicited, or transferred drugs while working or while on County premises or while operating County vehicles, machinery or equipment.
If testing is conducted based on reasonable suspicion, the County will immediately document the circumstances which formed the basis of the determination that reasonable suspicion existed to warrant the testing. A copy of this documentation shall be kept confidential by the County pursuant to this policy and shall be retained for at least one (1) year.
(e)	Follow-up - If an employee, in the course of employment, has a confirmed positive drug or alcohol test the County will require the employee to submit to a drug and/or alcohol test on a quarterly, semiannual or annual basis, at the County’s option, for two (2) years LIUCBA2007/2010 9/19/07

thereafter. If an employee tests positive within eighteen (18) months of completing the two (2) year random follow-up testing for a prior positive drug test, the employee will be considered to have failed a second test, and will be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with this policy. The County will transport the employee to the testing facility.
(f)	Transportation Employees - All employees who are required to hold a commercial driver’s license (CDL) and operate a commercial motor vehicle as a condition of employment will be tested for drugs and alcohol in accordance with the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 and federal rules as follows:

(2)	Post-accident - A covered driver will be tested following an accident when any person involved in the accident has been fatally injured or the driver receives a citation for a moving traffic violation arising from operating the commercial motor vehicle. Additionally, any driver involved in an accident will be subject to testing under Reasonable Suspicion, section 4.d.
(3)	Reasonable Suspicion - Same as for other employees.
(4)	Random - Employees will be tested for alcohol and drugs on a random unannounced basis just before, during or just after operating a commercial motor vehicle. Not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number of employees in covered positions will be tested for alcohol in the first year and fifty percent (50%) for drugs the first year. The number to be tested in subsequent years will conform with federal rules. Each driver shall be chosen using a scientifically valid random method and shall have an equal chance each time selections are made.
(5)	A confirmed blood alcohol level of .02%, but less than .04% will require that the employee be removed from performing all duties requiring a CDL for a minimum of eight (8) hours, or until a re-test shows the employee’s blood alcohol content has dropped below .02%. If an employee has a confirmed blood alcohol level of .04% or greater, the employee may not return to a function requiring a CDL until, at a minimum:
(1)	the employee undergoes an evaluation, and where necessary, treatment; and
(2)	a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) determines that the employee has successfully complied with any recommended treatment; and

Section 7.	Rehabilitation. Any employee who feels that (s)he has developed an addiction to, dependence upon, or a problem with alcohol or drugs, legal or illegal, is encouraged to seek assistance. Employees may seek such assistance through the County sponsored Employee Assistance Program (EAP) or other community resources.
Rehabilitation is the responsibility of the employee. Any employee seeking medical attention for alcohol misuse or drug abuse will be entitled to benefits only to the extent specified under the County’s group health insurance program EAP. Employees required to be absent from the workplace while in treatment may request a medical leave of absence in accordance with Section VIII. An employee shall be permitted to utilize all available accumulated paid leave before being placed in a leave without pay status.
Upon successful completion of the EAP or other treatment program, the employee shall be reinstated to the same or equivalent position that was held prior to such rehabilitation.
The County will not discharge, discipline or discriminate against an employee solely on the basis of any prior medical history revealed to the County pursuant to this policy.
The County will not dismiss, discipline or discriminate against an employee solely upon the basis of an employee voluntarily seeking treatment for an alcohol or drug problem. However, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken if the employee has previously tested positive for a drug and/or alcohol use, and has sought treatment through the EAP or entered a drug and/or alcohol rehabilitation program for drug related problems while in the County’s employ.
Section 8.	Violations and Continued Employment. Employees who violate this Drug Free Workplace Policy with a first time positive confirmed drug and/or alcohol test will be referred to the County EAP or other community alcohol and drug rehabilitation programs as appropriate. However, use of the EAP or other rehabilitation resources will not prevent the County from taking appropriate disciplinary action for violations of other County policies. Employees referred to the EAP or other rehabilitation program as a result of a first violation will be allowed to continue employment with the County provided that:
(1)	They contact EAP or other rehabilitation resource and strictly adhere to all terms of treatment and counseling prescribed; and
(2)	They immediately cease any an all abuse of alcohol or drugs; and
(3)	They consent in writing to periodic unannounced testing in accordance with Section 4(e)
of this Article for a period of up to two (2) years after returning to work or completion of any rehabilitation program, whichever is later. If the employee separates employment prior to completing the mandatory two (2) year random follow-up testing, he/she will be required to complete that testing if re-hired by the County.
(4)	They pass all drug tests administered under this program.
