WHEREAS, the City and Union have endorsed the practices and procedures of collective bargaining as a fair and orderly way of conducting their relations with one another; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements herein contained, the parties do mutually promise and agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1 RECOGNITION AND STAFFING
SECTION 1.1-	RECOGNITION-The City recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining representative of the employees in the classification of Mechanical Systems Maintenance Worker which is a unit appropriate for collective bargaining pursuant to the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act.
SECTION 1.2	- STAFFING- The City agrees that in the event an opening in the classification listed above becomes available, the City will first give the Union the opportunity to fill such opening with a qualified candidate. If the Union is unable to furnish a qualified candidate within forty-eight hours following the day in which a written request is received by the Union, the City will be free to fill that position with a qualified applicant of their choosing.
ARTICLE 2 UNION RIGHTS
SECTION 2.1	- UNION SECURITY: No employee shall be required to become or remain a member of the Union as a condition of employment or continuation of employment with the City. All employees shall be free to join the Union and, in the exercise of such freedom, neither the Union nor any of its officers will intimidate or coerce employees into joining the Union. In the event federal, state or local law concerning mandatory Union membership is modified or
1
repealed, the parties agree that they will negotiate in good faith concerning successor language to accommodate the change.
The City agrees to continue to deduct, according to the current practice of the parties, the dues, assessments and initiation fees for the Union upon the receipt of a written and signed voluntary authorization form from any employee. Such money deducted shall be remitted to the official designated by the Union for receipt of such funds in accordance with the current practice. The Union shall advise the City in writing of any change in the amount to be deducted at least fifteen (15) days prior to the effective date of the change. No deduction shall be made which is prohibited by applicable law or which is not affirmatively consented to by the employee.
SECTION 2.2	- UNION INDEMNIFICATION: The Union shall indemnify, defend, and save the City harmless against all claims, demands, suits, or other forms of liability and for all reasonable legal costs that shall rise out of or by reason of action taken or not taken by the City’s properly complying with the provisions of this article. The City will promptly notify the Union of all such charges received by the City. The parties shall mutually agree upon legal representation.

SECTION 2.3	- UNION ACCESS: Union business agents shall have reasonable access to the premises and work sites of the City in order to meet with represented employees or to help resolve a dispute or problem. The Union will notify a member of management prior to a work site visit and the visit shall not disturb the work of employee(s) on duty. Notification of management will not be necessary for safety sensitive issues.
SECTION 2.4	- UNION MEETINGS ON PREMISES: The Employer agrees to make available conference and meeting rooms for Union meetings upon prior notification by the designated Union representative, unless to do so would seriously interfere with the operating needs of the Employer, or cause undue inconvenience to the Employer.
SECTION 2.5	- PERSONNEL RECORDS: The Employer and the Union agree to abide by the Employee Access to Personnel Records Act during the term of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section can be the basis of a Grievance under this Agreement, if the same or similar facts are also in dispute or at issue in a pending claim filed by the same employee at the Illinois Department of Labor.
ARTICLE 3 MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
Except as specifically restricted by the express language of this Agreement and Letters of Understanding, the City retains the exclusive right to manage and to direct the work force pursuant to its legal responsibilities in the manner it determines to be in the best interests of its citizens.
2
SECTION 3.1	- RIGHTS RESIDING WITH MANAGEMENT: Except as amended, changed or modified by the Agreement and side letters, the Employer retains the exclusive right to manage its operations, determine its policies, budget and operations, the maimer of exercise of its statutory functions and the direction of its working forces, including, but not limited: the right to hire, evaluate, allocate, and assign employees subject to the seniority provisions of this agreement; to discipline, suspend and discharge for just cause; to relieve employees from duty because of lack of work; to make and enforce reasonable rules of conduct and regulations (upon prior notice and discussion, if requested by the union); to determine the departments, divisions and sections and work to be performed therein; to introduce new methods of operations and to eliminate work; and to maintain efficiency.
SECTION 3.2	- STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS: Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to modify, eliminate or detract from the statutory responsibilities and obligations of the Employer except that the exercise of its rights in the furtherance of such statutory obligations shall not be in conflict with the provisions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 4
NON DISCRIMINATION
SECTION 4.1	- PROHIBITION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION: Both the Employer and the Union agree not to discriminate against any employee based on the protected class status of race, sex, religion, mental and/or physical disability, or any other form of discrimination prohibited by applicable federal, state, and local laws. The Parties also agree to work cooperatively to provide reasonable accommodations for disabled employees to the extent required by law. This Section 4.1 cannot be the sole basis of a Grievance, but it can be an issue in dispute in a hearing relative to the application of a different section of this agreement. The parties agree that discrimination issues arising under local, state, and federal antidiscrimination laws and ordinances are not arbitrable under this Agreement.
SECTION 4.2	- EQUAL EMPLOYMENT/AFFIRMATIVE ACTION: The parties recognize the City’s obligation to comply with Federal and State Equal Employment and Affirmative Action Laws. Upon written request, the Union agrees to provide the City with a copy of its current EEO-3 Local Union report.

ARTICLE 5
GRIEVANCE
SECTION 5.1 - DEFINITION: A grievance, for purposes of this Article, is a claim that the City has violated this Agreement regarding the interpretation or application of any of the terms of this Agreement affecting employees or the union covered by this Agreement. An individual employee, a group of employees or the Union may institute a grievance. All parties shall make a good faith effort to resolve grievances informally.
SECTION 5.2	- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE: The following is set forth as an orderly procedure for resolving all grievances:
Oral Discussion: If an individual employee, a group of employees, or the Union shall have a grievance against the City, it shall first be taken up in oral discussion with the supervisor involved, the steward and the aggrieved employee within ten (10) regular working days of the knowledge of an alleged violation. If a group of employees is involved, one (1) employee from that group shall participate in the oral discussion.
The discussion shall take place as soon as practical, and no later than five (5) regular working days from the request for oral discussion, to expedite disposition. The supervisor shall provide his verbal disposition at the conclusion of the discussion if the disposition has been made; and if not provided then, he shall provide his written disposition within the two (2) regular working days following the discussion.
Step 1. In the event that the grievance is not resolved through oral discussion, the aggrieved party through his/her shop steward shall deliver a written statement of the grievance to his/her manager within ten (10) regular working days of the oral discussion response. The grievance shall state the facts, date, cite specific sections of the contract that have been alleged to be violated, and the specific remedy(s) requested. A diligent effort shall be made to adjust the grievance of this step. A First Step grievance meeting shall be scheduled within five (5) regular working days of the manager's receipt of the written grievance. The grievant, shop steward, supervisor involved and the manager shall attend this meeting. The manager shall have ten (10) regular working days to give his or her written answer and a brief explanation of his/her reasons to the shop steward who presented the grievance and the grievant. Grievances not raised within the 10 ten regular working day time limit from date of occurrence will be dropped. Once the grievance has completed Step 1 of the grievance procedure, it cannot be modified beyond this Step in terms of the facts, specific violations and remedy requested unless new or additional material facts are discovered regarding the events of this grievance which were not known at the time of filing of the grievance and are necessary to modify the grievance.
4
Step 2. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step 1, the grievance shall be appealed by the Union business representative to the Department Head within ten (10) regular working days after receipt of the Step 1 answer. The written grievance shall state the facts involved in the grievance and the contract provisions allegedly violated by the City. A Second Step grievance meeting shall be scheduled within ten (10) regular working days of receipt of the written grievance appeal by the Department Head, subject to the availability of all parties. The Second Step meeting shall be attended by the Union business representative or his designee, the shop steward, the grievant, the Department Head, manager and supervisor involved. The City Labor Relations Manager may also attend this meeting. The Department Head shall give his/her written answer and a brief explanation of his/her reasons to the Union business representative within ten (10) regular working days after the Second Step grievance meeting.
Step 3. If the written grievance as submitted in Step 2 has not been satisfactorily settled, it shall be appealed in writing by the Union's business representative to the Human Resources Director. The writing referring the grievance to the Human Resources Director shall state in what respects the Step 2 answer is inconsistent with this Agreement. Such submission shall be made within ten (10) regular working days after the receipt of the answer in Step 2. A Third Step grievance shall be scheduled within ten (10) regular working days of receipt of the written appeal by the Human Resources Director. A Third Step hearing shall be scheduled within ten (10) working days of receipt of the written appeal by the Human Resources Director, subject to the availability of the parties. The Third Step hearing shall be attended by the Union business representative, the shop steward, the Human Resources Director, the Labor Relations Manager, the Department Head, and the manager. The Human Resources Director shall submit an answer with a brief explanation of his reasons to the Union business representative within ten (10) regular working days after the close of the hearing.
Step 4, If the written grievance has not been satisfactorily settled by the Operation of the grievance procedure as outlines hereinabove, the Union shall have the right, upon notification to the City, in writing, within fifteen (15) regular working days Aer the answer is given in Step 3, to submit the grievance to arbitration. The parties will make a sincere effort to mutually agree upon an arbitrator within five (5) regular working days after the notice is received. If the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator, the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service will be requested to supply a list of seven (7) arbitrators, from which list each party alternately shall strike one name. However, either party may reject the first list submitted in its entirety and request a second list. The Union shall strike first. On alternate arbitration cases when it is necessary to select an arbitrator in this manner, the City shall strike first. The parties shall continue striking names until only one remains on the list and that person shall be the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be designated to hear the grievance, and his decision shall be final and binding. The arbitrator, however, shall not have the right to change, add to or subtract from the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The fee and expenses of the arbitrator, shall be borne equally by the City and the Union provided, however, the fees and expenses of witnesses including experts, court reporters, cost of the hearing room (if off site), the cost of documentary evidence, and matters of that nature shall in all cases be borne by the party procuring the same if only one party requests that resource.
SECTION 5.3	- INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSION: The City will cooperate with the Union in the investigation of any grievance provided that grievances when investigated or
5
discussed during the employees' regular work day will not disturb the employees' work duty and provided the supervisor has granted prior approval for the meeting if it occurs during working time.
SECTION 5.4	- ADVANCED GRIEVANCE STEP FILING: Certain issues which by nature are not capable of being settled at a preliminary step of the grievance procedure, may be advanced to the appropriate step where the action giving rise to the grievance was initiated by mutual agreement.
SECTION 5.5	- EFFECT OF SETTLEMENTS: A grievance may be withdrawn or settled at any step without creating a precedent.
SECTION 5.6	- PERTINENT WITNESSES AND INFORMATION: In the interest of early settlement of disputes, both parties agree to provide directly applicable documents, and witnesses, reasonably available to them which are pertinent to the grievance under consideration.
SECTION 5.7	- EXCLUSIVITY OF GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE: The procedures set forth in this Article shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for resolving contract disputes. Individuals have legal rights that may coexist with topics within this Agreement. The rights of such individuals are not limited or in any manner abridged by the Operation of this Section except as provided in Article 4, Section 4.1
SECTION 5.8 - TIME LIMITS: In order to further expedite the settlement of grievances, time limitations have been agreed upon. Except with respect to the time limits in the Oral Discussion stage of the grievance procedure, if there is no timely response from either party within time limitations stated in Steps 1,2, and/or 3, of the grievance procedure (or an agreement upon, extension; email is fine) the grievance will progress to the next step in the grievance procedure., Extensions may be granted under the following provisions:
a.	when the representatives of either party are not available, or
b.	when mutually agreed upon in writing by both parties (email is sufficient).
ARTICLE 6
NO STRIKE AND NO LOCKOUT
SECTION 6.1	- NO INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE: The Union and the employees covered by this Agreement recognize and agree that the rendering of services to the community cannot, under any circumstances or conditions, be withheld, interrupted, or discontinued. Therefore, during the term of this Agreement, neither the Union nor its agents nor any employee, for any reason, will authorize, institute, aid, condone, or engage in any slow down, (a concerted effort to systematically delay or diminish services to the City), work stoppage, or strike (including sympathy strike), by bargaining unit employees. During the term of this Agreement, neither the Employer nor its agents for any reason shall authorize, institute, aid, engage in or promote any lockout of employees covered by this Agreement.
6
SECTION 6.2	- UNION RESPONSIBILITY: In the event of a violation of Section 6.1 of this Article, the Union agrees to notify all bargaining unit members and. representatives of their obligation and responsibility for maintaining compliance with this Article, including their responsibility to remain at, or return to, work during any interruption which may be caused or initiated by others, and to encourage employees violating Section 6.1 to return to work.
SECTION 6.3	- PENALTY: The Employer may move to discharge or discipline any employee who violates Section 6.1. The Union agrees that the City has the right to deal with any such strike activity by the above measures, including suspension without pay on any, some or all of the employees participating therein, depending on the individual facts of each alleged violation.
SECTION 6.4	- MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY: Nothing contained herein shall preclude the employer from obtaining judicial restraint and damages in the event of a violation of this Article.
SECTION 6.5 - PICKET LINES: It shall not be a violation of this Agreement if an employee refuses to pass through legally established primary picket lines. However, the City and its employees have a responsibility towards assuring both public safety and property protection. If a bona fide emergency exists, an employee will not unreasonably refuse to cross a picket line. The City shall notify the Union of its actions when ordering an employee to cross a picket line in compliance with this Section (email is sufficient).
ARTICLE 7 LABOR MANAGEMENT RELATIONS
SECTION 7.1	- AGREEMENTS: All formal negotiations or bargaining with respect to the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be conducted by authorized representatives of the Union and authorized representatives of the City. Agreements reached as a result of such negotiations shall become effective only when signed by the authorized representatives of the parties and ratified by the City Council.
SECTION 7.2	- COMMITTEE: There shall be labor/management meetings for the areas of discussion set forth below. Such meetings generally shall be held quarterly, unless mutually agreed otherwise.
The committee shall be composed of up to five (5) bargaining unit representatives and five (5) City management personnel. In addition, the business representatives of each trade union, the Public Works Director and City Labor Relations Manager may also attend. The selection of bargaining unit representatives shall be done by the unions. The selection of management personnel shall be done by the City.
The purpose of the meetings is to deal with matters of general concerns to members of the organization as opposed to individual complaints of employees. Accordingly, the committee will not discuss grievances which are properly the subject of the procedure outlined in Article 5. Areas
7
of discussion shall include:
1.	Disseminate general information of interest to the parties
2.	Give representatives an opportunity to express their views, or to make suggestions on subjects of interest to employees of the bargaining unit.
3.	Notify the Union of changes in non bargainable conditions of employment contemplated by the Employer, which may affect employees in the bargaining unit.
The Union representatives shall be released from work with pay to attend Labor/Management Committee meetings that are scheduled during their normal hours of work. In no event shall the total lost time pay for union representatives' attendance at these meetings exceed ten (10) hours pay for each meeting. The Union co-chairperson of the committee shall provide the names of the bargaining unit personnel to attend such meeting to the City co-chairperson of the committee at least one (1) work day prior to the meeting.
SECTION 7.3 - MEETINGS - Quarterly meetings will be scheduled at the beginning of the calendar year by the City and the City will provide notice of the schedule to all five (5) bargaining unit representatives and their business representatives.

In addition, at least one week prior to the scheduled meeting, all five (5) bargaining unit representatives and/or their business representatives should identify who will be attending the meeting on their behalf.
If there are no agenda items proposed by any of the five (5) bargaining unit representatives and/or their business representatives at least one (1) week prior to the scheduled meeting and the City has no agenda items to discuss, all parties will be notified by the Public Works Director or his designee that the meeting is not necessary due to lack of agenda items.
ARTICLE 8 DRUG & ALCOHOL POLICY/FITNESS FOR DUTY
SECTION 8.1 - DRUG AND ALCOHOL FREE WORK PLACE: It is the policy and commitment of the City of Peoria and the named labor union to provide an environment within the work place which is free from prohibited drugs and alcohol in order to protect the employees as well as the health and safety of the public. The City recognizes that alcohol and drug abuse is considered by many to be an illness and encourages its employees to voluntarily utilize the City's employee assistance program before such abuse affects the employee's job performance. It is specifically agreed that no employee shall be disciplined or the subject of adverse employment action for the first instance where the employee notifies the employer that he has a problem with drug or alcohol use, and voluntarily seeks assistance prior to initiation of an investigation of suspected drug or alcohol abuse by the employee or pending discipline. Such employees shall be referred by the managerial employee who is notified to the City's Employee Assistance Program for confidential
8
counseling and treatment. The managerial employee shall not divulge any information received from the employee who voluntarily seeks the help of the Employee Assistance Program. Such voluntary referral to the Employee Assistance Program, however, does not relieve the employee from the responsibility to adequately perform their job. In addition, voluntary submittal does not eliminate the employee from the requirements to take required drug or alcohol tests as described in Section B below.
Consistent to the requirements of the Federal Drug Free Workplace Act:
1.	Any employee who consumes, possesses or distributes alcohol or controlled substance while in the workplace or while conducting City business shall be terminated from the employ of the City.
2.	Any employee who fails to notify the City within five (5) days after they are convicted of a criminal drug offense for a violation taking place in the workplace or while conducting City business, will be terminated.
3.	Any employee convicted of the manufacture, sale, or distribution of prohibited drugs, regardless of when or where that act takes place, will be terminated from the employ of the City.
4.	The City shall endeavor to provide employees and supervisors with a positive program of drug education and to make everyone aware of help that is available for such a problem.
No employee shall be under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or illegal drugs while at work. No employee shall report to work to perform a safety sensitive function within 4 hours after using alcohol. If an employee is called in for overtime, he/she shall inform the supervisor in charge of the callout if he/she has consumed alcohol within 4 hours prior to the scheduled reporting time, or if he/she is impaired by drugs or alcohol.
No employee shall fail to report to their immediate Supervisor any known adverse side effects of over the counter medication(s) or prescription drugs which the employee is taking, and no employee shall be disciplined or discharged or otherwise prejudiced by reason of such disclosure.
A. Drug and Alcohol Testing: To further achieve the goals of the drug and alcohol policy, the City may require all employees to be subject to drug and alcohol testing prior to employment, for reasonable suspicion, as a part of physical exams otherwise requested or directed by the City, or upon completion of voluntary self-referral to the City's employee assistance program or as follows:
1.	As soon as practicable following an accident involving a City vehicle or equipment where the accident involved loss of human life, an injury requiring medical treatment, where there is damage to City property reasonably believed to be in excess of $1,000 and/or when the Operator was issued a citation for a moving violation, the employee shall be tested for alcohol and controlled substances.
9
Alcohol tests must be performed within 8 hours following the incident and controlled substance tests within 32 hours following the incident. The employee shall remain readily available for such testing or may be deemed by the City to have refused to submit to testing. The employee shall not consume alcohol or controlled substances until the test occurs or the time expires.
2.	Random testing - The City shall annually random test for alcohol 25% of the average number of employees. The City shall also annually random test for controlled substances 50% of the average number of employees.
It being the desire of the parties to protect the safety of the public and other employees, and to safeguard the rights of individual employees, the parties agree that drug and alcohol testing shall be conducted as follows:
1.	The City may order individual employees to submit to breath, blood or urine tests to determine the presence of alcohol and/or drugs where the City has a reasonable suspicion to believe the individual employee is then under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances. The City shall set forth in writing to the employee within 24 hours after the order to submit to the testing is given, the objective basis for such reasonable suspicion, including all objective facts and reasonable observations and conclusions drawn from those facts;
2.	Employees ordered to submit to drug and alcohol tests shall promptly comply with the order. Refusal to submit to such tests demanded after a determination by the City that reasonable suspicion exists to suspect that an employee is under the influence of alcohol or illicit drugs, shall be grounds for immediate discharge. The City shall present each employee, prior to issuing the order to test, this Agreement and the policy of the City concerning drug and alcohol abuse;
3.	The City agrees that its testing procedure for the presence of drugs or alcohol shall conform to the following:
(i)	Use only a SAMHSA certified licensed clinical laboratory to test body fluids or materials for alcohol or drugs (illicit substance), and only a breath testing devise and Operator currently certified by the Department of Transportation;
(ii)	Establish a chain of custody procedure for both sample collection and testing that will insure the integrity of and identity of each sample and test result;
(iii)	Collect a sufficient sample of the same body fluid of material to permit for an initial screening, a confirmatory test and a sufficient amount to be set aside and reserved for later testing if requested by the employee;
10
(iv)	Collect all samples in such a manner as to preserve the individual employee's right to privacy, insure a high degree of security for the sample and its freedom from adulteration. Proper procedures and testing shall be conducted to prevent the submission of a false or adulterated sample;
(v)	Confirm any body fluid sample that tests positive in the initial screening for alcohol or drugs (illicit substance) by use of gas chromatography, with mass spectrometry or an equivalent scientifically accurate and accepted method that provides quantitative data about the detected alcohol or drug metabolites;
(vi)	Provide the employee tested with an opportunity to have an additional portion of the same sample tested by a licensed testing facility of his or her own choosing;
(vii)	Require that the clinical laboratory report to the physician who ordered the test, positive results only in the case where both the initial and confirmatory test results of body fluid are positive as to the same sample;
(viii)The Medical Review Officer (MRO) shall provide each employee with the report of the results of each drug or alcohol test that includes the types of tests conducted, the results of each test, the detection level used by the laboratory, and other information provided to the MRO by the laboratory;
(ix)	Insure that all positive samples are maintained for a period of not less than one hundred twenty (120) days to permit additional testing at the election of the employee or union.
(x)	Body fluid specimen samples shall be sealed in front of the person providing the sample, labeled and checked against the identity of the employee to ensure the results match the tested specimen. Samples shall be stored in a secured and refrigerated atmosphere until testing or delivery to the testing lab representative.
(xi)	If an alcohol test reveals that there is a concentration of alcohol in the employee's blood stream (blood alcohol concentration shall mean either grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grains of alcohol per 210 liters of breath), of .04 or more the employee will automatically be deemed "under the influence" of alcohol within the meaning of this Policy, and therefore, shall be subject to discipline under this Policy.
(xii)	If an alcohol test reveals that there is a concentration less than those specified above, there is no presumption that the employee is "under the influence", but the City may discipline the employee (subject to the grievance procedure) under this policy in the presence of other indicia that the employee is under the influence. If a breath test under this Section 8.1 reveals an alcohol concentration higher than those specified above, the employee may promptly secure a blood test, which, if it contradicts the breath test result, will be paid for by the City .The testing or processing
11
phase for body fluids shall consist of a two-step procedure:
a.	Initial screening test
b.	Confirmation test
(xiii)	The body fluid sample is first tested using the initial drug screening procedure. An initial positive test result will not be considered conclusive; rather, it will be classified as "confirmation pending." Notification of test results to the City shall be held until the confirmation test results are obtained.
(xiv)A body fluid specimen testing positive will undergo an additional confirmatory test. The confirmation procedure shall be technologically different and more sensitive than the initial screening test.
(xv)	Personnel utilized for testing will be certified as qualified to collect samples or adequately trained in collection procedures.
(xvi)	Concentrations of a drug at or above the levels established by SAMHSA for screening tests shall be considered a positive test result when using the initial immunoassay drug screening test. At the present time, these levels are:
INITIAL TEST
Level Nanogram/Milliliter (hereafter referred to as (ng/ml)
Marijuana metabolite. Cocaine metabolite Opiate metabolites Phenylcyclidine Amphetamines
50 300 2000*
25
1000
*	A test for 6-Acetylmorphine will be conducted when the specimen's morphine concentration exceeds 2000 ng/ml.
Concentration of a drug at or above the levels established by SAMHSA for confirmatory tests shall be considered a positive test result when performing a confirmatory Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectophotomotry test on a urine specimen that tested positive using a technologically different initial screening method. At the present time, these levels are:
12
CONFIRMATORY TEST
Marijuana metabolite.
Cocaine metabolite
Opiate
Phencyclidine Amphetamines:
Amphetamines
Methamphetamine
Level (ng/ml)

*	**Specimen must also contain amphetamine at a concentration greater than or equal to 200 ng/ml.
(xvii) The laboratory selected to conduct the analysis shall be experienced and capable of quality control, documentation, chain of custody, technical expertise and demonstrate proficiency in urinalysis.
(xviii) Employees having a negative drug test result shall, upon written request, receive a memorandum stating that no illegal drugs were found. If the employee requests such, a copy of the letter will be placed in the employee's personnel file. Any initial drug test wherein the level of purported drugs is reported below that specified within the scale set forth under "INITIAL TEST" shall be considered a negative drug test by the City and no action whatsoever shall be taken against said employee under this policy. This shall not preclude the City from disciplining an employee for a correlative disciplinary offense which would otherwise subject the employee to discipline.
(xix)	Each step in the collecting and processing of the drug testing shall be doctunented to establish procedural integrity and the chain of custody.
(xx)	Where a positive result is confirmed, specimens shall be maintained in secured, refrigerated storage for at least a period of one hundred twenty (120) days.
(xxi)	All records pertaining to City required drug tests shall remain confidential, and shall not be provided to other employers or agencies without written permission of the person whose records are sought.

13
(xxiii)	If an employee is required to leave work to take a drug/alcohol test, the City will pay the employee for time lost from scheduled work for that day.
(xxiv)	For random drug tests the following additional conditions shall apply:
a.	The City will contract with an independent third party to provide random selection services through use of employee social security numbers. The City shall determine how many dates the random testing shall occur on, and the actual dates shall be selected by a random number generator.
b.	To maintain the security of the selection system, the contractor shall deal exclusively with the Deputy Director of Operations and Maintenance, or in his/her absence, the Director of Operations and Maintenance, for purposes of notifying the City of testing dates and individuals selected, verifying and updating the Pool and supplemental selection of employees, if necessary. The Director or Deputy Director may oversee another employee, who has been trained in the applicable procedures, in the performance of the actual duties outlined in this section.
c.	When the City contact person is notified by the contractor of the employees to be tested, he/she shall promptly require them to report to a designated collection site to provide specimens of breath and/or urine as required by the selection.
d.	Any employee selected who is on authorized time off which was applied for and approved prior to notice to the City of the date of the test shall be required to report to the collection site on his/her first day back from pre-approved lave. Any employee who requests leave of any type after the City has been notified on the testing date shall be required to report to the collection site on the shift he/she would otherwise have been required to report unless he/she is excused bDeputy Director of Operations & Maintenance for good cause shown. Any employee so excused shall be required to report to the collection site on his/her first day back to work.
e.	When an employee is selected in the random process, he/she. shall promptly report to the appropriate collection site upon the direction of his/her supervisor. For purposes of drug testing, he/she shall provide specimens of urine sufficient to allow for "split sample" collection and processing of the specimens. For purposes of alcohol testing, he/she shall supply a breath sample sufficient for a breath alcohol test. All breath alcohol testing shall be performed by a DOT certified operator employed by an independent third party which either operates or is affiliated with the NIDA certified laboratory selected for drug testing. All breath tests shall be performed on a DOT certified breath analysis machine. In the event that the initial breath test shows a result of .02 or greater, a second test shall be performed. Only if the second test shows a result of .04 or greater shall it be considered a positive result.
14
4.	Except as provided herein, the parties agree that there shall be no random, periodic or mass testing of employees for alcohol or drugs.
5.	The City agrees to maintain all records concerning drug or alcohol problems of its employee in the utmost confidence, releasing such information only upon written authorization of the affected employee or to other management personnel on an as needed basis, or upon proper court order.
B .Discipline/Rehabilitation: The parties agree that the decision as to whether an employee will be disciplined and/or referred for treatment and rehabilitation shall be based upon the employee's length of service, the nature and extent of the problem and all other relevant factors on a case by case basis. Violation of any of the provisions of this Policy may be considered "just cause" for discipline. If, as a result of the investigation and/or completion of a positive alcohol or drug test, just cause is present, discipline may be imposed, but no more harshly than as follows (NOTE: Discipline shall be subject to the grievance procedure under the collective bargaining agreement)
SECTION 8.2 - PHYSICAL & MENTAL FITNESS: It shall be the responsibility of each employee to maintain the standards of physical and mental fitness required for performing his essential job functions (either with or without a reasonable accommodation if disabled). Whenever the Employer has a verifiable just cause to suspect that the physical or mental condition of an employee is endangering his own health or the safety of fellow workers; or when the employee appears unable to perform the essential functions of the job, the employee may be requested by the Director or Deputy Director of Operations & Maintenance to submit to an examination by a physician without expense to the employee which shall only be for the purpose of determining his physical and mental condition relative to City employment.
Employees shall have the right to secure similar testing at their own expense from psychiatrists, psychologists or physicians of their own choosing. The employer and the employees shall only utilize the services of qualified, certified medical doctors, psychiatrists or psychologists. Where there is disagreement between physicians regarding an employee being medically released to return to work, a third physical specialized in the field of medicine involved shall be selected jointly by the disputing physicians. The decision of the third physician shall be final and binding. The cost of the third physician shall be borne by the City.
SECTION 8.3 - POLYGRAPH TEST: No employee shall be required to take a polygraph examination as a condition of retaining employment with the Employer nor shall they be subject to discipline for the refusal to take such.
SECTION 8.4 - EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM: The City agrees to provide an Employee Assistance Program to assist employees who are experiencing personal problems which the employee believes may be affecting his job performance. This program is available to all employees and their immediate family. Except as provided otherwise in this Agreement, employee participation in the Employee Assistance Program shall be voluntary, confidential, and not used for or considered in matters relating to performance evaluations, discipline or promotions. Participation in the program shall not be used as an excuse for his/her poor job performance.
15
ARTICLE 9 SENIORITY
SECTION 9.1 - DEFINITION OF SENIORITY: City seniority shall mean the continuous, full time employment with the employer beginning with the latest date of hire with the employer and shall include layoffs and other periods of absence authorized by and consistent with this Agreement. To accommodate earlier definitions of seniority for older employees, it is further agreed that persons employed as of the effective date of this Agreement shall retain City seniority dates as presently held. City seniority is to be used to determine the amount of fringe benefits earned.
Each member of the labor union covered by the Agreement shall have a seniority date that measures the length of continuous employment with the City while performing the work assigned to the union. Such seniority date is subject to Section 9.3 below. Union seniority may be used for the purpose of shift assignments, job bidding, selection of time off, selection of vacation times and for lay off/recall unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement. Where more than one (1) person is hired as a regular full time employee on the same date and any of those employee(s) hired was/were a temporary employee, seniority shall be determined first by the initial date of hire as a temporary employee and then by drawing numbers out of a hat with a union steward present. In the event two or more temporary employees are being hired as fall time employees and those temporary employees have the same hire date as a temporary employee, determination of seniority as a fall time employee shall be determined by drawing numbers out of a hat as provided above.
SECTION 9.2	- TERMINATION OF SENIORITY: Seniority and the employment relationship shall be terminated when an employee:
a.	Quits, resigns or retires;
b.	Is discharged (unless reversed by grievance procedure);
c.	Is absent without leave for three (3) consecutive working days without notifying the City except where failure to notify is due to documented circumstances beyond the control of employee
d.	Is laid off for a period of time which exceeds two years or is laid off and
fails to notify the City of his intent to report for work within seven (7) working days and will report within fourteen (14) days after having been recalled by certified letter to last known address Provided advance notice is given to the City during the seven (7) day period referenced above, the Parties agree to extend the fourteen (14) day period for a reasonable period of time due to unanticipated documented circumstances. Failure to notify or to return to work as provided above will not result in the loss of seniority where there is documentation of unanticipated reasonable circumstances beyond the control of the employee.
16
SECTION 9.3	- TRIAL EMPLOYMENT: When an employee accepts City employment outside of the work covered by this Agreement and returns within six (6) months, their Union seniority shall be deemed continuous. If they return after the end of six (6) months, their Union seniority shall start at the time they return to the Union position.
SECTION 9.4	- SENIORITY LIST: The City shall maintain and keep current a roster of the employees showing the applicable employment seniority for each employee. This roster shall be provided annually to the Union, upon request (email is sufficient).
ARTICLE 10
PROBATIONARY PERIODS
SECTION 10.1 - PROBATION PERIOD: All newly appointed employees will serve an original probation period of six (6) months. Temporary and/or part time employees do not serve, nor ever complete a probation period while in that status. However, any temporary or part-time employee will serve a probation period of six (6) months upon being hired as a regular employee (this period shall be reduced to three (3) months for temporary employees who have perform bargaining unit work a combined total of six months as a temporary employee before being made a regular employee.)
SECTION 10.2 - ORIGINAL PROBATION: At least twice during the probationary period (at two (2) months and at four (4) months), the supervisor shall give each probationary employee a written and oral evaluation of his work. Should a new employee's performance be judged unsatisfactory, the employee may be terminated. The decision of the City to retain or dismiss the employee shall be final and binding on all parties. This notification is to be made within two (2) weeks of the end of the probationary period.
The City may adjust the probationary period by the length of time equal to the length of any authorized leave of absence, period of light duty assignment or other approved breaks in service taken by the employee during the probationary period. If the cumulative break in service and/or period of light duty assignment during probation is more than two (2) months, the City may require the entire probationary period be restarted.
SECTION 10.3 - PROMOTIONAL PROBATION: The rules regarding evaluations for original probationers also apply to promotion. Should an employee, who was promoted from another classification within the same bargaining unit, not complete his probationary period, he shall be reinstated to his former position from which he was promoted.
ARTICLE 11
LAYOFF AND RECALL
SECTION 11.1 - NOTICE: Subject to the following, it is understood and agreed that the City retains the exclusive right to determine appropriate staffing levels and reserves the right to contract out work it deems necessary:
17
A.	If the employer adjusts staffing levels downward (during the month of December),
it shall notify the Union twenty 20 days prior to the intended effective date of the planned layoff. For the remainder of the year, a thirty (30) day notification period shall apply. The employer and Union will promptly meet to discuss alternatives and/or exceptions to Section 11.2. If alternatives to lay off are not found, employees to be laid off will be notified ten (10) working days prior to the effective date of the layoff.
B.	Where contracting out would result in the layoff of existing bargaining unit employees, the City will notify the Union at least 60 days before such contracting and will offer the Union an opportunity to meet and discuss the matter before the date of any existing bargaining unit employee is laid off as a direct result of such contracting out. Such good faith bargaining may include, among other items, the relative economic costs and the effects of such action upon existing bargaining unit employees who may be laid off as a result of such contracting. The grievance and arbitration procedures set forth in this Agreement may be implemented should the parties fail to reach agreement during bargaining.
C.	The length of notice or the duty to bargain contained in paragraphs A and B, do not apply to periods of declared emergency (natural and/or manmade disasters) situations.
SECTION 11.2- PROCEDURE FOR LAYOFF/RECALL: The exact procedure for layoff/recall is different for each labor organization and is covered by Letters of Understanding or side agreements.
ARTICLE 12
EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE
We believe that the purpose of the Collective Bargaining Agreement is to provide for an orderly collective bargaining relationship between the City and the Union, to encourage and improve efficiency and productivity, and to prevent work interruptions from interfering with the operations of the City. One area that plays a role in accomplishing this purpose is employee discipline.
In the interest of enhancing employee discipline, the Parties wish to adopt a new employeediscipline system. This new system, described in detail below, places a premium on correcting employee behavior through counseling. It also separates Minor Offenses from Major Offenses and places them on separate discipline tracks. The new disciplinary system seeks to balance the employees' need for certainty in how the City will administer discipline with the City's need to retain its broad authority under Article 3, Management Rights, to manage its workers.
1.	Therefore, in consideration of the above, the Parties agree that the Changes adopted here will last through the term of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement, which ends on November 30,2018
The City shall use the principles of progressive and corrective discipline to improve employee behavior and/or performance. However, when the severity of an infraction is great, discipline outside the normal progression, up to and including dismissal, may be considered an
18
appropriate remedy. It should be recognized that when using the principle of progressive discipline, all aspects of performance are taken into consideration. Individual infractions standing alone, may not warrant action beyond the first level, but when viewed cumulatively with other warnings, more extreme action may be appropriate, The City will not reprimand, relieve from duty, suspend, discharge, or discipline a non-probationary employee without just cause. If the City has reason to reprimand an employee, said reprimand shall be done in a manner that will not embarrass the employee before other employees or the public.
Minor and Major Offenses: The City and Union recognize that not all offenses are the same in terms of their seriousness and their effect on the safety and efficiency of the work environment. In light of this recognition, the Parties draw a distinction between Minor Offenses and Major Offenses, The Parties will treat each type differently as described in Sections 12.3 and 12.4 below.
Minor Offenses: Minor Offenses are those that are not Major Offenses, which are described in Section 12.4. There are two categories of Minor Offenses: 1) Preventable Vehicle Operation Accidents and Injuries; and 2) All Other Violations.
a.	Counseling: The Parties recognize that the purpose of progressive and corrective discipline is twofold. First, its purpose is to change an employee's behavior so that the behavior conforms to the needs of a safe and efficient workplace. Second, its purpose is to demonstrate the importance of following workplace rules by imposing progressively harsher discipline when an employee repeatedly violates rules.
To accomplish these dual goals, the City will implement counseling before starting an employee on the discipline track. The purpose of the counseling is to identify and correct employee behavior in a positive, non-threatening environment. Counseling is separate and distinct from discipline.
For Category 1 Minor Offenses, each employee shall receive one counseling session before the City places him or her onto the discipline track described below,
For Category 2 Minor Offenses, each employee shall receive one (1) counseling sessions before the City places him or her onto the discipline track described below.
For both Category 1 and 2 Offenses, if an employee receives a one-day suspension, the Parties shall schedule a counseling session to discuss the employee's behavior and performance issues. The purpose of this session is to find a solution to the problem to avoid the need for future discipline.
The City shall make a written record of the counseling session and shall furnish the employee and the Union with a copy of such record.
The Union agree that the City's issuance of verbal counseling shall not be a grievable action.
b.	Category 1 — Preventable Vehicle Operation Accidents and Injuries: A
19
Preventable Vehicle Operation Accident or Injury is an occurrence involving City vehicles or equipment that the offending employee could have avoided had he exercised due care in performing his work responsibilities. Counseling and discipline shall progress as follows:
1st offense—	Written	Warning
2nd offense—	1 to 3 day Suspension
3rd offense—	4 day Suspension or more
4th offense—	Subject	to Discharge
* As described above, the Parties shall schedule a counseling session when this discipline level occurs.
c.	Category 2 — All Other Violations: This Category includes All Other Violations, which are any work rule violation that does not rise to the level of a Major Offense, All Other Violations include Personnel Policy and Personal Protective Equipment violations and any other Minor Offense the City has just cause to discipline for, Counseling and discipline shall progress
as follows:	
1st offense—	Written Warning
2nd offense—	1 to 3 day Suspension
3rd offense—	4 day Suspension or more
4th offense—	Subject to Discharge
* As described above, the Parties shall schedule a counseling session when this discipline level occurs
Major Offenses: There is one category of major offenses.
d.	Major Offense: This type of offense is the more serious of the two categories and an
employee will be subject to suspension as well as possible discharge for even one offense. The following is a list of Major Offenses:
(i)	Willful destruction of City property;
(ii)	Fighting on the job;
(iii)	Possessing a weapon while on duty;
20
(iv)	Theft while on duty;
(v)	Making physical threats to any other person while on duty; and
(vi)	Gross insubordination;
(vii)	Unauthorized person in vehicle;
(viii)	Refusal to follow a direct and reasonable order from supervision;
(ix)	Recklessness resulting in serious accident while on duty;
(x)	Engagement in racial or other unlawful discrimination or harassment as defined in Title VII and/or City policy; and
(xi)	Any other employee action that the City determines, in its sole discretion, to rise to the level of a Major Offense. Examples of additional Major Offenses may include, but are not limited to the following: falsifying official documents; drinking while on duty; buying or selling illegal substances while on duty; theft of City property or property of another; having sex while on duty, indecent exposure while on duty; sleeping while on duty; distributing pornography while on duty; or bringing the City into disrepute. The City must have just cause to impose discipline under this subpart. The purpose of this subpart is to retain the City's discretion under Article 3, Management Rights.
e.	Pre-discipline Meeting: Before the City discharges or disciplines an employee for these Major Offenses, there shall be a pre-disciplinary meeting between the City, the employee, and the Union. At this meeting, the City will document the reason or reasons for the contemplated disciplinary action and disclose the names of witnesses and copies of relevant documents. The employee and the Union may present rebuttal evidence. After this meeting, the City will inform the employee and the Union in writing the discipline it gives the employee and the reasons for such discipline. If the employee and the Union wish to grieve the discipline decision, the grievance will proceed pursuant to the grievance procedure outlined in Article 5 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Personnel Department Records: The City shall retain counseling and disciplinaiy records of its employees as described below.
f.	Minor Offenses: Each offense has a corresponding period where counseling and discipline will remain on an employee's record. Because the counseling and disciplinary track for minor offenses escalate in seriousness with each new offense, the City will base record retention on each new offense. Thus, each counseling session or disciplinary action— including lower level offenses—shall remain on an employee's record until he or she is offense-free for the retention time period of his most recent offense. Once the employee goes without an offense for the entire corresponding duration, his entire record is removed and he starts back at the beginning of the disciplinary track.
21
Minor Offenses: Each Minor Offense shall have the following time periods:
Counseling-	1 year
Written warning—	1 year
1 day suspension—	2 years
3 day suspension—	2 years
More than 3 day suspension	3 years
g.	Major Offenses: Major Offenses shall remain on the employee's record indefinitely.
Progressive Discipline By Category: Discipline for Minor Offense Categories 1 and 2 are on separate tracks and thus an offense in one category will not be used to advance discipline in the other category
The Union recognize that Minor Offense Category 2 is a broad category of offenses. It includes offenses that vary in nature. Nonetheless, each Category 2 offense, regardless of nature, will advance an employee's discipline level within Category 2. For instance, a Personal Protective Equipment violation and a Personnel Policy violation will not advance along separate tiers in the Category 2 disciplinary track. Both types of offenses will advance the employee on the same Category 2 disciplinary track,
The City will not use Major Offenses to advance discipline in either Minor Offense category.
The City is free to use past Major Offenses, in determining discipline for a subsequent Major Offense.
Notification: If the City imposes disciplinary action or counsels an employee per Section 12.3.A, it shall furnish the employee and the Union a copy of any reports.
12.8 Right to Representation: Employees shall have the right to Union representation at all meetings with the City where the Employees reasonably fear that disciplinary action may result. No suspension or dismissal will occur without a prior offer to the employee to provide Union representation. If the Union Steward or a Business Manager is unavailable, the employee may select another employee from the unit to act as a witness.
Employer and Union Agreement: Nothing in Article 12 precludes or prohibits the City and the Union from agreeing to resolve disciplinary matters on a case-by-case basis without setting precedent or establishing a past practice.
22
ARTICLE 13 RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT
SECTION 13.1 - RESIDENCY: Employees shall establish and maintain their principal place of domicile in the City within 30 days of the end of their probationary period or one (1) year whichever is greater. At the conclusion of five (5) full years of active service and of Peoria City limits residence, they may establish and maintain their principal place of domicile within the City of Peoria or outside the City within a twenty (20) mile radius of Peoria City Hall.
On the effective date of this Agreement a current employee with less than five full years of Peoria City limits residence or a new employee hired on or after July 1, 2009 may elect to waive the Peoria City limits residence requirement by agreeing to forfeit 2% of his annual base salary for the time that remains on such Peoria City limits residence requirement. An employee who makes such election must complete a Waiver of Residency form at Human Resources prior to establishing the principal place of domicile outside the Peoria City limits. A probationary employee who elects to not establish Peoria City limits residency shall begin the five full year salary reduction period upon completion of the Waiver of Residency form.
An employee's unauthorized residency outside the city or county or twenty mile (20) radius from City Hall in violation of the applicable residency requirements established above shall be grounds for immediate dismissal. For the purpose of this Article, an employee's place of residency shall be considered to be his principal place of domicile.
The need to establish residency within the probationary period may cause an extreme hardship on individuals. In such cases, the Department Head may grant extensions of the time limit, not exceeding one year.
ARTICLE 14
