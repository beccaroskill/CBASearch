Local 1657 Reminds You to
KNOW your rights
As a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1657, you have the right to representation - a protection enjoyed by Union members. This right to representation safeguards you from making statements which may lead to discipline or dismissal and insures that management and security personnel follow proper questioning procedures.
The following are the steps you should take when management or security personnel wants to question you about an alleged violation of company policy. Ask if the conversation is disciplinary in nature or involves a security investigation. If the answer is yes, then:
1.	DEMAND UNION REPRESENTATION. Your right to Union representation is not automatic, nor is your employer required to inform you of this right.
2.	REFUSE TO PROCEED WITHOUT UNION REPRESENTATION. A questioner must be told of your desire for representation. Refusal to cooperate without explanation can be viewed as insubordination. If you are refused representation, stay in the room but remain silent - do not answer or explain your actions.
3.	DO NOT MAKE ANY WRITTEN OR VERBAL STATEMENTS OF GUILT OR INNOCENCE. You cannot be forced to make a statement. Remember, if you claim innocence you are still making a statement in a situation where no statement is the appropriate response.
4.	DO NOT WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO REPRESENTATION. If you proceed in questioning without representation, you have waived your right to representation and any statement you make can be used against you.
This rule does not apply to normal everyday conversations between an employee and supervisor which pertain to regular job duties or normal work performance.
