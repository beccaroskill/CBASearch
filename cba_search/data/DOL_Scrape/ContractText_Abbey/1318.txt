STANDARD INSIDE APPRENTICESHIP LANGUAGE
Section 6.01 There shall be a Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee (JATC) having three members representing the Penn-Del-Jersey Chapter of the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) and an equal number of three members representing Local Union 98 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). This Committee shall make local standards in conformity with the National Apprenticeship and Training Standards for the Electrical Contracting Industry governing the qualifications, selection, education, and training of all apprentices. The JATC shall also be responsible for training Journeymen and others. The Local standards will be promptly agreed upon by the parties to this Agreement and shall be registered with the National Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee and the appropriate State or Federal Apprenticeship Registration Agency.
Section 6.02 Members of the Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee shall be selected by the party they represent. Their term of office shall be three years unless removed by the party they represent. The term of one Employer and one Union representative shall expire each year with successors to be determined in the same manner as the original appointments were made. A Committee member may be re-appointed.
The Committee shall select from its membership, but not both from the same group, a Chairman and a Secretary who shall retain voting privileges.
The Committee shall meet at least once a month and also when called by the Chairman.
Section 6.03	(a) The Committee shall supervise all matters involving
apprenticeship training in conformity with the provisions of this Agreement and the registered local Apprenticeship Standards. In case of a deadlock, the matter in dispute shall be referred to the parties to this Agreement for settlement. Any proposed change in this Agreement pertaining to Apprenticeship and Training should first be considered by the Committee for their recommendation before being acted upon by the parties to this Agreement.
(b) The Committee may establish or authorize a Joint Subcommittee to be similarly constituted and selected for authorized training programs other than apprentice training programs.
15
Section 6.04	(a) In order to provide diversity of training or work

All transfer and assignments for work shall be issued by the Committee and the business office be so notified.
(b) The Committee is hereby instructed and authorized to employ a full-time Training Director at such time as is possible and practical. The Committee shall delegate to the Director that responsibility and authority deemed necessary by the Committee.
Section 6.05 All apprentices must enter the program through the Committee.
An apprentice may be removed from training at any period of apprenticeship for violation of Committee rules and policies. Such removal by the Committee cancels the classification of apprentice and the opportunity to continue on the job training (OJT) or classroom training.
Section 6.06 There shall be a minimum of six periods of apprenticeship. The first two periods, consisting of one-thousand OJT hours each and satisfactory completion of the first year of related classroom training, shall constitute the probationary period. Successive periods will require the minimum hours OJT and an additional year of related classroom training. The six periods are as follows:
Six Periods	OJT Hours	Related Training		
1	0-1000	Satisfactory Progress		
2	1000-2000	1st Year	School	Completed

The Committee will determine whether or not any individual Employer is entitled to an apprentice as well as the total number of apprentices to be assigned to the Employer.
The Committee shall allow each qualified Employer a ratio of one (1) first year apprentice to one (1) apprentice to three (3) Journeymen on any job or in any shop as shown below.
RATIO
1 Journeyman	1	Apprentice
1 Journeyman	1	Apprentice	1 First Year Apprentice*
2 Journeymen	1	Apprentice	1 First Year Apprentice
3 Journeymen	1	Apprentice	1 First Year Apprentice
4 Journeymen	2	Apprentices	1 First Year Apprentice
4 Journeymen	2	Apprentices	2 First Year Apprentices
etc.
* Denotes apprentice
in his/her probationary period (1st or 2nd period).
16
The first person on a job shall be a Journeyman.
A first year apprentice, as used above, may be an indentured apprentice in his/her probationary period, or an unindentured employed from the pool of qualified applicants.
Unindentureds shall be replaced by first year indentured apprentices when they are available for assignment.
First year apprentices may perform all tasks assigned by a General Foreman, Foreman, and/or Journeyman; however, they shall not work on or near live voltage circuits or systems.
If unable to furnish a first year indentured apprentice in accordance with the allowable ratio, the JATC shall assign the next available individual who was interviewed but not selected from the pool of applicants. If such a list does not exist, an individual applicant who has met all basic requirements for apprenticeship shall be assigned to the employer.
If the supply of apprentices (3rd through Sth period) is exhausted, then first or second period indentured apprentices may be used on a temporary basis to fulfill the apprentice ratio until successive period apprentices become available to replace them.
The hours worked as an unindentured shall not be credited toward apprenticeship should they later be selected for apprenticeship. Only indentured apprentices shall attend or participate in related training activities. An individual shall not be employed as an unindentured for more than 2000 hours cumulative.
The only benefit plans in which first year apprentices and unindentureds shall participate are local Health and Welfare Plans, and N.E.B.F.
Section 6.08 An apprentice is to be under the supervision of a Journeyman Wireman at all times. Journeymen are not required to constantly watch the apprentice, but are to lay out the work required and permit the apprentice to perform the work on his/her own. Journeymen are permitted to leave the immediate work area without being accompanied by the apprentice. Only a sixth period apprentice shall be permitted to work alone on any job without direct supervision of a Journeyman/Wireman.
Section 6.09 The parties to this Agreement shall be bound by the Joint Apprenticeship and Training Trust Fund Agreement which shall conform to Section 302 of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 as amended, ERISA and other applicable regulations.
The Trustees authorized under this Trust Agreement are hereby authorized to determine the reasonable value of any facilities, materials or services furnished by either party. All funds shall be handled and disbursed in accordance with the Trust Agreement.
Section 6.10 All Employers subject to the terms of this Agreement shall contribute two-percent (2%) of their gross monthly labor payroll for each hour worked by journeymen and apprentices above the 2nd period. This sum shall be due the Trust Fund by the same date as is their payment to the N.E.B.F. under the terms of the Employees Benefit Agreement.
