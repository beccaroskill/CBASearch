The Company may, at its sole discretion, discontinue the use of any four (4) day workweek schedule line(s) of work. Should the Company decide to discontinue the use of all four (4) day workweek schedules in a station, the Company will provide the Union a minimum of thirty (30) days notice. Where utilized, a four (4) day workweek will consist of four (4) scheduled work days and three (3) consecutive scheduled days off, except for those employees whose scheduled days off are Saturday, Sunday and Monday, or Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.

3.	Employees may be reassigned between duty assignments and job assignments on a given shift based on the needs of the service.
The Company will identify the affected employees, considering existing staffing levels in classifications, job assignments/duty assignments, starting times, and/or days off. Schedule adjustments and reassignments involving changes to shift start times, and/or days off be offered to affected employees in seniority order. Where there are insufficient volunteers, employees will be assigned in reverse seniority order.
In the event that these adjustments are expected to exceed thirty (30) days in duration, within the first thirty (30) days of such adjustment, the Company shall post the fourteen (14) day notice for a work schedule rebid for the affected duty assignment as provided in Paragraph K above.
The Company will establish as necessary the number of Lead Fleet Service Agents and Fleet Service Agents for the needs of the service on each shift in all duty assignments at any station, subject to the terms of this Agreement.
Employees returning to active duty from an authorized leave of absence or occupational injury will be assigned to their previous duty assignment.

A.	The Company shall determine the number of overtime hours to be worked. Overtime hours are defined as additional hours worked at the Company’s request over and above an employee's scheduled hours.
B.	Where the Company determines that overtime is required, such overtime will be offered to qualified employees on an equalized basis. All eligible employees will be considered available for overtime.
C.	Employees will be equalized for actual overtime hours worked and, if signed up on the overtime availability list, for actual overtime hours offered and refused and for those overtime hours for which the signed up employee could not be contacted, up to a maximum of sixteen (16) hours per day. Employees who do not sign up on the availability list will not be charged any hours eligible to work for the purpose of equalization unless they work the overtime. Daily overtime totaling less than thirty (30) minutes will not be charged for equalization purposes. A list will be established for each duty assignment and only those employees signed up will be contacted. Separate lists will be maintained for Lead Agents.
D.	Shift extension is overtime which is anticipated to be four (4) hours or less and is not the result of a part-time vacancy or absence. Shift extension overtime will be offered to those employees whose shift begins or ends closest to, but within four (4) hours, of the expected overtime need.
Shift extension will be offered in the following order:

1.	Furlough allowance is paid to employees who are furloughed as a result of a reduction-in-force and for no other reason.

more years of service, based on Hire Date, on the date furloughed will receive furlough allowance at the rate of one (1) week's pay for each completed year of service, up to a maximum of fifteen (15) weeks. A week of furlough allowance is computed on the basis of the employee's base straight time hourly rate at the time of furlough, multiplied by forty (40) hours.
3.	Part-time employees who have completed two (2) or
more years of service, based on Hire Date, on the date furloughed will receive furlough allowance at the rate of one (1) week's pay for each completed year of service, up to a maximum of ten (10) weeks. A week of furlough allowance is computed on the basis of the employee's straight time hourly rate, multiplied by the average number of regularly scheduled work hours per week during the preceding fifty-two (52) weeks, excluding overtime hours, extra hours and shift swap hours on or off.
4.	Furlough allowance is paid in successive pay periods immediately following the effective date of the furlough until the employee has returned to work or the entitlement is exhausted, whichever occurs first.

(Note: Employees do not accrue vacation in the months of June and October.)
C.	To be eligible for vacation accrual for the month, an employee must be active (not on a paid or unpaid leave of absence including occupational injury) for the majority of days in the calendar month. Employees receiving furlough allowance will not be eligible to accrue vacation.
D.	Vacation pay is computed at the employee’s regular rate of pay. For full-time employees a vacation day will be equal to the scheduled hours for the day.
1.	For part-time employees, the vacation day will be equal to the number of paid hours for which the employee was scheduled to work.
2.	For part-time open-time employees, vacation pay for
each vacation day during the vacation period will be equal to the daily average of the regularly scheduled paid hours the previous week. For a DAT vacation day, the day will be equal to the number of regularly scheduled paid hours for which the employee was scheduled to work.

number of employees from each classification/duty assignment permitted off at any time may be restricted based on the needs of service. Vacation bids may be bid separately by classification and/or duty assignment.
Vacations will be bid for the full calendar year and must be posted and bid by December 15 of the prior year. Vacations will be bid in full week increments on a single round basis and will be posted with all weeks beginning on Mondays.
Eligible full-time employees may elect to use up to one-hundred-twenty (120) hours, and eligible part-time employees may elect to use up to fifteen (15) days, of earned vacation time to be taken as Day-At-a-Time (DAT) vacation as provided for in Paragraph M. Prior to bidding vacation for the following year, employees will be required to designate the number of vacation weeks they will bid and the number of DAT hours/days they will set aside.
Awarded vacations periods will be scheduled concurrent with the employee’s regularly scheduled days off. These vacation periods will be assigned before or after the scheduled days off, so that the majority of the vacation days fall during the week that was awarded. Regularly scheduled days off for an open-time employee for an awarded vacation period will be Saturday and Sunday. The Company will adjust an open-time employee’s days off for the week following the vacation period to be Monday and Tuesday, if the employee was unable to successfully bid either Saturday and Sunday off the week prior to the awarded vacation period or Monday and Tuesday off the week following the awarded vacation period.
Vacations will be taken in the year earned. Employee vacation accruals in the current year may be taken in advance of time earned. If an employee terminates before the vacation time is actually earned, the unearned time will be deducted from his final paycheck.
Trading of vacation periods is not permitted, however, during a calendar year, vacation periods of five (5) days or

more that are available or become available, may be awarded to the senior Agent with a preferential bid on file for that vacation time period. This provision shall be subject to the needs of service and will not apply when the Company has less than 30 days notice of such vacated vacation period.
Agents transferring to a different station or different vacation bid area or part-time employees awarded permanent fulltime vacancies or full-time employees awarded part-time vacancies or Agents promoted to premium classifications shall be allowed to reschedule their vacation period(s) to available vacation weeks if their previous bid vacation periods are not available. If sufficient vacation weeks are not available, the Company will designate additional vacation weeks sufficient to accommodate the employee’s remaining vacation weeks.
Vacation earned but not taken during the calendar year will be paid during the first quarter of the following year. These days will be paid at the employee’s rate of pay on December 31 of the calendar year in which they were earned.
Employees will be required to bid a minimum of two (2) weeks vacation annually. DAT vacation requests must be submitted in writing by the employee no later than three (3) days prior to the requested day off. DAT vacation requests will be granted based on the needs of service in seniority order within the classification, duty assignment and shift. An employee will not be eligible for DAT vacation when on a scheduled day off, a Company recognized holiday, during a scheduled vacation period, or during a shift swap to work.
Upon an employee’s termination or retirement from the Company, unused accrued vacation will be paid at the employee’s current rate of pay. Employees who have a negative balance upon termination or retirement will be required to repay the days through payroll deduction.
Employees who fail to bid will be bypassed. Bypassed employees who report late for bidding will be permitted to select from any remaining open vacation weeks at the time

they report for bidding. Bypassed employees who fail to report for bidding during the bid process will be assigned vacation weeks from the remaining open vacation weeks.
Employees who have a negative vacation balance at the end of the year will be provided a letter indicating the number of negative hours, payroll deduction authorization and specified date for return of the signed payroll authorization. Employees will have the option to repay the negative vacation balance by having the subsequent year’s vacation accrual reduced by the negative vacation balance (hours for full-time employees and days for parttime employees). Payroll deductions will be at the employee’s rate of pay on December 31 of the calendar year in which the employee ends with a negative balance and will be deducted as follows:
1.	If the negative balance is eight (8) hours or less, the repayment will be a one-time lump sum deduction; or,
2.	If the negative balance is more than eight (8) but equal to or less than eighty (80) hours, eight (8) hours will be deducted from each bi-weekly pay check until the negative balance is repaid; or,
3.	If the negative balance is more than eighty (80) hours, the total number of negative hours owed will be divided by ten (10) and that amount will be deducted from each bi-weekly pay check until the negative balance is repaid.
Employees who do not return their payroll authorization letter by the required date, will have their subsequent year’s vacation accrual reduced by the number of hours (or days for part-timers) equal to their negative balance. Employees who do not have sufficient unbid vacation days in the subsequent year to cover their negative balance will have the appropriate number of vacation days cancelled from their bid vacation.

Article 21 - System Board of Arbitration
A.	In compliance with Section 204, Title II of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, there is hereby established a System Board of Arbitration (the Board) for the purpose of adjusting and deciding grievances which may arise under the terms of this Agreement.
B.	The Board shall consist of three (3) members; a neutral referee, a member selected by the Company and a member selected by the Union. Upon timely receipt of appeal from the Union to the Company’s Director of Arbitration, Labor Relations, or following submission of a Company grievance by the Vice President of Labor Relations to the Union and Company members of the Board, the Company’s Director of Arbitration, Labor Relations or his designee shall contact the designated representative of the Union to select a mutually agreeable arbitrator to serve as the neutral member of the Board.
C.	The neutral arbitrator shall be selected by the Company and the Union from an established panel of neutrals as described in Paragraph E. If the Company and the Union cannot agree upon the neutral member, they shall select him/her by alternately striking names from the panel. The order of striking shall be determined by coin toss for the first case in which a neutral member is chosen under these provisions and, in subsequent cases, the parties shall alternate taking the first strike. Either the Union or the Company, as the parties determine in each instance, shall contact the selected neutral, with appropriate notice to the other party, to determine his/her availability. Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon, if the neutral member selected for the particular case is unable to serve within ninety (90) days after his/her selection (or fifteen (15) days in the case of an expedited hearing), the neutral who remained on the list prior to the last strike shall be contacted as noted above. Such a procedure will be followed until a panel member is selected to hear the case.
D.	If the Company or the Union member of the Board considers a grievance which has been submitted to the Board to have

The parties shall select an Arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of this Article as expeditiously as possible. The Board hearing shall take place not more than fifteen (15) days following notice of the need for expedited hearing, or at such later date as the parties mutually agree.
The panel of neutrals shall consist of nine (9) neutrals. The parties shall agree on a panel of neutrals in the following manner:
1.	Each party shall provide to the other a list of eleven (11) neutrals within fourteen (14) days after the signing of this Agreement. Any names found on both lists will be deemed to be members of the panel. Any other names from either list, which can be agreed upon by the parties, will also be placed on the panel.
2.	Should the parties fail to agree upon a panel of nine (9) neutrals within forty-five (45) days after the signing of this Agreement, then either party may petition the National Mediation Board (the NMB) for a list of candidates consisting of the requisite number needed plus a number of additional candidates equal to three (3) times the number of remaining neutrals needed. Any candidate offered by the NMB shall be a member of the National Academy of Arbitrators. The parties will then use an alternate strike process to arrive at the necessary number of neutrals, with the order of striking to be determined by coin toss.
3.	Each panel member shall serve for a minimum period of twelve (12) months, effective on the date that the parties reach resolution on the first panel of thirteen. After a panel member has served for a twelve (12) month period, either the Company or the Union may serve notice to remove him/her by

Article 27	- Union Shop and Dues Check-Off Agreement
It is hereby agreed that there will be established a Union Shop under the Agreement as follows:
A.	In accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, all employees of the Company now or hereafter fully subject to the Agreement between the parties hereto shall, as a condition of their continued employment subject to such Agreement, become members of the Union within sixty (60) calendar days after the date they first perform compensated service as such employees after the effective date of this Agreement, and thereafter shall maintain membership in good standing in such Union; except that such membership shall not be required of any individual until he has performed forty-two (42) days (336 hours) of such compensated service within a period of twelve (12) consecutive calendar months. Nothing in this Agreement shall alter, enlarge or otherwise change the coverage of the Agreement.

employment, shall be governed by Paragraph A. of this Article.
C.	1. Nothing in this Agreement shall require an employee to become or to remain a member of the Union if such membership is not available to such employee upon the same terms and conditions as are generally applicable to any other member, or if the membership of such employee is denied, or terminated for any reason other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues, initiation fees, and assessments (not including fines and penalties) uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership in the Union. For the purpose of this section, dues, fees, and assessments shall be deemed to be "uniformly required" if they are required of all employees in the same work classification at the same time in the same Local Lodge.
2.	For the purpose of this Agreement, "Membership in good standing in the Union," shall mean that the employee is a member of the Union and is not more than sixty (60) days in arrears in the payment of initiation fees, assessments, and membership dues as referred to in Paragraph C.1.
3.	When an employee becomes delinquent or not "in good standing" within the meaning of Paragraph C.2. above, he shall be subject to discharge and the following procedures shall apply:
(a)	The General Chairman of the Union shall notify the employee in writing, Certified mail, return receipt requested, and copy to the Vice President of Customer Service of the Company, that he is delinquent in the payment of initiation fees, assessments or membership dues as specified herein, and accordingly is subject to discharge as an employee of the Company.

(b)	If, upon the expiration of the fifteen (15) day period, the employee still remains delinquent, the General Chairman of the Union shall certify in writing to the Vice President of Customer Service of the Company, with copy to the employee, that the employee has failed to make the required payment within the fifteen (15) day grace period provided in sub-paragraph (a) above, and is therefore to be discharged. The Vice President of Customer Service shall promptly notify the employee involved that he is to be discharged from the service of the Company, and shall so discharge him for his failure to pay or tender the initiation fees, dues, and assessments as required under the terms of this Article unless he files an appeal.
(c)	If the decision of the Vice President of Customer Service is not satisfactory to the employee or to the Union, it may be appealed directly to the highest officer of the Company designated to handle such appeals.

The Company shall promptly notify the other party in writing of any such appeal. The decision of such appeal shall be rendered within ten (10) calendar days of the date the appeal is taken and the employee

(d)	Such decision on appeal shall be final and binding unless within seven (7) days thereof the Union requests in writing that the decision be reviewed in such joint conference by the Vice President of Customer Service or by his designated representative, and the General Chairman, or by his designated representative. If such request is made, the decision on appeal shall be reviewed in such joint conference within seven (7) days of the date such request is received, and any decision rendered within such seven (7) day period shall be final and binding. If the decision on such review is that the employee has not complied with the terms of this Agreement, his employment and seniority in that class or craft shall be terminated within ten (10) calendar days of the date of said decision, unless the Company and the Union agree otherwise in writing.
D.	An employee discharged by the Company under the provisions of Paragraph C. shall be deemed to have been discharged for non-payment of Union dues, and notation so made on his employment record.

3.	If sufficient earnings do not remain after other deductions as noted above for each pay period during the month, or if there are employees on the payroll that do not have on file with the Company an authorization for dues deductions as per Paragraph

Re: Flexible Spending Account
April 5, 1999
Thomas F. Brickner
Grand Lodge Representative I.A.M.A.W.
Dear Mr. Brickner:
This will confirm the Company's intent to continue the Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Program. The program will consist of two reimbursement accounts, one for eligible medical care expenses and the other for eligible dependent care expenses.
The FSA Program will be designed to permit Fleet Service employees to contribute a portion of their compensation through payroll deduction into one or both accounts on a pre-tax basis. These payroll deductions shall not reduce pay-related benefits for the purposes of retirement, disability or life insurance benefits, to the extent permitted by law. As employees submit claims for eligible expenses throughout the year, they will be reimbursed from their accounts. Elections by employees to contribute to FSA's must be made prior to the beginning of the plan year. No changes in elections are permitted during the plan year except in the event of a change in family status, as defined under the USAir Medical Plan. Amounts not reimbursed and remaining in the FSA's at the end of the plan year will be used to reduce expenses incurred in the administration of the plan. Covered expenses are determined by the Company.
Maximums that may be excluded from tax during any taxable year will be established in accordance with Internal Revenue Code provisions. Periodic non-discrimination testing may impact plan participation.
Sincerely,
/s/John M. Hedblom

Re: Labor Protective Provisions
April 5, 1999
Mr. Thomas F. Brickner
Grand Lodge Representative I.A.M.A.W
Dear Mr. Brickner:
This is to confirm the understanding reached between US Airways, Inc. (the “Company”) and the I.A.M.A.W. (the “Union”) during negotiations for the initial 1999 Fleet Service collective bargaining agreement (the “Agreement), regarding employee protections in the event of a merger.
(1)	The Company agrees that, in the event of a merger with another air carrier (other than a carrier within the US Airways control group), where all or substantially all of the assets and operations of the other air carrier are integrated with those of the Company, the Company shall provide to the Company’s employees covered by this agreement the seniority integration procedures of Sections 3 and 13 of the Allegheny-Mohawk Labor Protective Provisions: provided, however, that said procedures will not be provided, if and to the extent they are in conflict with contractual or legal obligations of the other carrier.
(2)	If the Company’s employees covered by this Agreement are furloughed within six (6) months of the Company’s merger with another air carrier, and the furlough is a direct result of said merger, the Company will pay to the furloughed employees, in lieu of the furlough allowance otherwise required by this Agreement, a sum of money equal to two times the furlough allowance provided for under this

Re: Retirement Lump Sum
April 5, 1999
Mr. Thomas F. Brickner
Grand Lodge Representative I.A.M.A.W
Dear Mr. Brickner:
This is to confirm the understanding reached between US Airways, Inc. (the “Company”) and the I.A.M.A.W. (the “Union”) during negotiations for the initial 1999 Fleet Service collective bargaining agreement (the “Agreement”). The following will apply:
Pension Supplement. (a) Any Fleet Service employee who (i) as of January 1, 1999, was age 60 or over and had five or more years of service with the Company; (ii) as of January 1, 1999 has an accrued benefit in the Retirement Plan for Certain Employees of US Airways, Inc. (the “Retirement Plan”); (iii) elects benefit commencement under the Retirement Plan on or after attaining age 62; and (iv) at the time of benefit commencement has a “total pension benefit” (as defined in subsection (b)) of less than $51.00 per month per year of service, will receive a pension supplement of $5,000 when he or she commences benefits under the Retirement Plan.
(b)	For purposes of this section, an employee’s “total pension benefit” equals the sum of: (i) the monthly benefit payable in the form of a single life annuity under the Retirement Plan (the defined benefit plan), (ii) the monthly benefit payable in the form of a single life annuity under the US Airways, Inc. Employee Pension Plan (the money purchase plan), and (iii) the monthly benefit payable in the form of a single life annuity as a result of Profit Sharing Contributions under the US Airways, Inc. Employee Savings Plan (the 401(k) plan). The total pension benefit shall be calculated as of an employee’s actual benefit commencement date under the Retirement Plan, based on the monthly benefits payable to the employee at that time.

Re: Transfers
June 1, 2000
Tom Miklavic
Assistant General Chairman
I.A.M.A.W.
Dear Mr. Miklavic,
The following will confirm our conversation regarding the transfer of employees who have not completed the minimum stay of one (1) year for system transfers pursuant to Article 8, paragraph F.5 of the fleet service contract.
The Company will consider transfer requests on a case-by-case basis from employees meeting the following criteria:
•	Completion of at least six (6) months of the one (1) year minimum stay requirement
•	Satisfactory performance
•	The employee’s transfer does not adversely affect staffing requirements in the vacating position and/or deplete company resources
•	The hiring location is recruiting/hiring outside the company.
Based on these criteria, the Company reserves the right to approve transfers for employees who have not met their one (1) year minimum stay requirement.
Sincerely,

RE: Vacation Balances for Transferred Employees
October 17, 2001
Mr. Randy Canale
President and Directing General Chairman
District 141 - IAMAW
Dear Randy,
This letter will confirm our conversation regarding the vacation balances for employees who transfer from full-time to part-time or part-time to full-time.
Employees transferring from full-time to part-time or part-time to full-time will receive payment for the current year’s vacation days accrued but not used as of the effective date of the transfer, or reimburse the company through payroll deduction for vacation days used but not accrued as of the effective date of the transfer.
The company will make every effort to allow employees to have a minimum of two (2) weeks of vacation time off in a calendar year. In the event that a fleet service employee who is paid for their vacation balance upon transfer, will be unable to accrue and take a minimum of two (2) weeks of vacation time off with pay, the company will consider requests for vacation time off without pay to accommodate a minimum of two (2) weeks off in the calendar year.

Dear Randy,
This letter will confirm our conversation regarding the Company’s agreement to enhance the benefits offered in Article 22, B.1.c regarding family medical and dental coverage for employees displaced from full-time Fleet Service positions to part-time positions.
Full-time employees working in Fleet Service on the effective date of the collective bargaining agreement, who are subsequently affected (from a non-closed station) will be eligible for family medical and dental coverage upon recall to part-time only if they listed part-time within their location on their displacement bid form at the time of their displacement but were not awarded part-time during the displacement exercise based on their relatively junior classification date. Full-time employees (except those in closed stations) who did not elect to list part-time in their location on their displacement bid form will not be eligible for family medical and dental coverage upon recall to part-time.
Full-time employees working in Fleet Service on the effective date of the collective bargaining agreement, who are subsequently affected as a result of the closure of their station, will be eligible for family medical and dental coverage upon recall to part-time in their new location.

Employment and other conditions at Wholly Owned Carriers
A.	US Airways shall request PSA, Piedmont, and Allegheny (hereafter “Wholly Owned Carriers”) to make job offers and employ furloughed Employees who apply for Wholly Owned Carrier Vacancies in accordance with the following provisions. It is recognized, however, that US Airways does not control the hiring and employment policies of the Wholly Owned Carriers, and thus cannot be responsible for their compliance with these provisions. US Airways will request that the Wholly Owned Carriers indicate, in writing, within seven (7) days of the agreement between the Company and the Union, whether they will comply with the provisions below.
1.	Employees who are furloughed on or after the effective date of this agreement who desire transfer to a Wholly Owned Carrier Vacancy will be required to notify the Wholly Owned Carrier and submit their application to the Wholly Owned Carrier. Employees who are on furlough as of the effective date of this agreement who are interested in applying for Vacancies at the Wholly Owned Carrier must submit their application to the Wholly Owned Carrier within forty-five (45) days of the date that the Wholly Owned Carrier notifies the Employee that it will begin to accept applications. Applications must include all locations for which the employee is applying.
2.	The Wholly Owned Carrier will be requested to offer employment to any qualified furloughed Employee who has applied under the terms stated in item (1) above prior to employing anyone else in that Vacancy. As employment opportunities become available, the Wholly Owned Carrier will be requested to offer such positions in relative seniority order to qualified Employees who have submitted applications in accordance with this Agreement.

Re: "Back to Back" Shift Swaps
March 10, 2003
Tom Miklavic
Assistant General Chairman
DL 141 - IAMAW
Dear Mr. Miklavic:
The following will confirm our understanding regarding the company and union agreement regarding the allowance of back to back double shift swaps. This agreement is cancelable by either party subject to a thirty- (30) day notification:
1.	Employees may shift swap to work back to back double shifts, once per workweek.
2.	The company may disapprove any shift swap for any employee where the company finds that there is evidence of a pattern of abuse and/or evidence that the employee's productivity, safety, or job performance is adversely affected as described in item 5 below.
3.	There must be a minimum of 7 hours of rest between each of the double shifts worked back to back.
4.	Back to back double shift swaps will not be approved for any employee who is on a Level II or higher of the attendance control program.
5.	In the event that the company finds any evidence of an adverse impact on the employee's performance, productivity or safety, the employee's manager shall discuss the concerns with the employee. Following the discussion, should the company again find further indications of an adverse impact to the employee's productivity, safety, or job performance then the employee's back to back shift swaps will be suspended for six (6) months. Any grievance filed as a result of the suspension of back to back double shift swaps will be limited to the factual question of whether the employee was advised of the company concerns over the adverse impact to their performance, safety or productivity and such grievance will end prior to the System Board of Arbitration step of the grievance process.

1) Retired employees may apply thirty three (33) accrued sick pay hours per month up to a maximum of 1200 hours, valued at $11.26/hour, to your pre-65 medical premium
- Retired employees will be responsible for medical premium costs in excess of $371.58. Monthly contributions will be calculated as the total cost of the plan and level of coverage you elect less $371.58. Premium Equivalents will be recalculated annually based on the Plan’s experience. The chart below compares monthly Premium Equivalents under the current program to those currently estimated for the new program. Please note that the 2005 Current Program rates were developed using Active employee rates and the new program uses “true” pre 65 employee rates. It should also be noted that the new program costs for 2005 are estimated only and the actual 2005 rates may vary. The 2005 rates for the new program will be finalized by early December.

- Once accrued sick pay has been exhausted retired employees will have the option to move to an “access only” medical plan where they will be responsible for paying 100% of the medical premium until they reach age 65. The medical premium for this “access only” plan will be different than the medical premiums for those using accrued sick pay to purchase the benefit and will be based on plan experience for the “access only” group.
2)	In lieu of #1 above, employees may receive a one-time cash payment in the amount equal to $9.20 times the number of accrued sick leave hours in their sick bank up to a maximum of 1200 hours.
- Choosing to receive this one-time payment means that the employee and their dependents will not be able to participate in the pre or post-65 health care programs, including the “access only” plan noted above.
3)	At age 65 retired employees and their dependents will not be eligible to participate in or have access to any post-65 medical plan through US Airways.

RE: Fleet Bidding
May 9, 2005
Randy Canale
President and Directing General Chairman
District 141 - I.A.M.A.W.
Dear Randy,
Pursuant to our most recent discussions, the Company is willing to change past interpretation of Article 9.3.C, regarding bidding freeze while on furlough as follows:
Fleet Service employees who have currently received furlough notice awards, or going forward who receive furlough notice awards, but who remain active prior to their designated furlough date, will not be prohibited from filing system transfer requests while on active status to stations which were listed as available on their furlough notice. Such employees may submit bids for system transfers to any location, including locations offered during the displacement process which the employee did not list on their displacement bid.
This change in interpretation regarding the bidding freeze is applicable only while the employee is in an active status prior to furlough. Effective with the employee’s furlough date, these transfer requests will not be considered for locations offered during the displacement process which the employee did not list on their displacement bid and such employee will be prohibited from submitting system transfers to these locations for a period of one (1) year from the effective date of their furlough.

Re: Seniority for furloughed fleet service employees
July 14, 2008
William Chandlee
Assistant General Chairman
IAMAW- District 141
Dear Mr. Chandlee:
The following will confirm our agreement regarding the application of Article 7, paragraph H for classification seniority for furloughed fleet service employees who transfer/accept positions outside of fleet service classifications other than shift manager.
The Union’s position is that the provisions of Article 7.H. do not apply to fleet service employees furloughed to the street that transfer/accept positions outside of fleet service classifications other than shift manager. Therefore the Union and Company agree that a furloughed fleet service employee that accepts a position outside of fleet service will continue to maintain but not accrue all previous fleet service classification and pay seniority for the duration of their recall. Should their recall rights expire or they refuse recall, they forfeit all previous feet service classification and pay seniority.
Article 7.G. will continue to apply to furloughed fleet service employees that accept shift manager positions. Such employees will continue to maintain but not accrue all previous fleet service classification and pay seniority.
Sincerely,
/s/Ron Harbinson

Letter of Agreement re: Four-Day Work Week Schedules
Dear Mr. Delaney:
This will confirm our agreement to modify the collective bargaining agreement to permit shifts of more than eight-and-one-half (8 ^) hours and a work week of four scheduled work days. Prior to the initial implementation of a four-day work week in a station after Operational Employee Integration (OEI), the Company must have mutual agreement from the Union. Once the Company has agreement from the Union to permit four-day work week schedules in a station the following applies:
1.	Notwithstanding Article 5.A, the Company will, at its sole discretion, determine which lines of work in the station may have a four-day work week schedule and the time frame for implementation of any four-day work week schedule. The Company may utilize a four-day work week schedule in any duty assignment or for certain lines of work within any duty assignment which may be modified as determined by the Company. The Company may, at its sole discretion, discontinue the use of any four-day work week schedule line(s) of work. Should the Company decide to discontinue the use of all four-day work week schedules in a station, the Company will provide the Union a minimum of thirty (30) days notice. Where utilized, a 4-day work week will consist of four (4) scheduled work days and three (3) consecutive scheduled days off, except for those employees whose

Pursuant to this Agreement Regarding Seniority List Integration (this “Agreement”), US Airways, Inc. and any successor (collectively, “US Airways”), American Airlines, Inc. and any successor (collectively “American”), the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (“IAM”), and the Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO (“TWU") (collectively, the “Parties”), hereby agree as follows:
1.	On January 25,2013, US Airways, American, and the TWU entered a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) addressing certain issues in the event a plan of reorganization becomes effective that includes the merger of American or an affiliate of American with US Airways or an affiliate of US Airways (“American/US Airways POR”) and that effectuates a combination of American and US Airways into a single entity (“New American Airlines”). In Paragraph 5 of the MOU, the parties to the MOU addressed seniority list integration between the TWU and the appropriate employee representative^) of US Airways’ pre-merger (i) Fleet Service Employees, (ii) Maintenance Control Technician Employees, (iii) Mechanic and Related Employees (including all accreted classifications), and (iv) Stock Clerk Employees — all of which are currently represented by the IAM.
2.	This Agreement supersedes and replaces Paragraph 5 of the MOU. US Airways, American and TWU agree that all other terms of the MOU remain in effect, and are in no way changed or altered by this Agreement.
3.	The TWU and IAM agree that seniority list integration for each of the four employee groups listed in Paragraph 1 of this Agreement shall be based on the date of each employee’s entry into the basic classification, as set forth in the existing Collective Bargaining Agreements and the current seniority lists maintained by American and US Airways for each such group. To the extent that two or more employees have the same date of entry into the Classification, placement on the applicable integrated seniority list as to those employees shall be determined by the date of hire, or if that is also the same, the last four digits of their social security number, with the employee with the lower number being assigned a lower seniority number on the list (having higher seniority).
4.	The TWU and the IAM shall complete the seniority list integration process for each of these four groups as soon as practicable. Once the seniority list integration process is completed and the integrated seniority list is published, an affected employee may only challenge his or her placement on the list, but solely on the grounds that (i) his/her dale of entry into the basic classification has not been calculated correctly or (ii) that he/she has not been placed on the integrated seniority list in accordance with the terms of this Agreement The TWU and IAM will form a committee to address and resolve any individual challenges, which
172
Letters Of Agreement/Understanding
must be raised by submitting a letter identifying the alleged problem to the committee within 30 days after the integrated seniority list is published.
5.	New American Airlines shall accept the resulting integrated seniority list for each of these four groups provided that:
a.	The integrated seniority lists shall have only prospective effect from their respective date of implementation by New American Airlines.
b.	There shall be no “system flush” whereby an employee may displace another employee from the latter’s position as a result of the implementation of the integrated seniority lists or the implementation or expiration of any condition or restriction contained in the integrated seniority lists;
c.	Employees on furlough status at the time the applicable integrated seniority list is implemented may not bump or displace employees in active status at that time; and
d.	The integrated seniority lists shall not contain conditions or restrictions that increase the costs associated with training above those normally associated with the merger of two airlines.
6.	New American Airlines shall not implement the integrated seniority list for any of these four groups until implementation of a single collective bargaining agreement governing the combined employee workforce of that group.

Mr. Richard Delaney
President and Directing General Chairman
IAMAW District Lodge 141

Elk Grove Village, IL 60007
Dear Mr. Delaney:
This letter will confirm our agreement regarding the application of excise tax or other penalty included in The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) or any excise tax or penalty which may replace the PPACA.
In the event the Company determines that any of the PPO 100, 90 or 80 percent plan design options provided for in this Agreement (each a “Plan”) would be or become subject to an excise tax or other penalty under applicable law (and thus become an “Affected Plan”), the Company will meet and confer in good faith in order to reach an agreement with the Union concerning the minimum modification or modifications to the affected Plan necessary to avoid application of the excise tax or other penalty. The Company shall provide to the Union information that the Union reasonably requests, including actuarial reports, necessary for the Union’s design and consideration of such modifications. Unless otherwise agreed, any agreed modification shall become effective at the time the excise tax or penalty would become applicable in respect of the Affected Plan (the “Affected Plan Date”).
If the Company and the Union are unable to agree on modifications necessary to avoid the application of the excise tax or other penalty on the Affected Plan within ninety (90) days after the initial meeting, an arbitrator shall immediately be selected in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement to determine the modifications to the design of the Affected Plan that will become applicable. The authority of the arbitrator is expressly limited to establishing those modifications to the design of the Affected Plan that will ensure that no excise tax or other penalty will apply. If the arbitrator determines that no reasonably practical modification to the Affected Plan can

guarantee that no excise tax or other penalty will apply, the Company shall have the right to terminate the availability of the Affected Plan to the Fleet Service employees. If, under the preceding sentence, the Company has terminated or would have the right to terminate the availability to the Fleet Service employees of all three Plans, the arbitrator will be empowered to designate an alternative plan design (a “New Plan”) that is available from the Company provider and that replicates the provisions of the 80 percent plan to the greatest possible extent without causing the New Plan to become subject to any excise tax or other penalty. In the event that the arbitrator has not issued a determination prior to the excise tax or penalty becoming due or if such penalty or excise tax is otherwise owed for any reason, notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, the Company shall be permitted to implement such modifications to the design of the Affected Plan as it considers to be necessary to avoid the excise tax or penalty. The Company shall have a reasonable period of time following the issuance of the arbitrator’s determination to implement the New Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Letter of Agreement shall not be effective if, after the effective date of this Agreement, the Company enters into any new or amended collective bargaining agreement having a term of three (3) years or more with any union group that does not contain a provision substantially similar to this Letter of Agreement.
In the event a plan is modified pursuant to this Letter of Agreement (LOA), employees will be afforded the opportunity through an open enrollment period to elect a different plan, prior to the implementation of any modified plan.
