This Section covers employees of the Employer who are covered by this Agreement. It expresses the understanding of the Employer and the Union concerning Employer contributions to the Health and Welfare Plan on behalf of such employees and their dependents, as applicable.
15.2	Trust Fund
All Employer contributions referred to in this Article shall be paid into the General Employees Trust Fund, at the address designated by the Trustees. It is understood that all questions concerning eligibility of employees for coverage, including the commencement and termination of coverage, shall be determined by the Trustees of said Trust Fund.
The Employer agrees to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust (as amended) of the General Employees Trust Fund, and any plan documents or summary plan description thereof, as each of these may from time to time be amended by the Board of Trustees, and hereby acknowledges prior receipt of a copy thereof.
The Employer shall comply with all the provisions of the General Employees Trust Fund and shall maintain, furnish and make available for audit such data and records as the Trustees may require, as provided in the Agreement and Declaration of Trust of the General Employees Trust Fund.
An Employer which requests that an audit take place out of the jurisdictional area of this Agreement shall reimburse the Trust Fund for all additional costs incurred by the Fund Auditors to include travel and out of pocket expenses.

If any employee works the required number of hours in the month but is not listed by the Employer, the Employer shall be personally liable and fully responsible for all claims that may be incurred by such employee in the same amounts as though the employee had in fact been listed. This personal liability, however, does not in any way relieve the Employer of his liability to make payments under this Agreement.

When possible the Employer agrees to implement IRS Code 125 upon effectuating this Agreement. This allows employees to set aside a portion of their compensation before taxes to make contributions toward the cost of health insurance.

If, as a result of any federal or state law which may become effective subsequent to the effective date of this Agreement, the level of Health and Welfare benefits provided by such law for any group of employees, or their dependents, is lower in certain categories of services than that provided hereunder, the parties shall request that the General Employees Trust Fund, to the extent practicable and necessary, provide a plan of benefits supplementary to the federal or state benefits so as to make benefits in each category of coverage as nearly comparable as possible to the benefits provided hereunder. Employers need only expend for this purpose the actual amount required to achieve parity, if necessary, between the benefits provided under any federal state plan as supplemented in the manner hereinabove described.
If any such law requires payment by the Employers party to this Agreement to a specified plan or fund which is separate from the Health and Welfare provided under this Agreement, the Union and the Employers shall meet to agree on a means of implementing such requirements, and if applicable shall seek a plan of benefits from the General Employees Trust Fund which supplements the federal or state benefits so as to provide benefits in each category comparable to those provided under this Agreement. The Employer shall not be required to pay for duplicate coverage, or to pay duplicate health care costs for the same types of benefits, for the same employee as a result of such new federal or state law. It is understood that “duplicate health care costs” could include a new tax to the extent that such new tax pays for duplicate health care coverage for employees covered under this Agreement.
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MAINTENANCE CONTRACTORS AGREEMENT - 2008-2012 - P. 15
The Employers and the Union shall meet to discuss any other necessary adjustments to the Health and Welfare provisions of this Agreement caused by federal or state legislation on health care.

ARTICLE XX	- GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
20.1	Procedure
Any difference between the Employer and the Union involving the meaning or application of the provisions of this Agreement shall constitute a grievance and shall be taken up in the manner set forth in this section. A grievance need not be
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MAINTENANCE CONTRACTORS AGREEMENT - 2008-2012 - P. 18
considered unless the aggrieved party serves upon the other party a written statement setting forth the facts constituting the alleged grievance. For a discharge case grievance, such notice must be served within ten (10) days from the date of discharge. Such written statement concerning any other type of grievance must be served within fifteen (15) days of its occurrence or the discovery thereof by the aggrieved party. Probationary employees do not have recourse to the grievance procedure to grieve disciplinary matters. It is the intent of the parties that reasonable diligence be used in the discovery and reporting of alleged grievances so that they may be adjusted or dismissed without undue delay.
20.2	Steps 1 and 2
The Employer and the Union agree to use their best endeavors by informal conferences between their respective representatives to settle any grievance within ten (10) days after service of such written statement. Upon receipt of a timely written request there shall be an Adjustment Board consisting of two (2) representatives designated by the Union and two (2) representatives from the Employer. Said board shall meet within thirty (30) days from the filing of the written grievance, or the grievance is automatically waived, unless the time limit is mutually extended by both parties in writing.
Either party may request the following procedure for any Adjustment Board meeting. The chairperson of the Adjustment Board shall be a representative designated by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The chairperson shall be a non-voting member of the Adjustment Board but shall meet with the panel to assist and offer advisory opinion(s) in an effort to help the panel reach a decision. The Board shall render a decision upon adjournment of the hearing, or by mutual agreement extend such hearing for a period not to exceed ten (10) days.
The mediator shall be chosen from the following list of mediators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service:
Lydia Baca
Gregory Lim
Joel Schaffer
David Weinberg
Jerry Allen
Whichever mediator from the above list who is available on the earliest date available to the parties shall be selected to attend the Board of Adjustment. The parties shall agree upon on a timeline for the mediated Board of Adjustment to be held at the time that either party requests the above procedure. The parties may also mutually agree to modify the list of mediators.
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MAINTENANCE CONTRACTORS AGREEMENT - 2008-2012 - P. 19
It is expressly understood that if operating conditions do not allow non-adversary participants, this rule may be modified by mutual agreement as well as time limits.
The Adjustment Board shall meet as required and shall consider fully all aspects of the issues presented. Any decision by the majority of the four (4) members of the Board of Adjustment shall be final and binding upon all parties subject to the limitations of jurisdiction and authority contained in this Contract.
20.3	Arbitration
If during the period that the Adjustment Board can meet, no majority decision is reached either party may within fifteen (15) days following such period request in writing that the matter be referred to arbitration. The referral to arbitration must be done within thirty (30) days after the Board of Adjustment or the right to arbitrate is waived. If the parties cannot agree upon a person to act as an impartial arbitrator within five (5) days after service of such demand, then an impartial arbitrator shall be named by agreement from a list of five (5) arbitrators supplied by the State of Conciliation Service. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final; and binding on both parties hereto. The arbitrator shall have no power to amend or modify the terms of this Agreement. In the event of willful failure by either party to appear before the Arbitrator he is hereby authorized to render his decision upon the evidence produced by the party appearing. Each party shall bear all costs of presenting its case to the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator's fee and all incidental expense of the arbitration shall be borne by the parties hereto.
The Arbitrator shall not award to an employee back pay for a period beginning more than thirty (30) days prior to the date on which the employee made a written claim or filed a grievance; the Employer must make available a means by which employees can make written claims of pay disputes. This provision shall not apply to scheduled wage increases or benefit increases under this Agreement.
20.4	Expedited Arbitration
A.	Differences between the Employer and the Union shall be referred to the (new) Expedited Arbitration provisions upon mutual agreement of both the Union and the Employer.
B.	The Employer and the Union shall each designate two (2) representatives who shall meet and work out all the details of an Expedited Arbitration system, such as arbitrator selections, calendaring logistics, billing/notification arrangements, and all other logistics.

1)	The parties shall meet promptly to select mutually acceptable arbitrators.
2)	If they are unable to agree within thirty (30) days of the date of ratification of this Agreement, or the opening on the panel, they shall then exchange lists of five (5) arbitrators each within the following seven (7) days. An arbitrator whose name appears on both lists shall be considered mutually acceptable. If the initial exchange does not result in the selection, the parties shall exchange additional lists within succeeding seven (7) day period until the required number of arbitrators has been selected.
21.3	The Arbitrator shall be the sole arbitrator to hear and determine the matter. Such hearing shall be held within ten (10) days after the arbitrator receives notification of the dispute. The arbitrator shall consider and decide the grievance and shall render a decision immediately after hearing and consideration of all evidence presented. The arbitrator may request and upon mutual agreement of both parties to the dispute receive additional time to deliberate on the matters presented but in no case shall the decision be delayed beyond the forty-eight (48) hours following the close of the hearing.
21.4	The Arbitrator shall orally advise the parties of his decision with a brief explanation of the basis thereof. He shall make a brief, signed note upon the written grievance stating his disposition of the matter. Such decision shall be final and binding on all parties to the dispute and the aggrieved employee, but shall not be considered as a precedent in any future proceeding.
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MAINTENANCE CONTRACTORS AGREEMENT - 2008-2012 - P. 21
21.5	Any arbitration held under the provisions of this Step Three shall be conducted as informally as possible, consistent with a full and fair hearing of the issues.

21.9	In the event either party believes the matters raised by a grievance are of such importance as to override the desirability of the expedited and informal arbitration procedures contained in this Article, such party shall advise the other in writing of its desire to proceed to arbitration under the provisions of Article XX of this Agreement, wherein the parties are not limited to representation by any person of their choice.
21.10	The Arbitrator shall not award to an employee back pay for a period beginning more than thirty (30) days prior to the date on which the employee made a written claim or filed a grievance; the Employer must make available a means by which employees can make written claims of pay disputes. This provision shall not apply to scheduled wage increases or benefit increases under this Agreement.

2.	Small Master Contract Sites (Area 2V, Section 5.F)
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MAINTENANCE CONTRACTORS AGREEMENT - 2008-2012 - P. 77
3.
New Non-Union Small Sites (Area 2W, Section 10)
11.10	The following rules shall be observed when an Employer is bidding on or taking over the servicing of an establishment where the Union represents the existing employees:
A.	When requesting staffing information from the Union, the requesting Employer must provide the Union with the client’s RFQ cover page or similar documentation demonstrating that the account is out to bid.
When staffing is requested for a building which has been put out to bid, the incumbent contractor shall provide the Union within four (4) work days the number of employees, names, daily hours worked, vacation and sick leave accrual, medical plan and wage rates, including regular employees temporarily off work with Employer authorization.
Only when the Union has received the client’s RFQ cover page or similar documentation that a building is going out to bid, and can provide that documentation to the incumbent Employer, shall the incumbent Employer be obliged to supply this detailed information.
The Union agrees to supply such requested information within seven (7) calendar days to any Union contractor requesting such information or the Employer is not obligated to any staffing levels. The appropriate staffing levels shall be considered as the number of employees on the job sixty (60) days prior to such building being put out to bid. In any case, the new Employer shall be held harmless from any errors and omissions by the Union.
B.	The Employer shall not reduce the number of working hours per day or per week except when it is verified that the service specifications of a job are altered by the client; then the Employer may increase or decrease the work force pursuant to the terms of the new specifications.
C.	Previous employees shall be continued on the job as probationary employees for a sixty (60) day period. During this probationary period, the Employer may terminate the employment of any such employee with just cause and such termination shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of this Agreement. The Employer agrees to implement this Probationary Period in a good faith manner and not as a means to terminate employees continued from a predecessor Employer. Employees who complete the probationary period shall acquire seniority from their original date of hire at the job site secured by the Employer.
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MAINTENANCE CONTRACTORS AGREEMENT - 2008-2012 - P. 78
D.	Employees retained by the Employer shall receive the wage and fringe benefits as established by this Agreement or any Appendices listed in this Agreement based on the employee’s seniority at that work location. No employee will suffer a reduction in wages or fringe benefits as a result of the changeover to a new contractor signatory to this Agreement. If there is a collective bargaining agreement in effect at that work location other than this agreement, the Union must provide the client and signatory bidders competing for that work location with a copy of that collective bargaining agreement along with any staffing information provided by the incumbent Employer.
E.	The service record of employees retained by the Employer shall not be broken by reason of such change in Employer. Vacation and sick leave seniority dates shall be honored from the prior Employer.
11.11	When service specifications of a worksite are altered, the process or system of cleaning is changed, or the square footage to be cleaned increases or decreases, the Employer may decrease or increase the workforce.
11.12	The Employer will furnish to the Union, in writing, the name and address of any job where the Employer’s services have been terminated, together with the number of employees, the amount of daily person hours worked and the rates of pay at such job. Such information is to be furnished to the Union at least two (2) weeks prior to the date such services are terminated, where possible.
ARTICLE XIV - LEAVE OF ABSENCE
14.7	Absence of less than sixty (60) days because of illness, accident, or injury shall be considered as time worked for purposes of seniority, including vacation seniority.
14.8	Medical Leave
Employees with at least six (6) months of service shall be granted leaves of absence for bona fide illness, accident, or injury, up to six (6) months, and shall be restored to their regular job upon presentation of a doctor’s certificate that they are able to return to work. If such leaves of absence exceed sixty (60) days, the employee’s former seniority shall be restored upon return to work by the employer, but no seniority shall have accrued during the period of absence.
14.9	Notification of Personal Leave
For any non emergency, the employee will give at least two weeks notification for such leave to his/her immediate supervisor. In the event of an emergency, delaying the expected return of an employee from leave, an employee shall give 2 days notice prior to the last day of the approved leave, verbally and to be
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MAINTENANCE CONTRACTORS AGREEMENT - 2008-2012 - P. 79
confirmed, if requested, in writing an extension of the leave beyond the 30 days. In extreme emergencies the employer may grant extensions of leaves with one day notice.
ARTICLE XVIII - SENIORITY, TRANSFER, AND LAYOFF
18.15	In the reduction of forces due to the slackness of work, the last employee hired shall be the first employee laid off, and in rehiring, the last employee laid off shall be the first employee rehired, until the list of former employees is exhausted, provided those employees remaining are capable of performing the work required.
18.16	Seniority is defined as an employee’s continuous service with his/her Employer or predecessor Employer(s) signatory to this Agreement or other Local 1877 Agreement since date of hire. When layoffs occur in a building site, the most junior employee will be the first person laid off. Seniority shall not be used for bumping purposes.
18.17	In filling higher paid positions covered by this Agreement, employees working in other classifications covered by this Agreement shall be given a reasonable trial on the basis of seniority where merit, ability, and physical fitness are equal as determined by the Employer.
18.18	Employees transferred to a different worksite shall retain their original seniority, and shall be informed of the reason for the transfer.
18.19	An employee’s pay and benefit rate shall not be reduced as a result of a transfer within the same classification from one location to another, unless the transfer is as a result of a request by building management for just cause, in which case the employee will be transferred to another site at the wage and benefits of that site.
18.20	The guarantee to maintain wage and benefit levels does not apply in the case of transfer from a Government Wage determination site, or a site covered under an Appendix in the Sacramento Area, with or without cause. This provision shall only apply to any wage or benefit level which is specified in the applicable Appendix or Government Wage determination.
18.21	An employee who voluntarily requests a transfer to another work site agrees to accept the wage rate and benefits offered at that site corresponding to his/her level of seniority, and the Employer must notify the employee of such different wage rate or benefit level before the employee transfers to the new work site.
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MAINTENANCE CONTRACTORS AGREEMENT - 2008-2012 - P. 80
18.22	When the building management requests removal of an employee without just cause, the Employer will transfer the employee to a work site of equivalent wage rate and benefits as soon as is reasonably possible, not to exceed five (5) working days.
18.23	Transfers of employees required by clients shall be stated in writing by the Employer.
18.24	Employees on layoff and regular part time and extra employees shall receive preference over all newly hired employees, in the event the Employer hires employees. Employees laid off from a worksite shall receive first preference for filling openings at another worksite with the same salary schedule as the worksite from which the employee was laid off, based on the total length of service with the Employer, with the exception of Government Wage determination sites or Sacramento Appendix sites as specified above. For the purposes of salary determination, that employee shall not be considered a replacement employee.
18.25	The Employer shall provide the Union with a list of all employees on the recall list upon request by the Union, no more than three (3) times per year.
ARTICLE XXIV - SUBCONTRACTING
24.3	In the event that the Employer determines that it is financially necessary to subcontract work or in the event there is not a sufficient number of qualified employees or applicants, the Employer may, under these circumstances, subcontract work performed by bargaining unit members to other contractors or individuals. The Employer shall not contract out to avoid its obligations under this Agreement nor as a means of reducing the scope of the Union. The Employer will notify the Union of any sub-contractors used to perform work in any classification covered by this agreement, and of the specific reasons why the subcontracting is required.
ARTICLE XXX - ENTIRE AGREEMENT
30.5	This Agreement represents the complete and final understanding of all bargainable issues between the Employer and the Union. It is the intent of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement will supersede all prior agreements, understandings and practices, oral or written, express or implied, between the parties and shall govern their entire relationship and shall be the sole source of all rights or claims which may be asserted in arbitration hereunder or otherwise.
30.6	Therefore, the Employer and the Union, for the life of this Agreement, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right, and each agrees that the other
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MAINTENANCE CONTRACTORS AGREEMENT - 2008-2012 - P. 81
shall not be obligated to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter not specifically referred to or covered in this Agreement unless by mutual agreement of the parties, even though such subject or matter may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either or both of the parties at the time that they negotiated or signed this Agreement.
