Section 6.15	Immediate Arbitration
Either party may waive the time limits specified herein and proceed to immediate arbitration in any case where either party alleges the other is threatening to take an action in violation of this MOU, which could result in irreparable injury, in so short a period of time as to disallow the other party from proceeding within said time limits and in circumstances where an arbitrator acting under the usual time limits should not effect an adequate remedy.

When a select call-staffing pattern is in effect, the standby response time is 30 minutes (wheels rolling on the CCV). If an employee cannot meet the 30-minute requirement, he/she will be required to remain at the work location. The Ranger Unit Chief may, at the request of an employee, waive the response time requirement.
8.8.3.3	Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, management may continue the practice of requiring up to 2 Fire Captains (B) per camp to remain on duty at the camp until aircraft cutoff time.

8.8.4	Standby hours should not routinely be used for non-emergency work. Supervisors should adjust daily work hours to encompass the assignment(s). When a supervisor cannot make such an adjustment during the same day, he/she shall make a concerted effort to schedule a work hour adjustment during the same duty shift, but no later than the end of the following duty shift. In the case of employees returning from assignments outside their unit, these adjustments can be made over a three-shift period beginning with their return. Adjustments need not be made for emergency work, normal housekeeping, personal hygiene and all work necessary for immediate emergency response.

Section 8.13	Travel to Work
8.13.1	Travel time to and from scheduled duty at the employee's headquarters shall not be considered hours worked.

ARTICLE 9	- VOLUNTARY TRANSFER AND REASSIGNMENTS
Section 9.1 Voluntary Intra-Unit Reassignments
9.1.1	Voluntary intra-unit reassignments are those changes of work location within the
geographic boundaries of a ranger unit, including conservation camps.
42
BU 8
01-06
9.1.2	Persons desiring a reassignment within their ranger unit may submit a request anytime during the year. It will remain valid through the end of the calendar year. It may include up to three locations or specialized assignments.
9.1.3	The unit manager must consider intra-unit reassignment requests before list appointments, reinstatements or transfer requests when filling a vacant position. In choosing among candidates for intra-unit transfer, the deciding official will use objective criteria for selection. A non-selected employee requesting transfer will be informed orally or in writing.
9.1.4	The unit manager may require up to two years' time and satisfactory job performance in the employee's current assignment before accepting a request for reassignment. As with inter-unit transfers, the department may also require completion of the apprenticeship program for affected employees.
9.1.5	When inter-unit transfers, reinstatements or list appointments are being considered for unit vacancies, all valid reassignments requests will be included in the selection process using the voluntary in-class transfer policy (Section 9.2) selection procedure.
Section 9.2	Voluntary In-Class Transfer Policy (Inter-Unit)
9.2.1	The parties recognize that when the State deems it necessary to fill a vacant position, the needs of the State must be given first priority. The needs of the State include the right to fill vacant positions using such methods as involuntary transfer, reassignment, reinstatement, substantiated hardship, or other selection alternative for reasons such as staff redistribution, affirmative action, special skills, abilities or aptitudes. In addition, the parties recognize that the State must make reinstatements or other mandatory placement of personnel overages.
9.2.2	Without prejudice to these needs, or to the inherent rights of the State to hire, transfer, promote, or demote employees, or the rights of the employee organization as delineated herein, the parties also recognize the desirability of a transfer policy within each department which allows employees the opportunity to express personal preference in the choice of work location.
9.2.3	With respect to any Unit 8 classification vacancy within a department for which there is a transfer request on file, if the State elects to fill the vacancy using existing eligible or promotional lists, it will consider voluntary transfer requests from permanent employees within that department and the civil service eligibility list at the same time to fill the position. The department will evaluate the specific requirements of the position which may exceed the minimum qualifications for the class and may include such objective matters as the ability to speak in public, structural firefighting experience, EMT certification, specialized training and other similar qualifications. The specific qualifications shall be determined by the delegated appointing authority and are not grievable.

9.2.5.3
9.2.5.4
9.2.5.5
9.2.5.6
9.2.5.7
The department will evaluate each transfer applicant and the promotional list eligible, using a rating form worth a maximum of 100 points. The rating form may include up to ten factors. One factor will always be based on permanent status in the class or its predecessor. For this factor, the employee will be given one point for every full year of permanent status in the class, up to a maximum of 15 points. Fractions of a point can be given for fractions of a year to the nearest quarter. Fire Captain shall be considered a single class regardless of the incumbent’s pay range. Fire Crew Supervisor is a predecessor of the Fire Captain class. The other factors will be rated from one to ten points. At least five factors will be based on the minimum qualifications for the class and up to four may be based on the special qualifications for the vacancy being filled. The aggregate score will be totaled, and the employee with the highest score will be offered the position. In case of a tie, the employee with the greatest seniority in the class for which the vacancy exists shall be offered the position.
Any permanent employee may request consideration for a position through this transfer procedure consistent with the following provisions:
The department may require 2 years of service in the employee's current assignment before eligibility for transfer. However, if there is such a requirement it must be made known in the job announcement and in the interview process. Additionally, apprenticeship employees in CDF may not be considered for voluntary transfer until successful completion of their apprenticeship program. An assessment of impact on operational programs, employee's development progress, performance, and other needs of the department and the employee would be key to waiving the length of service requirement.
When filling a vacancy, all active transfer requests on file must be evaluated pursuant to this policy. The specific qualifications and objective criteria required to fill the position shall be provided to the applicants at the time they are notified of any interview.
Transfer candidates shall be informed of the final selection decision within ten working days of the selection.
The department shall utilize an aggregate rating form to assist the unsuccessful employees in improving their qualifications and interview skills. A copy of the form will be forwarded to each candidate with aggregate scores and a summary of narrative comments within 15 days of the final selection.
An employee may have up to three active transfer requests on file at any one time for three locations that may be as broad as a region or as narrow as a reporting or ranger unit.
Requests for transfers will be valid for the calendar year for which they are submitted. It will be necessary to resubmit transfer requests on or after January 1 of each year.
The unit manager or the program manager of the employee's home unit, or headquarters as applicable, has the authority to disapprove transfer requests based on one of the following:
44
BU 8
01-06
9.2.5.7.1	When a serious impact may result to on-going programs, particularly when several transfer requests from one unit are received simultaneously;
9.2.5.7.2	Employee is on probationary status;
9.2.5.7.3	When documented performance is below standard.
9.2.5.8	Disapproval of a transfer request requires documentation of the specific reasons for disapproval on or attached to the appropriate transfer form. The decision to disapprove a transfer request is grievable through the second level of the grievance procedure.
9.2.5.9	The transfer request, once approved, shall be sent by the employee's unit directly to the unit to which he/she has requested transfer.
9.2.5.10	To encourage cost effectiveness of the transfer policy, the appointing authority may evaluate and select candidates for positions by personal interviews or by resumes only, depending upon the circumstances surrounding a specific position(s). Interviews may be conducted by telephone.
9.2.5.11	Transfer approvals shall be at the same level as the delegated appointing authority.
9.2.5.12	Moving costs for voluntary transfers shall be borne by the employee. Travel and subsistence costs associated with any transfer interview shall be borne by the employee.
9.2.5.13	This transfer policy shall not apply to reassignments within a reporting/ranger unit or conservation camp within the geographical boundaries of a ranger unit.
9.2.5.14	A hardship transfer request once approved by the employee's Regional Chief shall be honored with the first position in the unit requested which is being filled on a permanent basis. Approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Paid leave shall not be used to cover the ten (10) workdays.

Section 11.2	Rural Health Care Equity Program
11.2.1	Effective July 1, 2001 the State shall continue the Rural Health Care Equity Program for Bargaining Unit 8 members, which may be administered in conjunction with a similar program for state employees in other bargaining units, for excluded employees, and for annuitants.

For Bargaining Unit 8 members, because a substantial number of them are seasonal employees, payments shall be on a monthly basis.

BU 8

11.2.2	For permanent employees, as in the “Medical Reimbursement Account” situation, the employee does not have to wait for reimbursement of covered medical expenses until the full amount has been deposited.
11.2.3	As to any employee who enters state service or leaves state service during a fiscal year, contributions for such employee shall be made on a pro rata basis. A similar computation shall be used for anyone entering or leaving the bargaining unit (e.g., promotion in mid-fiscal year).

11.2.5	Pursuant to GC section 22825.01, a Rural Health Care Equity Program will be

11.2.6	Each Unit 8 employee shall be able to utilize up to $1500 per year, pursuant to GC section 22825.01, but with the exceptions for greater utilization hereafter noted. The pro rata limitation pursuant to subsection 11.2.2 is applicable here.
11.2.7	If an employee does not utilize the complete $1500 pursuant to the procedures and limitations described in GC section 22825.01, then the unused monies shall be put in a “same year pool.” That same year pool shall be utilized to pay those who have incurred eligible health care expenses in excess of the $1500, but again according to the procedures and limitations in GC section 22825.01. The monies in the same year pool would be distributed at the end, or even soon after, each fiscal year to that group of employees who had eligible expenses in excess of $1500 in the relevant fiscal year. Those monies shall be distributed on a pro tanto (pro rata) basis.
11.2.7.1	Any employee not in Bargaining Unit 8 all year shall receive credit under this subsection 11.2.7 utilizing the same pro rata formula as in subsection 11.2.3 above.
11.2.7.2	If an employee is entitled to less than $25.00 under this subsection 11.2.7, the money shall instead go into next year’s fund pursuant to subsection 11.2.8 hereafter.
11.2.8	If monies still remain after a distribution to such employees (i.e., all employees who spent more than $1500 as provided in GC section 22825.01 were completely reimbursed), then those surplus monies shall be rolled over into the next fiscal year’s fund available for distribution to employees whose expenses pursuant to GC section 22825.01 exceed $1500 in such subsequent year. Similar “rollovers” would occur in any years where all employees were completely reimbursed (or had payments made on their behalf) pursuant to GC section 22825.01 and monies still remained in the pool.

11.3.3	The employee voluntarily participating in counseling services may do so through the use of approved sick leave when absent from work. Those employees who are formally referred by a supervisor to counseling shall do so on State time for the first visit. Any subsequent visits are at the employee's option.

11.5.5	Priority may be given to those with work incurred injuries, illnesses or disabilities caused by pregnancy. That means employees on limited duty for non-work incurred physical conditions could have their limited duty status adjusted to accommodate the person with the work or pregnancy incurred difficulty.
11.5.6	Employees requesting limited duty may be required to supply medical substantiation of the need as well as the type of work they may safely perform.

The department will pay for the cost of the medical examination if required.
11.5.7	Employees on limited duty because of a non-work incurred temporary disability will be scheduled to work a NIRA duty week consistent with their job classification. On the last day of this contract (June 30, 2006) fire protection employees shall be placed on year round IRA.
11.5.8	Employees on limited duty because of a work incurred temporary disability will be assigned to the duty week associated with the job to be performed not to exceed four days per week unless the employee's regular duty week is longer. In either case, the employee will work up to 40 hours and be assigned on-call or standby time based on the job and their medical condition. Such employees will continue to receive any planned overtime compensation they would have received had the injury not occurred.

The State and the Union agree that the limitation on service retirement benefits shall be increased from 85 percent of final compensation to 90 percent for members of Unit 8 who retire directly from State employment on and after January 1, 2000.

Section 21362.1 of the Government Code is amended to read:
21362.1 Notwithstanding Section 21362, the limitation on the service retirement benefit shall be 90 percent for Unit 8 members who retire directly from state employment on and after January 1, 2000.

Section 13.6	Modified First Tier Plan
CDF Firefighters and the State agree that an alternative retirement plan shall be established for employees who are eligible for membership as miscellaneous or industrial members of the Public Employees’ Retirement System. The alternative retirement plan shall be referred to as the “Modified First Tier Plan” and shall become effective the first day of the pay period following ratification by the Legislature and the Union.
Section 13.7	First Tier Eligibility for Employees in Second Tier
The Union and the State (parties) agree that the legislation implementing this agreement shall contain language to allow employees who are currently in the Second Tier retirement plan to elect to be covered under the First Tier, as described in this article. The parties further agree that the provisions of this article will be effective only upon the CalPERS board adopting a Resolution that will employ, for the June 30, 1998 valuation and thereafter, 95% of the market value of CalPERS’ assets as the actuarial value of the assets, and to amortize the June 30, 1998 excess assets over a 20 year period beginning July 1, 1999. The parties agree to jointly request the CalPERS board to extend the 20 year amortization period in the event the cost of these benefits or unfavorable returns on investments results in an increased employer contribution by the State.
The legislative language would allow an employee in the Second Tier to exercise the Tier 1 right of election at any time after the effective date of this legislation. An employee who makes this election would then be eligible to purchase past Second Tier service. The parties will work with CalPERS to establish more flexible purchase provisions for employees. These include, but are not limited to, increasing the installment period from 96 months (8 years) to 144 months (12 years), or up to 180 months (15 years), and allowing employees to purchase partial amounts of service.
New employees who meet the criteria for CalPERS membership would be enrolled in the first Tier plan and have the right to be covered under the Second Tier plan within 180 days of the date of their appointment. If a new employee does not make an election for Second Tier coverage during this period, he/she would remain in the First Tier plan.
Employees who purchase their past service would be required to pay the amount of contributions they would have paid had they been First Tier members during the period of service that they are purchasing. As required by CalPERS law, the amount will then include interest at 6 percent, annually compounded.
Section 13.8	First Tier Retirement Formula (2% @ 55)
The Union and the State (parties) agree that the legislation implementing this agreement shall contain language to enhance the current age benefit factors on which service retirement benefits are based for Miscellaneous and Industrial members of the First Tier plan under the Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). The parties further agree that the provisions of this article will be effective only upon the CalPERS board adopting a Resolution that will employ,
94
BU 8
01-06
for the June 30, 1998 valuation and thereafter, 95% of the market value of CalPERS’ assets as the actuarial value of the assets, and to amortize the June 30, 1998 excess assets over a 20 year period beginning July 1, 1999. The parties agree to jointly request the CalPERS board to extend the 20 year amortization period in the event the cost of these benefits or unfavorable returns on investments results in an increased employer contribution by the State.
The legislative language would provide the enhanced benefit factors to State employees who retire directly from State employment on and after January 1, 2000.
The table below compares the current First Tier age benefit factors to the improved factors that the proposed legislation would place in the part of the Government Code administered by CalPERS.
AGE AT RETIREMENT	CURRENT FACTORS	PROPOSED FACTORS
50	1.092	1.100
51	1.156	1.280
52	1.224	1.460
53	1.296	1.640

61	2.134	2.375
62	2.272	2.438
63 and over	2.418	2.500
There would be factors for attained quarter ages, such as 52 % that will be included in the proposed legislation. These improved age benefit factors will apply for service rendered on and after the effective date of the memorandum of understanding between the State and the Union. The improved factors will also apply to past service that is credited under the First Tier and the Modified First Tier.
The amount of member contributions required of employees who will be covered under these new factors will continue to be 5 percent of monthly compensation in excess of $513.

Section 13.9	Modified First Tier Members Merged Into First Tier
The Union and the State (parties) agree that the legislation implementing this agreement shall contain language that would move all employees who are currently covered under the Modified First Tier into the First Tier, as described in this article. The parties further agree that the provisions of this article will be effective only upon the CalPERS board adopting a Resolution what will employ, for the June 30, 1998 valuation and thereafter, 95% of the market value of CalPERS’ assets as the actuarial value of the assets, and to amortize the June 30, 1998 excess assets over a 20 year period beginning July 1, 1999. The parties agree to jointly request the CalPERS board to extend the 20 year amortization period in the event the cost of these benefits or unfavorable returns on investments results in an increased employer contribution by the State.
The legislative language would allow employees who are in the Modified First Tier retirement plan to be moved into the First Tier plan. This movement will result in granting those employees all of the rights and benefits of the First Tier plan, including the conversion of sick leave credits into retirement service credit at retirement, making contributions at 5 percent of monthly pay in excess of $513, and the use of the highest compensation averaged over one year when calculating retirement benefits. All past service credited under the Modified First Tier plan will be credited under the First Tier plan at no further cost to the employees. The effective date of First Tier membership for affected employees will be the January 1, 2000.
Section 13.10	Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP)
Subject to mutual agreement of the parties the State agrees to investigate the feasibility of a “DROP” program. Should the parties agree to a “DROP” program, no costs shall be borne by the State.

The labor/management Board of Adjustment (BOA) shall be the first step in the grievance procedure. The purpose of the BOA is to provide a voluntary, alternative dispute resolution system for resolving grievances.
19.5.1.1.1	The BOA shall be comprised of two individuals selected by the employer, and two individuals selected by the union.
19.5.1.1.2	The union and employer will each designate one of their members who will serve a term of two years and one with a one-year term. All appointees thereafter will have two-year terms that may be renewed by their respective parties.
19.5.1.1.3	If an individual who is selected to serve on the BOA is unable to serve for whatever reason, a substitute may be appointed.
19.5.1.1.4	The employer and union shall bear all costs for their BOA appointees except that union appointees shall be on State release time.

19.5.1.2	Procedural Matters
19.5.1.2.1	The BOA shall determine all procedures for hearing, except as otherwise provided for in this agreement. Said procedures shall be determined by majority vote.
19.5.1.2.2	The BOA shall not be bound by common law, statutory rules of evidence, technical or formal rules of procedure, or precedential decisions, but shall review the submitted documents and declarations in such a manner as necessary to reach a just and proper decision based on all relevant evidence properly submitted.

19.5.1.2.4	One Board member representing a party (employer or Union) may cast the vote of the other representative of that party if he/she is absent. The decision of the BOA shall be determined by majority vote. Thus, a 4-0, 3-1 or 3-0 vote determines a matter. The BOA may meet by conference call. The BOA may waive a meeting and agree to send a matter directly to arbitration. BOA members need not attend arbitration.
19.5.1.2.5	The BOA must provide the parties (or their representative) the opportunity to present information and argue orally.
19.5.1.2.6	Information received by the BOA, and discussions between BOA members shall be confidential.

19.5.1.2.8	The intent of this BOA process is to have expeditious but fair hearings. The Board shall consider only the written materials provided by the parties prior to the hearing. However, the Board may order sworn testimony, the subpoenaing of one or more witnesses, or the production or receipt into evidence of documents upon motion of either party, if the Board determines that a just hearing and/or decision requires same. The parties contemplate that such a determination will be the exception rather than the rule.
19.5.1.2.9	Subject to Section 19.5.1.2.8 the BOA ordinarily will not conduct evidentiary-type hearings regarding discipline grievances. In cases of minor discipline, the grievant shall be given a total of 15 minutes for an opening statement/argument and rebuttal. The employer shall be given a total of 15 minutes for its responding statement/argument.
19.5.1.3	Board of Adjustment Decisions

Section 19.6	Settlements
Nothing in the article is intended to preclude the parties from independently settling disputes arising from disciplinary actions.
Section 19.7	Hearings
19.7.1	SPB Disciplinary Action Appeal Hearings
19.7.1.1	This section applies to hearings conducted by State Personnel Board (SPB) staff when a disciplined employee elects appeal to SPB rather than invoking the alternative dispute resolution procedures contained in Article 19 of this agreement.
19.7.1.2	The parties recognize and appreciate the inefficiencies result for SPB when the parties to a hearing delay settlement or are unrealistic in their scheduling projections. The parties are therefore committed to avoiding and minimizing these issues for the convenience of SPB while carrying out rights conferred by this section.
19.7.2.	1 Full Initial Day of Hearing
19.7.2.	2 The State Personnel Board shall calendar hearings for a full, initial day, if requested by either party based on a good faith belief that (a) at least one full day of hearing will be required; (b) that the parties will be prepared to present a full day’s case on the first day of hearing; and, (c) the matter will not first settle without resort to hearing.
19.7.2.	3 The State Personnel Board will notify the parties of this right in its acknowledgement letter. Requests for a full, initial day of hearing must be received by the Board no later than 10 days after receiving SPB’s acknowledgement letter, and copy must be simultaneously sent to the opposing party. If a timely request is not made, the SPB may set the first day of hearing for no less than one half-day.
19.7.3	Selection of Administrative Law Judge
At the same time the State Personnel Board sends out its acknowledgement letter it will give the parties the names of three Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) who could be assigned to hear the case. The parties will each have the right to strike one name from the list of three. Only a judge not stricken from the list of three shall be appointed to hear the case.

19.7.4.6

19.7.5
19.7.6
The State Personnel Board shall initially calendar hearings for multiple days when the parties believe in good faith that (a) more than one day of hearing will be required; and, (b) the matter will not settle.
If either party to the disciplinary dispute believes that the hearing will take more than one day, that party shall contact the other and the parties will make a good faith attempt to estimate the number of days that will be required. They will also attempt to identify dates (and alternative dates) they are available for multiple days of hearing.
Upon receipt of the State Personnel Board’s acknowledgement letter, the party desiring multiple days of hearing shall notify the Board about the number of estimated hearing days that will be required and proposed hearing dates agreed to by the parties. Requests must be received by the Board no later than 10 days after receiving SPB’s acknowledgment letter, and a copy must be simultaneously sent to the opposing party. If the parties cannot agree on proposed hearing dates, then the requesting party shall only notify SPB about the estimated number of hearing days required.
The State Personnel Board shall schedule the matter for multiple days of hearing on the dates agreed to by the parties if an ALJ not stricken is available. An ALJ shall be considered available if he/she is not previously scheduled for time off, a hearing or other necessary and legitimate business-related event (e.g. meeting).
If the parties have been unable to agree on proposed hearing dates or the ALJ is available on the dates agreed upon, then SPB shall respond to timely requests by providing the parties with proposed multiple days for the hearing. If a party rejects a proposed hearing date, that party will be responsible for contacting the other to obtain alternative dates that are mutually acceptable. If no party rejects the hearing dates, a hearing notice will be issued.
Initial setting requests of 5 days or less will ordinarily be accommodated by SPB unless it determines the number of days requested is excessive as the result of a pre-hearing conference held with the parties to determine the complexity of the case (e.g., number of witnesses, etc.).
Multiple days of hearing will ordinarily be scheduled to occur in two-day blocks, and in consecutive weeks, to avoid (a) the time and expense associated with protracted cases; and, (b) SPB losing an entire week on the calendar in the event of cancellation.
The State Personnel Board may not deny continuance requests supported by good cause because the matter was initially set for multiple days of hearing.
Non-Expedited Hearing Decisions
The ALJ’s proposed decision shall be finalized within 30 calendar days following the conclusion of the last day of hearing. The proposed decision shall be submitted to the five-member Board as soon as legally possible thereafter.
Expedited Hearings
119
BU 8
01-06
19.7.6.1	The parties to the dispute may, upon mutual agreement, initiate an expedited hearing process, if the parties to the dispute have a good faith belief that the matter will only take one day of hearing o in dismissal cases.
19.7.6.2	State Personnel Board shall schedule expedited hearings which occur (depending on the parties; availability) no sooner than two (2) weeks, and no later than four (4) week, following State Personnel Board’s receipt of a mutual request. The State Personnel Board is not, however, obligated to schedule expedited hearings so soon if all of its ALJ’s were previously scheduled for time off, hearings or other necessary and legitimate business-related events (e/g., meetings). Under such circumstances, the hearing shall be scheduled for the earliest open date that coincides with the parties’ availability.
19.7.6.3	Mutual requests for expedited hearings shall include a list of dates the parties are not available for hearing for State Personnel Board’s scheduling convenience.
19.7.6.4	The AlJ’s proposed decision shall be finalized within 20 calendar days following the conclusion of the hearing. The proposed decision shall be submitted to the five-member Board as soon as legally possible thereafter.
APPENDIX A - SUBSTANCE ABUSE TESTING
	Federal Regulations 49 CFR Parts 382, et al and 49 CFR Part 40 require the State of California (State) to test its commercial drivers for controlled substances and alcohol. As specified below, this requirement covers certain employees in Bargaining Unit 8. Having met and conferred, the State and the CDF FIREFIGHTERS agree to the following regarding the impact of this testing on employees in Unit 8.
Section 1	Authority And Purpose
1.1	The State will conduct drug and alcohol testing of commercial drivers in Bargaining Unit 8, as specified in Federal Regulations 49 CFR Parts 382, et al. and 49 CFR Part 40.
1.2	The State will apply all of the provisions of this Agreement to employees in Bargaining Unit 8 who meet the criteria for testing required by 49 CFR Part 382 et al. This includes employees who:
1.2.1	Are in a classification that requires the possession of a Commercial Drivers License (CDL); or who
1.2.2	Possess a CDL and drive a motor vehicle for the State of California that:
1.2.2.1	Has a gross combination weight rating or gross combination weight of 26,001 or more pounds inclusive of a towed unit with a gross vehicle weight rating or gross vehicle weight of more than 10,000 pounds; or
1.2.2.2	Has a gross vehicle weight rating or gross vehicle weight of 26,001 or more pounds; or
1.2.2.3	Is designed to transport 16 or more passengers, including the driver; or

1.2.2.4	Is of any size and is used in the transportation of materials found to be hazardous for the purposes of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act and which require the motor vehicle to be placarded under the Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR part 172, subpart F).
1.2.3	Possess a CDL and periodically drive a commercial vehicle (as described in subsection 1.2.2 above) for the State, and elect to remain in the federal testing program during their non-driving periods.
1.2.4	The pre-employment and/or random testing provisions of this agreement will not apply to employees who possess a restricted fire fighter license for the operation of emergency firefighting equipment.
1.3	The State will apply the reasonable suspicion testing provisions of his Agreement to all employees in Bargaining Unit 8 who meet the criteria for Testing required by State drug and alcohol testing provisions (Department of Personnel Administration [DPA] Rules 599.960-599.966 and State Personnel Board Rules 213 - 213.6).
1.4	This agreement restates and describes certain of the federal testing provisions and requirements. However, the State and CDF FIREFIGHTERS agree that the applicable federal regulations shall be applied in their entirety, and as they are specifically set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). In any conflict between the CFR and this agreement, the CFR shall prevail.
Section 2	DPA Consortium The DPA will serve as the administrator for the consortium that will provide drug/alcohol testing services for the federal testing program to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF).
Section 3	Types Of Testing
3.1	Random Testing
3.1.1	Each year, a number of drug tests that equals 50% of the employees in the DPA testing pool will be conducted on employees who are randomly selected from the pool. In addition, a number of alcohol tests that equals 25% of the number of employees in the DPA testing pool will be conducted on employees who are randomly selected from the pool. The DPA will randomly select employee names from the testing pool using the HEIDI computer software program.
3.1.2	Employees will usually provide urine specimens (for drug tests) and take breath alcohol tests for the random testing program during normal work hours. Employees whose regularly scheduled work shift occurs outside of the designated collection sites' normal hours of operation may be held after shift, with appropriate compensation, to be tested, or the employing department may make arrangements to have them tested during their shift.
3.1.3	In no event shall an employee be called in for the purpose of participating in a random test while the employee is on vacation, regular days off, sick leave, compensating time off or other leave status. 121
BU 8 01-06
3.2	Reasonable Suspicion
3.2.1	Employees will be required to submit to a reasonable suspicion drug test and/or a breath alcohol test if the supervisor has reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the state and/or federal requirements on the use of controlled substances and/or alcohol. A finding of reasonable suspicion must be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the employee. The observations may include indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled substances.
3.2.2	Supervisors who make a determination of reasonable suspicion must receive 1) at least 60 minutes of training on alcohol misuse and 2) at least an additional 60 minutes of training on controlled substances use. The training shall cover the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of probable alcohol misuse and use of controlled substances.
3.2.3	Any Unit 8 employee covered by this testing program is subject to reasonable suspicion testing for alcohol or drugs anytime he/she is on duty, standby or on-call.
3.2.4	The basis for all reasonable suspicion determinations shall be documented in writing. This shall include a specific description of the observations on which the determination is based. This documentation shall be completed within 48 hours of the determination. A copy shall be provided to the employee.
3.2.5	When reasonably possible, and provided it does not interfere with employee or public safety, reasonable suspicion shall be confirmed by the direct observation of another supervisor or peace officer as defined under Penal Code Sections 830.1 and 830.2. The supervisor does not have to be a CDF employee.
3.3	Post Accident
3.3.1	A driver who is in an accident involving a commercial vehicle shall be tested for alcohol and controlled substances if the following conditions exist:
3.3.1.1.	The driver was performing safety-sensitive functions with respect to the vehicle, and the accident involved the loss of human life; or
3.3.1.2	The driver received a citation under State or local law for a moving traffic violation arising from the accident; and the accident involved bodily injury requiring treatment away from the scene and/or resulted in damage to any vehicle that required the vehicle to be towed or transported away.
3.4	Pre-Employment/Pre-Duty Testing
122
BU 8
01-06
3.4.1	A pre-employment/pre-duty controlled substance and alcohol test must be conducted before the first time a driver performs a safety-sensitive function for the State. A driver must also take a pre-duty controlled substance and alcohol test when he/she transfers from a position not performing safety-sensitive functions to a position performing safety-sensitive functions. This also applies to a driver returning from a leave of absence for more than 30 days due to illness, lay-off, injury, extended leaves, (paid or unpaid) etc., who has not remained in the controlled substance and alcohol program and, therefore, has not been subject to the random testing process. A negative test result is required prior to performing safety-sensitive functions. A driver may be exempted from pre-employment/pre-duty testing if the employing department verifies his/her participation in and compliance with a federal testing program under a prior employer, as specified in the federal regulations.
3.5	Return-to-Duty Testing
3.5.1	Employees who have engaged in prohibited conduct under the federal regulations must submit to and pass a return-to-duty test prior to performing safety-sensitive duties again.
3.6	Follow-up Testing Following the Substance Abuse Professional's (SAP's) determination that the employee has properly followed the SAP's recommendation for rehabilitation, the employee will be subject to a minimum of 6 unannounced follow-up alcohol and/or drug tests during the first 12 months following his/her return to work. Any additional testing or other requirements will be specified in the employee's last chance agreement.
Section 4
Testing Process
4.1	Drug Testing
4.1.1	Following are the controlled substances (drugs) included in the federal testing
program, and the cutoff levels used in the tests for each of them. The following are to be utilized whether samples are collected by random, reasonable suspicion or other testing. This information was current when this agreement was signed, but is subject to change by the federal government.
CONFIRMATORY SUBSTANCE	CUTOFF	CUTOFF
Amphetamines/Methamphetamine	1000 nanogram	500 nanogram
Cannabinoids	50 nanogram per milliliter	15 nanogram per milliliter
Cocaine	300 nanogram per milliliter	150 nanogram per milliliter
Opiates	300 nanogram per milliliter	300 nanogram per milliliter
Phencyclidine	25 nanogram per milliliter	25 nanogram per milliliter
123
BU 8
01-06
4.1.2	Drug testing shall be performed on a urine sample using an immunoassay screening test and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry confirmatory test for positive tests. The State shall use a SAMSHA approved laboratory for these tests.
4.2	Alcohol Testing Alcohol testing will be performed by certified Breath Alcohol Technicians (BATs) using federally-approved National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) evidential breath testing devices.
4.3	Urine Collection/Breath Testing Process
4.3.1	Urine collection/breath alcohol testing services will generally be conducted in private clinical facilities. In addition, the State will utilize on-site (mobile) urine collection/breath alcohol testing services provided by private contractors. The State will specifically inform CDF FIREFIGHTERS of any situations in which State agencies plan to use their own staff and facilities to collect urine samples. Time that is required for the employee to take the tests for random testing, reasonable suspicion, post-accident testing, and follow-up testing, including waiting, transportation, and testing time will be considered hours worked in accordance with the hours and overtime provisions of the Unit 8 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
4.3.2	If urine collection/breath testing is not completed until after the completion of the employees scheduled work day, or if the employee is to remain away from the work site pending the outcome of the tests, the employing State agency shall ensure that the employee has a safe and reasonable way to get home (e.g., with a friend or family member, etc.).
4.4	Re-tests For controlled substance tests, employees may request that a re-test, using the second portion of their split-sample urine specimen, be conducted at a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) certified laboratory of their choice, provided they do it through the Medical Review Officer (MRO) who reviewed their laboratory results and make their request within 72 hours of receiving notice of the MRO's determination regarding the results of the first drug test. If the second test confirms the results of the first drug test, the employee will pay for the costs of the second test. If the second test indicates that the first test results were erroneous, the State will pay for the second test.
4.5	Medical Review Officer Services All drug test results will be reviewed by a MRO who, in turn, will report his/her finding to the State agency. MRO services will be provided by a licensed physician (medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy) who has knowledge of substance abuse disorders and has appropriate medical training to interpret and evaluate drug test results.
124
BU 8
01-06
4.6	Substance Abuse Professional Services All employees who test positive for drugs or alcohol will be referred to a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) for evaluation if they are to return to duty. SAP services will be provided by a licensed physician (medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy), or a licensed or certified psychologist, social worker, employee assistance professional, or addiction counselor (certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors Certification Commission), with knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of drug and alcohol-related disorders. DPA will provide a statewide network of SAPs. The State will pay for the State-provided SAP services. Any prescribed rehabilitation will be on the employee's own time and expense (except as any of these expenses may be covered by the employees State health insurance plan) All procedures used for urine collection, breath alcohol testing, laboratory analysis of urine specimens, medical review of test results, and substance abuse professional evaluations shall be in conformance with 49 CFR Part 40 and 49 CFR Parts 382, et al. as they now exist, or may exist in the future.
Section 5	Employee Rights And Representation
5.1	The collection of a urine specimen and the administration of a breath test are not, in themselves, investigative interviews that would trigger an employee right to representation. However, the State agrees to make a reasonable effort to grant employee requests for representation during the urine sample and breath alcohol testing processes, provided that this can be done without delaying the testing process or causing operational difficulties for the State.
5.2	In addition, employees have the right to representation at any investigative interview that could lead to a decision by the State to take adverse action. Notwithstanding subsection 5.1 above, this includes any such interviews that occur in conjunction with the urine sample collection/breath testing process.
5.3	Employees also have the right to representation in any discussion with the MRO except that the inability of the employee to arrange for such representation may not delay the conversation beyond 5 days after the earliest of the following: (a) being contacted by the MRO, or (b) being contacted by the State and ordered to contact the MRO, or (c) not being available for employer contact after a good faith effort on the employer's part. If the employee fails to arrange for representation the employee may either discuss the findings of the lab results with the MRO or decline to do so; in either case, the MRO will proceed to issue a determination regarding the results of the drug test. Conversations between the MRO and the tested employee will be by telephone in all or nearly all cases. In no case shall the testing and review process be delayed.

6 2	Employees will receive a copy of the custody and control form certified by the MRO as to the results of all drug tests ordered by the State Upon written request to the State, the State will send the employee copies of any and all documents that the State has in its possession and that relate to the employee's drug test, including laboratory results, reasonable suspicion documentation, MRO reports and disciplinary reports This material will be released to the employees representative only upon the written request of the employee
6 3	Statistical information about the drug testing program that cannot be used to identify particular individuals is not confidential
6 4	Drug training records are not confidential, even though they may contain the names of employees who have attended drug-related training sessions
Section 7	Employee Conformance With Federal Requirements
7 1	All commercial drivers in Unit 8 are expected to comply with the requirements set forth in 49 CFR Part 40 and 382 et al Failure to provide a breath sample, refusing to take a required drug test or engaging in any other conduct that obstructs the testing process shall be considered as insubordination Any violation of the federal requirements including but not limited to testing positive may be the basis for adverse action, up to and including dismissal
7 2	CDF has a zero tolerance policy for any employee in a sensitive position being legally drunk or under the influence of drugs while on duty Any Unit 8 employee found impaired while on duty, standby or on-call will be terminated
7 3	Employees who use prescription medications or over-the-counter medications, which may render them unable to perform their regularly assigned duties safety, must report such use to their supervisor In such instances, the State may reassign the employee to non-safety sensitive duties
Section 8	Temporary Loss Of A Commercial Drivers License
8 1	Employees whose CDL has been revoked, suspended, restricted, or affected by any other action that would limit or restrict the employee's ability to drive a commercial vehicle shall report such loss to their supervisor their first day of work after losing the license
