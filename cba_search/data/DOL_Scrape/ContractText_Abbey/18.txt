5.22	Failure to Accept Return from Layoff
If, for any reason, an Employee fails to report within 10 days following a notice of recall under these provisions, he shall be terminated effective on the date of the notice of recall.

8

Employees accepting training for a promotion must accept a promotion to the position for which they are trained if one is offered and for which the Employee is qualified. Employees who fail to accept a promotional job offer will be ineligible for promotions for the next 2 years. The Company will give preferential consideration to Employees successfully trained for a higher job classification.

It is the intention of the parties to strengthen the skills, capabilities and accountability of Employees, eliminate rigid distinctions regarding what jobs may be performed within a classification, provide a more rapid progression for Employees to assume the full range of responsibilities and replace multi-job, multi-step progressions with a single job classification.
2.	To progress to a higher step within a job classification that is based on qualifications, an Employee must have completed the minimum time in the step, have an overall job performance rating of satisfactory by his supervisor, successfully completed any training required for advancement and demonstrated the necessary knowledge and proficiency required for advancement.
3.	If an Employee is unable to progress to the next higher step after being given a reasonable opportunity to do so (but no longer than 6 months), the Employee, if he is a current incumbent, will be demoted to a Laborer or other job classification for which the Employee is qualified and his rate of pay will not be reduced (“red circled”) for 18 months. Employees who are hired after the effective date of this Agreement and who fail to progress, will be demoted or terminated.
