Preamble
VISION STATEMENT
Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 500 and the Board of Education of the Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) are collaborative partners who believe in performance excellence for staff and students, and in valuing and respecting the role of supporting services employees as contributors to a high-quality learning community. We work together to provide a high-quality education to every student through continuous improvement, effective communication, mutual respect, and meaningful involvement of supporting services staff in the decision-making processes at appropriate levels. The parties are committed to a professional relationship through mutual respect, a comprehensive staff development program that encourages mutual commitment, and the recognition of staff excellence. SEIU Local 500 recognizes and supports the commitment of the school system to provide the very best in educational opportunities to all students. MCPS recognizes and respects the Union’s commitment to advocating for the interests of its members as valued direct and indirect contributors to student achievement.
We jointly commit to working in collaboration to seek support from the County Council and General Assembly to achieve the critical mission of the school system, including adequate supporting services staffing levels and competitive pay and benefit levels. This includes informing the Council and Legislature of the full impact on the school system and our community stakeholders when funding levels do not align with our system priorities.
Our commitment, shared responsibility, and collaborative partnership are integrated into our organizational culture. This includes working together to resolve issues of mutual interest, as well as differences as they arise, in a collaborative manner. This culture promotes the success of each student and each supporting services employee.
The parties are committed to working together, and with the other employee organizations, to ensure the creation of an organizational culture of respect throughout MCPS. In order to sustain an organizational culture of respect, it is critical that all employees, whether in the bargaining unit or the administration, have an awareness, understanding, and tolerance of others’ interests, viewpoints, cultures, and backgrounds and their impact on our ability to deliver a high-quality education to every student. This culture promotes a positive work environment that ensures the success of each employee, high student achievement, and continuous improvement in a self-renewing organization. The parties will collaborate to embed an organizational culture of respect in all work locations in the school system in order to ensure that all students, and those who directly or indirectly provide for their education, are successful.

ARTICLE 4
Collaboration
A.	Introduction
1.	MCPS and SEIU Local 500 are committed to creating organizational structures and processes that strengthen the collaborative relationship between MCPS and SEIU Local 500.
2.	We define collaboration as a process in which partners work together in a meaningful way and within a time frame that provides a real opportunity to shape results. The purpose of the process is to work together respectfully to resolve problems, address common issues, and identify opportunities for improvement. To be successful, the collaborative process must be taken seriously and be valued by both parties. The process must be given the time, personal and institutional involvement and commitment, hard work, and dedication that are required to be successful. The partners will identify and define issues of common concern, propose and evaluate solutions, and agree on recommendations.
B.	Board of Education-Superintendent-SEIU Local 500 Relations
1.	The Board of Education and the SEIU Local 500 Executive Board agree to meet at mutually agreed-upon times to discuss items of interest and concern. The SEIU Local 500 Executive Board may submit specific items it wishes to include on the agenda at least two working days prior to the meeting.
2.	The superintendent agrees to meet with the SEIU Local 500 Executive Board at mutually agreed-upon times four times a year to discuss matters of mutual interest and concern.
C.	Organizational Culture of Respect
The parties are committed to fostering an organizational culture of respect throughout the school system (see Appendix II for the entire document). This culture is built on the belief that all employees are essential for the school system to attain equity and excellence for all students. To accomplish this, there must be a systemwide commitment to foster this organizational culture of respect and there must be accountability at all levels of the organization. The parties recognize that this collective bargaining relationship is essential to enhancing this culture. The organizational culture of respect is based on the following principles:
■	Trust in each other and the process
■	Use of collaborative and interest-based processes
■	Recognition of every employee’s contributions
■	High expectations for all staff and students that are reasonable, clear, and transparent
■	Open, honest contributions without fear of retribution
■	Open and effective communication
■	Respect for various points of view
■	Civility in all our interactions
■	Team building and working together as teams
The parties will work together to ensure that all employees understand that, in order to create this culture, everybody must take responsibility for their own behavior and follow these principles. Managers and supervisors must model this behavior, and all employees are expected
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 3
to exhibit this behavior at all times. In addition, all employees, regardless of their position or bargaining unit affiliation, should be actively and fully engaged in the essential work of MCPS, and all employees should appreciate and benefit from the contributions made by their colleagues. One way to ensure that this culture exists throughout MCPS is through the full implementation of the Supporting Services Professional Growth System. Professional development plans and employee recognition are important components of this system. In addition, all employees are expected to provide and receive feedback constructively and respectfully. There will be a commitment to resolving issues and problems at the lowest level possible without applying blame.
D.	Commitment to the Framework for Equity and Excellence
The Board of Education and SEIU Local 500 are committed to equity and excellence for all students and staff. Our commitment to equitable practices is reflected in the school system’s core values and beliefs. In order to be successful, the parties expect all staff to respect individual and group differences and to recognize that diverse opinions, perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds help MCPS attain the high expectations we have for all students.
It is our shared responsibility to assume that each student and adult have unlimited potential and the ability to achieve at high levels. Equitable practices require the commitment to high expectations for all students and employees and the provision of supports that meet the diversity of their needs. All employees are committed to cultural competence and positive relationships between students, staff, parents, and community members, regardless of race, ethnicity, or background.
E.	Participation in Worksite Collaborative Committees and Processes
MCPS and SEIU Local 500 are committed to the inclusion of supporting services employees in worksite collaboration for both school-based and nonschool-based supporting services employees’ participation on committees (e.g., the leadership team, school improvement team, Baldrige Leadership Team, Professional Learning Community Institute, School Leadership Training Institute, and Department of Transportation lot committees).
Supporting services employees are expected to be included in school-based and nonschoolbased committees to facilitate the opportunity to provide input on issues pertinent to them and other supporting services employees. In order for their contributions to be valued by the other team members, they must be full participants in the process. This will ensure that the needs and interests of supporting services employees are addressed in the decision-making process. As members of these teams, supporting services professionals are accountable to those they represent by informing them about the meetings and soliciting their feedback and input.
School-based Support Staff
The members of school-based leadership teams will be elected by the other supporting services professionals in the school. SEIU Local 500 will develop school-based leadership that will be responsible for managing and overseeing the election process at individual schools. For the 2010-2011 school year, the union will certify to the chief operating officer no later than June 1, 2010, in which schools the union is prepared to conduct elections for supporting services representation on the school leadership teams. The union will hold elections in all remaining schools for the 2011-2012 school year. Such elections will be held during regular work hours at times and locations approved in advance by the principal. The parties agree to evaluate such structures at the end of the 2011-2012 school year to determine if further expansion will be beneficial. The chief operating officer and the SEIU Local 500 president will maintain a list of school-based members of leadership teams and will periodically communicate to them regarding their roles as team members. They also will gather feedback about what is working well and opportunities for improvement.
When possible and appropriate, participation on school-based leadership teams should occur during the normal workday of the unit member or through adjustment of the schedule of the unit member on days when such meetings are held. In situations where the meetings occur outside the normal work hours of the unit member and the schedule cannot be adjusted, MCPS will make a limited amount of overtime available to the school or worksite. Such overtime authorization must be requested in advance and approved by the appropriate office—Office of School Performance, Office of the Chief Technology Officer, Division of School Plant Operations, Division of Food and Nutrition Services, and Department of School Safety and Security.
4 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
Additionally, it is expected that supporting services professionals will participate with their leadership teams in the Professional Learning Community Institute and the School Leadership Team Institute.
MCPS and SEIU Local 500 are committed to identifying best practices in schools that engage and involve supporting services employees in leadership, strategic planning, and process improvement initiatives. The parties will solicit best practices from schools and other worksites and will maintain a list to share these practices with all worksites. These structures should encourage the participation of all supporting services staff because their contributions are critical to student achievement and school outcomes. These structures should create connections between the work of the school leadership team and the operations leadership team.
One example of such a structure is school-based operations leadership teams that include representation of the various supporting services functional areas in the school. MCPS and SEIU Local 500 agree to identify schools willing to pilot operations leadership teams for the 2010-2011 school year. Schools where such teams currently exist should continue them as well. The parties further agree to evaluate both the usefulness and effectiveness of such teams at the end of the 2010-2011 school year and determine whether to establish such committees as a permanent part of the school leadership structure in all schools, beginning with the 2011-2012 school year.
F.	Collaboration Between the Leadership of SEIU Local 500, Other MCPS Employee Organizations, and MCPS Leadership
1.	The parties are committed to working collaboratively with representatives of the other employee organizations in a variety of structures and processes that have been created to address the priorities of MCPS. They include the following:

The charge of ADC shall include but not be limited to the following:
•	Discussing matters of mutual interest or concern.

•	Integrating the language and the expectations in the Organizational Culture of Respect and the Framework for Equity and Excellence into employee orientations, professional development activities, meetings, and committee work.
•	Identifying how decisions that are made with other employee organizations will impact unit members, and how all parties will be involved in these decisions so that the impact of any decision will be known before the decision is made.
•	Discussing decisions that impact the members of multiple employee organizations.
•	Overseeing the alignment of the three professional growth systems.
•	Working together to identify opportunities and initiatives to improve the wellness of MCPS employees.

2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 5

The membership of this committee will include the president and executive director of each of the employee organizations, the deputy superintendent, and the chief operating officer.
c.	Executive Leadership Team—The membership of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) will include the president and executive director of each of the employee organizations, the deputy superintendent, the COO, and other MCPS leadership. The ELT charge includes but is not limited to the following:

a.	Staff Development Cross-functional Team—The membership of this committee includes association representatives and representatives from various offices. The charge of the committee includes, but is not limited to, discussing issues and making decisions at the district level about staff development and training programs so that they are aligned with and focused on school system goals.
b.	Collaborative Management Coordinating Committee (CMCC)—A joint collaborative venture to provide oversight for collaborative problem solving in MCPS. This multistakeholder group was created to support the work of ADC. One official representative from each of the three unions will co-chair this committee. The job descriptions of these officials will include the work of the committee as part of their ongoing duties and responsibilities. The initial work will be to develop an action plan to address opportunities to improve the coordination and alignment of the collaborative problem-solving initiatives in MCPS.
c.	Professional Growth System Implementation Teams—The leadership of each of the employee organizations is invited to be a member of each of the three implementation teams.
3.	SEIU Local 500 and the Board of Education also are committed to sustaining the relationships between the parties through committees that have been established in other parts of this agreement, such as the following:
a.	Joint Labor Management Collaboration Committee and Labor Management Committees (Article 4.G.)
b.	Joint Employee Benefits Committee (JEBC) (Article 23, Section H)
c.	Career Development and Educational Improvement Committee (Article 26.H)
d.	Supporting Services Professional Growth System Implementation Team and Peer Assistance and Review Panel (Article 27.D)
4.	ADC also is committed to addressing concerns about schools and other worksites with climate issues. This commitment requires the parties to take appropriate steps to deescalate situations in schools or other work sites and to collaborate with representatives of the other employee organizations and the appropriate MCPS office to resolve issues quickly at the lowest level possible. This may require providing resources and supports to schools and work sites to help them address their climate issues.
5.	a. SEIU Local 500 is committed to using surveys that provide important feedback to offices and schools. Such surveys are a helpful tool and will be used jointly by all parties to identify successful practices of an organization and provide opportunities to identify areas for improvement. These surveys should be considered important feedback, and the survey results will not be used to evaluate schools, offices, or individuals.
6 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
b. Two comprehensive surveys used by MCPS are the School and Office Environment surveys. There is an expectation from all parties that surveys are important and should be completed, and time is provided during the workday for employees to complete these surveys. The results of the surveys will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our work and contribute to strengthening student achievement. The questions on these surveys will be reviewed by all parties on a regular basis to be certain they are updated to reflect changes in the organization, new responsibilities, and new initiatives.
G.	Joint Labor/Management Collaboration Committee
1.	The Joint Labor/Management Collaboration Committee (JLMCC) will be used as a forum for the discussion of issues that are not current matters of negotiation or grievance but are matters of mutual interest or concern between the parties. The JLMCC will provide for regular, ongoing discussions and decision making on matters germane to unionmanagement relations and, when appropriate, to the continuous improvement of school system operations. Each party shall identify at least four representatives, and no more than eight representatives, as permanent members of the committee. Appointees to the committee should be individuals with sufficient knowledge and authority to effectively represent their respective organizations (MCPS and SEIU Local 500). JLMCC will meet bimonthly; however, the committee may choose to amend the frequency of meetings to effectively and efficiently address the committee’s workload.
2.	The overall charge to JLMCC shall include but not be limited to the following:
a)	Serving as the coordinating body for SEIU/MCPS labor management committees and as a resource to facilitate the use of collaboration throughout MCPS.
b)	Administering and interpreting the negotiated Agreement.
c)	Discussing issues that impact all supporting services employees systemwide and any matters of mutual interest or concern, and reaching tentative agreements on issues in a timely manner.
d)	Providing oversight for the implementation of the Supporting Services Professional Growth System.
e)	Gathering information and data to address issues that are brought to the JLMCC or other labor/management committees.
f)	Reviewing and assessing the effectiveness of collaboration between MCPS and SEIU Local 500.
g)	Identifying issues that affect members of the other MCPS employee organizations and communicating those issues to the joint deputies/employee organizations leadership committee.
h)	Although MCPS has the discretionary responsibility for the classification system for all MCPS positions, SEIU Local 500 plays an important role in monitoring the application of the position classification system and in advocating for its unit members. SEIU Local 500 will have opportunities to provide input to MCPS through the submission of recommendations for reclassification through the JLMCC and consultation and collaboration with managers regarding the collection of information pertinent to studying positions for reclassification.
3.	JLMCC will have the following authorities:
a)	To provide oversight and support for chapter-level labor/management committees (LMCs) in the following areas:
•	Transportation employees

2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 7
b)	MCPS and the union will designate their respective representatives and MCAAP also will appoint school-based leaders to each of these groups.
c)	LMCs shall address issues, concerns, or topics within specified areas of responsibility. LMCs will be encouraged to discuss opportunities to improve processes and structures through innovation and enhanced quality.
d)	Members of these LMCs who represent SEIU Local 500 will be authorized to take leave to attend these meetings, utilizing leave approved under Article 20 of this Agreement. Substitutes will be provided when necessary and available.
e)	LMCs will operate under the aegis of JLMCC and will report periodically to JLMCC. JLMCC shall be authorized to consolidate, reconfigure the membership of, modify the charge and tasks of, and discontinue LMCs or initiate new LMCs or subcommittees.
f)	To clarify language and meaning and correct contradictions or inconsistencies in the negotiated Agreement. Recommendations for such changes or corrections to the Agreement shall be subject to internal ratification and approval procedures of MCPS and SEIU Local 500.
g)	JLMCC will develop ground rules that will guide the activities of the committee.
4.	JLMCC will consider the following collaborative venues determined by the parties to be of high priority:
a.	JLMCC and SEIU Local 500 should develop effective working relationships with the Office of School Performance and the community superintendents to make certain that they consider the interests of supporting services employees when they conduct school walk-throughs, meet with school improvement teams, and conduct other business at their schools.
b.	JLMCC should identify and support opportunities for supporting services employees to have open and honest discussions with each other between and among functional areas. Employees should be encouraged to share their experiences in order to learn from one another.
c.	SEIU Local 500 and the Board of Education recognize that there is great potential to afford support employees opportunities to contribute to improving school system operations and practices through their innovation and creativity. Such efforts can lead to greater effectiveness and cost efficiencies within existing practices and a deepening commitment to seeking alternative strategies to practices that have not proven to be as effective. The encouragement by the school system and the union of quality and innovation initiatives reinforces to the public a commitment to maximize the investment of every dollar budgeted to support the success of our school system.
The parties agree to the creation of a joint committee on quality and innovation initiatives to explore ways of encouraging such innovation, including ways to recognize and reward employees, when their contributions are adopted into practice by the school system. The committee will make its recommendations to the JLMCC for consideration and adoption.
d.	Schools are encouraged to work collaboratively with representatives from the departments of Transportation, Financial Services, Materials Management, Facilities Management, and other units to determine how to best meet the needs of students and other stakeholders. This collaboration may include periodic meetings for this specific purpose or participation on school leadership or operations teams.
e.	JLMCC will create a joint technology committee that will be responsible for developing recommendations to enhance the accessibility to technology and the ability of staff to utilize current technology systems in MCPS.
f.	In an effort to explore ways to utilize employee expertise and expand internal capacity to provide professional development, the parties agree to form a joint work group to consider options such as the creation of a training group composed of support professionals. The committee will provide a report and recommendation to JLMCC for final consideration by December 31, 2010.

1.	The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative level, equitable solutions to the problems that may occur in the administration of this Agreement. Both parties agree that these proceedings will be kept informal and confidential at all levels of the procedure.
2.	Nothing herein contained shall be construed as limiting the right of any unit member having a grievance to discuss the matter with any appropriate members of the administration. Such grievance may be adjusted without intervention of the Union, providing that the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or other agreements reached between the parties to this Agreement. A copy of any such grievance and response shall be sent to the Union.
3.	No grievance shall be initiated more than 15 duty days after the cause has occurred or should have been discovered unless an extension for filing has been agreed to, in writing, between the parties. A written Union request for a single extension of up to 14 calendar days in order to investigate a potential grievance is automatically granted if submitted prior to the initial deadline.
4.	A grievance shall be automatically waived and shall not be subject to further discussion or appeal if the grievant does not process it within any of the stated time limits. Such time limits may be extended only by mutual agreement between the parties.
C.	A covered unit member will first discuss his/her grievance with his/her immediate supervisor. Both parties will make efforts to solve the grievance at this informal level. The Union, on behalf of its institutional interests, may pursue informal resolution of the grievance at this level, as well.
D.	Step One
If the grievance cannot be solved at the informal level, the unit member or the Union, on behalf of and at the request of the unit member, then submits the grievance to the appropriate administrator in writing within 15 duty days after the grievance arises. If the appropriate administrator does not satisfy it within 10 duty days from receipt of the written grievance, the grievance may be processed to Step Two. Should the administrator fail to respond to the grievant and the Union in a timely manner, the Union may appeal the grievance to Step Two of the grievance procedure.
Step Two
If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition in Step One, he/she may request that the union appeal the grievance to Step Two. The Union shall meet and counsel the grievant on the merits of the grievance. If the Union deems the grievance to be meritorious, it may refer the grievance to the director of association relations within 10 duty days of receipt of the Step One response, or within 10 duty days of the deadline for the Step One response, if none was received. If the grievance is referred within the time limits, the director of association relations shall have 15 duty days to conduct an investigation of the matter and respond to the Union, with a copy to the grievant. The response of the director of association relations shall include the disposition of the grievance as well as copies of relevant and appropriate documents relied upon in determining the disposition of the grievance.
10 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
Step Three
1.	If the grievant and the Union are not satisfied with the disposition in Step Two, the Union may forward the grievance to the Department of Association Relations within 10 duty days of receiving the Step Two response, or within 10 duty days of the deadline for the Step Two response, if none was received, for processing. If the grievance is referred within the time limits, a meeting shall be scheduled to discuss the grievance. The superintendent or his/ her designee shall preside over the meeting on behalf of the employer. The superintendent/ designee shall have 10 duty days from the date of the meeting to respond to the Union and the grievant.
2.	A grievance may be filed for a group of unit members at Step Three if the president or designee of SEIU Local 500 and the director of association relations agree that the authority to resolve the grievance does not exist at Step One or Step Two.
Step Four—Arbitration
1.	If the grievant and the Union are not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance made by the superintendent, the grievance may be submitted to arbitration.
2.	Arbitration may be initiated by the Union by serving notice upon the Board requesting arbitration within 15 duty days after receiving the Step Three response and setting forth the precise question it proposes to arbitrate, the section of the Agreement violated, and a description of the action taken that initiated the grievance. The director of association relations, on behalf of the Board, will acknowledge his/her agreement with the submission to arbitration statement by affixing his/her signature to the submission form within five duty days and returning the form to the Union. If the director of association relations does not agree with the submission to arbitration statement, he/she will so indicate this disagreement within five duty days, sign the form, and return it to the Union. If disagreement exists on the submission statement, the arbitrator must first frame the issue before proceeding with the merits of the case.
3.	The superintendent or designee and the president of SEIU Local 500 or designee will attempt to agree upon a mutually acceptable arbitrator and obtain a commitment from said arbitrator to serve. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator or obtain such commitment within the specified period, a request for arbitration may be sent to the American Arbitration Association and a list of arbitrators requested. A copy of the demand shall be sent to the other party. The parties will then be bound by the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association as they apply to the selection of an arbitrator.
4.	The arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify any terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall not accept issues not presented during the grievance procedure. The arbitrator shall be without power or authority to make any recommendations beyond the terms of this Agreement. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties and should be issued within 30 days of the close of any hearing, or in the event briefs are filed, 30 days after such filing.
5.	The expense of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties.
6.	Definition of Student Abuse, Neglect, or Mistreatment. Actions by a bargaining unit employee that constitute sexual misconduct, inappropriate physical contact, or neglect by the employee that either has the effect of causing harm to the student, or for which harm is reasonably foreseeable as a result of the employee’s improper actions.
7.	In the event of allegations of student abuse, neglect, or mistreatment the Union is entitled to review statements from students concerning the allegations. The Union representative may submit additional questions the Union would like to have asked of the students regarding the alleged events and matters directly relevant to the allegations. In the event the Union submits such question(s), the administration will collaborate with the Union to develop appropriate questions that will be asked of student witnesses. The Board will provide the Union with a copy of any record of the investigation.
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 11
a.	Student witnesses will be interviewed separately and will be told not to discuss their interviews with other students.
b.	A record will be made of interviews of student witnesses.
8.	The Board may choose to submit the written statement(s) of student witnesses and not to have them testify. If the Board elects to introduce evidence at an arbitration hearing, which is based on student witnesses that the Board has not produced at the hearing, that evidence shall be treated accordingly, in the judgment of the arbitrator.
9.	If the Board elects to introduce the testimony of student witnesses at the arbitration hearing, the arbitrator will consider whether the student has the maturity and understanding of the need to accurately recount events.
a.	A student witness’ testimony may be taken other than in a face-to-face confrontation between the student and a grievant against whom the student’s testimony is offered if the arbitrator finds that the student would likely suffer emotional stress that would substantially impair the student’s ability to communicate with the arbitrator if required to be confronted face-to-face with the grievant.
b.	The arbitrator may order the presentation of the testimony of a student witness by an alternative method if the arbitrator finds that presenting the testimony of the student by an alternative method is necessary to protect the best interests of the student or enable the student to communicate with the arbitrator.
10.	If the arbitrator concludes based on the record that student abuse, neglect, or mistreatment did in fact occur as alleged, the arbitrator may not substitute her/his judgment with regard to the appropriateness of the disciplinary penalty assessed by the employer.
11.	When a grievance has been filed regarding disciplinary action against an employee in situations in which a non-MCPS agency is investigating the allegations of student abuse, neglect, or mistreatment, MCPS will inform the Union in the event that the investigating agency finds the facts of the allegation to be unfounded. MCPS will reconsider its own finding and any discipline imposed in light of the findings of the outside investigative agency.
E.	Miscellaneous
1.	All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of a grievance will be filed in a separate grievance file and will not be kept in the official personnel file of any of the participants.
2.	All decisions rendered at all levels of the grievance procedure will be in writing, setting forth the decision and the reasons therefore, and will be transmitted promptly to both parties. The Union shall be sent a copy of all grievances and responses.
3.	Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, taking appeals, making reports and recommendations, and other necessary documents will be prepared by the superintendent or designee after consultation with the Union, and will be given appropriate distribution so as to facilitate operation of the grievance procedure.
4.	Both parties shall be permitted to present evidence and witnesses and to cross examine all witnesses whenever a hearing is held.
5.	The administrative complaint procedure currently in use to process and resolve unit member complaints pertaining to matters not covered by this Agreement or subject to collective bargaining shall be continued. Matters subject to the grievance procedure and subject to collective bargaining consistent with Article 5, Section K, shall not be heard or processed under the administrative complaint procedure. An aggrieved employee affected by a matter involving an alleged violation of statutory rights that also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. An employee shall be deemed to have exercised his/her option under this provision at such time as the employee timely initiates an action under the applicable statutory procedure or timely files a grievance in writing, in accordance with the provisions of this Article, whichever event occurs first.
12 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
6.	It is agreed that the Union may submit any class action grievance involving a general alleged violation of the Agreement. It also may submit a grievance alleging actions taken by the employer, not otherwise protested, that violate basic principles or understandings expressed in the Agreement.
7.	Grievance meetings and hearings shall be scheduled to minimize, where possible, the disruption of school system business. Grievance meetings and hearings scheduled during the grievant’s regular working hours shall be considered time worked. Grievants and school employee witnesses whose testimony is relevant and material to the grievance, called by either party, shall likewise lose no pay because of their participation.
8.	The employer shall furnish documentation and information that is reasonably available, appropriate, and necessary for full and proper discussion and understanding of subjects relevant and material to the grievance in question, to the Union to the extent not prohibited by law. Further, a representative of the Union investigating a grievance shall have the right, with the written authorization of the bargaining unit member, to examine the contents of the unit member’s personnel and/or worksite file.
F.	Employee Rights
1.	No reprisals of any kind shall be taken against any party involved in the grievance procedure.
2.	The Union shall be the exclusive representative of a grievant at Step Two and beyond. The grievant may be represented by the Union at any step of this grievance procedure.
3.	Nothing in this grievance procedure shall limit the rights of any unit member to discuss any complaint, problem, or matter of dissatisfaction with any appropriate administrator without representation or the intervention of any organization.

14 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
3.	Effective January 1, 2009, a 5.3 percent increase shall be applied to the pay schedule for all unit members. (The COLA provision in this paragraph was not implemented. It is subject to reopened negotiations, in accordance with Article 41 of this Agreement.)
4.	Each bargaining unit employee with 22 or more years of MCPS service shall receive a onetime salary adjustment (gross) of $200 in each of the first two years of this Agreement. This paragraph expires upon implementation of the step 22 provisions in Section B below.
B.	1. Longevity increases shall be provided on completion of 10, 14, 18, and (effective July 1, 2009) 22 years of MCPS service. (The Step 22 longevity provision was not implemented during FY 2010 or 2011. It is subject to reopened negotiations, in accordance with Article 41 of this Agreement.) (New or additional longevity increases will not be implemented during FY 2011 and are subject to reopened negotiations in accordance with Article 41 of this Agreement.)
2.	The amount of the 10-,14-, and 18-year longevity salary increment shall each be a one grade increase on the Supporting Services Pay Schedule. The 22-year longevity rate shall be 2.5 percent more than the employee’s rate of pay with the 18-year longevity increment.
3.	A longevity salary increment shall be effective the first day of the pay period in which the unit member completes 10, 14, 18, and 22 years of MCPS service.
C.	1. A permanent or conditional unit member shall be eligible each year for a one step salary increment. Subject to Section C.2 below, such salary increments shall be awarded annually until a unit member reaches the top pay step (not including longevity) of the pay grade to which his/her position is assigned. (Step increases will not be implemented during FY 2011 and are subject to reopened negotiations, in accordance with Article 41 of this Agreement.)
2.	a) Wage increments are effective on the first day of the pay period in which the anniversary date falls.
b) Whenever a unit member is permanently assigned to a position that has a higher salary range than the one he/she holds, the effective date of the change shall become his/her new anniversary date, except that the anniversary date does not change if the higher position is a result of a reclassification and the unit member is the incumbent in the position.
3.	A fully qualified unit member who is promoted to a higher grade position shall be assigned at the lowest step of such higher grade that exceeds his/her existing step by two steps; however, if there is no step in the higher grade which exceeds his/her existing step by two steps, the unit member will be placed at the top of the grade.
4.	A building service manager, a building service assistant manager, a cafeteria manager, or a food services satellite manager whose position is reclassified to a lower grade because of reduced responsibility or a change in revenues/meals served will have his/her salary status “grandparented” under the following conditions and terms:
a)	The employee received, and continues to receive, a “Meets Competency” on performance evaluations.
b)	The employee participates in interviews offered in the same job classification held at the time he/she was grandfathered.
c)	The grandparent status will end if—
i.	the employee is offered and declines a job in the same job classification held at the time he/she was grandfathered, or
ii.	the employee accepts a job in a different job classification.
d)	If the grandparent status ends in accordance with the terms of this Section (C.4), except for acceptance of another job as indicated in c.ii. above, the employee will be “red-circled” at his/her then current hourly rate so that there will not be a reduction in hourly rate of pay.
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 15
D.	Shift Assignment and Differential Pay
1.	Shift differential pay means the amount paid over and above the basic hourly straight time rate.
2.	Eligibility—Each eight hour unit member is eligible for shift differential pay, if the unit member is assigned to all of the following:
a)	A permanent or conditional position
b)	The second or third shift
c)	A full eight hour shift
d)	A position classification approved by the superintendent or designee for shift differential payment
3.	Designation of Shift Starting Time and Appropriate Shift Differential Rates—The starting time and rate of shift differential pay for the shifts are listed below. A unit member assigned to any shift
a)	Starting at 2 p.m. or later and before 10 p.m. is eligible to receive 5 percent differential pay in addition to his/her base rate of pay.
b)	Starting at 10 p.m. or later and before 5 a.m. is eligible to receive 7.5 percent differential pay in addition to his/her base rate of pay.
E.	Extracurricular Activities—A unit member whose past performance in an extracurricular activities program has been satisfactory will be given preference over other unit members when there are openings for such activity that need to be filled. The person thus assigned will receive the same stipend paid to a teacher, if permitted under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). For purposes of determining eligibility for extracurricular activity assignments at the stipend rate, the FLSA standard 40-hour week shall be used rather than the standard 8-hour day identified in Articles 8 and 13 of this Agreement. A unit member who has been effective, as determined by the principal, as a nonathletic extracurricular activity sponsor may retain the stipend activity during the following school year, unless the principal determines a change in sponsor is necessary.
F.	Paraeducator Compensation for Class Coverage—Paraeducators will be compensated for class coverage when such coverage involves having the paraeducator work from a prescribed lesson plan designed to ensure continuity of instruction in the absence of a teacher, and when such coverage is provided for a minimum of two hours in a given day. Should a paraeducator cover a class or classes without a regular teacher or a substitute teacher present, and such coverage is for the required total amount of time, whether for a consecutive period(s) of time or not, the paraeducator shall receive a class coverage premium of $7.50 per hour for all time spent providing such coverage for that day. Should the coverage for a qualifying assignment be continuous into the following school day, the class coverage premium shall continue, beginning with the first hour of continuous coverage the following school day. Routine recess, lunch hour, and bus duty responsibilities will not constitute a break in class coverage assignments. All class coverage hours worked by a paraeducator must fall within his/her assigned duty hours and are not to extend beyond the number of hours of his/her daily assignment. It is further understood that it is the responsibility of the paraeducator’s supervisor to ensure that work is assigned to the employee within the employee’s assigned duty hours. Nothing in this section is intended to allow a paraeducator to perform class coverage duties without compensation as provided for above. The parties agree to jointly monitor the utilization of paraeducators for class coverage. Where a paraeducator is not available the principal may designate another support staff employee qualified to perform such work. In such instances, the class coverage premium shall apply when the class coverage work meets the requirements of this section.
G.	Pay Differential for Interpreting Responsibilities—A unit member may receive pay differential for utilizing advanced skills in oral communication and comprehension in English and another language that has been determined to be eligible for receipt of the pay differential, and if the unit member utilizes such skills to meet the needs of the work-site community in a manner that is beyond the duties and responsibilities for the position to which the unit member is assigned. The following conditions will apply:
16 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
1.	Prior to becoming eligible for the pay differential, the bargaining unit member must pass an oral language proficiency and interpreting examination designed to assess advanced oral and interpreting skills in an eligible language.
2.	Compensation is $9.00 per hour, in addition to the unit member’s regular rate of pay, for all hours actually worked utilizing the skills, with a minimum of one hour pay for each occurrence. The pay differential is applied in half-hour blocks after the first hour.
3.	All hours worked under this provision must fall within the assigned duty hours of the unit member and are not to extend beyond the number of hours of the unit member’s daily assignment. It is the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that such work is assigned to the unit member within the unit member’s assigned duty hours.
4.	A unit member who has concerns about the impact of such an assignment on his/her regular responsibilities should raise those concerns with his/her supervisor. The principal or director involved will consider the concerns and make a decision about priorities.
5.	When a unit member is receiving the interpreting differential, the unit member’s use of advanced language interpreting skills may become an element of the unit member’s professional growth plan and the unit member’s performance of advance language skills may be noted in the performance evaluation. Poor performance in this area will not adversely impact an employee’s overall evaluation, but may lead to removal of certification for the differential.
6.	If a language is removed from the list of eligible languages, a bargaining unit member receiving pay differential for proficiency in that language will immediately cease to receive the differential pay.
7.	A unit member who has passed the proficiency exam may choose at any time to withdraw from the program and no longer be eligible for the interpreting differential.
8.	Decisions regarding the selection of languages for eligibility for differential pay, the content of language proficiency examinations, and decisions regarding whether a bargaining unit member satisfies language proficiency requirements are non-grievable and non-arbitrable.
9.	The Joint Labor/Management Collaboration Committee will review this program after it has been in effect for at least a year to determine whether or not it should be recommended for continuation; and if recommended, will consider future changes to the program to ensure that the objectives of this program are realized.
ARTICLE 8
Overtime
A.	1. Unit members covered by this Agreement who are not in those positions considered as exempted for overtime under the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act as executive, administrative, or professional employees, and who are required or authorized to work by an appropriate supervisor in excess of 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in a regularly scheduled work week shall be paid at one and one half times the unit member’s regular rate of pay.
2.	Paid leave shall be counted as hours worked for purposes of determining hours worked for overtime.
B.	Overtime Assignments
1.	MCPS has the right to assign overtime. However, unless a unit member is given at least two hours notice before the close of his or her regularly scheduled shift preceding the overtime or unless an emergency occurs that prevents giving of such notice, the overtime work will be voluntary.
2.	Overtime shall be distributed as equally as possible among the unit members qualified to do the work, except for those building service workers who work overtime for Interagency Coordinating Board on weekends. Those unit members will normally be Grade 6 building
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 17
service workers in order to meet the commitment made to the Montgomery County Council. In middle schools and high schools, up to 20 percent of such weekend overtime hours per year shall be offered to employees on site who hold positions higher than pay Grade 6. In elementary schools, up to 30 percent of such weekend overtime hours per year shall be offered to employees on site who hold positions higher than pay Grade 6.
For weekdays and holidays, the equitable distribution language will hold.
C.	Overtime Records
Overtime records shall be maintained on each unit member and the records necessary for the processing of a grievance will be made available to the president of SEIU Local 500 or designee upon request.
D.	For positions that will have regularly scheduled overtime, unit members will be notified by the Office of Human Resources and Development of this requirement prior to selection.

Sick leave is a designated amount of compensated leave that is to be granted to a unit member who, through personal illness, injury, pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and recovery, or quarantine, is unable to perform the duties of his/her position. Sick leave also may include other excused absences such as medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment impossible to schedule on nonduty days.

1.	Eligibility—The provisions of sick leave apply to all unit members.

It is mandatory if the unit member uses sick leave for five or more consecutive duty days.
9.	Rewarding Perfect Attendance
SEIU Local 500 and MCPS have a shared interest in minimizing the amount of sick leave utilized. Excessive sick leave utilization creates excessive burdens on co-workers, harms employee productivity, and creates additional economic demand on the school system.
Perfect attendance reflects an extraordinary level of commitment on the part of any employee to support the school system’s commitment to excellence and to student achievement. In recognition of such commitment, as well as for the benefits and savings to the school system that results from employees being at work, MCPS will recognize employees who work an entire school year without utilizing any of their sick leave benefits.
a)	Each school year MCPS shall recognize any bargaining unit employee who worked the entire preceding school year without utilizing any sick leave benefits. The unit member
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 21
may apply for and receive a cash-out payment for up to one third of the employee’s earned sick leave benefit for that year.
b)	The hours paid out will be deducted from the employee’s earned sick leave account, and paid no later than first pay period in January that includes the winter break.
c)	The Joint Labor Management Collaboration Committee will monitor this program to measure its effectiveness and realized cost savings to the school system, and will consider future changes to the program to ensure that the objectives of this program are being realized.
10.	SEIU Local 500 Sick Leave Bank
All rules and guidelines governing the uses of the sick leave bank shall be established by mutual consent of the parties.
C.	Leave Without Pay, Personal Illness, or Family Illness
The Employee and Retiree Service Center may grant a leave of absence without pay to a unit member when that unit member or a member of his/her immediate family is ill. The leave shall be for definite periods, such as a semester or school year, and shall not exceed one year. The leave without pay begins when the unit member has exhausted all available sick leave and sick leave bank options. Leave approved and verified with a doctor’s certification on an FMLA leave request form, in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act, may be taken for up to 12 weeks. Applications for leave must be submitted in writing to the appropriate supervisor or official and forwarded with his/her recommendation to the Leave Administration team in the Employee and Retiree Service Center for approval.
1.	Eligibility—All unit members are eligible to apply.
2.	Benefits—Unit members may contribute to the retirement system while on leave, according to the provisions of the MCPS Retirement System. For unit members on FMLA leave, MCPS will maintain the employee’s benefits under the conditions coverage would have been provided if the employee had continued working.

a)	A unit member who is on permanent status at the time he/she is granted leave because of personal illness or illness in his/her immediate family shall remain on permanent status.
b)	A unit member who has completed six months of successful experience with Montgomery County Public Schools on a probationary status and has been recommended for permanent status at the time leave is granted shall go on permanent status at the time he/she returns from leave and is reassigned.

Reassignment upon return from an approved FMLA leave will be to the unit member’s original position held prior to leave or to an equivalent position if the original position has been eliminated.
D.	Leave for Illness in the Immediate Family
Leave may be granted for illness in the immediate family and shall be charged against accumulated sick leave.
E.	Workers’ Compensation Leave
A unit member who is physically unable to report for duty as a result of an injury in the line of duty may be placed on workers’ compensation leave at full salary by the superintendent or designee provided the unit member seeks medical treatment with respect to the injury from a physician who is among a comprehensive list of preferred providers approved by the Board of Education. SEIU Local 500 shall have representation on the selection committee that recommends the list of preferred providers to the Board. If the unit member elects to be treated by a physician who is not among the list of preferred providers, the unit member will be entitled to receive the benefit mandated by the Workers’ Compensation Law of Maryland, but will not be
22 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
entitled to the benefits in this section. A unit member receiving Workers’ Compensation benefits but not receiving workers’ compensation leave may use his/her accrued sick leave and must submit to the Board all monies received through the Workers’ Compensation Law of Maryland, or resulting from a legal liability of a person other than the unit member.
For purposes of this section, full salary is defined as net biweekly pay after withholding of federal, state, and FICA taxes. The parties agree that it is not desirable for such individuals to receive greater salary after taxes while on workers’ compensation leave than when they are on active duty. Therefore, the Board shall provide a supplement to the standard workers’ compensation benefit so that the net pay of the employee is equal to his/her regular net pay.
The unit member, or his/her representative, must file an injury report with the Employee and Retiree Service Center within 48 hours of the injury. The unit member shall also file a leave request for leave for disability accompanied by a participating doctor’s report stating he/she is unable to carry out the duties of his/her assignment due to this injury.
Workers’ compensation leave is approved by the associate superintendent for human resources and is contingent upon the claim for disability being approved by the MCPS workers’ compensation claims administrator. If the leave is not approved by the MCPS workers’ compensation claims administrator, the employee will be required to repay MCPS all monies received. This payment can be in the form of annual leave, sick leave, or lump sum payment. All monies payable to the unit member through the Workers’ Compensation Law of the state of Maryland, or resulting from a legal liability of a person other than the unit member must, under the right of subrogation, be transmitted to the Board by the unit member. It is the responsibility of the disabled unit member to check with his/her physician and to inform his/her principal or other appropriate official monthly of the approximate date he/she can return to his/her regular assignment. A unit member may be carried on full workers’ compensation leave for up to one year after the disability accident. At that time, the superintendent or designee will determine whether the unit member is able to return to his/her regular assignment, be given an alternate work assignment, be placed on sick leave, or be placed on disability retirement. An alternate work assignment terminates workers’ compensation leave.
F.	Annual Leave
Annual leave is paid leave that is granted to each 12 month unit member.
1.	Eligibility for Annual Leave—The provisions of annual leave shall apply only to those unit members whose assigned responsibility is of 12 months’ duration. Twelve month unit members on permanent status will be advanced annual leave at the beginning of each fiscal year. Twelve month probationary unit members will be advanced annual leave upon attainment of permanent status. Twelve month unit members whose assignment is less than 40 hours per week accrue annual leave in proportion to the hours of assignment and according to the number of years of MCPS service as established for 12 month unit members whose assignment is a 40-hour week.
2.	Method of Computing Annual Leave—All newly hired 12 month unit members and all currently employed 10 month unit members upon appointment to a 12 month position shall earn annual leave as follows:
0-3 years of MCPS service—15 days
4-15 years of MCPS service—20 days
16+ years of MCPS service—26 days
3.	Restriction on Time for Use of Annual Leave
a)	Unit members will take their annual leave at times when such leave will not adversely affect the ongoing instructional/operational program. The administrator/supervisor in collaboration with affected employees will provide a written notice for anticipated critical staff coverage and suggested time periods for leave usage. Reasonable opportunity for use of annual leave must be allowed.
b)	A unit member must provide a minimum of one week advance notice when requesting three or more consecutive days annual leave. Leave may be granted with less notice at the discretion of the administrator. When operational and scheduling circumstances
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 23
may lead to potential constraints on the approval of leave requests, administrators/ supervisors will notify employees of the situation in a timely manner. Administrators/ supervisors are encouraged to inform employees of such constraints as soon as they become aware of them. Guidelines regarding the criteria for determining when requests may be authorized or denied will be provided upon request of employees.
4.	Accumulation of Annual Leave
a)	For any one year, a 12 month unit member may carry forward up to, but not exceeding, 10 days of annual leave earned from the previous year.
b)	The maximum number of days of annual leave available at any one time will be the balance brought forward up to a maximum of 20 days, plus the amount to be earned for the current school year.
c)	Each year, annual leave that is not used or forwarded shall be automatically transferred to a unit member’s accumulated sick leave.
5.	Disposition of Accumulated Annual Leave at Termination of Service—All annual leave should be used before the effective date of employment termination, or a lump sum settlement shall be made at the current salary rate, but not to exceed a maximum of 40 days.
6.	Indebtedness for Advanced Annual Leave at Termination of Service—Any indebtedness for advanced annual leave by a unit member upon termination of service shall be resolved as follows:
a)	The amount due shall be deducted from the unit member’s earned salary.

Retirement contributions, if any, may be paid monthly to MCPS; or the total of such contributions, plus interest, may be paid at the time of return from leave, in accordance with MCPS procedures.
7.	In order to return from maternity/child care/adoption leave, the unit member shall submit a request in writing to the associate superintendent for human resources at least one month before the date the employee desires to be reassigned. If a unit member is offered an assignment for which the unit member is qualified at the same pay grade and the assignment is refused, the unit member will have to resign or be terminated. A unit member returning from an FMLA leave will be reassigned to his/her original position, or to an equivalent position if the original position no longer exists.
J.	Military Leave (Section 6 205 of the Annotated Code, Education)
1.	Military Leave of Absence
a)	Approval—A unit member entering military service may, upon written application and with the approval of the superintendent or designee, be granted leave of absence without pay for one period of service and in accordance with the state regulations referred to above. A copy of the military orders must accompany the request for leave. This leave applies to individuals who are drafted or who volunteer for service for one period of enlistment.
b)	Return From Military Leave—A unit member granted military leave of absence shall retain the right to be placed in the same or similar position upon return from leave, subject to the following:
(1)	The unit member has completed any required period of probation prior to entering the armed forces and his/her separation from the armed forces was under conditions other than a dishonorable discharge.
(2)	He/she makes application within 90 days from the date of his/her separation from the armed forces in case he/she has involuntarily entered, or within 90 days after the termination of his/her first period of enlistment in case he/she has voluntarily entered, for reinstatement by the Board of Education.
(3)	He/she makes application for reinstatement within 90 days from the date of separation from such service or within 90 days after discharge from a hospital, provided such hospitalization is directly connected with, related to, and immediately follows his/her separation from the armed forces, and the period of hospitalization does not extend beyond a year from the date of such separation.
Any employee qualifying for reinstatement under this provision shall be entitled to start at the salary and rate of earnings for leave which he/she would have received if he/she had remained continuously in the Board of Education’s service.
If he/she is not qualified to perform the duties of his/her prior position by reason of disability sustained during military service, but is qualified to perform the duties of any other position in the employ of the Board of Education, he/she shall be reemployed in such comparable position, the duties of which he/she is qualified to perform, as will provide him/her like seniority, status, and pay rate, or the nearest approximation thereof consistent with the circumstances of his/her case.
c)	Retirement—The unit member, upon reinstatement, shall submit to the MCPS Retirement System an official verification of the length of military service.
2.	Military Leave for Training Purposes (Article 65, Section 42, of the Annotated Code of Maryland)

28 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
b)	Application Procedure—Application for military leave for training purposes shall be made in advance, immediately upon receipt from the appropriate military authorities of official notice to report. A copy of the official orders must accompany the application for leave, which must be approved by the appropriate official and the superintendent or designee. When possible, military leave for unit members with less than 12 months of responsibility shall be arranged during nonduty periods. The superintendent or designee may request a change in military orders when it seems to be in the best interest of the school system.
c)	Pay Status During Leave—All unit members who are members of the organized militia or the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, or the Marine Corps Reserves shall be entitled to leave of absence without loss of pay on all days during which they shall be engaged in field or coast defense or other training ordered or authorized under any law of Maryland or of the United States, during such time as they are on inactive duty training, for not more than 15 days annually, provided, however, if any members of the organized militia are ordered to active duty under authority of the governor, they shall be entitled to leave of absence without loss of pay for such time they actually serve under such active duty orders in addition to the 15 day period specified above.
K.	Salary and Leave Benefits for Conscientious Objectors
1.	There are two classes of conscientious objectors—
a)	Class 1 O, who does not enter the military service but fulfills his/her selective service obligation by working for 24 months in an institution approved by the state in which he/she resides, and who is not entitled to veterans’ benefits, and

3.	A unit member who is Class 1 O, who is drafted and enters this type of program, shall be given Leave for Unusual and Imperative Reasons and, upon release from his/her obligation, shall be reinstated at the same or comparable position at the same salary step and in the same status as at the time his/her leave began.
4.	Unit members who are conscientious objectors and who are Class 1 A-O shall be entitled to all provisions of the salary plan and military leave policies.
L.	Leave for Family Bereavement
A unit member shall be allowed a maximum of five days of absence without loss of salary upon the death of a child, parent (natural, foster, step, or in law), brother, sister, husband, wife, or of anyone who lives regularly in his/her household. A unit member shall be allowed a maximum of two duty days of absence without loss of salary upon the death of a brother in law, sister in law, son in law, daughter in law, grandparent, grandchild, spouse’s grandparent, or an individual for whom the unit member held durable medical or personal representative power of attorney at the time of death. In the event of unusual travel or personal obligations in connection with the use of bereavement leave, additional leave days may be granted by the Leave Administration Team in the Employee and Retiree Service Center. With approval from the Leave Administration Team, one or more of the allowed days may be used at a time that is not immediately proximate to the date of death for a burial or memorial service that occurs at a later date. Leave for family bereavement is not available for business purposes such as estate management or will review.
M.	Political Leave
Leaves of absence for political activity without salary, including candidacy for political office or holding public office, shall be arranged with the following rules:
1.	Unit members engaging in political activity shall make it clear that their utterances and actions are theirs as individuals.
2.	Leaves of absence shall be requested in writing.
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 29
3.	Leaves of absence for campaigning and holding office may be arranged for a definite period. If the candidate is not elected, he/she shall be returned to his/her position immediately.
4.	Leave may include voter registration, election day duties, or other political responsibilities.
N.	Civil Leave for Juror or Witness Service
Upon approval of the superintendent or designee, a unit member who is subpoenaed as a witness in a civil or criminal case, or is called and serves on a jury, may be granted paid leave for that period of time he/she is unable to report to work. Application for leave must be made in advance and submitted with a copy of the subpoena. The unit member shall transmit any monies received from such assignment other than those used for personal expenses (e.g., travel) to the Board of Education.
O.	Compensatory Leave
Unit members shall not earn or be granted compensatory leave.
P.	Leave for Emergency Closing of Schools and/or Central Office
When schools are closed because of inclement weather or other emergency reasons, 12 month unit members are expected to report or remain on duty; all 10 month unit members are granted emergency leave automatically.
When all schools and the central offices are closed because of inclement weather or other emergency reasons, 12-month unit members designated as emergency personnel are expected to report or remain on duty unless directed not to do so by the superintendent or designee. Appropriate local site staffing levels in emergency situations will be determined by the supervisor in consultation with the appropriate local work leader. All others are automatically granted emergency leave.
In school years when there are more emergency days lost than permitted by the school calendar, those excess days must be made up at times specified by the superintendent or designee. All 12-month personnel are expected to report for duty when schools are closed, or take annual leave, unless the superintendent or designee has announced that the central office is closed.
Q.	Leave for Unusual or Imperative Reasons
Employees may be granted leave by the superintendent or designee for unusual or imperative reasons at no loss of pay, or at loss of full pay when no other leave is applicable. Approval must be secured before the absence occurs.
R.	Personal Leave
1.	All unit members may be granted up to four days per year for personal leave. A written request for the intended absence shall be submitted to the principal or appropriate official at least one day prior to the expected absence. No specific reason for such personal leave shall be required or solicited. Personal leave, if granted, must be used only to conduct personal business of a nature that cannot be scheduled on any nonduty day. Personal leave will be granted only when the immediate supervisor determines that adequate provisions for continuing the instructional/operational program can be made. In cases of emergency, the appropriate official shall be notified prior to the start of the duty day to be taken off.
2.	The rules regarding personal leave shall be as follows:
a)	Requests for personal leave shall be made in writing.
b)	Leave immediately before or after a holiday, vacation, or staff development day may be requested for reason from the school principal or appropriate official.
c)	Up to two personal leave days may be carried over from year to year, i.e., personal leave may accrue to a maximum of six days. The remainder of unused personal leave shall be transferred to accumulated sick leave at the end of the school year.
S.	General
1.	Except in those cases where the superintendent or designee has the right to grant the leave, the superintendent or designee shall have the right to recommend to the Board of Education that a leave of absence be granted with loss of substitute pay, without pay, or with pay or to recommend that the leave be denied.
30 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
2.	Administrators/supervisors shall reply to leave requests requiring approval within a reasonable period of time. When particular operational needs or scheduling considerations prevent a timely response to an employee’s leave request, the administrator/supervisor will inform the employee promptly regarding the delay, including the operational needs or scheduling considerations causing it and an anticipated time for approval or denial of the leave request. Leave is not considered approved until the administrator/supervisor grants the request.
T.	Procedures for Short- and Long-Term Leave (non-FMLA)
1.	When the leave is of short duration, and not longer than 60 consecutive duty days, a substitute may be employed and the position held for the return of the unit member. Use MCPS Form 430-1 for short term leave.
2.	Unit members wishing leave in excess of 60 consecutive duty days for a period not to exceed 18 months must use MCPS Form 430-1 for long term leave without salary. The unit member’s position will not be held for his/her return.
3.	Unit members who are eligible for annual leave will be allowed to use any earned leave in their accounts after approval by the principal or appropriate official. The 60-day or 18-month period shall include the period of annual leave if used.
4.	Unit members must request these leaves in writing to the appropriate official at least 30 duty days in advance of the intended leave.
5.	Unit members may elect to have continued participation in the MCPS Employee Benefit Plan by assuming the full cost of the premiums while on leave without pay. Contributions to the employee benefit plan will be payable monthly to the Board of Education in accordance with MCPS procedures. Failure to make payments in accordance with MCPS procedures will result in cancellation of benefits. Retirement contributions, if any, may be paid monthly to MCPS, or the total of such contributions, plus interest, may be paid at the time of return from leave in accordance with MCPS procedures.
6.	In order to return from leave, the unit member shall submit a request in writing to the associate superintendent for human resources at least one month before the date the employee desires to be reassigned. If a unit member is offered an assignment for which he/ she is qualified at the same pay grade and the assignment is refused, the unit member will have to resign or be terminated.
7.	Unit members who are not working, are not in a leave status that qualifies for the Board of Education contribution towards benefits, and are not under FMLA protection, shall be responsible for paying the full cost of employee benefits. Failure to pay shall result in loss of benefits.
ARTICLE 13
Working Hours and Work Load
A.	The regularly scheduled work week shall not exceed five days. The regularly scheduled workday shall not exceed eight hours in addition to a daily duty free lunch period. Starting and dismissal times will be assigned by the principal or the appropriate director. However, no change in starting and dismissal times in excess of two hours will be made without the concurrence of the Union and the affected unit member. Such change in assigned schedule may occur no more frequently than one time each school year. This limitation will not apply where the entire shift of the position assignment is changed. By mutual agreement between the Board and the Union, the work hours or work week for an employee or group of employees may be modified to exceed five days per week or eight hours per day.
The parties recognize the desirability of providing employees in the bargaining unit who work less than 40 hours per week the opportunity to work an optimal number of hours per week consistent with the operating needs and efficiency of the school system.
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 31
B.	Except for bus operators and bus attendants, the workday for 40-hour per week unit members shall consist of eight hours of work within eight and one half consecutive hours unless the workday has been modified as indicated in Section A above. The workday for unit members working less than 40 hours shall also consist of regularly scheduled consecutive working hours exclusive of duty free lunch periods when applicable. Starting and dismissal times for bus operators and bus attendants will be assigned by the director of transportation. Nothing shall prevent a unit member from voluntarily requesting an exception to this section.
The transportation department will undertake a review of schedules and assignments for the purpose of reducing the length of the downtime periods.
C.	1. Notwithstanding the above, the Board may implement modified work weeks for central office safety and security personnel, not to exceed 40 regularly scheduled hours in a six-day week (Saturday, 12:01 a.m. to Friday, 12:00 p.m.). Time worked in excess of 40 hours in a modified work week shall be overtime and paid at one and one half the unit member’s regular rate of pay. Such a modified work week may be implemented by mutual agreement between the principal and the employee for school-based safety and security personnel. No such employee shall suffer retaliation for not agreeing to a modified work week.
2.	Notwithstanding Sections A and B above, there may be times when the nature of work performed by certain unit members (career information counselors, social services assistants, family day care team manager and quality control assistant in food services, and transaction assistants in the Employee and Retiree Service Center) requires them to perform work periodically that does not fall within the regularly scheduled workday. Such operational needs are normally foreseeable and occur infrequently. These operational needs may be accommodated through previously determined adjustments of the employees’ work schedule(s) for the pay week in which the activity occurs. The schedule adjustments should be made as much in advance as possible, preferably at the beginning of each semester, with volunteers being called upon first. Such adjustment may, if the unit member has volunteered to do so, include more than 8 hours in a day, not to exceed 10 hours of work time, without overtime payment, as long as the total time worked in a workweek does not exceed 40 hours. Any time worked in excess of 10 hours in a day, or 40 hours in a week, will be at the overtime rate. Whenever possible, the schedule adjustment for any individual employee will be determined collaboratively between the unit member and his/her supervisor, giving full consideration to regular program needs and the unit member’s preferences, including obligations outside the member’s normal work hours.
3.	Requests for approval for application of the procedure specified in Section C.2 above for employees in other positions that are later identified as being similar in nature to the positions referenced in Section C.2 above may be made to the Joint Labor Management Collaboration Committee.
D.	1. A unit member who is requested by an appropriate official to report back to work after the unit member’s normal workday or to report to work on a nonscheduled workday, except as indicated in Section C.2 or C.3 above, shall be credited with a minimum of three hours of work. However, time worked immediately before or immediately after the unit member’s regularly scheduled hours is not considered call back work and only the actual work time is reported.
2.	When a unit member is directed in writing by a supervisor to remain at home and be ready to report for work when called, that unit member shall receive three additional hours straight time pay for each day on such standby basis.
E.	1. In regard to systemwide delayed opening, 10-month school based unit members will begin work 20 minutes before the scheduled student starting time on said day without loss of pay.
2.	In regard to systemwide early dismissal, the same school-based unit members may leave as soon as all students and teachers with whom they work directly are off the school premises.
3.	The principal of any school may require any unit member in Section E.1 to be on duty for the normal duty day if he/she is needed. Only the principal will determine such need.
32 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
F.	If the entire school system (including the central office) is closed at the order of the superintendent or designee, those employees who are required to work on an emergency basis will be paid at their applicable straight time rate for the hours they work while the system is closed. This payment will be over and above the payment they would have received had they not been required to work. Where schools are closed after food service employees report to work, they will be paid at the applicable straight-time rate for the hours worked, in addition to emergency leave as provided in Article 12, Section P.
G.	School based unit members and maintenance employees who are required to report to work at the beginning of their shift or remain at work until the end of their shift on days of delayed opening and early closing of schools shall receive one hour pay in addition to their regular pay. It is understood that this additional payment to maintenance employees will apply only when the required work to be performed is related to the reasons for the delayed opening or early closing.
H.	Ten month food service employees, educational assistants, media assistants, and office employees will be notified by the closing of the school year of their next year’s starting date and assignment, subject to the right of MCPS to make changes in such assignments whenever circumstances require, especially in the case of educational assistants.
I.	The duties or work required of a unit member will not be increased unreasonably above those normally required because of staff shortages or schedule reductions.
J.	MCPS will provide reasonable and customary work breaks for full time unit members unless such breaks are not feasible. Every one of such unit members is entitled to receive such breaks routinely, but it is recognized that circumstances may occasionally make them not feasible. The supervisor will notify the unit member of break arrangements and discuss the personnel and operating priorities that relate to breaks with the unit member. A reasonable and customary work break would normally mean a work break of 10 to 15 minutes during the first four hours of work and, for an employee who works seven hours or more, another similar work break during the last three or four hours of work.
K.	Secretaries shall be compensated for time spent outside their normal work hours calling teacher substitutes.
L.	Unit members may not work additional hours beyond their regularly scheduled work time without proper supervisory authorization. In emergency circumstances, where it is not possible to obtain prior authorization, unit members may perform the emergency work and shall pursue proper supervisory authorization as soon as practical. However, no unit member shall be required, pressured, or permitted by the supervisor to work additional time without appropriate compensation. This provision shall not apply to Fair Labor Standards Act exempt employees who work more than 40 hours in a regularly scheduled work week.
M.	Annually, MCPS will inform all unit members and supervisors regarding the responsibilities and proper procedures for requesting authorization to work and compensation for work beyond a unit member’s regularly scheduled hours.
N.	The appropriate supervisor shall assign priorities to the work of a bargaining unit member whenever the employee so requests.
O.	As part of an annual process or at the request of an employee, the appropriate supervisor shall review and discuss work assignments, priorities, and expectations with the unit member.
P.	To the extent feasible, employees’ regularly assigned work will not be interrupted by assignments that are not germane to such work. However, supervisors retain the right to assign work. A principal or appropriate supervisor may determine that it is necessary in a particular circumstance to interrupt an employee’s work for duties not germane to the employee’s regular assignment. The principal or appropriate supervisor will ensure that work assignments that do not fall under duties related to an employee’s job description are taken into consideration for purposes of work expectations and performance evaluations. When there are concerns about the frequency or duration of such assignments, any party may raise this issue for collaborative resolution.
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 33
ARTICLE 14
Prohibition of Volunteer Work
Except in emergency situations and except for the type and amount of work which by past practice has been performed by volunteers, no bargaining unit work shall be performed by anyone other than an employee in the unit. Volunteers will not be used to take over the duties of any unit member. MCPS shall provide the Union a report annually on the status of the volunteer program to be submitted by the coordinator of volunteers.
ARTICLE 15
Reduction in Force
A.	Authority—The Board of Education of Montgomery County retains the right to reduce its force, and its decisions on such reduction are not subject to the grievance procedure.
B.	Notice—No reduction in force shall be implemented without 15 duty days notice to the employee and 25 duty days notice to the Union, during which MCPS shall consult with SEIU Local 500 on the reduction in force.
C.	Definition—Reduction in force (RIF) shall mean an action resulting in a unit member being terminated from MCPS for reasons other than disciplinary.
D.	Procedure for Reduction—When a reduction in staff within a given classification occurs, the determination of those who are to be released will be in the following order:
1.	Probationary employees to be laid off first.
2.	If further reductions are needed, those unit members with less than four years’ service whose two most recent performance evaluations have been unacceptable and/or below average will be laid off next.
3.	If still further reductions are required, seniority (as defined below) will govern, with the least senior unit member to be laid off first.
The foregoing procedure will be applied on a systemwide basis and seniority is defined as MCPS service.
E.	Recall
1.	Unit members whose services have been terminated because of a reduction in staff shall for a period of two years receive priority consideration for reemployment if they so desire and when MCPS decides to fill vacancies. The recall will be in the inverse order of force reduction. If a unit member is notified of recall to a reasonably approximate position for which the unit member qualifies and refuses the assignment, the unit member will lose the right to further recall.
2.	In the event that a unit member does not desire at the time of termination to be placed on the list for priority consideration, he/she shall receive full payment for all earned unused annual and sick leave and will lose the right to recall. For those terminated unit members having two full years of service but less than six years of service, they will receive, in addition, one half month’s salary for each year of creditable to MCPS service. For those terminated unit members having six or more years of service, they will receive, in addition, one month’s salary for each year of creditable to MCPS service, up to a limit of 12 months’ salary.
F.	Any unit member who is terminated due to a RIF may be placed on leave without pay for the six months immediately following the last duty day and may choose to continue membership in the MCPS health benefit plan in which the unit member is enrolled by paying the full cost of membership in such plan during those six months. If the member is not recalled, or refuses an assignment before the end of the initial six month period, the leave without pay and the membership in the MCPS health benefit plan is terminated automatically.
34 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
G.	A nonbargaining unit employee may not exercise seniority rights to bump into or be placed in a SEIU Local 500 bargaining unit classification during a time of RIF affecting that classification or while there are unit members on active recall status who are eligible for work in such classification.
H.	It is the goal of the parties to avoid layoff of unit members to the extent possible. The superintendent or designee will attempt to provide a period of retraining for nonprobationary unit members so that they can be placed in positions for which they would not otherwise qualify without such training.
I.	Any action taken under the foregoing provisions, except for the decision referred to in Section A, shall be grievable under Article 6.
ARTICLE 16
Position Descriptions
A.	Upon request, each unit member will be provided with an accurate description of his/her duties or responsibilities in the form of a class specification.
B.	A copy of a unit member’s class specification will be included in each employment package, to be distributed during orientation.
C.	Any unit member dissatisfied with an adverse reclassification that results in a pay reduction or downgrading may appeal directly to the superintendent or designee, whose decision shall be final. A unit member assigned to a lower grade classification as a result of a reclassification will be placed on the lower pay grade without reduction in pay. When the same rate of pay does not exist in the lower pay grade, the unit member’s hourly rate of pay will be red circled, which will remain in effect for no more than three years from the effective date of the reclassification action. The unit member’s anniversary date for step increases will not be affected.
D.	SEIU Local 500 shall be notified in advance when a classification action is to be taken that reduces the pay or pay grade of a unit member.
E.	Upon the request of SEIU Local 500 and at mutually agreeable times, a member of the classification staff will meet with a representative of SEIU Local 500 to discuss classification matters.
ARTICLE 17
Discipline and Discharge
A.	A suspension, demotion, discharge, or other disciplinary action may only be taken against unit members for proper cause. Discharge, demotion, suspension, or other written disciplinary action placed in an employee’s personnel file in Human Resources will be handled in accordance with the procedures of Sections D and E below. Any meeting with an employee which constitutes an investigative interview shall be delayed a reasonable length of time, not to exceed two duty days, in order to allow for the Union representative to attend if the employee so requests. However, if information is needed from an employee in order to ensure the safety of an individual, obtaining that information need not be delayed. An investigative interview occurs when— (1) management or a supervisor questions an employee to obtain information regarding a situation that may lead to suspension, demotion, or discharge; and (2) the employee has a reasonable belief that disciplinary action may result. If the employee requests representation, the role of the union representative is to assist the employee. In doing so, the representative may attempt to clarify the facts or suggest other employees who may have knowledge of them. Such suggestion does not obligate the employer to interview such other employees.
B.	To facilitate the availability of union representation in the meetings referred to in paragraph A, above, unit member employee representatives designated by the union to attend the meetings
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 35
shall be authorized to use leave to attend these meetings, in accordance with Article 20 of this Agreement. If the union designates a representative but the employer does not release the employee representative, the meeting may be delayed until the employee representative is available.
C.	Any suspension of a unit member for the purpose of investigation shall be with full pay. Normally, such investigations will be completed within five duty days.
D.	Written notice of charges with specifications will be given to the affected unit member at the time the disciplinary action is taken. Prior to acting upon a recommendation for discharge or suspension in excess of five duty days, the deciding official shall offer the affected employee the opportunity to make a statement on his/her behalf personally or in writing. Where the employee elects to make the statement in person to the deciding official, a Union representative may be present.
E.	The parties agree that the foregoing sections will be subject to binding arbitration in accordance with Article 6, Section D, Step Four—Arbitration, of this Agreement. As part of any arbitration process where disciplinary action is being challenged in accordance with this Article, lower-level discipline not subject to the arbitration process on its own merits that was part of the justification for the discipline being challenged may be reviewed by the arbitrator.
ARTICLE 18
Dues Checkoff
A.	As unit members individually and voluntarily authorize the Board of Education of Montgomery County, the Board agrees to withhold organizational dues or agency fee and other properly authorized deductions from the unit member’s wages and to transmit such funds to the SEIU Local 500 headquarters. The Board will include the name, school, office, or department where the unit member is located, and the amount of each deduction.
B.	Dues or agency fee will be deducted in equal payments during the term of this Agreement, beginning on the first full pay period following the receipt of the individually signed authorization by the Employee and Retiree Service Center. This deduction will remain in effect for the term of this Agreement or until the deduction is canceled in writing by the employee to SEIU Local 500 and the Employee and Retiree Service Center on or before September 10 of any school year.
C.	The amount deducted from a unit member’s wages during the term of this Agreement will be for the total dues, and each individual must authorize the deduction by authorization form signed by the unit member that such deductions shall be at the current rate. SEIU Local 500 shall certify to the Board in writing the current rate of dues and agency fee by the effective date of this Agreement. If this certification is not received by the Employee and Retiree Service Center, no deduction will be made.
D.	The right of dues checkoff in this Article shall be granted exclusively to SEIU Local 500.
E.	SEIU Local 500 shall indemnify and save the Board harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits, or any other forms of liability that shall rise out of or by reason of action taken or not taken by the Board for the purposes of complying with any list, notice, form, card, or assignment furnished under any such provisions.
36 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
ARTICLE 19
Filling of Vacancies
A.	A vacancy is defined as an open position within the bargaining unit which the Board has decided to fill on a permanent basis.
B.	Vacancies in the unit will be publicized in the MCPS Careers or other systemwide publication such as a job bulletin, and the vacancy database for paraeducators, as appropriate, immediately following the decision to fill such positions. The announcement will include a statement of the basic qualifications required for the position. Applicants will be required to complete and submit in writing all qualifying evidence and take any required tests within six and one-half working days following the announcement of the vacancy.
C.	The announcement and application procedures contained in Section B above shall not be applicable to the filling of those vacancies involving large numbers of positions and people at the same time.
The announcement and application procedures contained in Section B above shall also not be applicable to the positions of bus operator and bus attendant. These positions will be filled from a list of applicants who have completed successfully the approved training program, subject to the prior observance of the procedures stated in Article 37 (Transportation), Section G.
D.	Bargaining unit positions will be designated as either senior qualified (SQ) or optimally qualified (OQ) positions. The SQ and OQ designations that have been in effect prior to this Agreement shall continue in effect. The Union will be consulted with regard to this designation prior to any change in designation and when new bargaining unit positions are created.
E.	In the filling of all SQ vacancies other than those that arise under Section C above, the principal or other appropriate administrator will select from among the three most senior qualified applicants for the position.
F.	Qualifications for all positions will be as determined by the Board. A list of required qualifications, including any additional requirements specific to a particular vacancy, will be available at the time the position is advertised and provided to a unit member or the Union upon request.
G.	For the purposes of filling SQ vacancies, seniority shall be defined as length of continuous service with MCPS. Employment in a temporary position shall not be considered in determining seniority, except as provided in Article 2, Section C.3.
H.	A list of requirements and advertised preferences used in determining OQ candidates for OQ vacancies (the Office of Human Resources and Development’s screening criteria chart) will be made available at the time the position is advertised to a unit member or the Union upon request.
I.	In filling OQ positions, the Office of Human Resources and Development will advertise the position, including at least a partial listing of the essential requirements and preferences. A complete listing of requirements for the position can be found in the vacancy data base, accessible by all employees through the MCPS web site.
J.	Requirements and preferences will not be established by the employer for the purpose of favoring
an individual candidate or candidates for selection.
K.	In filling OQ positions, a minimum of three candidates possessing all requirements, plus any or all of the advertised preferences, shall be referred for an interview.

N.	A current part-time employee in the school in the same job classification shall be given priority consideration on a seniority basis for additional hours assigned to a school that are not part of a new or vacant position, if the current employee is available for work at the time the additional hours are needed. A current part-time employee in the same school in another job classification will be considered for such hours when appropriate, prior to applicants from outside the school. However, no employee may be assigned more than 40 hours per week.
O.	MCPS experience will be given positive consideration in selection for positions. When two finalists are determined to be equally qualified, the internal candidate will be given preference for selection.
P.	All persons who have applied for a specific vacancy other than paraeducators will be notified if they are not selected and will be given the reason or reasons why they were not selected. Non-selected OQ candidates who have interviewed for a position and are not selected may contact the administrator/designee within two weeks of notification for specific feedback. Content of the feedback related to strengths and weaknesses is not grievable. If an applicant for a paraeducator position has not heard from the administrator within 14 days after the advertisement period has ended, the applicant may assume that he/she has not been selected for the interview. OQ candidates who have not been selected to interview for a position may contact the Office of Human Resources and Development within two weeks to get information about why they were determined not to be qualified or not selected to interview.
Q.	Paraeducators
1.	SEIU Local 500 will have the opportunity to be involved in the development of the superintendent’s operating budget in the fall, which will include providing input regarding the various staffing formulas for paraeducators. When the initial allocation of positions to schools is made, the union will be notified of the school-by-school allocations.
2.	Principals will communicate with paraeducators during the paraeducators’ workday about the allocations and the process for deciding on positions for the following school year as soon as possible, but no later than three weeks (excluding spring break) after the principals have received the initial allocations. Paraeducators will have an opportunity to provide input to the principal and to indicate preferences for the following year.
3.	In a school where one or more paraeducators’ hours have been reduced for the following school year, and where there are available lunch hour aide hours, and where the paraeducator(s) can be available at the appropriate time, lunch hour aide time may be offered to the paraeducator(s) for one year only at the paraeducator’s regular rate of pay. When there are more paraeducators in a school desiring such accommodation than there are hours available, adjustments will be made in order of seniority.
4.	Paraeducators who are involuntarily transferred will be notified by May 15. Circumstances beyond the principal’s control may necessitate further changes during the summer months. A six-week voluntary transfer process shall commence no later than May 15 of each year. Although paraeducators will be allowed to transfer during this period, they will not be allowed to increase their hours but will be allowed to voluntarily decrease their hours. In addition, promotional opportunities into paraeducator positions will not be allowed during this period, with the exception of paraeducators moving into special education paraeducator positions. Hiring from outside or from current temporary employees will not be allowed.
5.	An involuntary transfer meeting will be held and paraeducators will be provided the opportunity to submit their preferences. Vacant positions will be maintained on the MCPS website by the Office of Human Resources and Development during the period of involuntary transfers in the summer. All involuntarily transferred staff will be assigned by the beginning of the school year.
6.	Those paraeducators whose hours have been reduced and who wish to have them restored will have priority placement to another paraeducator position that will restore their hours.
7.	Individuals who are interested in applying for a vacant paraeducator position listed on the vacancy database should apply directly to the school. Candidates who are not selected can request from the school administrator the reasons why they were not selected.
38 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
8.	The parties have collaboratively developed a process for implementation of this Article. This process shall be reviewed on a periodic basis.
R.	Noncompetitive Assignments
1.	The provisions of this paragraph concerning noncompetitive assignments shall not apply in cases of temporary assignments of less than six months, higher level assignments, voluntary reassignment under SSPGS, or demotions.
2.	Employees who are returning from leave whose positions are no longer available and employees involuntarily transferred resulting from reductions in position allocations may be assigned noncompetitively to appropriate positions. MCPS shall consider requests by the affected employees to accommodate geographic or other personal considerations.
3.	Other noncompetitive assignments may be made under exigent circumstances and shall be communicated to the Union at least two weeks prior to the effective date to ensure sufficient time and opportunity for SEIU Local 500 to discuss the facts as permitted by law and the rationale and provide input regarding the proposed assignment. In unusual circumstances where two weeks’ notice is not possible or appropriate, the two-week time period may be reduced or waived. If the affected employee(s) or the Union objects to the noncompetitive assignment, MCPS and Union representatives will collaboratively consider alternatives to the proposed assignment.
4.	When the application deadline for an advertised vacant position has passed, every effort will be made to avoid making a noncompetitive assignment to such position.
S.	The provisions of this Article may be suspended by agreement of the Board and the Union where considered desirable by the parties to rectify or correct a specific personnel matter.
T.	During the life of the Agreement, a committee composed of an equal number of representatives of MCPS and the Union shall review the procedures followed for filling vacancies and making administrative placements and will advise the superintendent or designee regarding suggested improvements for these procedures.

Employee Benefit Plan
A.	The present employee benefit plans, as contained in the booklet titled “Your Benefit Plan,” shall be maintained for the life of this Agreement, and shall not be changed except as may be recommended to the parties by the joint SEIU Local 500-MCPS Employee Benefits Committee as provided in this Article.
B.	Medical Plans
The Benefit Plan shall include the following options:
1.	Two Point-of-Service (POS) health plans, with differentials between in-network and out-of-network plan designs. The two plans shall be as follows:
a)	PLAN A—The Board shall maintain the Point of Service (POS) health plan, which is open to all unit members. The Board shall pay 90 percent of the annual premium for each unit member enrolled in the plan and the unit member shall pay 10 percent of the annual premium for the plan.
b)	PLAN B—The closed Point-of-Service (POS) Plan benefit levels shall remain the same, except as specified. This plan shall be open only to employees who were in the existing indemnity plan as of December 31, 1998, and the plan shall be closed to new enrollment. The Board shall pay 80 percent of the annual premium for each unit member enrolled in this plan and the unit member shall pay 20 percent of the annual premium for the plan.
2.	HMOs—Health Maintenance Organizations
For unit members who enroll in the Board of Education’s health maintenance organizations (HMOs) (or other future carriers awarded contracts through the MCPS bidding process), the Board agrees to pay a sum which is 95 percent of the annual premium. The unit member shall pay 5 percent of such annual premiums.
C.	Supplemental Plans
The existing dental, vision, drug, and life insurance plans shall continue to be provided, except as modified herein. Unit members will be able to select each plan independently, regardless of other plan selections. The premium cost-sharing formula shall be 90 percent/10 percent for each plan.
1.	Dental Plans
MCPS will contract with both a Dental Preferred Provider Organization (DPPO) and a Dental Maintenance Organization Provider (DMO) to provide dental benefits to MCPS employees. Unit members may elect annually to participate in either the DPPO or the DMO Plan. The DPPO will provide both in-network and out-of-network dental benefits.
2.	Vision Plan
The existing vision care insurance plan shall remain in effect.
3.	Prescription Drug Plans
a)	MCPS will implement a managed prescription drug plan that combines utilization review, physician profiling and case management techniques. The plan will protect a physician’s ability to make a final medical determination of the appropriate medication. The plan’s co-payment structure is designed to encourage participants to purchase prescription drugs at the most affordable price.
b)	The prescription co-payment schedule will be:
DRUG CLASS	Retail	Domestic Mail Order
	30-day supply	3-month supply
Generic Drugs	$5	$0
Brand Name, Formulary List Drugs	$10	$10
Brand Name, Non-formulary, no generic equivalent	$25	$25
Brand Name, Non-formulary, generic is available	$25 plus the difference	$25 plus the difference
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 43
c)	Generic Equivalent Rules—Prescriptions for non-formulary brand name drugs with a generic equivalent will automatically be filled with a generic, and the participant will be charged the lower generic class co-pay. If the physician specifies to dispense as written, or if the participant opts for brand name non-formulary drugs, such drugs will be dispensed and the co-pay shall include the added difference in cost for the name brand drug over the generic drug.
d)	Formulary Drug Class (a.k.a. “Primary Drug Class”) is a list of preferred brand name medicines that have been reviewed and selected by the pharmacy benefit manager’s “Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee” of practicing doctors and clinical pharmacists for their safety, quality, and effectiveness.
e)	Drug Class—Maintenance medications are drugs usually prescribed to treat conditions of a long-term or chronic nature, such as diabetes, arthritis, or high blood pressure. Drugs are classified according to therapeutic category and those drugs that are considered as maintenance medications under the plan are identified through the pharmacy benefit manager. Two initial 30-day prescriptions for maintenance drugs may be filled at a retail pharmacy. Following that, maintenance drugs must be filled through the mail-order pharmacy program. If such subsequent maintenance drug prescriptions are purchased at a retail pharmacy, the plan shall only pay as much as it would have if the drug had been purchased mail-order—and the participant shall pay the difference. Participants may choose to continue purchasing their maintenance drugs in 30-day prescriptions at a retail pharmacy beyond the first two months. If they do, the co-pay shall be the mail order co-pay for a 30-day supply plus the added difference in cost for the retail maintenance drug over the plans cost for purchase of a 30-day supply of the maintenance drug through the mail-order pharmacy.
f)	Biotech Drug Class—Certain newly-patented, high-cost, bio-engineered drugs are to be bought in the most cost-effective way. The plan design shall include a specialty mail-order pharmacy for biotech drugs. The Joint Employee Benefits Committee will have responsibility for continuing to seek out ways to purchase biotech drugs at the lowest possible cost.
g)	If a doctor certifies that it is medically necessary to prescribe a brand name drug (for example, if the participant has an allergic reaction to the generic equivalent), the copay on brand name drugs filled through the mail order program will be the applicable brand name drug co-pay: either formulary or non-formulary non-generic.
h)	Network pricing at pharmacies participating in the network, and through the mail order pharmacy, shall be made available to plan participants to purchase medical supplies not covered by the plan but negotiated through the network. The co-pay for such supplies shall be 100 percent of the network discounted cost.
i)	Participants in the Kaiser HMO shall have their prescription coverage provided by Kaiser in conjunction with their medical plan. The co-pays shall be $5 for all prescriptions at Kaiser pharmacies (including mail-order) and $10 at other participating pharmacies (including Giant, Safeway, and CVS).
4.	Life Insurance
a)	The Board will provide eligible unit members with the opportunity to purchase additional term life insurance in an amount equal to one times annual salary, during the initial benefit eligibility period. An eligible unit member who does not purchase additional term life insurance when first eligible may do so during future open enrollment periods provided he/she meets insurance company underwriting requirements. The unit member will pay the full cost of additional life insurance purchased under this provision.
b)	The Board will provide eligible unit members with the opportunity to purchase additional dependent life insurance in an amount equal to $10,000 for a dependent spouse, and $10,000 for a dependent child, during the annual open enrollment period or when the unit member first becomes eligible for dependent life insurance coverage. An eligible
44 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
unit member who does not purchase additional dependent life insurance when first eligible may do so during future open enrollment periods, provided their dependents meet insurance company underwriting requirements. The full cost of dependent life insurance purchased under this provision will be paid by the unit member.
D.	Dual-Employee Households
Whenever a husband and wife are both employed by MCPS and eligible to participate in the Employee Benefits Plan, one of the following enrollment options will be available:
1.	Each may choose to be covered separately under a single plan.
2.	One employee may choose medical coverage which would include his/her spouse as a dependent. The other may enroll in any other benefit plan, but not in a medical plan.
3.	If one employee chooses a plan covering other dependents, the other may enroll in a single plan. In no event will any employee or dependent be covered by two MCPS plans.
E.	Domestic Partner Coverage
Health plan coverage shall be available to same-sex domestic partners of unit members.
F.	General Liability Coverage
The Board agrees to continue to carry a comprehensive general liability policy in which employees are named insureds while acting within the scope of their duties with limits of liability at not less than $1,000,000.
G.	Tax Deferred Annuities & Deferred Compensation Plans
Unit members will be eligible to participate in the currently available tax advantaged salary deferral (403b and 457) plans. Forms will be available from the plan vendors and in some cases at the Employee and Retiree Service Center (ERSC). ERSC and its website shall contain the contact information for all vendors.
H.	Joint Employee Benefits Committee
1.	SEIU Local 500 and MCPS will participate in a multi-union Joint Employee Benefits Committee (JEBC) for the purpose of reviewing periodically the employee benefit plan. The JEBC shall be continued and shall make recommendations to the parties when warranted. Each party shall appoint three members of the committee.
2.	The committee shall select and monitor the performance of the health care plan administrators.
3.	It is understood that the committee shall utilize the bid process if required by state law or MCPS regulation to contract for outside services required to assist the committee.
4.	The Board shall indemnify and hold SEIU, its officers, employees, and agents harmless against any and all claims arising out of the agreements set forth in this section and will reimburse witness costs and fees, court costs, legal fees, and lost wages incurred in defending against any such claim.
5.	In recognition of the inadequacy of the Maryland State Teachers Pension the Joint Committee is also charged with developing options for enhancing the MCPS supplemental pension plan. Such options may be the subject of future negotiations between the parties.
I.	Flexible Spending Accounts
1.	The Board of Education shall establish and maintain a Section 125 plan, which includes medical reimbursement and dependent care assistance flexible spending accounts, and premium conversion.
2.	The Board shall provide an annual matching payment of up to the first $100 set aside by an employee in his or her medical reimbursement flexible spending account.
J.	Retirement/Pension Plans
The Board agrees that any modifications in the retirement and pension plan benefits will be announced 90 days in advance of the effective date of the implementation of such changes. It agrees further that the Union will be consulted about the proposed changes and will be given an opportunity to provide its views and suggestions. Unit members planning to retire should contact the Employee and Retiree Service Center as early as possible.

ARTICLE 24
Protection of Persons and Property
A.	1. Unit members in every school in the county may intervene in any fight or physical struggle which takes place in their presence in any school building or on the school grounds, between or among students or any other persons. The degree and force of the intervention shall be as reasonably necessary to restore order and to protect the safety of the combatants and surrounding persons.
2.	A unit member who incurs injury while thus intervening shall be compensated by the Board for necessary medical expenses resulting directly from the intervention and shall not suffer any loss of compensation for time lost from his/her school duties resulting directly from the intervention, but such compensation shall be reduced by any payments made pursuant to the Workers’ Compensation law.

B.	Subject to a $15 minimum, a unit member may file a claim for repair or replacement of clothing or other personal property damaged or destroyed in the performance of his/her duties, taking into consideration depreciation. Personal property possession must have been reasonable or proper under the circumstances, and the damage or destruction must not have been caused in whole or in part by the negligent or wrongful act of the employee. No damage or destruction will be compensated when it has resulted from normal wear and tear associated with day to day living and working conditions. All claims will be evaluated fairly by a small claims review board prior to its decision.
C.	Damage to a unit member’s motor vehicle will be reimbursed up to the level of his/her motor vehicle insurance deductible, not to exceed $100, provided that the unit member can produce the proof that his/her motor vehicle was damaged as a result of his/her enforcement of school regulations.

ARTICLE 25
Uniforms
A.	The Board will furnish five uniforms the first year of employment. Each year thereafter, the Board will furnish three replacement uniforms to employees who elect to wear uniforms, or, at the employee’s choice, a selection of uniform-related clothing from which the employee may select items of lesser or equal cost as the three replacement uniforms. The Board will designate for participating employees the available selection of clothing items, along with the cost (to the employer) of each item. At the Board’s discretion, it may make additional resources available to participating employees, to be made available among such employees on a fair and equitable basis, allowing the employees to select additional or more expensive designated uniform-related clothing. Unit members who are furnished with uniforms through this process must wear them to work. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action.
Employees shall receive a set of summer uniforms and a set of winter uniforms within the total number of uniforms agreed upon.
B.	It is the unit member’s responsibility to maintain and clean the uniforms. Exceptions will be made for those classifications that, through the nature of the daily work, the uniforms become inordinately soiled and dirty. For those classifications, the Board will supply laundering. Employees in these classifications will be issued more than five uniforms initially if necessary to provide a daily change.
46 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement

D.	All employees electing to wear uniforms shall be fitted during working hours.
ARTICLE 26
Career Development and Training
A.	SEIU Local 500 and the Board of Education recognize the vital importance of training and education in this era of change. A well trained, effectively functioning work force is necessary if Montgomery County Public Schools is to achieve its goal of providing high-quality education for every student. The Board recognizes the need for programs that will improve the efficiency of unit members in their current jobs and the importance of assisting unit members to meet MCPS employment needs along with the unit member’s individual career development plans.
B.	All unit members and probationary employees who would become unit members upon successful completion of the probationary period are eligible for and encouraged to participate in in-service training programs designed to improve their effectiveness. The form and substance of these programs may differ widely and all unit members and probationary employees who would become unit members upon successful completion of the probationary period and their supervisors are jointly responsible for analyzing areas of job needs and then actively seeking training that will improve performance. To achieve the goal of developing and implementing a comprehensive program of in-service training, the Board agrees to budget the sum of $100,000 per year for instructional support for system designed training programs, to hire consultants, and to develop relevant programs. This sum will be administered by the Office of the Deputy Superintendent of Schools. The Career Development and Educational Improvement (CDEI) Committee will make recommendations consistent with Article 26, Section F.
C.	MCPS Professional Development Training Programs
Professional development training programs offered by MCPS are categorized into three “tiers”:
1.	Tier 1—Mandated Training—Training that is required for employees to retain certification or licensure in order to maintain employment in MCPS and/or training required as part of a professional development plan that the employee must complete in order to meet core competencies. Tier 1 training is compensated at the employee’s normal hourly rate.
2.	Tier 2—MCPS Initiatives Training—Training that is recommended or strongly encouraged by MCPS in order for employees to increase their awareness, knowledge, and/or skills as they relate to major initiatives in MCPS. Tier 2 training taken outside of regular duty hours will be paid at the rate of $15 per hour.
3.	Tier 3—Professional Development Training—Training that can further employees’ education and/or improve present job skills or qualify for other positions within MCPS. A number of professional development hours per year are allotted for unit members to participate in training of their choosing at a time they choose, including possibly during the normal work day (see Section E below). Tier 3 training taken outside of regular duty hours is not compensated.
D.	Some education and training, which can either increase unit members’ effectiveness in their current positions or can assist them to prepare for other positions within MCPS, may be available through other educational institutions or agencies. Such courses usually are offered for credit at schools, adult education institutions, or other agencies.
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 47
1.	To encourage unit members to take courses that will benefit them and MCPS, either in their present positions or another position to which they aspire within MCPS, the Board agrees to reimburse unit members for 50 percent of the institutionally assessed tuition and fee cost, not to exceed 50 percent of the current cost of in-state tuition at the University of Maryland, College Park, of approved courses or vocational certification tests, up to a maximum of nine credits or the equivalent per fiscal year.
2.	Non-college training will be reimbursed by converting clock hours to credits, 15 clock hours equals one credit. Prior approval for these classes is available, and encouraged, if there is a question about whether the class is reimbursable or not.
3.	Employees generally will not be reimbursed for outside courses or training if such courses are also offered by MCPS and are available to the employees in the unit. Exceptions will be made for credits that are needed as part of a degree, certificate, or professional development program in which the employee is enrolled if the MCPS course would not be counted and the credits would otherwise be reimbursable. Exceptions may also be made for other valid reasons (e.g., the MCPS courses are full and unavailable).
4.	SEIU Local 500 shall be furnished, on an annual basis, with the names of employees receiving tuition reimbursement hereunder, and the amount of such reimbursement.
E.	SEIU Local 500 and the Board realize that many unit members may desire to obtain further education and training to improve present job skills or qualify for other positions within MCPS. To enable unit members to achieve this aim, the Board supports a program of released time for unit members on permanent status who work 20 or more hours per week. The unit member’s supervisor and the associate superintendent of the Office of Human Resources and Development may authorize up to 10 percent of the unit member’s monthly scheduled work time to attend classes. Travel to and from classes must be included and must not interfere with job performance or the needs of the school system.
F.	To assist unit members to utilize the opportunities in Sections B, C, and D, the Board agrees to budget not less than $15,000 per year for the purchase of books, equipment, and other educational resource materials. The CDEI Committee may make recommendations concerning the expenditure of these funds.
G.	Tier 2 Training Opportunities—Each bargaining unit member who is not a 12-month employee will be provided with an opportunity to receive a minimum of a four-hour block of Tier 2 training on one or more no-work-no-pay days. This training shall be compensated at the Tier 2 training rate. Any unit member who elects not to participate in this training on the day(s) it is offered is no longer entitled to the benefit of this Section during that same school year.
H.	The CDEI Committee shall continue for the period of this Agreement. The committee shall be composed of three members selected by the Union and three members selected by the superintendent or designee. The CDEI Committee shall have the following responsibilities:
1.	To make recommendations for new training programs and other training opportunities.
2.	To participate in the ongoing planning for the training needs of unit members.
3.	To serve in a consultant role to the Office of Human Resources and Development on the expenditure of funds listed in Sections B and C.
4.	To serve in a consultant role to the Professional Library on the expenditure of the special funds provided in Section E.
5.	To receive reports on the effectiveness of the Career Development and Training Program for the purpose of achieving the goals as stated in Section A.
6.	To make recommendations on training and experience desirable for various career goals within MCPS.

ARTICLE 27
Professional Development
A.	Developing and Retaining Highly Qualified Supporting Services Staff
SEIU Local 500 and MCPS share a commitment to ensure a high-quality, well-trained work force that is integral to the success of every student. Supporting services personnel are in every respect professionals at what they do, and as such, should be held to the same high standards of performance and accountability as their colleagues who are teachers, principals and administrators.
B.	The Supporting Services Professional Growth System (SSPGS)
1.	The parties commit to maintaining a comprehensive supporting services professional growth system that is jointly designed and implemented.
2.	The SSPGS is built on the tenets of support and professional development for all unit members. It is the responsibility of all stakeholders, i.e. evaluators, providers of indirect feedback, reviewers, and unit members to be aware of all components of the SSPGS. The parties will promote workforce excellence, encourage personal and systemic growth, and focus on performance through continuous improvement.
3.	Through SSPGS, MCPS and SEIU Local 500 aspire to ensure that all supporting services staff either directly or indirectly contribute to achieving the highest performance possible of every MCPS student and employee by raising the quality of support to instruction, as well as all other services that contribute to student achievement. The SSPGS acknowledges that supervisors, peers, and others provide valuable, ongoing support in promoting the success of every employee.
4.	New employees will participate in a new employee orientation program. Employees will also receive a copy of the job class description and be provided with performance expectations necessary to ensure success. Support will be provided to novice supervisors as needed.
C.	Elements of the SSPGS
The SSPGS is a multidimensional approach to supporting and improving the quality of employee performance in MCPS. The essential elements of the system are as follows:
1.	Standards for employee performance are competency-based measures developed jointly by the parties
2.	Training for evaluators and employees
3.	A professional growth cycle that integrates the formal evaluation year into a multi-year continuous process of professional growth
4.	A mandatory professional development plan (PDP), including job-embedded opportunities, utilizing the best practices of professional growth
5.	Support to underperforming employees, affording them a reasonable opportunity for improvement and continued employment
6.	Opportunities for employees to participate in professional development activities within their work day
D.	Governance of the SSPGS Implementation
1.	SEIU Local 500 and MCPS agree to collaboratively operate the SSPGS, which offers employee’s access to a Performance Improvement Process (PIP), including a Peer Assistance and Review Program (PAR).
2.	The PAR program shall operate in accordance with the procedures specified in the SSPGS Handbook 2006-07 (or as modified by the parties in the future). The SSPGS Handbook is not subject to the grievance procedure contained in this Agreement. This does not preclude processing of a grievance alleging violation of specific provisions of this Agreement.
3.	The PAR program shall be run by a PAR Panel. The Panel shall consist of at least 12 members appointed by the superintendent; an equal number being bargaining unit employees recommended by SEIU Local 500, and representatives of the administration, recommended by the chief operating officer. PAR operational guidelines will be established by the PAR Panel in accordance with the SSPGS Handbook.
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 49
4.	A job description will be developed for the SEIU designated PAR Panel co-chair. MCPS recognizes the essential, often demanding, responsibilities associated with being the SEIU designated PAR co-chair and will endeavor to minimize the impacts of other job responsibilities to support the successful completion of that work.
5.	The PIP includes professional growth consultants who provide peer assistance and guidance to support those employees not meeting competency, and to report on the employee’s progress in meeting competency.
6.	A supporting services employee identified as underperforming, either through a “not meeting competency” evaluation, or through a documented history of under performance, shall be referred by his/her supervisor into the PIP process.
7.	An employee referred into the PIP process will be afforded the options of participating in the PAR program, receiving a 90-day special evaluation, or returning to a previously held position in which he/she was successful. These options will be explained to the employee by a professional growth consultant, prior to a decision being requested. In the event an employee opts not to make a decision, the default choice shall be a special evaluation.
8.	Probationary employees do not have access to the PIP process.
9.	The parties agree to jointly oversee an ongoing assessment of the PAR program.
E.	PAR Panel Recommendations
The professional growth consultant presents a six-month summative report of the employee’s progress to the PAR Panel. Included in the report is the judgment of the professional growth consultant as to whether the employee has successfully completed the PAR agreement and is now meeting competency. If the judgment is that the employee is not meeting competency and therefore may be terminated, the employee and the evaluator are given the opportunity to appear before the PAR Panel. A majority vote of the PAR Panel is required to accept or not accept the judgment of the professional growth consultant based on the information provided. If, by vote, the PAR Panel supports the judgment that the employee is not meeting competency, a recommendation for termination will be forwarded to the superintendent or his/her designee, or at the discretion of the panel, a recommendation that the employee be returned to a previous, successfully held position.
F.	Union Representation, Grievance and Appeal Rights
1.	Employees appearing before the PAR Panel may have a union representative present with them. The union representative is present for consulting purposes only, and may not participate in the hearing.
2.	An employee who chooses the PAR process waives his/her right to grieve a termination for performance reasons, unless the decision by the superintendent or his/her designee to terminate the employee was not supported by a majority vote of the PAR panel.
3.	Employees who select a special evaluation option through the PIP process retain their full due process rights, including any existing grievance rights.
G.	Rights and Responsibilities of Employees in the PAR program
1.	Nothing in this Article or the PAR program shall diminish the rights granted to supporting services employees under Section 4-205 of the Education Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, relative to dismissal, and the right to appeal such personnel actions to appropriate government boards or agencies.
2.	SEIU Local 500 unit members participating in the PAR program as professional growth consultants or as members of the PAR Panel, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Board against any and all claims arising as a result of their actions within the scope of their duties.
H.	Evaluations
1.	In the SSPGS, the formal evaluation process is seen as a tool for continuous improvement for all employees. During the formal evaluation year, both the employee and the evaluator gather data from professional development years since the last evaluation, as well as from the evaluation year. This data serves as a point of reference for the collaborative evaluation
50 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
process. The evaluation year is a time when the employee and evaluator reflect on progress made and potential areas for future professional growth. MCPS will take all necessary steps to ensure that the formal evaluation process is carried out in a timely manner.
2.	Formal evaluations are not required during professional development years of the professional growth cycle.
3.	The details of the evaluation processes are included in the SSPGS Handbook.
I.	Process for Changing the Evaluation System
1.	The evaluation system contained in the SSPGS is the result of extensive and continued collaboration between the parties. The end result is a professional growth and evaluation system that enjoys a shared commitment for its continued success.
2.	In the spirit of our ongoing collaborative relationship, the current evaluation system shall not be changed without following the procedures set below:
a.	Preceding the implementation of any proposed changes, the Board shall notify SEIU Local 500 of its desire to change the evaluation system.
b.	Thereafter, the parties shall confer in good faith over the content of any proposed changes in the evaluation system, until agreement is reached, or until 90 days following receipt by SEIU Local 500 of the Board’s notification regarding its desire to change the evaluation system. The conferring teams shall be headed by the chief negotiator for each party.
c.	If no agreement is reached within 90 days following receipt by SEIU Local 500 of notification that the Board desires to change the evaluation system, the Board may unilaterally implement changes in the evaluation system.
J.	Professional Development
1.	Principles—Professional development is the process by which employees individually and jointly enhance and update their knowledge of jobs, enhance their level of performance in all core competencies and, where appropriate, improve their instructional skills and strategies. Enhanced professional development increases employee effectiveness, builds confidence, morale and commitment, and subsequently, the ability to improve the quality of education of all students in MCPS.
2.	The parties agree on the following assumptions about professional development:
a.	Successful professional development plans must be focused on the pursuit of excellence in an employee’s current position or on developing the skills necessary to make an employee competitive for career advancement opportunities.
b.	Professional development should be continuous, focused on core competency best practices, and should include job-embedded opportunities.
c.	Professional development opportunities may include education partnerships leading toward degrees, certification, and/or licensure that focus on the instructional and operational needs of the system.
d.	School and office climates that promote professional learning and growth provide opportunities for collaboration and dialogue around how employees can most effectively contribute either directly or indirectly to student achievement.
K.	Career Pathways Program
1.	SEIU Local 500 and the Board of Education recognize the vital importance of training and education in this era of change. A well-trained, effectively functioning workforce is necessary if Montgomery County Public Schools is to achieve its goal of providing high-quality education for every student. The Board recognizes the need for programs that will improve the efficiency and the competencies of unit members in their current jobs and the importance of assisting unit members to meet MCPS employee needs along with the unit member’s individual career development plan. The parties support Goal 5 of the strategic plan: Provide high-quality business services that are essential to the educational success of all students. The parties further recognize the critical importance of the union’s mission to raise the standard of living of supporting services employees and their families.
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 51
2.	Working for the Board of Education is a career choice.
3.	The professional development process provides employees with a variety of high-quality career opportunities that promotes individual success and enhances the organizational effectiveness of MCPS. For employees who are successful and dedicated to the critical mission of the school system, success must foster opportunity to create career pathways. Such pathways should lead to greater opportunity in one’s existing job, or to support employees in getting the necessary guidance, mentoring and training to seek other career change and/ or advancement opportunities within the school system.
4.	The Board and the union are jointly committed to a SSPGS that provides comprehensive professional development opportunities that support the continuous growth of a skilled and effective workforce within existing positions, and supports career change and/or advancement opportunities for those seeking them, and reflect best practices for adult learners.
5.	SEIU Local 500 and The Board of Education see alignment between the school system’s mission of a high-quality education for every student and the union’s mission for its members.
6.	To achieve the objective of offering employees greater pathways to career advancement opportunities, the parties have agreed to implement the Career Pathways Program. As part of SSPGS, the Career Pathways program is intended to support SEIU Local 500 unit members to identify career goals and obtain training and direction to attain those goals. The Career Pathways Program will offer opportunities for employees to improve their knowledge and skills in content areas that will enable employees to reach their career goals, with programs and processes in place to support those objectives.
7.	The school system will identify critical hard-to-fill job areas based on retention and turnover data, as well as other organizational needs. MCPS will consider providing training and development of skills and knowledge for these jobs. In addition, the school system may allow for professional development support beyond what is currently provided for under this collective bargaining agreement as an incentive to employees to consider a career choice in the critical need area, and so that the employee can attain the knowledge and skills required to be considered for the position. In return for this support, the employee would agree to remain with the school system for an agreed-upon time, provided a vacancy in the critical need position exists at the time the employee completes the agreed-upon professional development.
8.	The SSPGS Implementation Team will oversee the implementation of this program. In addition, the SSPGS Implementation Team will oversee an evaluation of the program. This evaluation will include impact statements, feedback gathering, and ongoing data gathering and assessment opportunities that provide information needed to improve the Career Pathways Program.
ARTICLE 28
Personnel Files
A.	Official Personnel File
1.	Unit members will have the right, upon written request, to review the contents of their official personnel file located in the Office of Human Resources and Development. If the unit member wishes to be accompanied by another person or a representative of the Union during such a review, that request must be entered in writing.
2.	Application references for employment and promotion references from individuals not employed by MCPS will not be made available for review by a unit member.
3.	Material derogatory to a unit member’s conduct, service, character, or personality will be placed in his/her personnel file only if the unit member has had an opportunity to review such material. The unit member will acknowledge that he/she has had the opportunity to review such material by affixing his/her initials to the copy to be filed, with the express
52 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
understanding that such initialing in no way indicates agreement with the contents. The unit member shall be permitted to attach his/her comments related to the derogatory material. Derogatory material placed in a unit member’s personnel file may be grieved under Article 6. A Union representative may review an employee’s file without the employee being present if such review is authorized in writing by the employee.
Derogatory notations reflecting oral or written warnings shall not be used in support of any disciplinary or adverse action after three years from the date such warnings were issued, provided that no additional derogatory notations have been placed in a unit member’s personnel file in the three-year period.
B.	Supervisor Files
1.	A supervisor may create private files on employees that include such things as documents and notes kept for purposes of evaluation. Such a file does not constitute an official personnel file. The existence of such a file on an employee shall be made known to that employee, who in turn, shall have the right to review the file upon request and initial acknowledgment of each item entered in the file. After an employee’s performance evaluation has been completed and upon the employee’s request, documents and notes kept in the supervisor’s file for more than three years regarding that employee shall be removed and discarded.
2.	Should there be a change of supervisor prior to the time for the employee’s regularly scheduled performance evaluation, because either the employee transfers to another position or the supervisor is replaced by another individual, an interim evaluation shall be prepared by the departing or former supervisor, based upon the employee’s work in the evaluation period up to that point in time. A copy of this interim evaluation shall be provided to the employee and also may be provided to the new supervisor.
3.	Any supervisor file maintained on an employee and forming the basis for an interim evaluation remains the private property of the departing or former supervisor and may not be provided to the new supervisor. Nor does the interim evaluation become part of the official personnel file, except upon the written request of the employee.
ARTICLE 29

Such adjustment or adjustments will be made effective on the first of the month following the official change in IRS regulations.
B.	Unit members who are required as a condition of employment in a given position to use their private automobiles and who, because of this required employment use, pay a higher insurance premium, shall be reimbursed for the amount of the additional premium.

C.	Unit members whose assignment within a job classification requires them to travel to more than one work location in any one school day will receive the IRS rate per mile for travel in excess of the distance from the unit member’s residence to and from the base work location. That location closer or closest to the unit member’s residence shall be considered his or her base work location.

B.	Nondiscrimination—The Board and the Union agree that there shall be no discrimination by the Board or SEIU Local 500 against employees because of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital status, or physical handicap.
54 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
C.	The personal life of a unit member shall be the concern of, and warrant the attention of, the Board only as it may directly prevent the unit member from properly performing his/her assigned functions during duty hours, or violate local, state, or national law, or be prejudicial to his/her effectiveness in his/her position.
D.	At the request of either party, Board and Union representatives shall meet to discuss any proposed Board policies or practices regarding testing of employees for use of drugs or alcohol, with the goal of reaching agreement on a program acceptable to both parties. Such discussions shall be without prejudice to the Board’s authority to implement testing for drug or alcohol abuse by employees or the Union’s right to challenge such practices.
E.	In any investigative meeting or interview with an employee that is conducted by the Office of Human Resources and Development and that may lead to demotion, suspension, or discharge, the employee will be advised that he/she has the right to have a Union representative present.
F.	No employee shall be disciplined or suffer loss of pay or benefits, or change of school or shift, as a direct result of truthfully reporting facts concerning an infraction by any other employee or contractor to the school system.
G.	All 9- or 10-month unit members who perform work during the summer that is the same or substantially the same as the work performed during the regular school year have the following contractual rights and obligations:

B.	A representative and/or alternate from SEIU Local 500 shall serve as member(s) of the Accident Review Board.
56 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
C.	Adequate cleaning supplies will be provided, within reasonable limits.
D.	Any permanently assigned segment of work will be reflected in the employees’ total scheduled hours. All operators and attendants will report to work on all applicable MCPS scheduled duty days, as defined in the MCPS operating budget.

F.	SEIU Local 500 will be allowed 10 minutes to address employees at each beginning-of-the-year in service meeting of bus operators and attendants.
G.	Assignments to bus operators and attendants shall be made on a fair and equitable basis in accordance with the provisions outlined below. The design of runs is intended to maximize efficiency and safety. The process for bidding on runs is structured to provide for operators and attendants to maintain AM/PM runs and certain additional work, with opportunities to add additional work in August and throughout the school year and limit the changes to runs, except where and when stops must be added or deleted to transport students e.g., overloads, new students, students no longer going.
1.	June
a.	At the end of each school year, all trips not part of the AM/PM runs will be removed from all runs, except as established in paragraph b. below. Operators and attendants, who wish to change their AM/PM runs at the end of the school year, will give up their current AM/PM runs and bid in August on new AM/PM runs and indicate their interest in bidding on a designated form. Operators and attendants also will designate a proxy should they be unavailable to bid in person and indicate their interest in 40 hours of work. If a run is eliminated between June and September, the operator and attendant will be given another AM/PM run. These operators and attendants may bid on another run/trip for the first time in December. Dates for August bids will be announced.
b.	Extra Work Carried Over
i.	Bus operators and bus attendants who have completed three or more years of service as permanent employees and who have non- AM and PM work that is likely to be available again in the following school year (school community-based, Edison, Head Start, pre-K, mail, Ride by the Rules liaisons, Preschool Education Program, Fire Academy, Medical Careers, early morning bus starters, etc.) shall have the option to keep that work into the next school year. Extra work not expected to be available in the next year (speech, homeless, mainstream inter-school mid-day transfers, etc.) will not be eligible for such carry over. Activity runs will be offered as carryover work if they meet the same criteria for carryover as other runs. This includes work being expected to return and being held by an employee with three years of seniority as of July 1 of the current year. Because the start date of activity runs is unpredictable, the pay for carryover activity runs will start when the run starts. Any activity run that starts after December 1 will be bid.
ii.	If the extra work assignment hours are different for the next year, the hours will be adjusted accordingly. Letters indicating employee wishes regarding extra work will be sent in June and must be returned by July 1 of each year for the employee to be provided the carryover opportunity.
iii.	Carried over extra work assignments that do not start on the first day of school will be paid until October 20. If the work has not begun by October 20, the extra hours of pay will be discontinued and assigned hours will be adjusted accordingly effective October 20, until such time as the work becomes available.
iv.	The parties will confer prior to the end of the 2010-11 school year to determine whether eligibility for carrying work into the following school year should be made available to bus drivers and bus attendants with less than three years of service.
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 57

Bidding for open runs/trips will take place on a countywide basis. Open AM/PM runs will be posted along with other regularly scheduled open extra work (trips).
Between September and June all regularly scheduled open extra work will be posted for bid every two weeks at each of the depots. Open AM/PM runs will be bid in November, February, and April. Supervisors, operators, and attendants may request time adjustments if the hours paid are less than the hours worked.
a)	Interested applicants will apply for vacancies using the current application form within six and one half days of the run vacancy announcement (RVA).
b)	The RVA will include the following:
i.	Bus parking location.
ii.	Estimated hours paid (minimum).
iii.	All schools served, stops served (in case of special education trips, students’ names will not be posted), time of day, and frequency (i.e., Wednesday only or five days/ week). Exact stops may be omitted in the August bid to facilitate earlier posting of some pieces of work.
iv.	Size/type or specific bus required. Assigned bus must match type of bus required (for example, a wheelchair bus is required for wheelchair bids and a non-wheelchair bus is required for non-wheelchair bids. This helps ensure availability of buses and makes the distribution of work more equitable).
v.	Any restrictions—Example: certain trips such as midday kindergarten routes may be restricted geographically (e.g., an operator bidding on a Poolesville High School and Poolesville Elementary School run and parking the bus in the Poolesville area would not be permitted to bid on a midday kindergarten trip in the Magruder High School cluster attendance area). In the case of special education runs, new students may be placed on a bus even if the route must be extended. (Operator and/ or attendant pay will be adjusted accordingly.)
vi.	Closing date for bid coordinator receiving written application from operator or attendant.
c)	i. The RVA will be placed in a notebook within the dispatch office (or a bulletin board if and when available). This can be changed by the Transportation Labor Management Committee.
ii.	The RVA will be posted for six and one half working days, closing at 5:00 p.m. on the seventh day. The operator and/or attendant interested in placing a bid is responsible for delivery of that bid to the depot administrative staff or bid coordinator by the closing date. The employee may withdraw his/her bid at any time prior to the closing date by submitting a written withdrawal request to the bid office. Buses should not be used to deliver bids.
iii.	AM and PM route postings are countywide, allowing movement of operators and/or attendants among depots. Midday and extra work bids are restricted geographically.
d)	Operators and/or attendants will be allowed only two changes in runs per school year; operators and/or attendants may make these changes at any time during the school year without restriction. For the purpose of this subsection, “extra work,” (including midday trips, activity trips, and other like assignments) will not be considered a “change.”
e)	Bus operators and/or attendants normally will not be assigned to more than 40 hours per week on a regular basis. Operators and/or attendants may bid on runs that conflict with their present assignment and, if awarded, will give up the present assignment for the new one.
f)	Operators and/or attendants may bid on multiple runs in a given RVA. They will indicate their choices in priority sequence. Runs/trips will be awarded by seniority and within operator/attendant stated priority. Runs/trips must be accepted as awarded.
58 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
g)	Included in the estimated hours paid to bus operators in subsection 2 above will be one-half hour per day for fueling the bus, cleaning the bus (inside and outside), completing forms, questionnaires, etc. Supervisors, operators, and/or attendants may request time adjustments if the hours paid are more or less than the hours worked.
h)	Time paid will be measured in increments of one tenth of an hour. Each run/trip will be assigned a minimum number of hours. When travel times overlap, operators and attendants will be paid only once for any period of work.
i)	i. Operators or attendants may request an audit of the run and an adjustment of hours. Audits will be performed promptly. Should that audit reveal a difference in the hours assigned to the run/trip, a pay adjustment will be made, retroactive to the date that the assignment began, but not more than 20 duty days prior to the audit request.
ii.	After the first workday following October 20, the operator and/or attendant shall retain the assigned hours for the balance of the school year (except as specified in paragraph iv) below) unless the time required to operate the run/trip is increased, in which case hours paid will be adjusted accordingly. If the operator and/or attendant has suffered a loss of work assignments and refuses to accept an alternate or additional assignment to bring the hours worked up to the hours paid, then the operator’s and/or attendant’s assigned hours will be reduced to the actual number of hours worked for that run/trip.
iii	If operators and/or attendants opt to give up a run/trip, they may not be guaranteed a run/trip of equal assigned hours and their assigned hours will be adjusted accordingly.
iv.	Notwithstanding paragraph i) above, run time assigned for the transportation of one or more homeless students will be part of the permanently assigned hours of the bus operator/attendant beginning with the second full pay period following the addition of such student(s) to the route, and will be removed from the permanently assigned hours of the bus operator/attendant when the homeless student(s) are no longer being transported.
j)	Operators or attendants (including those who share a given run/trip) must have a minimum four hours per day assignment. This must include at least a regular morning and afternoon route.
k)	In some cases, run/trip listings may be posted showing additional time allowed for “deadhead” travel. If this “deadhead” travel time overlaps with “deadhead” travel time for an adjacent run/trip for a given operator or attendant, the operator or attendant will not be paid double for a single “deadhead” time period.
l)	Buses will be assigned in accordance with Section H below. When a bus run (special education or regular) becomes available, the operator receiving the bid and assigned the run and hours may take his/her bus to the new run unless the bus does not fit the established requirements of the run (for example, going from a regular run to a special education run). In this situation, the operator must accept a different assignment bus.
m)	All non-driving assignments within the Department of Transportation (DOT) not filled under Article 10 or Article 19 shall be bid in accordance with Section G above except for the following:
i.	All requests for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) job accommodations shall be considered and verified by the Office of Human Resources and Development individual responsible for ADA compliance in accordance with established MCPS procedures. However, the DOT shall make available placement opportunities to nondriving assignments to those bus operators whose requests are so verified, consistent with operational requirements.
ii.	All other administrative placements of bus operators to nondriving assignments shall be done in consultation with the union. Such assignments shall not extend beyond 60 calendar days except by mutual agreement between the Union and the chief operating officer.
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 59
iii.	MCPS’ DOT will notify SEIU Local 500 of any administrative placement under subsection b) above that lasts more than 15 consecutive duty days. The notification will be directed in writing to the director of the SEIU Local 500 Representation Programs Department. Such notification shall include the name of the employee being assigned to an administrative placement, the date of such placement, the reason for the assignment, the title of the position being assigned to and the position the employee held prior to the administrative placement.
iv.	If, under subsection b) above, an administrative placement lasts 60 consecutive calendar days the MCPS’ DOT will notify SEIU Local 500 (as outlined in subsection c) above) that such administrative placement has lasted for 60 consecutive calendar days. Such notification shall include the name of the employee assigned to the administrative placement, the date of such placement, the reason for the assignment, the title of the position being assigned to, the position the employee held prior to the administrative placement and how long the requested extension of time is expected to last. The extension of time must be by mutual agreement as outlined in subsection b) above.
n) The provisions of this Article may be suspended by agreement of the DOT and the Union where considered desirable by the parties to rectify or correct a specific issue or matter.
o)	All activity run assignments shall be paid at premium rate of pay (1.5 times regular rate). Any operator assigned to an activity run who also has a regular PM run shall be paid for any additional time gap between the PM run and the activity run at his/her regular rate of pay.
p)	Any bus operator who reports to work before 5:00 a.m. to start buses shall receive 7.5 percent differential pay in addition to his/her base rate of pay for that day.
H.	Assignment of School Buses—Buses will be assigned to maximize efficiency in meeting the transportation needs of MCPS. The following factors will be used in assigning buses:
1.	Buses equipped with wheelchair lifts or those assigned to serve pupils in special education programs are exempt from the following; however, every effort will be made to distribute them with preference given to senior drivers, based on factors 2 through 7 below.
2.	New buses will be distributed by systemwide seniority.
3.	When new buses are available, they will be assigned to eligible operators after completion of five years of service, based on their hire date (i.e., when the operator is beginning his/ her sixth year of employment, by August 15).
4.	Bus operators assigned a new bus will maintain that bus assignment for five years unless the group of eligible operators, those with more than five years of service, has been exhausted (see 3 above).
5.	If a new bus is offered to an eligible bus operator and the operator turns down that assignment, the operator’s ranking will be maintained. However, the operator will not be considered for a new bus assignment until his/her cycle comes up again (he/she would probably have to wait a minimum of five years).
6.	All other assignment of buses not included in 1 through 5 above will be assigned on a seniority roll-down basis.
7.	Bus operators may request to keep their current bus assignment by submitting a used bus assignment form (see Appendix).
I.	Procedures for the Fair Distribution of Field Trips—Field trips will be assigned on a fair and
equitable basis for those operators who express an interest.
1.	No field trips will be awarded to operators who are regularly scheduled 40 hours per week, unless the field trip assignment cannot be covered by the pool of operators defined in item 4 below or as described in 5 below.
2.	No field trips will be awarded to operators with a position designation of perm-sub (guaranteed 40 hours per week), unless the field trip assignment cannot be covered by the pool of operators defined in item 4 below.
60 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
3.	Operators with a position code of 9210 Temp (20-hour employees) may be assigned field trips.
4.	Any operator (withstanding the previously mentioned) with an application on file in the field trip office who is scheduled less than 32.5 hours per week is eligible to be assigned field trips, unless such an assignment will place the operator in an overtime status.
5.	It is understood that, on rare occasions, it will be necessary to make emergency or critical service decisions to assign field trips outside these guidelines. This is by no means a common practice, but may occur from time to time.
6.	DOT will make every effort to ensure that operators are notified of field trips well enough in advance to arrange their schedules to accept them. Trips that are kicked back because the operator was improperly notified will not cause that operator to become ineligible for future trips.
7.	Kicked Back Trips—As time permits, priority in giving out kicked back trips is as follows: a) Permanent employees interested in short-notice assignments
b)	Substitutes (nonpermanent)
c)	Radio operators
J.	Compensation for field trips and activities will be paid within 30 days of the submission of field trip tickets by the employee. Employees must submit field trip tickets within five days of completion of the trip. Upon request to DOT, an employee will be provided a summary of field trips for which he/she has been paid along with the trip ticket numbers.
K.	1. In each year of this Agreement, an assessment of scheduled hours will show at least 66 percent of those bus operators having indicated an interest to work full time have a 40-hour schedule.
2.	Only those DOT employees working in excess of 40 hours in a week or 11 hours in a given day will be eligible for time and one-half overtime compensation. No employee shall be required to have a scheduled workday in excess of 13 elapsed hours.
3.	If Section K.1 is not met, then Section K.2 above, at the request of either party, shall be null and void and overtime will be paid for all hours over eight in a day; and routes will be reassigned to require no more than eight hours per day. Reduction in hours shall be on the basis of seniority, with less senior employees being reduced first. Where necessary, routes will be rebid in accordance with the other provisions of this Article. The Union and affected employees will be given 15 days’ notice before this procedure is implemented. The parties may agree to alternative remedies during this time.
L.	Performance Improvement Process and Route Bids—Acceptance into the performance improvement process of SSPGS will not affect the ability of a bus operator or attendant to bid on new route(s) or extra work. Should a bus operator/attendant successfully bid on work that necessitates his/her reassignment to another depot or to another supervisor within the same depot, after having been recommended and approved for the performance improvement process, the professional growth consultant (PGC) will work with the outgoing and incoming supervisor to ensure that the performance improvement process continues without disruption in the new assignment. All obligations on the part of the operator/attendant and the department outlined in the Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) agreement or performance improvement plan will remain in effect. The new supervisor will be permitted to review supporting documentation necessary to provide adequate support.
The Department Director may, after consultation with the PGC, where appropriate, choose to have the operator/attendant remain in his/her current assignment until successful completion of the PAR process or the successful completion of a 90-day special evaluation. In such instances, the department agrees to hold the vacant assignment for the operator/attendant until such time as the process has been successfully completed. Should the new assignment result in additional hours to the operator/attendant at the time of the bid, the department will compensate the operator/attendant based on the higher number of hours, until the reassignment actually occurs, and assign appropriate additional work to the operator/attendant in the interim.
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 61
M.	Bus Route Supervisors
1.	For bus route supervisors, use of annual leave on school days will be approved only in unusual circumstances. During Christmas and spring breaks, and on some other no work-no pay days, employees in such positions may be required to use annual leave. A schedule of such days, which is subject to change, will be provided by DOT management near the beginning of each fiscal year.
2.	The normal work schedule for bus route supervisors will be a split shift, driving a route during either the AM or PM peak period and providing on-the-road supervision during the other peak period. The bus route supervisor will be responsible for adjusting his/her schedule, in consultation with his/her supervisor, to accomplish his/her work within 40 hours per week.

A COMPACT BETWEEN
Montgomery County Educational Association (MCEA) Montgomery County Association of Administrative and Supervisory Personnel (MCAASP) Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 500 Board of Education and the Superintendent of Schools

Organizational Culture of Respect
The Board of Education, the superintendent and the executive staff, and the organizations representing employees recognize and value the role of all employees as contributors to a learning community which sets high standards of performance for staff and students. By working together through continuous improvement, effective communication, and meaningful involvement in the decision-making processes, we provide a high quality education to every student. We are committed to shared responsibility and a collaborative partnership integrated into an organizational culture of respect.
2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement ♦ 65
The commitment to foster an organizational culture of respect that is embedded throughout the school system is a priority of the employee organizations, the Board of Education, and the superintendent and executive staff. This culture is built on the belief that all employees, both school-based and nonschool-based, are essential to a successful learning environment. Inherent to this belief is the recognition that there is strength in diversity, which is inclusive of all groups and individuals. We are committed to:
•	Trust in each other
•	Use of collaborative and interest-based processes
•	Recognizing the collective bargaining relationships as opportunities to enhance this culture
•	Recognition of every employee’s contributions
•	High expectations for all staff and students that are reasonable, clear, and transparent
•	Open, honest contributions without fear of retribution
•	Open and effective communication
•	Respect for various points of view
•	Civility in all of our interactions
•	Team building and working together as teams
There is a commitment to fostering and sustaining a culture of respect through supports and structures. In order to be effective, these supports and structures should be embedded throughout the system, visible and accessible to everyone, and seen as fair and equitable. In order to make certain that this culture is promoted throughout the school system, time is needed for collaboration, training, and professional development and resources are needed to accomplish this.
Examples of supports and structures include, but are not limited to:
•	Board of Education policies, such as the Creating A Positive Work Environment in A Self-renewing Organization and Human Relations policies.
•	Professional growth systems, which include professional development, employee orientation, mentoring, training, recognition, support for new and under-performing employees, and professional development plans
•	Collaborative processes, such as labor/management collaboration committees, Councils on Teaching and Learning, principal leadership groups, cross functional teams, advisory committees, and Study Circles
•	Diversity training and development initiatives
•	Continuous improvement processes, including the Baldrige-guided school improvement process
•	Communication processes, including satisfaction and climate surveys, focus groups, budget forums, and various feedback reports
•	Dispute resolution activities
66 ♦ 2011-2014 ♦ SEIU Local 500, CTW Agreement
In an organizational culture of respect, individuals are aware and understand the impact of their behavior and decisions on others. We expect that the actions and behaviors of all individuals and groups are consistent with and reflect this organizational culture. The actions listed below represent expected behaviors:
•	Model civility in daily interactions
•	Use collaborative and interest-based strategies rather than positional or adversarial approaches
•	Be clear about the level of involvement in the decision-making process
•	Seek to solve the problem, not apply blame
•	Utilize active listening skills
•	Encourage creativity and risk-taking
•	Seek and respect the opinion of others
•	Respect the time and the time commitments of others
•	Seek to resolve issues at the level where they occur
•	Seek to understand before making judgments
•	Acknowledge the professional judgment of individuals in their roles
•	Be aware of nonverbal communication
•	Use power and authority appropriately and positively
•	Be an active and responsible member of the team
•	Be responsible for accepting and giving feedback
•	Provide and receive feedback constructively and respectfully
•	Communicate openly and respectfully
In order to sustain an organizational culture of respect, it is critical that all employees have an awareness, understanding, and tolerance of others’ interests, viewpoints, culture, and background. This culture promotes a positive work environment that ensures the success of each employee, high student achievement, and continuous improvement in a self-renewing organization.
