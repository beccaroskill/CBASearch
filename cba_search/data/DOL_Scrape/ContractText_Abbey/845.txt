BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
(5)	Portions of the music sound track from a motion picture may be

February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
(3)	The Leader/Conductor, Orchestra Manager, Orchestrator(s), Librarian, and Music Prep Service/Supervising Copyist must be credited by name and position.

to payment under the provisions of this agreement which have been sold during the applicable reporting periods, the dates of initial release for sale thereof, the manufacturer’s suggested retail price thereof and the component units thereof, and the excise and sales taxes, if any, and the Federation and/or the Sound Recording Special Payments Fund and/or the Music Performance Trust Funds, as applicable, shall have the right at all reasonable times to inspect such records. The undersigned shall give the Federation prompt written notice of the date on which the phonograph record containing such dubbed music sound track covered hereby is first released for sale. An inadvertent failure to comply with said requirement of notice shall not constitute a default by the undersigned hereunder, provided such failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from the Federation.
“Buyer further agrees that in the event of a sale, transfer, license or assignment of the right to dub sound track from the motion picture for phonograph records, Buyer shall obtain from the purchaser, transferee, licensee or assignee an Assumption Agreement covering the rights disposed of in the form set forth herein and shall provide an executed copy of such Assumption Agreement to the Federation. Upon delivery of such Assumption Agreement, Buyer shall not be further liable to the Federation or the Funds for the keeping of any records related to or the payments required based upon the rights covered under the Assumption Agreement and the Federation and the Funds agree to look exclusively to the purchaser, transferee, licensee or assignee executing such Assumption Agreement for compliance with the provisions of Article 8(b)(1). In the event Buyer fails to deliver such Assumption Agreement, it shall continue to be liable for the payments required under Article 8(b)(1).”
It is understood that additional provisions may be included in form Assumption Agreements, so long as such additional provision(s) do not vary or alter the terms of the foregoing Assumption Agreement.
Producer agrees to give notice to the Federation within thirty (30) days of each sale, transfer or license of such dubbing rights, with the name and address of the Buyer or assignee, and to deliver to the Federation an executed copy of each assumption agreement entered into by the Producer. An inadvertent failure on the part of the Producer to comply with any of the provisions of this subparagraph (b) shall in no event constitute a default by the Producer hereunder or a breach of this Agreement, provided that such failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from the Federation.

BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
Upon delivery of such assumption agreement, Producer, or any subsequent owner obtaining the execution of such an assumption agreement, shall not be further liable to the Federation or to the Funds for the keeping of any such records or the payments required hereunder insofar as they relate to the dubbing of music sound track for phonograph records, and the Federation and the Funds agree to look exclusively to the party last executing such an assumption agreement for the keeping of such records and compliance with payment obligations.
(c)	The Producer further agrees to register identification of picture and music sound track with the Federation Representative.
(d)	It is agreed that persons employed under this Agreement shall not be required or permitted to record music sound track for general usage or for any purpose whatsoever except as provided herein.
(e)	It is further agreed that all music sound track already recorded, commonly referred to as “library music sound track,” will not be disposed of, sold, leased or used for any picture or purpose except to accompany revival of the picture for which recordings were originally made.
(f)	It is agreed that persons employed under this Agreement will not be required or permitted to use music sound track for any purpose in violation of the terms herein provided.
(g)	The Producer is not restricted from continuing the established industry practice of exchanging so-called “stock shots.”
(h)	The use of library music sound track for short subjects is prohibited.
(i)	No orchestra or part thereof shall be permitted to augment music recordings in the same session in which the original recordings are made. The above is not intended to prohibit the Producer from making musical bridges, replacements or other special musical effects for the purpose of musical punctuation, matching a picture action or other special effects, such as reverberation where the tracks are staggered several sprocket holes or frames to give sound effects not obtainable with more musicians. It shall not be the intention of the Producer to program a recording call specifically for augmenting music tracks as a means of eliminating musicians.
(j)	The Producer agrees that the substance and intent of Article 8 hereof shall be incorporated in all agreements made by the Producer for licensing, leasing,

lending, giving, selling, utilizing or other disposition of music sound track containing the recorded music made by members of the Federation, or scenes or shots containing pictures of members of the Federation performing on musical instruments or conducting.
8A. REUSE OF PORTIONS OF THE MUSIC SOUND TRACK FROM A MOTION PICTURE
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 8 and except as provided in subparagraph (e) below, no additional compensation shall be payable for the reuse of any portion of the music sound track of a motion picture in the following circumstances:
(a)	When used for promotional, trailer, news or review purposes. For purposes of this subparagraph, a “promotional” use shall be for the purpose of advertising or publicizing the specific motion picture or serial or series from which the sound track is taken (including the filming of musicians engaged in the recording of such sound track). The term “promotional,” as used herein, shall also include “the making of...” or “behind-the-scenes”-type programs. As used in this subparagraph (a), the term “news” means regularly-scheduled news programs and special news programs which are not pre-planned and which are broadcast within twenty-four (24) hours after the event which gave rise to the program. It is understood that obituary programs are deemed to be “special news programs” even if pre-planned.
Upon learning of any unauthorized use of either “the making of...” or “behind-the-scenes”-type promotional programs, the parties will jointly discuss appropriate steps to be taken to collect monies for such unauthorized use.
(b)	When used as a so-called “stock shot,” as that term is customarily understood in the industry — (i.e., shots excluding dialogue or identifiable characters).
(c)	When used for purposes of recapping the story to date in the context of a serial, multi-part program, episodic series, unit series or anthology.
(d)	When used as a flashback in a context of a serial, multi-part program, episodic series, unit series, one-time show or anthology, except that this shall not apply to programs comprised primarily of flashbacks.

BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15,2005
(e)	(1) For any use of any portion of a production number with the
accompanying footage from a motion picture, or for the use of up to two (2) minutes of music sound track from a motion picture without the accompanying footage, which use is not within the exceptions provided for in subparagraphs (a)-(d) above, the Producer shall pay the following aggregate one-time-only sum for each motion picture to the musician or musicians determined by the Federation to be entitled to such compensation and prorated among such musicians as determined by the Federation:
(i)	one (1) minute or less of sound track - $1,500;
(ii)	for each thirty (30) seconds or portion thereof in excess of one (1) minute - $750.
(2)	For the use of any other music sound track with the accompanying footage from a motion picture not covered under subparagraph (e)(1) above, which use is not within the exceptions provided for in subparagraphs (a)-(d) above, the Producer shall pay the following aggregate one-time-only sum for each motion picture to the musician or musicians determined by the Federation to be entitled to such compensation and prorated among such musicians as determined by the Federation:
(i)	one (1) minute or less of sound track - $750;
(ii)	for each thirty (30) seconds or portion thereof in excess of one (1) minute - $375.

(g)	The actual production company which produces the program or motion picture containing the excerpted portion of the music sound track requiring payment is obligated to make the payment required under this Article, provided the company is signatory to this Agreement.

15.	POST 460 THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURES
(a)	The provisions of this Article 15 relate and apply only to theatrical motion pictures produced by Producer and subject to this Agreement or to the prior American Federation of Musicians Basic Theatrical Motion Picture Agreements of 1960, 1964, 1969, 1972, 1974, 1977, 1981, 1984, 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996 and 1999:
(i)	The principal photography of which commenced on or after January 31, 1960, and with respect to the release to free television of such motion pictures either during the term hereof or at any time thereafter; and
(ii)	In which there is music sound track containing recorded music made by “participating musicians,” (as such term is hereinafter defined), or scenes or shots containing pictures of participating musicians performing on musical instruments or conducting.
(b)	As to each such motion picture, the Producer will pay:
(i)	To the Administrator of the Film Musicians Secondary Markets Fund (previously known as the Theatrical and Television Motion Picture Special Payments Fund) (hereinafter the "Secondary Markets Fund") pursuant to the terms of this Article 15 and the Film Musicians Secondary Markets Fund Agreement attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit “A,” one and two-thirds percent

BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
(1%%) (hereinafter referred to as the “percentage payment”) of the Producer’s accountable receipts from the distribution of such motion picture on free television after February 16, 2002, computed as hereinafter provided and subject to the following conditions:
(1)	The term “Producer’s gross,” as used herein, means the worldwide total gross receipts derived by the distributor of such motion picture (who may be the Producer or a distributor licensed by the Producer) from licensing the right to exhibit the motion picture on free television. If the distributor of the motion picture does not distribute the motion picture directly to free television, but employs a subdistributor to so distribute the motion picture, then the “Producer’s gross” shall be the worldwide total gross receipts derived by such subdistributor from licensing the right to exhibit the motion picture on free television. In case of an outright sale of the free television distribution rights, for the entire world, or any territory or country, the income derived by the seller from such sale, but not the income realized by the purchaser or licensee of such rights, shall be the “Producer’s gross.” If any such outright sale shall include free television exhibition rights and other rights, then (but only for the purpose of the computation required hereunder), the Producer shall allocate to the free television exhibition rights a fair and reasonable portion of the sale price which shall, for the purpose hereof, be the “Producer’s gross.” In reaching such determination, Producer may consider the current market value of free television exhibition rights in comparable motion pictures. If the Federation shall contend that the amount so allocated was not fair and reasonable, such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration as herein provided; and in the event the Board of Arbitration shall find that such allocation was not reasonable and fair, it shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated. If the outright sale includes free television distribution rights to more than one motion picture, Producer shall likewise allocate to each motion picture a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price of the free television rights; and if the Federation contends that such allocation is not fair and reasonable, the question may be determined by submission to arbitration as above provided. If the Board of Arbitration shall find that such allocation was not fair and reasonable, it shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated to each motion picture. The price received on the outright sale of only free television distribution rights in a single photoplay shall not be subject to arbitration. Sums paid to any advertising agency in connection with any exhibition of a motion picture on free television shall not be included in Producer’s gross.
Monies received from AGICOA for such motion picture shall be included in “Producer’s gross,” with respect to payments due to the
-20-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002—February 15, 2005
Secondary Markets Fund pursuant to the provisions of Article 15 on or after February 16, 2002.
(2)	The term “accountable receipts,” as used herein, means the balance of the Producer’s gross after deducting an arbitrary forty percent (40%) of the Producer’s gross for distribution fees and expenses; except that in the case of an outright sale of free television distribution rights, there shall be deducted only an arbitrary ten percent (10%) of the Producer’s gross for sales commissions and expenses of sale.
(3)	Producer’s obligation shall accrue hereunder only after accountable receipts are received by the Producer; but as to foreign receipts, such obligations shall not accrue, nor be included in accountable receipts, until the Producer shall either have the right to freely use such foreign currency, or Producer has the right to transmit to the United States to Producer such foreign currency from the country or territory where it is frozen. If such currency may be utilized or transmitted as aforesaid, it shall be deemed to have been converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which such currency was actually transmitted to the United States as aforesaid or, if not actually transmitted, then at the prevailing free market rate of exchange at the time such right to use or to transmit occurs. Frozen foreign currency shall be deemed to be unblocked on the basis of “first in, first out” unless otherwise allocated by local foreign fiscal authorities. Allocation of such unblocked funds as between revenue which serves as the basis of determining payments hereunder and other revenue shall be on a proportional basis, subject to different earmarking by local foreign fiscal authorities. Payments of amounts accruing hereunder shall be made quarterly on the basis of quarterly statements, as hereinafter provided. Foreign receipts shall be accounted for in U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange at which such receipts are actually converted and remitted, and should any discounts, taxes, duties or charges be imposed in connection with the receipt or remittance of foreign funds, only so much of such funds as remain thereafter shall be included in accountable receipts. Producer shall not be responsible for loss or diminution of foreign receipts as a result of any matter or thing not reasonably within the control of the Producer. The Federation, Employers’ Pension Fund or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, and the Musicians shall be bound by any arrangements made in good faith by the Producer, or for its account, with respect to the deposit or remittance of foreign revenue. Frozen foreign receipts shall not be considered trust funds and the Producer may freely commingle the same with other funds of the Producer. No sums received by way of deposits or security need be included in Producer’s gross until earned, but when the Producer is paid a nonretumable advance by a distributor, such advance shall be included in the Producer’s gross.
-21-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
A “non-returnable advance” is to be included in “accountable receipts” when the picture is “available” and “identifiable” and the amount of the advance payment is “ascertainable.”
The picture is “available” when the first of the following
occurs:
(A)	The product first may be exhibited or otherwise exploited by a specified method of distribution and in a territory under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement, or
(B)	It first may be sold or rented by a retailer under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement.
The picture is “identifiable” when the Producer first knows or reasonably should have known that a given motion picture is covered by a particular license or distribution agreement for its exploitation in the applicable market.
if:
The amount of the advance payment is “ascertainable”
(A)	the advance is for one motion picture, means of exhibition, and territory, or
(B)	the total amount of the advance is for more than one motion picture, means of exhibition and/or territory, in which case the Producer shall fairly and reasonably allocate such advance among the licensed motion pictures, exhibition markets and/or territorial markets. As each of these pictures becomes identifiable and available, the allocated portion of the non-returnable advance is to be included in “Producer’s gross” for that quarter. The Producer shall notify the Secondary Markets Fund of its allocation when the report of “Producer’s gross,” which includes the advance, is to be filed.
If the picture is available in any territory or by any means of exhibition and is identifiable and the amount of the advance is ascertainable, but the Producer does not provide the Secondary Markets Fund with the information required by this Agreement and applicable law, then the advance shall be deemed includable in “accountable receipts” no later than six (6) months after the Producer receives it.
-22-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
An advance received by a Producer’s parent, subsidiary or any other related or affiliated entity or successor-in-interest, or by any other entity to which the advance payment is directed by the Producer or license or distribution agreement, shall be considered as an advance payment received by the Producer.
(4)	If any license or outright sale of exhibition rights to the motion picture on free television includes as a part thereof any filmed commercial or advertising material, the Producer shall be permitted to allocate a reasonable amount (in accordance with then-current standard charges in the industry) to such commercial or advertising material, and the amount so allocated shall not be included in Producer’s gross hereunder.
(5)	The term “participating musician,” as used herein, means a musician who, while in the employ of the Producer (to which employment the provisions of this Agreement apply), participated in the preparation for or the recording of the music sound track for such motion picture or who was photographed in such motion picture as performing on musical instruments or conducting. If payments hereunder are made to the Employers’ Pension Fund, the “pro rata share” credited to each participating musician shall be that proportion of the percentage payment that the total compensation theretofore paid to such musician for his/her said services in the motion picture in an employment capacity bears to the aggregate total compensation theretofore paid to all participating musicians for their services in recording or being photographed in the motion picture in an employment capacity. If payments hereunder are made to the Secondary Markets Fund, there shall be payable to each participating musician that portion of the part of the musician’s share of the Secondary Markets Fund which is allocable to such motion picture that the total compensation theretofore paid to such musician for his/her said services in the motion picture in an employment capacity bears to the aggregate total compensation theretofore paid to all participating musicians for their services in recording or being photographed in the motion picture in an employment capacity.
The term “total compensation,” as used herein, means all monies paid to a participating musician for his/her said services, or his/her heirs, executors, administrators or assigns as of a time immediately preceding the close of the annual period covered by the Producer’s annual statement involved. The cost of transportation or living expenses paid to or on behalf of musicians shall not be included in “total compensation.”
(a)	Such payments made hereunder to the Employers’ Pension Fund are not and shall not in any manner be construed to be

BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
wages due to any individual employee, nor in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities or torts of any employee.
(b)	The Administrator of the Secondary Markets Fund shall make all deductions and withholdings required by law, and shall timely make all such reports and payments to governmental agencies as may be required by law.
(6)	When “participating musicians” have been utilized in creating the music sound track for a motion picture which is scored partially in the United States or Canada and partially outside of the United States and Canada, the percentage payment into the Secondary Markets Fund shall be as follows: the payment shall be prorated by multiplying such percentage payment by a fraction whose numerator consists of the total salaries paid to the musicians employed under the terms of this Agreement and the denominator of which consists of the total salaries paid to all musicians employed in connection with the scoring of such motion picture. The foregoing proration formula shall be subject to the following exceptions: (i) in any instance in which the total salaries paid to musicians employed under this Agreement are less than thirty percent (30%) of the total salaries paid to all musicians employed in connection with the scoring of the motion picture, the Producer shall nevertheless be required to pay thirty percent (30%) of the percentage payment due; and (ii) in any instance in which the total salaries paid to musicians employed under this Agreement total seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the total salaries paid to all musicians employed in connection with the scoring of the motion picture, then the Producer shall be required to make a contribution to the Secondary Markets Fund equal to what the contribution would have been if one hundred percent (100%) of the scoring had taken place in the United States or Canada. The Producer shall provide to the auditors the information necessary to determine the correct pro rata payment.* The Producer will identify a motion picture as subject to this subparagraph (6) at the time of the first payment to the Fund for that motion picture.
(7)	Producer will furnish to the Federation and the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, written reports on forms prepared by the Fund, approved by the AMPTP and the Federation, and furnished by the Fund, showing the Producer’s gross received from the sale, lease, license and distribution (whether by Producer or a distributor) of each such motion picture on free television.

Concurrently with the-furnishing of each such report, the Producer will make the payments shown to be due by such report. All payments shall be made by check payable to the order of and delivered to the Employers’ Pension Fund, or to the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be. Each such report shall designate, when known, the title, the production number (if available) and, when applicable, the episode number of the motion picture involved, the name of the production entity (if available), the distributor’s name, the distributor’s disbursing agent (if applicable), the period covered by the payment and, if receipts from release of the picture to free television are included in the payment, a breakdown of gross receipts attributable to Supplemental Markets and those attributable to free television release. On request, the Producer shall make available to the Federation or the Administrator of the Secondary Markets Fund all accounting statements delivered by a distributor to the Producer, but only insofar as such statements relate to the Producer’s gross. The Federation or the Administrator of the Secondary Markets Fund shall have the right, at reasonable times, to examine the books and records of Producer insofar as they relate to the Producer’s gross. Producer shall not be required to furnish any report hereunder with respect to the motion picture prior to Producer’s receipt of any Producer’s gross with respect to the motion picture, or for any reporting period during which no Producer’s gross from the motion picture is received by the Producer.

The leader/contractor shall be responsible for achieving compliance with this requirement.*

by this Agreement are subject to the AFM Basic Theatrical Agreement of 2002 with respect to the provisions of Article 15 thereof relating to payments to the Employers’ Pension Fund [Film Musicians Secondary Markets Fund] on release of a theatrical motion picture photoplay to free television; and the said Buyer hereby agrees, expressly for the benefit of American Federation of Musicians’ and Employers’ Pension Fund (herein referred to as the ‘Employers’ Pension Fund’) or Film Musicians Secondary Markets Fund (herein referred to as the ‘Secondary Markets Fund’), to make said payments required thereby. It is expressly understood and agreed that the rights of Buyer to exhibit or license the exhibition of such photoplays on free television shall be subject to and conditioned upon the payment to the Employers’ Pension Fund [Secondary Markets Fund] as provided in Article 15 of said Basic Agreement, and it is agreed that said Employers’ Pension Fund [Secondary Markets Fund] shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief and damages against Buyer in the event such payments are not made.
“Buyer shall be liable to make the payments described above but only based upon rights actually acquired by Buyer and only for the period it holds such rights.
“The undersigned agrees to keep or have access to complete records showing the income derived from the distribution of such motion pictures on free television within the entire territory for which Buyer is granted such rights and the Federation and/or the Secondary Markets Fund Administrator shall have the right at all reasonable times to inspect such records. The undersigned shall
-27-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
give the Federation prompt written notice of the date on which each photoplay covered hereby is first telecast on free television. An inadvertent failure to comply with said requirement of notice shall not constitute a default by the undersigned hereunder, provided such failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from the Federation.
“Buyer further agrees that in the event of a sale, transfer, license or assignment of the free television distribution rights and/or the Supplemental Markets distribution rights to the above-referenced motion picture, Buyer shall obtain from the purchaser, transferee, licensee or assignee an Assumption Agreement covering the rights disposed of in the form set forth herein and shall provide an executed copy of such Assumption Agreement to the Federation. Upon delivery of such Assumption Agreement, Buyer shall not be further liable to the Federation or the Secondary Markets Fund for the keeping of any records related to or the payments required based upon the rights covered under the Assumption Agreement for the exhibition of the motion picture on free television and/or in Supplemental Markets and both the Federation and the Secondary Markets Fund agree to look exclusively to the purchaser, transferee, licensee or assignee executing such Assumption Agreement for the keeping of such books or records and for making the payments attributable to the rights acquired. In the event Buyer fails to deliver such Assumption Agreement, it shall continue to be liable for the keeping of records and for the payments required for the exhibition of the motion picture on free television and/or in Supplemental Markets.”
It is understood that additional provisions may
be included in form Assumption Agreements, so long as such additional provision(s) do not vary or alter the terms of the foregoing Assumption Agreement.
Producer agrees to give notice to the Federation
within thirty (30) days of each sale, transfer or license of the distribution rights to such a motion picture on free television, with the name and address of the Buyer, assignee or distributor, and to deliver to the Federation an executed copy of each assumption agreement entered into by the Producer. An inadvertent failure on the part of the Producer to comply with any of the provisions of this subparagraph (9) shall in no event constitute a default by the Producer hereunder or a breach of this Agreement, provided that such failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from the Federation.
Upon delivery of such assumption agreement,
Producer, or any subsequent owner obtaining the execution of such an assumption

BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
agreement shall not be further liable to the Federation for the keeping of any such records or the payment required hereunder insofar as they relate to the broadcast of the photoplay on free television, and the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, agrees to look exclusively to the party last executing such an assumption agreement for the keeping of such records, payment and compliance with credit obligations.
(10)	With respect to such motion picture, Producer agrees either to:
(i)	Include in any chattel mortgage, pledge or other lien or security agreement covering the photoplay a provision, made expressly for the benefit of the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, to the effect that the chattel mortgagee, pledgee or lien or security holder agrees that if such mortgage, pledge, lien or security agreement is foreclosed, and such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder thereby obtains title to the photoplay and subsequently exhibits the photoplay on free television, then in such event, after such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder has recouped its loan so secured, plus interest and all costs and expenses incident to foreclosure, such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder will be bound by the provisions of this Article 15 with respect to payments to the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, thereafter becoming due and payable hereunder; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall prevent such mortgagee, pledgee or lien or security holder who has acquired title to the photoplay from thereafter making a sale of the photoplay to a third party free and clear of any limitations or obligations whatsoever. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (i), the rights of the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Funds, as the case may be, hereunder shall be subordinate to the rights of such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder; or
(ii)	In the alternative, be bound by the provisions of this Article 15 with respect to payments to the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, if any, due after such foreclosure shall have been made. In the event Producer elects this alternative, the provisions of subsection (i) above shall be inapplicable, and if the provisions referred to in subsection (i) above are not included in any such chattel mortgage, pledge, lien or security agreement, Producer shall be deemed to have elected the alternative provided for in this subsection (ii).
In the event of a foreclosure referred to in subsection (i) above, should the Producer distribute the motion picture for such
-29-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 —February 15, 2005
mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder, Producer shall be bound during the period of such distribution by the provisions of this Article 15 with respect to payments due hereunder, to the same extent as the mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder under subsection (i) above. Any such payments made by the Producer as the distributor shall be credited against any obligation of the mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder that may be due or become due to the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, under subsection (i) above; it being understood that the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, shall be entitled to such payments but once.
The foregoing provisions of this
subparagraph (10) shall not apply to any photoplay subject to any security instrument in existence on the effective date of this Agreement
(11)	If, after the effective date of this Agreement, the
Producer enters into a contract with a so-called “independent producer” for the production and financing of a theatrical motion picture and the distribution thereof by the Producer, (such contract being hereinafter referred to as an “independent contract”), Producer will include in such independent contract an agreement on the part of the independent producer, expressly for the benefit of the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, that the independent producer will pay, in the manner herein provided, the amounts, if any, required to be paid under the provisions of this Article 15 with respect to such motion picture. If such agreement on the part of the independent Producer be not included in any independent contract prior to the exhibition of the motion picture on free television, the Producer shall be liable and responsible for the payments, if any, required to be made under the provisions of this Article 15 with respect to such motion picture. If such agreement on the part of the independent producer is included in the independent contract prior to exhibition of the motion picture on free television, then the Producer shall not be liable or responsible in any manner or to any extent with respect to the motion picture under the provisions of this Article 15. The Producer will notify the Federation of any and all such independent contracts entered into by the Producer.
(12)	Any payments made by Producer to the
Administrator of the Secondary Markets Fund under the provisions of this Article 15 shall be, (subject to Paragraph 2(c) of the Secondary Markets Fund Agreement), to provide for and be payment for said Producer’s contribution to the musicians’ share of the Secondary Markets Fund (as defined hereinafter) and any employment taxes or
-30-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
insurance premiums which may be owing by said Producer with respect to the distribution of the musicians’ share of the Secondary Markets Fund.
(13)	The musicians’ share of the Secondary Markets Fund (“musicians’ share of the Fund”) shall be an amount equal to the sum of the contribution of the Producer, any investment earnings of the Secondary Markets Fund, and any “unclaimed amounts” as defined in Paragraph 2(g) of the Secondary Markets Fund Agreement, less:
(a)	All expenses reasonably incurred in the administration of the Secondary Markets Fund, including the compensation of the Administrator herein provided, and appropriate bonding premiums;
(b)	Amounts reasonably reserved by the Administrator as an operating Fund, and for contingencies, and for omission claims; and
(c)	An amount (hereinafter referred to as the “Producer’s share of the Fund”) equal to the total of any social security tax, federal and/or state unemployment insurance tax, other employment taxes, disability insurance premiums, and/or worker’s compensation premiums, which may be owing by the Producer, individually or collectively and/or by the Administrator, as employer or employers, with respect to the distribution of the musicians’ share of the Secondary Markets Fund.
A committee shall be established to discuss the type of information to be submitted to the Secondary Markets Fund to ensure proper allocation and distribution to participating musicians.
(14)	The parties have agreed that, in order to assist the Administrator of the Secondary Markets Fund with the information necessary to determine the correct pro rata share under Article 15(b)(i)(5), the Producer will send a copy of B forms or OMR reports that reflect the total compensation paid to each participating musician employed on each covered motion picture to: (i) the applicable local union when the scoring is done within the jurisdiction of the AFM Locals in Los Angeles, New York, Nashville, Vancouver or Toronto (and the local union will, in turn, provide the reports to the Fund); or (ii) in all other cases, to the Secondary Markets Fund. Such reports shall be provided within a reasonable time period following the scoring session.

16.	SUPPLEMENTAL MARKETS
(a)	The provisions of this Article 16 relate and apply only to theatrical motion pictures produced by Producer during the term hereof and subject to this Agreement:
(i)	The principal photography of which commenced on or after July 1, 1971, which motion pictures are, either during the term hereof or at any time thereafter, released in supplemental markets (as defined below); and
(ii)	In which there is music sound track containing recorded music made by participating musicians (as such term is hereinafter defined) or scenes or shots containing pictures of participating musicians performing on musical instruments or conducting.
(iii)	Definition
The term “Supplemental Markets,” as used in this Agreement, means only: The exhibition of theatrical motion pictures by means of cassettes, (to the limited extent provided in subparagraph (1) of this subparagraph (iii)), or Pay Television, as those terms are hereafter defined in subparagraph (2).
(1)	Cassettes:
For the purposes of this Article 16, a cassette is any audio-visual device, including without limitation, cassette, cartridge, phonogram or other similar audio-visual device now known or hereafter devised, containing a theatrical motion picture (recorded on film, disc, tapes or other material) and designed for replay on a home-type television screen. The sale or rental of cassettes for replay through a television receiver or comparable device in the home or in closed-circuit use, such as in hotel rooms, constitutes “Supplemental Markets” for the purposes of this provision insofar as cassettes are concerned.
(2)	Pay Television:
The term “pay television,” as used in this Article, shall mean exhibition of theatrical motion pictures on a television screen by means of telecast, cable, closed-circuit, satellite to home or CATV, where substantially all systems to which the program is licensed meet the following tests:
-32-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
(A)	a separate channel is provided for which the subscriber pays a separate fee (which fee is a major charge relative to other charges made to the subscriber) for that channel;
and/or
(B)	the subscriber pays for the motion picture or motion pictures selected (except that a motion picture or motion pictures selected for which only a token charge is made shall not be considered pay television);
and/or
(C)	the subscriber pays a fee for an encoded telecast, which fee is a major charge relative to other fees paid for encoded telecasts.
The foregoing tests cover those types of services and systems which exist in the industry today and are commonly understood in the industry today to be pay television services or systems.
The term “pay television,” as used in this Article, shall also include the exhibition of theatrical motion pictures through a television receiver or comparable device by means of a telecast, cable, closed-circuit, satellite or CATV for which the viewing audience (whether by the individual viewer or by the hotel, motel, hospital or other accommodation where the viewer is) pays to receive the program by making a separate payment for such specific program. Exhibition in theatres or comparable places by such means is theatrical exhibition and shall not be considered pay television.
The term Supplemental Markets does not include the exhibition of a theatrical motion picture by cassette or otherwise over a television broadcast station or in theatrical exhibition and, for this purpose, “theatrical exhibition” includes the educational market, the exhibition of theatrical motion pictures on any commercial carrier (referred to herein as “in-flight”), such as commercial airlines, trains, ships and buses, and other uses which have been traditionally considered theatrical exhibition of theatrical motion pictures, other than the specific home use hereinabove defined as the “Supplemental Market” for cassettes.
Whenever reference is made in this Article to pay television, such reference shall be deemed to include only those uses of motion pictures as to which a charge is actually made to the subscriber for the program
-33-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
viewed, or when the subscriber has the option, by additional payment, to receive special programming over one or more special channels. When no program charge or special channel charge is made to the subscriber in addition to the general charge, the transmission of theatrical motion pictures by the CATV facility, including programming originated by the CATV facility, is free television exhibition for the purposes of this Agreement, and such exhibition shall not be considered Supplemental Markets exhibition.
The Producers have agreed to the inclusion of pay television in the “Supplemental Markets” because, under the present pattern of distribution of theatrical motion pictures, pay television is supplemental to the primary market. The Producers reserve the right in future negotiations to contend that the pattern of release has changed so that pay television is no longer a Supplemental Market, but constitutes or is a part of the primary market of distribution of theatrical motion pictures, and that therefore no additional payment pursuant to this Article 16 should be made with respect to the release of theatrical motion pictures (including those covered by this Agreement) in said markets. Nothing herein shall limit the scope of negotiations on said subject.
(b)	As to each such theatrical motion picture, the Producer will pay:
(i)	To the Administrator of the Film Musicians Secondary Markets Fund, pursuant to the terms of this Article 16 and the Film Musicians Secondary Markets Fund Agreement attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit “A,” one percent (1%) (hereinafter referred to as the “percentage payment”) of the “Producer’s gross” derived from the distribution of such motion picture in Supplemental Markets, computed as hereinafter provided and subject to the following conditions:
(1)	Producer’s Gross
(A)	(i) For purposes of calculating Supplemental
Market fees due under this Article 16 arising from the distribution of theatrical motion pictures to “pay television,” as defined above, the term “Producer’s gross” shall mean the worldwide total gross receipts derived by the distributor of such motion picture (who may be the Producer or a distributor licensed by the Producer) from licensing the right to exhibit such picture on “pay television,” as defined above, and including, in the case of a “foreign territorial sale” by the Producer, the income received from such sale by Producer, but not the income received by “purchaser” or the “licensee.”
-34-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
If the distributor of such picture does not distribute such picture directly to pay television, but employs a subdistributor to so distribute such picture, then the “Producer’s gross” shall be the worldwide total gross receipts derived by such subdistributor from licensing the right to exhibit such picture on pay television. In case of an outright sale of the pay television distribution rights for the entire world, or any territory or country, the income derived by the seller from such sale, but not the income realized by the purchaser or licensee of such rights, shall be the “Producer’s gross.” If any such outright sale shall include pay television exhibition rights and other rights, then (but only for the purpose of the computation required hereunder) the Producer shall allocate to the pay television exhibition rights a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price which shall, for the purpose hereof, be the “Producer’s gross.” In reaching this determination, Producer may consider the cunent market value of pay television exhibition rights in comparable motion pictures.
(ii)	For purposes of calculating Supplemental Markets fees due under this Article 16 arising from the distribution of theatrical motion pictures on “cassettes,” as defined above, the term “Producer’s gross” is defined as follows:
(1)	If the Producer is the Distributor or the Distributor is owned by or affiliated with the Producer, the “Producer’s gross” derived from the distribution of such picture by “cassettes” shall be twenty percent (20%) of the worldwide wholesale receipts derived by the Distributor. In such cases, if the Distributor is also the retailer, a reasonable allocation of the retail gross receipts shall be made as between the Distributor as distributor and the Distributor as retailer, and twenty percent (20%) of the former only shall be deemed to be “Producer’s gross.” The reasonableness of such allocation shall be subject to arbitration and, in . such arbitration, generally prevailing trade practices in the cassette industry with respect to dealings between non-related companies shall be relevant evidence.
(2)	If the Distributor is not the Producer and is not owned by or affiliated with the Producer, the “Producer’s gross” shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the fees received by the Producer from licensing the right to distribute such picture by cassette.
(B)	The “Producer’s gross” shall not include:
(i)	Sums realized or held by way of deposit as security, until and unless earned, other than such sums as are non-returnable;
-35-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
(ii)	Rebates, credits or repayments for cassettes returned (and, in this connection, the Producer shall have the right to set up a reasonable reserve for returns);
(iii)	Sums required to be paid or withheld as taxes, in the nature of turnover taxes, sales taxes or similar taxes based on the actual receipts of such motion picture or on any monies to be remitted to or by the Producer, but there shall not be excluded from Producer’s gross any net income tax, franchise tax or excess profit tax or similar tax payable by the Producer or such Distributor on its net income or for the privilege of doing business;
(iv)	Frozen foreign currency until the Producer shall either have the right to freely use such foreign currency, or Producer has the right to transmit to the United States to Producer such foreign currency from the country or territory where it is frozen. If such currency may be utilized or transmitted as aforesaid, it shall be deemed to have been converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which such currency was actually transmitted to the United States as aforesaid or, if not actually transmitted, then at the prevailing free market rate of exchange at the time such right to use or to transmit occurs. Frozen foreign currency shall be deemed to be unblocked on the basis of “first in, first out” unless otherwise allocated by local foreign fiscal authorities. Allocation of such unblocked funds as between revenue which serves as the basis of determining payments hereunder and other revenue shall be on a proportional basis, subject to different earmarking by local foreign fiscal authorities;
(v)	Sums paid to any advertising agency in connection with any exhibition of a motion picture in Supplemental Markets.
(C)	Such gross income realized in foreign currency in any reporting period required hereunder shall be deemed to be converted to United States dollars at the prevailing market rate of exchange at the close of such reporting period, except that when such gross income has actually been transmitted to the United States, it shall be deemed converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which such foreign currency was actually so transmitted.
(D)	Allocation of Producer’s Gross
If any agreement for distribution in the Supplemental Market includes more than one theatrical motion picture, or includes both Supplemental Market rights and other rights, the Producer shall make a reasonable allocation for the purpose of determining payments due hereunder. If
-36-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
the Federation contends that such allocation is not reasonable, then such claim shall be submitted to arbitration.
(2)	Producer’s obligation shall accrue hereunder only after Producer’s gross is received by the Producer. Payments of amounts accruing hereunder shall be made annually on the basis of annual statements, as hereinafter provided. Should any discounts, taxes, duties or charges be imposed in connection with the receipt or remittance of foreign funds, only so much of such funds as remain thereafter shall be included in Producer’s gross. Producer shall not be responsible for loss or diminution of foreign receipts as a result of any matter or thing not reasonably within the control of the Producer. The Federation, the Employers’ Pension Fund or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, and the musicians shall be bound by any arrangements made in good faith by the Producer, or for its account, with respect to the deposit or remittance of foreign revenue. Frozen foreign receipts shall not be considered trust funds and the Producer may freely commingle the same with other funds of the Producer.
A “non-returnable advance” is to be included in “Producer’s gross” when the picture is “available” and “identifiable” and the amount of the advance payment is “ascertainable.”
The picture is “available” when the first of the following occurs:
(A)	The product first may be exhibited or otherwise exploited by a specified method of distribution and in a territory under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement, or
(B)	It first may be sold or rented by a retailer under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement.
The picture is “identifiable” when the Producer first knows or reasonably should have known that a given motion picture is covered by a particular license or distribution agreement for its exploitation in the applicable market.
The amount of the advance payment is “ascertainable” if:
(A)	the advance is for one motion picture, means of exhibition, and territory, or
-37-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
(B)	the total amount of the advance is for more than one motion picture, means of exhibition and/or territory, in which case the Producer shall fairly and reasonably allocate such advance among the licensed motion pictures, exhibition markets and/or territorial markets. As each of these pictures becomes identifiable and available, the allocated portion of the non-returnable advance is to be included in “Producer’s gross” for that quarter. The Producer shall notify the Secondary Markets Fund of its allocation when the report of “Producer’s gross,” which includes the advance, is filed.
If the picture is available in any territory or by any means of exhibition and is identifiable and the amount of the advance is ascertainable, but the
Producer does not provide the Secondary Markets Fund with the information required
by this Agreement and applicable law, then the advance shall be deemed includable in
“Producer’s gross” no
An advance received by a Producer’s parent, subsidiary or any other related or affiliated entity or successor-in-interest, or by any other entity to which the advance payment is directed by the Producer or license or distribution agreement, shall be considered as an advance payment received by the Producer.
(3)	If any license or outright sale of exhibition rights to the motion picture in Supplemental Markets includes as a part thereof any filmed commercial or advertising material, the Producer shall be permitted to allocate a reasonable amount (in accordance with then current standard charges in the industry) to such commercial or advertising material, and the amount so allocated shall not be included in Producer’s gross hereunder.
(4)	The term “participating musician,” as used herein, means a musician who, while in the employ of the Producer (to which employment the provisions of this Agreement apply), participated in the preparation for or the recording of the music sound track for such motion picture or who was photographed in such motion picture as performing on musical instruments or conducting. If payments hereunder are made to the Employers’ Pension Fund, the “pro rata share” credited to each participating musician shall be that proportion of the percentage payment that the total compensation theretofore paid to such musician for his/her said services in the motion picture in an employment capacity bears to the aggregate total compensation theretofore paid to all participating musicians for their services in recording or being photographed in the motion picture in an employment capacity. If payments hereunder are made to the Secondary Markets Fund, there shall be payable
-38-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
to each participating musician that portion of the part of the musicians’ share of the Secondary Markets Fund which is allocable to such motion picture that the total compensation theretofore paid to such musician for his/her said services in the motion picture in an employment capacity bears to the aggregate total compensation theretofore paid to all participating musicians for their services in recording or being photographed in the motion picture in an employment capacity. The term “total compensation,” as used herein, means all monies paid to a participating musician for his/her said services, or his/her heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, as of a time immediately preceding the close of the annual period covered by the Producer’s annual statement involved. The cost of transportation or living expenses paid to or on behalf of musicians shall not be included in “total compensation.”
(5)	When “participating musicians” have been utilized in creating the music sound track for a motion picture which is scored partially in the United States or Canada and partially outside of the United States and Canada, the percentage payment into the Secondary Markets Fund shall be as follows: the payment shall be prorated by multiplying such percentage payment by a fraction whose numerator consists of the total salaries paid to the musicians employed under the terms of this Agreement and the denominator of which consists of the total salaries paid to all musicians employed in connection with the scoring of such motion picture. The foregoing proration formula shall be subject to the following exceptions: (1) in any instance in which the total salaries paid to musicians employed under this Agreement are less than thirty percent (30%) of the total salaries paid to all musicians employed in connection with the scoring of the motion picture, the Producer shall nevertheless be required to pay thirty percent (30%) of the percentage payment due; and (2) in any instance in which the total salaries paid to musicians employed under this Agreement total seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the total salaries paid to all musicians employed in connection with the scoring of the motion picture, then the Producer shall be required to make a contribution to the Secondary Markets Fund equal to what the contribution would have been if one hundred percent (100%) of the scoring had taken place in the United States or Canada. The Producer shall provide to the auditors the information necessary to determine the correct pro rata payment. The Producer will identify a motion picture as subject to this subparagraph (5) at the time of the first payment to the Fund for that motion picture.
(6)	Such payments made hereunder to the Employers’ Pension Fund are not and shall not in any manner be construed to be
The foregoing provisions of this subparagraph (5) are without prejudice to the respective positions of the parties as to the meaning of Article 3 (“Scoring in the United States and Canada”) of this Agreement,

(7)	The Administrator of the Secondary Markets Fund shall make all deductions and withholdings required by law and shall timely make all such reports and payments to governmental agencies as may be required by law.
(8)	Producer will furnish to the Federation and the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, written reports showing the Producer’s gross received from the sale, lease, license and distribution (whether by Producer or a distributor) of each such motion picture in the supplemental markets. If payments hereunder are to the Employers’ Pension Fund, such reports shall be furnished annually for each fiscal year of the Producer. If payments hereunder are to the Secondary Markets Fund, then such reports shall be furnished on a quarterly basis for each calendar year. Concurrently with the furnishing of each such report, the Producer will make the payments shown to be due by such report. All payments shall be made by check payable to the order of and delivered to the Employers’ Pension Fund, or to the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be. Each such report shall designate, when known, the title, the production number (if available) and, when applicable, the episode number of the motion picture involved, the name of the production entity (if available), the distributor’s name, the distributor’s disbursing agent (if applicable), the period covered by the payment and, if receipts from release of the picture to free television are included, a breakdown of gross receipts attributable to Supplemental Markets and those attributable to free television release. On request, the Producer shall make available to the Federation or the Administrator of the Secondary Markets Fund all accounting statements delivered by a distributor to the Producer, but only insofar as such statements relate to the Producer’s gross. The Federation or the Administrator of the Secondary Markets Fund shall have the right, at reasonable times, to examine the books and records of Producer insofar as they relate to the Producer’s gross. Producer shall not be required to furnish any report hereunder with respect to the motion picture prior to Producer’s receipt of any Producer’s gross with respect to the motion picture, or for any reporting period during which no Producer’s gross from the motion picture is received by the Producer.
(9)	A Payroll Company that is a party signatory to this Agreement may grant the use of its signatory status on a picture-by-picture basis to any Producer not a party signatory provided that no session shall be allowed unless an executed Assumption Agreement in the following form has been provided to the

“Buyer shall be liable to make the payments described above but only based upon rights actually acquired by Buyer and only for the period it holds such rights.
“The undersigned agrees to keep or have access to complete records showing the income derived from the distribution of such motion pictures in Supplemental Markets within the entire territory for which Buyer is granted such rights and the Federation and/or the Secondary Markets Fund Administrator shall have the right at all reasonable times to inspect such records. The undersigned shall give the Federation prompt written notice of the date on which each photoplay covered hereby is first telecast in Supplemental Markets. An inadvertent failure to comply with said requirement of notice shall not constitute a default by the undersigned hereunder, provided such default is cured promptly after notice thereof from the Federation.
“Buyer further agrees that in the event of a sale, transfer, license or assignment of the Supplemental Markets distribution rights to the above-referenced motion picture, Buyer shall obtain from the purchaser, transferee, licensee or assignee an Assumption Agreement covering the rights disposed of in the form set forth herein and shall provide an executed copy of such Assumption Agreement to the Federation. Upon delivery of such Assumption Agreement, Buyer shall not be further liable to the Federation or the Secondary Markets Fund for the keeping of any such records related to or the payments required based upon the rights covered under the Assumption Agreement for the exhibition of the motion picture in Supplemental Markets and both the Federation and the Secondary Markets Fund agree to look exclusively to the purchaser, transferee, licensee or assignee executing such Assumption Agreement for the keeping of such books or records and for making the payments attributable to the rights acquired. In the event Buyer fails to deliver such Assumption Agreement, it shall continue to be liable for the keeping of records and for the payments required for the exhibition of the motion picture in Supplemental Markets.”
It is understood that additional provisions may be included in form Assumption Agreements, so long as such additional provision(s) do not vary or alter the terms of the foregoing Assumption Agreement.

assignee or distributor, and to deliver to the Federation an executed copy of each assumption agreement entered into by the Producer, An inadvertent failure on the part of the Producer to comply with any of the provisions of this subparagraph (10) shall in no event constitute a default by the Producer hereunder or a breach of this agreement, provided that such failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from the Federation.
Upon delivery of such Assumption Agreement, Producer, or any subsequent owner obtaining the execution of such assumption agreement, shall not be further liable to the Federation for the keeping of any such records or the payment required hereunder insofar as they relate to the exhibition of the motion picture in Supplemental Markets, and the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, agrees to look exclusively to the party last executing such an assumption agreement for the keeping of such records, payments and compliance with credit obligations.
(11)	With respect to such motion picture, Producer agrees either to:
(i)	include in any chattel mortgage, pledge or other lien or security agreement covering the motion picture a provision made expressly for the benefit of the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, to the effect that the chattel mortgagee, pledgee or lien or security holder agrees that if such mortgage, pledge, lien or security agreement is foreclosed, and such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder thereby obtains title to the motion picture and subsequently exhibits the motion picture in Supplemental Markets, then, in such event, after such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder has recouped its loan so secured, plus interest and all costs and expenses incident to foreclosure, such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder will be bound by the provisions of this Article 16 with respect to payments to the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, thereafter becoming due and payable thereunder; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall prevent such mortgagee, pledgee or lien or security holder who has acquired title to the photoplay from thereafter making a sale of the motion picture to a third party free and clear of any limitations or obligations whatsoever. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (i), the rights of the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, hereunder shall be subordinate to the rights of such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder; or
(ii)	in the alternative, be bound by the provisions of this Article 16 with respect to payments to the Employers’ Pension

BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, if any, due after such foreclosure shall have been made. In the event Producer elects this alternative, the provisions of subsection (i) above shall be inapplicable, and if the provisions of subsection (i) above are not included in any such chattel mortgage, pledge, lien or security agreement, Producer shall be deemed to have elected the alternative provided for in this subsection (ii).
In the event of a foreclosure referred to in subsection (i) above, should the Producer distribute the motion picture for such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder, Producer shall be bound during the period of such distribution by the provisions of this Article 16 with respect to payments due hereunder, to the same extent as the mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder under subsection (i) above. Any such payments made by the Producer as the distributor shall be credited against any obligation of the mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder that may be due or become due to the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, under subsection (i) above, it being understood that the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, shall be entitled to such payments but once.
The foregoing provisions of this subparagraph (11) shall not apply to any photoplay subject to any security instrument in existence on the effective date of this agreement.
(12)	If, after the effective date of this Agreement, the Producer enters into a contract with a so-called "independent producer” for the production and financing of a theatrical motion picture and the distribution thereof by the Producer (such contract being hereinafter referred to as an “independent contract”), Producer will include in such independent contract an agreement on the part of the independent producer, expressly for the benefit of the Employers’ Pension Fund, or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, that the independent producer will pay, in the manner herein provided, the amounts, if any, required to be paid under the provisions of this Article 16 with respect to such motion picture. If such agreement on the part of the independent producer be not included in any independent contract prior to the exhibition of the motion picture in Supplemental Markets, the Producer shall be liable and responsible for the payments, if any, required to be made under the provisions of this Article 16 with respect to such motion picture. If such agreement on the part of the independent producer is included in the independent contract prior to exhibition of the motion picture in Supplemental Markets, then the Producer shall not be liable or responsible in any manner or to any extent with respect to the motion picture under

Such reports shall be provided within a reasonable time period following the scoring session.
(16)	Producer agrees that prior to the employment of any musician in a motion picture intended primarily for exhibition on “basic cable” (as that term is used and understood in the motion picture industry), Producer will give at least sixty (60) days advance notice to the Federation of such proposed employment. Producer and the Federation agree to meet within thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice for the purpose of negotiating with respect to the terms and conditions for such employment.

(17)	The parties agree to meet and negotiate in good faith to establish terms and conditions of employment for musicians hired to work on programs made primarily for the home video markets.

If an agreement is reached, wages agreed upon shall be retroactive to the commencement of this agreement. With respect to production of variety programs, the so-called “needle drop” provisions in the then-current Television Videotape Agreement shall be incorporated herein.
(18)	If a program that is made primarily for the home video market, other than a variety show, is subsequently exhibited on free television, Producer agrees to make additional payments pursuant to Article 15 of the Theatrical Motion Picture Agreement.
(19)	If a program that is made primarily for the home video market is subsequently exhibited in the theatrical or foreign markets, Producer agrees to make such additional payments as provided in Paragraph 15(b)(l 7) of the Television Film Agreement.

(a)	Contributions shall be made to the Trustees of the American Federation of Musicians and Employers’ Pension Welfare Fund, created pursuant to the trust indenture dated October 2, 1959 (herein referred to as the “Employers’ Pension Fund”) in a sum equal to ten percent (10%) of all wages earned under this Agreement, computed at scale. Checks shall be made payable to the order of the “American Federation of Musicians and Employers’ Pension Fund,” and sent to P.O. Box 19155, Newark, NJ 07195-0155 (or to the local union to be forwarded to the Pension Fund, if the local union and Producer have so agreed). In lieu of making contributions to the Employers’ Pension Fund as provided above, such contributions with respect to musicians hired hereunder in Canada based on wages earned under this Agreement for services performed in Canada shall be made to the Trustees of the American Federation of Musicians and Employers’ Pension and Welfare Fund (Canada), created pursuant to Agreement and Declaration of Trust dated April 9, 1962, at 2255 Sheppard Avenue East, Suite A-l 10, North York, Ontario, Canada M2 J 4Y1.

(b)	Said trust indenture provides for pensions for persons on the basis of whose services contributions are made to such Fund and provides for administration by an equal number of employer and employee representatives with provisions for the appointment of an impartial umpire, and provides further for a pension plan, which plan and trust have been qualified under the Federal Internal Revenue Code and which shall comply with all applicable laws.

(d)	The Employer shall submit such reports in such form as the Trustees may reasonably require and the Employer’s records shall be subject to such reasonable audit by the Trustees as the Trustees may require.
During the course of bargaining, the Federation expressed concerns that the contribution report forms presently being utilized by signatory Producers may not contain all of the relevant information necessary to enable proper identification and/or effective auditing of Pension Fund contributions. After considering these concerns, the parties jointly recommend to the Trustees of the American Federation of Musicians’ and Employers’ Pension Fund that appropriate steps be taken to assure that contributing Employers provide the Pension Fund with sufficient information for the proper administration of the Fund.
(e)	The Federation and said Trustees, or either of them, may enforce the provisions contained in this clause.
4.	HEALTH PLAN
The parties hereto are parties to and bound by the provisions of the “Agreement and Declaration of Trust Establishing the I.A.T.S.E.-Basic Crafts-Guilds-Hollywood Producers-Health and Welfare Fund for the Employees of the Motion Picture and Allied Industries,” dated as of October 20, 1952 (hereinafter referred to as the “Health Plan”), with respect to the musicians’ classifications of this agreement.
In accordance with Article V, Sections 1 and 2 of such Health Plan, the rate of contribution to the Health Plan by Producer for each such employee employed by it hereunder shall be as follows:
During the term of this Agreement, Producer shall pay into the Plan one dollar, five and eight-tenths cents ($1,058) until August 3, 2003 (one dollar, twenty-five and eight-tenths cents ($1,258) effective August 3, 2003) for each hour guaranteed a musician by Producer or each hour worked by a musician for Producer on or after February 16, 2002 under the terms of this Agreement, including “straight time” and “overtime” hours on any day worked. Should subsequent increases be negotiated by the I.A.T.S.E. during the term of this Agreement, the same will apply. Minimum calls shall constitute time worked. Weekly schedules shall be considered as a minimum of forty-three and two-tenths (43.2) hours for a full workweek. With respect only to recording and rehearsal musicians employed for less than twelve (12) hours on a daily basis, whether for a single or double
-52-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
session, the contributions to the Fund shall be based on minimum credit of twelve (12) hours for any such day at the rate of one dollar, five and eighttenths cents ($1,058) until August 3, 2003 (one dollar, twenty-five and eighttenths cents ($1,258) effective August 3, 2003).
Contributions for musicians employed by Producer at a page rate shall be computed on the basis of one and one-half hours for each $18.55 effective February 17, 2002 ($19.01 effective February 16, 2003; and $19.68 effective February 15, 2004) earned with Producer at a page rate as a copyist; for each $29.66 effective February 17, 2002 ($30.40 effective February 16, 2003; and $31.46 effective Februaiy 15, 2004) earned with Producer at a page rate as an orchestrator or arranger.
For a dental plan, the Producer shall pay into the Health Plan an additional eighteen and seven-tenths cents (18.70) per hour contribution.
For a vision care plan, the Producer shall pay into the Health Plan a five cents (50) per hour contribution.
The above contributions are in accordance with the present pattern of contributions by Employers required under the Health Plan. In the event this present pattern of contributions under the Health Plan should be changed during the term of this Agreement, then the rate of contributions as provided herein shall automatically be changed to conform to such new pattern and rate of Employer’s contribution established under such Health Plan.
The parties recognize that a problem exists in the present formula for determining the basis of credited hours for Health Plan contributions for recording musicians, production musicians and musicians employed on a page rate. Therefore, the parties agree to immediately undertake a joint study to evaluate the problems and to recommend changes in the method of determining credited hours which will not result in any increase in the total hours for all musicians. If, during the term of this Agreement, the parties agree upon a change in the current method of contributions, this Agreement shall be amended to reflect such changes.
With respect to the employment of musicians outside of Los Angeles County, California for which such payments into such Health Plan are not permissible under the provisions of such Health Plan, Producer, in lieu thereof, will pay to the applicable local health plan, if any, and if permissible under an acceptable Letter of Adherence satisfactory to the Producer, the normal contribution for the appropriate category provided for under such local health plan
-53-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005

7.	SUBCONTRACTING
In the event Producer subcontracts out any work that would otherwise be subject to this Agreement, Producer shall have the option either: (i) to obtain from the subcontractor an agreement to comply with the minimum compensation provisions in this Agreement, and cause such subcontractor to comply with such provisions; or (ii) in the alternative, Producer shall make such payments.
8.	VACATION PAY

(j)	For vacations earned during the preceding year, Producer shall pay an eligible employee his/her vacation pay check not later than noon of the payday preceding the commencement day of his/her vacation, provided the employee has made a request to Producer for such vacation check at least one (1) week prior to such payday preceding the commencement of such vacation.

If payment is not thereafter made within fifteen (15) business days after Producer received such further written notice, an additional late payment charge of ten percent (10%) of the initial amount due the musician shall accrue for each additional thirty (30) day period in which payment is not made, and the first such thirty (30) day period shall commence on the date such further written notice is received.
(b)	The foregoing late payment charges shall not be required when Producer’s failure or delay in paying results from:
(1)	The employee’s failure or delay in furnishing a W-4 form; or
(2)	The musician’s failure to furnish appropriate documentation to enable the Producer to complete the 1-9 form (provided that a musician’s failure to provide such documentation shall not excuse late payment to any other musician engaged for the same session);
(3)	The musician’s failure to provide the Producer with the correct address to which payment should be sent. (If a payment is returned to the Producer, the Producer will contact the Local to ascertain the musician’s correct address and, thereafter, the payment will be forwarded to such address);

-65-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
Fourth double - twenty percent (20%) of basic rate extra.
The first instrument played in a single or double session, as the case may be, determines the basic instrument for that session and any overtime period to such session.
(iii)	Computation of Doubling
(A)	A musician who is required to double within the meaning of this Agreement within a day’s call shall be paid “doubling” for not less than one (1) three (3) hour session.
For example: A musician is called in for a double session of six (6) hours. In the first three (3) hours, he/she plays only a saxophone. In the second three (3) hours, he/she plays only a flute. He/she would be entitled to the basic rate for the first three (3) hours and one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for the second three (3) hours.
If, in such session, he/she played the saxophone for the first hour and the flute for the second and third hours and the saxophone for the fourth, fifth and sixth hours, he/she would be entitled to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for the first three (3) hours, and the basic rate for the last three (3) hours.
In computing the compensation for doubling, all time from the start of the recording engagement shall be considered in three (3) hour sessions regardless of the unequal division of a double session.
For example: If the Musician plays saxophone for the first and second hours and, after the break following the second hour, plays the flute for the third hour and the saxophone again for the fourth, fifth and sixth hours, he/she would be entitled to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for the first three (3) hours and the basic rate for the last three (3) hours.
In a double session, during which one or more doubles occurs in the first three (3) hours and the Musician commences the fourth hour with a doubling instrument, such doubling instrument shall be considered as the first double for the second three (3) hour period.
For example: A Musician plays the saxophone for the first hour, the flute for the second hour and the oboe in the third, fourth, fifth
-66-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
and sixth hours. He/she would be entitled to one hundred seventy percent (170%) of the basic rate for the first three (3) hours and one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for the last three (3) hours.
(B)	Overtime
If a double is begun in a three (3) hour session and such double is continued in an overtime period, the doubling rate shall apply for the three (3) hour session plus the overtime period.
For example: If a Musician plays a saxophone for the first and second hours and plays the flute for the third and fourth hours, he/she would be entitled to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for four (4) hours. If he/she played the saxophone for the first hour, the flute for the second hour and the oboe for the third and fourth hours, he/she would be paid one hundred seventy percent (170%) of the basic rate for the first three (3) hours and one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for the fourth hour.
For example: A Musician plays the saxophone for the first, second and third hours, and the flute for the fourth, fifth and sixth hours as well as the seventh hour, he/she would be entitled to the basic rate for the first three (3) hours and one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for the last four (4) hours.
For example: A Musician plays the saxophone for the first hour, the flute for the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh hours, he/she would be entitled to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for the seven (7) hours.
For example: A Musician plays the saxophone for the first three (3) hours, the flute for the fourth and fifth hours, and the saxophone for the sixth and seventh hours. He/she would be entitled to the basic rate for the first three (3) hours, one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for the second three (3) hours, and the basic rate for the overtime period.
If a double is commenced in an overtime period, he/she shall be paid a minimum of three (3) hours at the doubling rate.
For example: A Musician plays the saxophone for a three (3) hour session. He/she plays the flute for the fourth hour. He/she would
-67-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
be entitled to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for three (3) hours and the basic rate for one (I) hour.
(C)	The first “double” rate of fifty percent (50%) of basic rate extra may only be paid when the basic rate is in effect. The second “double” rate of twenty percent (20%) of the basic rate extra shall only apply when the first doubling rate is in effect at the same time. The third “double” rate of twenty percent (20%) of the basic rate extra shall apply only when the second doubling rate is in effect at the same time; and the fourth “double” rate of twenty percent (20%) of the basic rate extra shall only apply when the third doubling rate is in effect at the same time.
For example: In a three (3) hour session, a Musician plays the saxophone for the first hour, plays the flute for the second hour and the oboe for the third hour. He/she would have two (2) doubles and would be entitled to one hundred seventy percent (170%) of the basic rate for the three (3) hours. If, in addition, he/she played the clarinet in the third hour, he/she would have three (3) doubles and would be entitled to one hundred ninety percent (190%) of the basic rate for the three (3) hours. If, in addition, he/she played not only the clarinet but also the bassoon, he/she would have four (4) doubles and be entitled to two hundred ten percent (210%) of the basic rate for the three (3) hours.
(iv)	Any Musician who shall be required to transpose to avoid the use of an additional “doubling” instrument shall be considered as having doubled and shall be paid accordingly.
(3)	On Location
Engagements on location over twenty-five (25) miles but not more than one hundred (100) miles from point (inside jurisdiction) ordered to report, $37.64 ($38.58 effective February 16, 2003; and $39.93 effective February 15, 2004) per hour extra for time consumed in traveling to and from location. When such engagements are over one hundred (100) miles from point (inside jurisdiction) ordered to report, they shall be arranged through the Federation Representatives.

When any member or members are dismissed for the day while the balance of the orchestra is still in session, they shall immediately be given adequate time to pack up and leave, or they shall be paid for any period they are required to wait, subject to a ten (10) minute leeway.
(8)	Single Sessions, Guaranteed Longer Calls and Double Sessions
(i)	The Producer may hold the musician for one (1) hour beyond a single session or a guaranteed longer call. If musician is so held, or if work is performed in such hold hour, it shall be paid for at the straight time rate in units of fifteen (15) minutes. If the musician is required to remain beyond the one (1) hold hour, he/she shall be paid for such time beyond such hour at one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the straight time rate in fifteen (15) minute units, except that work beyond
-69-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT

the one (1) hold hour which occurs between midnight and 8:00 a.m. shall be paid at one hundred sixty-five percent (165%) of the straight time rate in fifteen (15) minute units. Provided, however, that in the event that a guaranteed call exceeds five (5) hours (but is less than a double session), the guaranteed call and the hold period combined shall not exceed six (6) hours.

If the musicians have given the appropriate advance notice, the Producer or his/her agent shall be responsible for securing additional musicians, if necessary.
(iii)	A double session shall be completed within eight (8) hours. Work hours beyond six (6) hours within an eight (8) hour period will be paid at one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the straight time rate in fifteen (15) minute units.

(iv)	Two single sessions shall not be called in the same day in lieu of a double session in order to circumvent the time spread penalty, when both of such single sessions are for the same motion picture, utilizing the same conductor, and both utilize all of the same individual musicians.
(v)	Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement, there shall be no compounding in computing the above and payment will be made on the highest appropriate rate.
(9)	Leader - Double Recording Musician’s Rate
When only one recording musician is called for a session, he/she shall be paid double the Recording Musician’s rate to perform alone.

(12)	Cartage
Whenever the Producer requests a musician to bring a heavy instrument to a recording session, the Producer shall specify whether the musician shall transport such heavy instrument either by public or private transportation, and public transportation shall be used if it is the only practicable manner of transportation. If a public carrier is to be used, the Producer shall have the option of designating the public carrier qualified to transport musical instruments. If the instrument is delivered by the designated public carrier, the Producer shall pay the cartage bill of the designated public carrier. If the musician chooses to use a carrier other than that designated by the Producer, the Producer shall not be liable for a cartage bill greater than the rate charged by the designated carrier.

As used in this provision, the term “year” shall mean the employee’s personal income tax earnings year (also hereinafter referred to as “tax year”); the term “eligible year” shall mean a tax year in which the employee worked one hundred (100) or more “straight time” days for Producer.
Any tax year in which the employee actually works less than one hundred (100) “straight time” days for Producer shall be excluded in computing
-93-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
the required twelve (12) “eligible” tax years, and the “straight time” days worked in such year shall not be counted in computing the required aggregate 2,400 “straight time” days to be worked in such twelve (12) tax years.
Employees who fail to work more than one hundred (100) “straight time” days for such employer in each of any two consecutive tax years shall, at the end of such second year, be considered a new employee hereunder with no previous employment credit with Producer, for the purpose of establishing the above eligibility requirements.

(1)	The period of recorded leaves of absence granted by Producer;
(2)	For the period during which the employee was absent and physically unable to work for Producer solely as a result of an “industrial accident” occurring to such employee while employed by Producer.
(b)	Vacation Days and Pay
Commencing with November 1, 1960, such employees who become eligible on or after such date, as above provided, shall, beginning with the date they so become eligible, earn with Producer fifty percent (50%) more in vacation time and money, based upon the applicable Weekly or Daily employee vacation schedule set forth above; any such employee shall be limited to earning a maximum of only fifteen (15) days vacation per year.

(c)	Loss of Eligibility
Employees who become eligible, as above provided, but who thereafter either resign from employment with Producer or fail to work for Producer more than one hundred fifty (150) “straight time” days in any one tax year shall, as of the last day of such tax year, or in the case of resignation, the date of such

resignation, lose such eligibility and right to earn the additional vacation days and pay above provided; in such event, they shall thereupon be considered new employees hereunder with no previous employment credit with Producer for the purpose of subsequently establishing the above eligibility requirements.
In determining whether any employee loses his eligibility for failure to work for Producer more than one hundred fifty (150) “straight time” days in a tax year, as above provided, no such year shall be counted for this purpose in which the employee could not work at least one hundred fifty-one (151) “straight time” days for Producer due to either or both of the following:
(1)	The period of recorded leaves of absence granted such employee by Producer;
(2)	The period during which such employee was absent and physically unable to work for Producer solely as a result of an “industrial accident” occurring to him/her while employed by Producer.

fully set forth herein, Articles 15 and 16 of the Basic Theatrical Agreement and Article 14 of the Basic Television Agreement (the “Operative Articles”).
(b)	Subject to Paragraph 2(c) hereof, each Producer shall make payments to the Administrator called for in the Operative Articles.
(c)	Each Producer, on or before sixty (60) days after the end of the calendar quarter, will pay to the Administrator such portion of the aforesaid payments as may have accrued pursuant to the terms of the Operative Articles during the preceding calendar quarter. Each payment hereunder shall be accompanied by reports required by the Operative Articles. A Producer who is delinquent in any payment hereunder for more than sixty (60) days after written notice from the Secondary & Markets Fund shall pay both the amount due and liquidated damages in the amount of ten percent (10%) per annum (.833% per month), calculated from the date of delinquency.
The foregoing provision shall not apply in the following circumstances:
(i)	for residuals payable in connection with the purchase of libraries. The Producer shall give notice to the Secondary Markets Fund in such cases. The Producers shall assist the Secondary Markets Fund in its endeavor to obtain compliance with any residual obligations which accrued prior to that date of the purchase. The Secondary Markets Fund shall cooperate with the Producer in furnishing records or verifying previous payments to enable the Producer to begin making residual payments accruing on and after the date of the purchase as expeditiously as possible.

(ii)	in the case of underpayments caused by the omission of one (1) or more musicians from the B Form or OMR;
(iii)	in the event of a bona fide dispute between the Producer and the Federation and/or the Secondary Markets Fund as to whether, or the extent to which, payments are owed to the Secondary Markets Fund. In such event, there will be no late payment charges during the pendency of the dispute provided that the Producer pays the undisputed amount on time.
(d)	All payments and supporting documentation and any other communications from each Producer to the Administrator shall be sent to the Administrator at its office at 12001 Ventura Place, 5th Floor, Studio City, CA 91604.
2.	(a) The Administrator accepts the duties hereby assigned to it and
shall establish the proper administrative machinery and processes necessary for the performance of its duties hereunder.
The Administrator each year shall, as soon as practicable after the end of the Secondary Markets Fund’s fiscal year (March 31st) distribute the musicians’ share of the Secondary Markets Fund (as defined in the Operative Articles). Each participating musician shall receive such amounts as are designated as payable to him/her in the Operative Articles and, in determining said amount, the Administrator shall determine that part of the musicians’ share of the Secondary Markets Fund allocable to each theatrical motion picture covered by the Operative Articles.
In the event of the death of a musician entitled to a distributive share hereunder, the Administrator shall distribute such share to the beneficiary designated by such musician on a form provided by the Administrator for such purpose or, if no such beneficiary be so designated, then to the surviving spouse of such musician; or if there be no such person, to the musician’s estate.
(b)	The Producers, individually and collectively, hereby irrevocably designate the Administrator as their agent to pay from the Producers’ share of the Secondary Markets Fund any Social Security tax, federal and/or state unemployment insurance tax, other employment taxes, disability insurance premiums, and/or worker’s compensation premiums, which may be owing by the

BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15,2005
Producer individually and/or collectively, as employer or employers, with respect to the distribution of the musicians’ share of the Secondary Markets Fund.
(c)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Administrator shall refund to each Producer that part of the Producer’s payment to the Secondary Markets Fund representing a part or all of said Producer’s portion of the total employer taxes and insurance premiums which may be payable under the Operative Articles and this Agreement with respect to the distribution of the musicians’ share of the Secondary Markets Fund, which the Producer, at the time it makes its annual payment to the Secondary Markets Fund, may request be refunded to it, or which must be paid by the Producer, and not the Secondary Markets Fund, to the relevant government agency or authority pursuant to any law, rule, regulation, ruling or other communication of any government agency or authority. Any such refund, and all reports, returns, information or other material, completed in proper form for reporting or filing, which is necessary for payment, and reporting or filing with respect thereto, of any such employer taxes or insurance premiums to the relevant government agency or authority by each Producer shall be transmitted to each Producer by the Administrator so as to enable the Producer to timely, accurately and completely make such payments and reports or filings. If a refund is made to a Producer under this Paragraph 2(c), the Administrator shall not be responsible for payment of said Producer’s employer taxes or insurance premiums payable under the Operative Articles and this Agreement with regard to the distribution of the musicians’ share of the Secondary Markets Fund with respect to which the refund is made. Should any government agency or authority require information, returns, reports or other material in regard to employer taxes or insurance premiums payable with respect to any distribution of the musicians’ share of the Secondary Markets Fund to be filed or reported by any Producer, rather than the Secondary Markets Fund, (even though payment of such employer taxes or insurance premiums is made by the Secondary Markets Fund), or should any Producer request that it, rather than the Secondary Markets Fund, file or report such information, returns, reports or other material, the Administrator shall transmit to the Producer all such reports, returns, information or other material, completed in proper form for reporting or filing, so as to enable the Producer to make such filing or reporting timely, completely and accurately.
For purposes of this Paragraph 2(c), the term “Producer” shall include any party which has undertaken, pursuant to the Operative Articles, a Producer’s obligation to make payments to the Secondary Markets Fund and any
EXHIBIT “A”
- 106-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
other party which has acted as agent on behalf of a Producer with respect to payment to the Secondary Markets Fund.
(d)	The Federation has agreed to furnish to the Administrator, and to cause its local unions to furnish to the Administrator, all data in the possession or subject to the control thereof which is necessary and proper to assist in the orderly and accurate distribution to musicians as provided herein, and to request the Trustees of the American Federation of Musicians and Employers Pension Fund to do likewise upon reimbursement of all costs reasonably incurred thereby in so doing.
(e)	The Administrator shall indemnify and hold the Producers
harmless out of the Secondary Markets Fund against any liability for making any of the payments to the musicians under Paragraph 2(a) hereof or any payments of employment taxes and insurance premiums which may be required to be made by the Administrator under Paragraph 2(c) hereof, it being the express intent of the parties that all such payments are to be made out of the Secondary Markets Fund with no further cost or expense of any kind whatsoever to the Producers. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Administrator also shall furnish a surety bond with a responsible surety company satisfactory to the Producers and to the Federation, to guarantee the full and faithful performance of its duties as herein described.
(f)	In making distribution to musicians hereunder, the Administrator shall clearly and legibly display the following legend on all checks, vouchers, letters or documents of transmittal: “This is a special payment to you by the Motion Picture and Television Producers who are operating under the AFM Basic Theatrical Motion Picture Agreement, as amended, negotiated by the American Federation of Musicians,” and/or “This is a special payment to you by the Motion Picture and Television Producers who are operating under the AFM Basic Television Motion Picture Agreement negotiated by the American Federation of Musicians.”
(g)	If a musician for whom a distributive share has been set apart
cannot be found or if payment under this Agreement has been tendered but is not completed after efforts which the Administrator deems reasonable, the Administrator shall add such share (“unclaimed share”) to a reserve account and hold the same pending receipt of claim until the end of the third fiscal year after the date on which such share was first payable. Thereafter, the unclaimed share shall be redeposited in the musicians’ share of the Secondary Markets Fund as defined
EXHIBIT “A
- 107-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
in the Operative Articles for distribution as provided in Paragraph 2(a). If, subsequent to the redeposit of such unclaimed share, the musician asserts a valid claim with respect to such unclaimed amount, the Administrator shall pay such claim (“Past-Year’s Claim”) and such payment shall be deemed an expense of the Secondary Markets Fund.
(h)	Any payments otherwise due to musicians which shall be less
than ten dollars ($10.00) shall be regarded as “de minimis” (“de minimis amounts”) and shall be added to a reserve account. Provided that, when the de minimis amount(s) so deposited to a musician’s credit, when added to any current distribution due such musician, equals or exceeds the sum of ten dollars ($10.00), said de minimis amount(s) shall be added to such current distribution and paid to such musician.
3.	(a) In the event that any Producer shall default in the payment of
any sums to the Administrator when the same shall become due pursuant to this Agreement, the Administrator shall have the duty, right and power forthwith to commence action or to take any other proceedings as shall be necessary for the collection thereof, including the power and authority to compromise and settle with the Federation’s consent. The Administrator’s reasonable expenses, attorneys’ fees and other disbursements incurred in the collection of any overdue sums shall be paid to the Administrator by the Producers so defaulting and such payment shall be added to the Secondary Markets Fund.
(b)	Nothing contained herein shall create any cause of action in
favor of any musician as defined in the Basic Theatrical Agreement or in the Basic Television Agreement against any Producer but the Federation may enforce distribution of the musicians’ share of the Secondary Markets Fund on behalf of the individual musicians.
(c)	The Administrator shall deposit all money and property
received by it, with or without interest, with any bank or trust company, insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and having capital, surplus and undivided profits exceeding Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000); provided, however, that in the event that Canadian dollars are receivable by the Administrator and it is not feasible or desirable to convert such Canadian dollars into United States funds, such Canadian funds and any securities purchased therewith may be deposited in the Chartered Bank of the Dominion of Canada, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. Except as modified by the provisions of Paragraph 3(d) hereof, the Administrator shall have
EXHIBIT “A”
- 108-
BASIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
the right and power to invest and reinvest the said money and property only in short term investments (not to exceed one year in duration), in bonds and other direct obligations of the United States of America and of the Dominion of Canada, high grade commercial paper, insured bank certificates of deposit, and commingled investment funds managed by banks or trust companies for which the Administrator or some other party may be engaged as investment manager for a reasonable fee. Such investments may be made without regard to the proportion which any such investment or investments may bear to the entire amount of the Secondary Markets Fund and to sell, exchange and otherwise deal with such investments as to the Administrator may seem desirable.
(d)	In connection with the collection of any sums due to it hereunder, the Administrator may consent to and participate in any composition of creditors, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceedings, and in the event that as a result thereof the Administrator shall become the holder of assets other than money, obligations to pay money conditioned only as to the time of payment, or property of the class specified in Paragraph 3(c) hereof (which assets are in this subsection (d) called “property”), the Administrator may consent to and participate in any plan of reorganization, consolidation, merger, combination, or other similar plan, and consent to any contract, lease, mortgage, purchase, sale or other action by any corporation pursuant to such plan and accept any property which might be received by the Administrator under any such plan, whether or not such property is of the class in which the Administrator, by Paragraph 3(c) hereof, is authorized to invest the Secondary Markets Fund; the Administrator may deposit any such property with any protective, reorganization or similar committee, delegate discretionary power thereto, and pay part of its expenses and compensation and any assessment levied with respect to such property; the Administrator may exercise all conversion, subscription, voting and other rights of whatsoever nature pertaining to any such property, and grant proxies, discretionary or otherwise, in respect thereof and accept any property which may be acquired by the Administrator by the exercise of any such rights, whether or not such property is of the class in which the Administrator, by Paragraph 3(c) hereof, is authorized to invest the Secondary Markets Fund. Anything to the contrary contained in this Paragraph 3(d) notwithstanding, the Administrator shall reasonably endeavor to dispose of any such property in order that the Secondary Markets Fund, to the fullest extent possible, at all times shall be comprised as specified in Paragraph 3(c) hereof.

(e)	Parties dealing with the Administrator shall not be required to look to the application of any monies paid to the Administrator.
(f)	Provided that the Administrator exercises due diligence and the
highest standard of professional conduct in performing duties for the Secondary Markets Fund, the Administrator will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from anything done or omitted in good faith, nor shall the Administrator be subject to any personal liability for monies received and expended in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In addition to the surety bond required by Paragraph 2.(e) above, the Secondary Markets Fund will secure any insurance coverage which may be necessary or advisable by virtue of this subparagraph (f).

twelve month period from April 1 to the next March 31. Within ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year, the Administrator shall furnish a statement for such fiscal year of its operations to each Producer hereto making payments to the Administrator and to the Federation. Such statements shall set forth in detail the properties and monies on hand and the operations of the Administrator during the immediately preceding fiscal year, including without limiting the details of any compromise or settlement made by the Administrator with any Producer, and such other information and data as shall be appropriate to inform fully the recipients of such statements and shall be certified by an independent certified public accountant.
(h)	The Administrator, at all times without limitation to the
duration of this Agreement, shall keep full and accurate records and accounts concerning all transactions involving the receipt and expenditure of monies hereunder and the investment and reinvestment thereof, all in convenient form and pursuant to approved and recognized accounting practices. Each Producer and the Federation shall have the right from time to time, without limitation to the duration of this Agreement, and at all reasonable times during business hours, to have their respective duly authorized agents examine and audit the Administrator’s records and accounts for the purpose of verifying any statements and payments made by the Administrator pursuant to this Agreement, during a period not exceeding two (2) years preceding such examination. The Administrator shall afford all necessary facilities to such authorized agents to make such examination and audit and to make extracts and excerpts from said records and accounts as may be necessary or proper according to approved and recognized accounting practices.

Confidential materials so provided shall not be copied and shall be returned to the Secondary Markets Fund when any issues pertaining to such materials have been resolved.
The Committee will meet at periodic intervals at least annually. The Secondary Markets Fund shall pay for all reasonable expenses incurred by the Committee members and the AFM liaison(s) in carrying out the Committee’s activities.
The Committee members and the AFM liaison(s) will be covered by any necessary or advisable liability insurance policy, which will be paid for by the Secondary Markets Fund.
(b) The AMPTP will have the right to replace any Producer representative(s) on the Committee by written notice to the Administrator and to the President of the AFM, and the AFM President will have the right to replace any AFM liaison(s) to the Committee by written notice to the Administrator and to the President of the AMPTP.
5.	(a) The annual budget for the costs associated with the operation of
the Secondary Markets Fund, including the compensation of the Administrator, shall be approved by the Committee after consultation with the AFM liaison(s). Such approval may be withheld only if the Committee reasonably determines that

Any issues as to whether information should be disclosed to such Producer representative pursuant to this subparagraph 5(b)(iii) shall be submitted to an AMPTP representative for review and advice.
6.	(a) The Administrator shall be subject to removal by the Committee
after consultation with the AFM liaison(s). The Administrator may resign at any time by thirty (30) days written notice to the Producers and the Federation.

Dear Steve:
The purpose of this letter is to confirm the agreement reached between the parties during the course of the Joint Industry-Federation Cooperative Committee meetings held April 21-22, 1992 and August 18-19, 1993. The parties have agreed that Article 8C.( 1) of the Basic Theatrical Motion Picture Agreement and Article 8C.(1) of the Television Film Agreement shall be interpreted and applied as follows:
If a Producer elects to compensate musicians who rendered services with respect to any sound track record released in connection with any theatrical motion picture and/or television film pursuant to the provisions of Article 8C.( 1) through (3), then the phrase ”[u]pon release of the record” in subparagraph (1) shall mean that the payment will be made no later than 45 days after the ’’street date” and, further, that the Producer will exert all reasonable efforts to cause the phonograph record companies to make payments to the musicians within thirty (30) days after "street date.” Additionally, if the Federation obtains, in direct negotiations with the phonograph record companies, a commitment from those companies to make payments in less than thirty (30) days, that time limitation shall apply with respect to the payments due under subparagraph (1) referred to above.

During the 1993 negotiations between the AFM and the Employers represented by the AMPTP, the parties agreed that the report form to the Special Payments Fund would contain certain information.

Dear Mark:
Reference is made to Paragraph 4, ’’Health Plan," of the American Federation of Musicians Basic Theatrical Motion Picture Agreement of 1993 and the Basic Television Film Agreement of 1993, which provides in part:
"The parties hereto are parties to and bound by the provisions of the 'Agreement and Declaration of Trust establishing the I.A.T.S.E.-Basic Crafts-Guilds-Hollywood Producers-Health and Welfare Fund for the Employees of the Motion Pictures and Allied Industries,’ dated as of October 20, 1952 . . . with respect to the musicians’ classifications of this agreement.
* * *
"The above contributions are in accordance with the present pattern of contributions by Employers required under the Health Plan. In the event this present pattern of contributions under the Health Plan should be changed during the term of this Agreement, then the rate of contributions as provided herein shall automatically be changed to conform to such new pattern and rate of Employer's contributions established under such Health Plan."
Consistent with the above provisions, the pattern and rate of contributions to the Health Plan on behalf of musicians and the benefits provided thereunder have for many years been in conformity with those provided under the I.A.T.S.E. & M.P.M.O. Basic Agreement. The parties further recognize that the upcoming negotiations between the IATSE and the Employers represented by the AMPTP for a new IATSE Basic Agreement may result in an agreed-upon reduction or modification of benefits and/or increases in the standards for eligibility, an increase in the rate of employer contributions to the Fund, or a new requirement for a cents-per-hour employee contribution.

During the course of the 1993 negotiations for the Basic Television and Basic Theatrical Motion Picture Agreements, the AFM expressed its concern that allowing documentary programs to fall under the "news" use provision of Article 8A.(a) of the Agreements may result in reuses of music sound track not intended by the parties.
To that extent, the Producers have agreed that, with respect to documentary programs, in order to meet the "news" use requirements of Article 8A.(a), the reuse of music from a motion picture sound track must accompany the footage for which such music was originally recorded.

This will confirm that the formula for determining percentage payments into the Special Payments Fund, as set forth in Article 15(b)(i)(6) and Article 16(b)(i)(5) of the AFM Basic Theatrical Motion Picture Agreement of 1996, shall also apply in the following circumstances:
