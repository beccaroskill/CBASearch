5.	Every staff member covered by this Agreement shall have the right to present grievances in accordance with these procedures, with or without representation. Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this
8
Agreement shall be construed to prevent any individual staff member, should he/she so elect, from presenting a grievance and having it adjusted without representation of the UNION; however, the UNION shall have the right to be present to observe at all steps of the grievance procedure, and provided any such adjustment is consistent with the terms in this Agreement. In the event a grievance is filed so that sufficient time as indicated under all steps of the procedure cannot be provided before the last day of school and should it be necessary to pursue the grievance to all steps, then said grievance shall be resolved under the terms of this Agreement and this Article and not under the succeeding Agreement.
B.	Procedure
Step #1: Within ten (10) working days of his/her knowledge of the occurrence, the grievant shall reduce the grievance to writing and present it to his/her immediate Principal/Supervisor. The Principal/Supervisor shall respond in writing by the end of the tenth (10*) working day following the day the written grievance is presented. This time period for the presentation of the written grievance may be extended by mutual agreement by providing a written request to the Director of Human Resources with a statement of the details of the occurrence prior to the expiration of the original ten (10) days.
The immediate Principal/Supervisor for the purposes of this procedure shall be that Principal/Supervisor with primary responsibility to resolve the grievance.
Step #2: If there is not a satisfactory resolution of the grievance at Step #1 or if the immediate Principal/Supervisor fails to respond within the specified time, the grievance shall be presented to the Superintendent or his designee. Such written grievance shall be submitted within ten (10) working days of the Principal/Supervisor's reply at Step #1 or, in the absence of such reply, within ten (10) working days of the date the reply was due.
The written grievance shall state the nature of the grievance, shall note the specific clause(s) of the Agreement allegedly violated, and shall state the remedy requested.
Within ten (10) days after such written grievance is filed, the aggrieved, the representative of the aggrieved as desired, the Principal/Supervisor and the Superintendent or his designee shall meet to resolve the grievance. The Superintendent or his designee shall make a decision within ten (10) days of the second step grievance meeting and communicate the decision and the reason for it in writing to the staff member and immediate Principal/Supervisor. A copy of the written grievance and all written replies or decisions shall be submitted to the BOARD of Education.
9
The time period for replying to the written grievance may be extended by mutual agreement by providing a written request to the UNION President or Business Agent with a statement of the reasons that additional time is needed.
Step #3: Binding Arbitration: In the event that the grievance has not been satisfactorily resolved at Step #2 of the Grievance Procedure, upon request of the UNION, the Superintendent or his designee and the UNION shall select the arbitrator from the Labor Mediation Roster maintained by the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board. A panel of five (5) arbitrators shall be submitted to both the UNION and the Administration. If the Superintendent or his designee and the UNION are unable to agree upon one of the panel members to resolve the grievance, an arbitrator shall be chosen by each party alternately striking one name from the list until one name remains. The remaining name shall be the name of the arbitrator. The UNION shall strike the first name, the Superintendent or his/her designee shall strike the second name, etc. The proceedings before the arbitrator shall be closed to the public.
The arbitrator shall have authority only to interpret and apply the provisions of this Agreement and only to the extent necessary to decide the submitted grievance and shall not have authority to add to, detract from, or in any way alter the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the Illinois Uniform Arbitration Act (Ch. 710, Sec 5/1 et seq. ILCS 1992.) The decision of the arbitrator shall be binding on the parties.
Expense for the Arbitrator’s services shall be borne equally by the BOARD and the UNION or by the individual if he/she is not a member of the UNION.
Administration participation in the earlier levels of the grievance procedure shall not constitute a waiver of the defense that the dispute involves management prerogatives outside the scope of the Bargaining Agreement and therefore not subject to binding arbitration.
C.	No Reprisals Clause - A staff member who participates in these grievance procedures shall not be subjected to discipline or reprisal because of such participation.
D.	Hearings and Conferences
1.	Hearings, conferences, and binding arbitration under this procedure shall
be conducted at a time and place which will afford a fair and reasonable opportunity for all persons involved to attend, including witnesses entitled to be present, and will be held, insofar as possible, after regular school hours or during non-teaching time of personnel involved. When such hearings and conferences are held (at the option of the Administration)
10
during school hours, all of the staff members whose presence is required shall be excused, with pay, for that purpose.
2.	It is agreed that any investigation or other handling or processing of any grievance by the grievant staff member or teacher organization representatives shall be conducted so as to result in no interference with or interruption whatsoever to the instructional program and related work activities of the staff member.
E.	Aggrieved Person Representation - The BOARD acknowledges the right of the UNION to participate in the processing of a formal grievance at any level once the grievance is reduced to writing. No staff member shall be required to discuss any grievance if he/she desires the presence of a representative and the representative is not present.
F.	The First Step - The first step may be waived by agreement of the grievant and the Superintendent or his/her designee.
G.	Administration Cooperation - The Administration shall cooperate with the aggrieved person and his/her representative in any investigation of any formal grievance.
H.	Filing of Materials - All documents, communication and records dealing with the processing of a grievance shall be filed separately from the personnel files of the participants.
I.	Grievance Withdrawal - A grievance may be withdrawn at any level without establishing precedent.
J.	Discipline of Teachers - An employee subject to a documented verbal warning, written disciplinary warning or suspension shall have the right to UNION representation at a meeting regarding such discipline. To the extent that an employee's conduct may result in a documented verbal warning, written disciplinary warning or suspension, such discipline shall be for cause.
K.	Removal of High School Head Coaches - The Principal shall provide each head high school athletic coach with an annual review at the end of his/her coaching season. Renewal of coaching assignments is based on consistent positive reviews, provided that a coach receives an opportunity to correct deficiencies before his/her assignment is not renewed by the BOARD. However, the BOARD may immediately dismiss the coach from his/her coaching assignment due to unprofessional conduct.
11
ARTICLE VI UNION RIGHTS
A.	UNION Bulletin Boards - The UNION may use reasonable space on existing teacher bulletin boards in each school.

Three of the four substitute teachers will allow that LPDC’s teacher member, appointed by the UNION, to conduct the required business of the LPDC, and the fourth substitute will rotate, allowing the individual teachers being reviewed to be in attendance with the LPDC during their review. The BOARD will establish an annual schedule of LPDC meetings which occur during the school day.

J	MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING
I
।	Compensation for Required Meetings
I	It is the recommendation that a committee study whether additional dismissals per
(semester can be added to the calendar beginning with the 1996-97 school year for the purposes of an improvement plan, or inservice training, or staff development activity. Dates should be set by the calendar committee. This committee will submit recommendations to the calendar committee no later than November 1,1995.
It is also the recommendation of this committee that some release time (substitutes)
I should be provided for the “school improvement team’ in order that they might focus on | school improvement issues, therefore reducing the need for these meetings to take place after the school day.
If a faculty feels meetings in their buildings are excessive, this committee recommends:
________________Dates and times should be documented and given to the president of the bargaining unit to be presented at the area of consultation meetings or to the Assistant Superintendent of School Operation.
Class Size/Student Achievement
In the assignment of students to class rosters, consideration will be given to the special needs of all learners. Building administrators will collaborate with affected teachers and when possible make accommodations as appropriate.
Counseling for Middle/Primarv Schools
The BOARD should move toward providing appropriate counseling services for middle and primary schools. This statement should be included in the School BOARD’S Goal 2000. The addition of a counselor in these schools will reduce the principal's work load. rwwiHp a	tha	tflarhpr anrl AnhannA fha afuHaftf’s

BOARD Policy 5114
Board Policy 5114, subparagraph d, would be amended by adding the following additional language: ... and false accusation made against school personnel and/or a fellow student.’ The purpose of this change is to ’codify* the past practice of disciplining students who make false accusations. Although the focus of this committee was to protect the innocent teacher from false accusations made by students regarding sexual harassment, the committee believed that broader language was needed to protect innocent teachers and students from any false accusation. For example, students have been falsely accused of bringing weapons to school.
New administrative personnel will be given sexual harassment prevention training.
Adopt-A-School BOARD
As of June 1,1995, the majority of the teacher representation on the Adopt-A-School Advisory BOARD shall be members of the collective bargaining agent.-------------------
Hepatitis Shots
The School DISTRICT will make a concerted effort starting at the primary schools to inform staff members of blood borne pathogens, and provide protective gloves directly to staff members.
Phones for Primarv/Middle/Roosevelt Schools
The DISTRICT will investigate the need, on an individual basis, for additional lines to be installed In school buildings. An orderly plan will be made to take care of the problems regarding the phones.
Payroll Deposits
The statement of procedure for summer checks shall be delivered to staff members by May 15.
1.	Payroll deduction deposits and automatic net check deposits shall be available to staff members at Redbrand Credit UNION. Payroll deduction deposits shall continue to be available at CEFCU. (The present software on the DISTRICT computer does not allow more than one net check facility**.)
2.	Staff members who elect twenty-six pays shall have the following options for delivery of summer checks:
a.	Checks may be mailed to the staff member's home for the entire summer.
b.	Checks will be automatically deposited in the available facility.
c.	Checks may be picked up at 3202 N. Wisconsin after 2:00 p.m. on ’Pay Day", Thursday.
d.	For those employees who pick up their checks in person, one paycheck may be mailed to a staff member's bank if the staff member furnishes Payroll with at least one week’s advance notification in writing, a stamped addressed envelope, a deposit slip, and (if necessary) a "hold harmless" statement for the DISTRICT.
**As software may be updated, other facilities for direct deposit of net checks may become available. It is simply not an option at this time due to the computer's lack of capabflity to do so.
Sample of Note for Payroll Procedures
"Please mail my check to. I
have provided a stamped envelope and deposit slip. I understand that it is my responsibility to be sure that the check has arrived and has been posted before I presume the money is available for writing checks.

Non-Certificated Study Hall and Lunch Room Monitors
As long as a climate of safety and order is maintained, the administration will hire noncertified personnel as allowed by law to act as Study Hall and Lunch Room Monitors.

75
Board Goals
The Board of Education and the Peoria Federation of Teachers shall establish independent committees composed of teachers and administrators to formulate a program to encourage staff involvement and input, and to establish fair and consistent evaluations and incentives for promoting better education in District 150.
Enhancement of Student Learning
In the event that the BOARD has the opportunity to expand student instruction services through the provision of major additional financial resources for this purpose, the Administration and the UNION agree to work collaboratively to design and implement a program to enhance the learning of students.
Counseling Services for High Schools
The committee for counselor services recommends the following items be considered by a joint committee for determining the role of the secondary school counselor. These recommendations are primarily taken from the Recommended Practices and procedures for Counselors as determined by the State BOARD of Education.
The functions of DISTRICT #150 High School Counselors should include, but not limited to the following categories:
	1.	Individual Counseling
	2.	Group Counseling
	3.	Group Guidance
	4.	Appraisal
[	5. 6. 7.	Consultation Coordination, Liaison, and Referral ProgramDevelopment
	8.	Public Relations
	9.	Professional Renewal
Administrators who assign clerical tasks, supervisory, and quasi-administrative responsibilities to counselors can negatively affect staff morale and may deny more needed services to students and staff. With this understanding, the following are examples of duties that should be curtailed or eliminated from a counselor’s responsibility:
1.
2.
3.
Routine Attendance
Involving Counselors in Disciplinary Action Reassignment non-Counselor Responsibilities (home room/hall/cafeteria supervision, daily substitute teaching)
76
The counselor should have no routine student supervision responsibilities different from or in addition to those shared by all faculty members on a short-term, rotating basis.
Other factors that shall be jointly studied to increase the effectiveness of a counseling staff could include, but not be limited to, the following:
1,	Counseling offices should be separate and located away from the
administration offices.
2.	The counselor student ratio should be a maximum of 1 to 300. (good programs throughout the State go no higher than 1 to 280). Schools characterized by high concentrations of negative factors (e.g. poverty, unemployment, absenteeism, low achievement) need the lowest possible counselor/student ratio.
3.	The DISTRICT should move toward the development of a separate college and career counselor at each high school.
Interim Bargaining
In the event that the Teacher Tenure Act is repealed or substantially changed by legislative action, the parties agree to interim bargaining on a “just cause* provision to provide job security for certificated personnel.
Administrative Directive
There shall be an administrative directive which states ‘No part-time person shall be hired for more titan seventy-five percent (75%) FFE without the permission of the Director of Human Resources.
77
Side Letters

Bargaining Agreement does not compromise or jeopardize either party's position in the Grievance over toe adjustment in insurance rates effective October 1,1999 and toe Unfair Labor Practice and Grievance over the adjustment in insurance rates effective October 1,2000 and will not be used against either party in such litigation.
2.	It is toe intent of the parties that toe Strategic Communications Committee win obviate the need for continuing toe quarterly Areas of Consultation meetings between the UNION and BOARD of Education.
