2.1 Level I
Within twenty (20) days of when the grievant knew or should reasonably have known of the act or omission giving rise to the grievances, the grievant must present such grievance in writing to the immediate supervisor.
This statement shall be a clear, concise, statement of the grievances, the provision(s) of the Agreement involved, and the specific remedy sought.
The supervisor shall communicate a decision to the unit member in writing within seven (7) days after receiving the grievance.
Within the same time limits either party may request a personal conference with the other party.

If both the Association and the District agree to grievance mediation, the parties shall attempt to agree on a mediator.
If no agreement is reached, the parties shall request the State Conciliation Service to supply a panel of five (5) names of mediators.

All pertinent parties are encouraged to utilize the advisory grievance mediation process as a possible alternative to binding arbitration.
2.4	Level IV (Arbitration)
Within ten (10) days of the end of the grievance mediation process, the grievant may, if not satisfied with the result of the grievance mediation process, submit a request in writing to the Superintendent and the Association for final and binding arbitration of the dispute.

Prior to the hearing, the parties shall attempt to agree upon a joint statement of the issue(s). If such submission is not agreed upon by the parties, the arbitrator shall refer to the grievance and the responses thereto in order to determine the issue(s).
After a hearing and after both parties have had an opportunity to make written arguments, the arbitrator shall submit in writing to all parties, his/her decision relating to the alleged violation of the specific provision(s) of this Agreement which shall be final and binding upon the parties.
The processing of a grievance beyond Level III shall constitute an express election on the part of the grievant that the grievance/arbitration procedure is the chosen forum for resolving the issue(s) contained in the grievance.
2.4.1	Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any unit member having a grievance to discuss the matter with any appropriate member of the administration, and to have grievances adjusted without intervention by the Association, provided that prior to any agreement upon a resolution of a grievance, the Association will be provided a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution, and in addition will be provided ten (10) days in which to file a response to the proposed resolution regarding whether the adjustment of the grievance is inconsistent with the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
2.4.2	A grievant shall have the right to have an Association representative or other representative of his/her choice at Levels I and II of the grievance procedure. This clause shall not be interpreted to expand the release time provision in Section 2.4.7.
2.4.3	If several grievances are filed which contain the same issue and underlying facts, then such grievances may be combined for a single disposition and/or hearing, provided the grievants, the Association, and the District agree to such consolidation.

2.4.4	The time limits specified at each level should be considered to be maximums, and every effort should be made to expedite the process. However, if the District does not respond within the specified time limits the grievance is automatically moved to the next level; and if the grievant fails to appeal within the specified time limits, such failure will constitute an automatic withdrawal of the grievance.
2.4.5	In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed by the end of the school year, and if left unresolved until the beginning of the following school year, could result in harm to an aggrieved person, the time limits set forth herein will be reduced so that the procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school year or as soon as is practicable.
2.4.6	Forms for filing grievances shall be prepared jointly by the District and the Association within five (5) days of ratification of the Agreement.
2.4.7	Time off from duties will be granted for the processing of grievances past Level I of the grievance procedure, Article 2, Section 2 herein, for unit members who are designated as Association representatives, subject to the following conditions:
(a)	by not later than thirty (30) days following the signing of this Agreement the Association will designate in writing to the Superintendent, the names of ten (10) unit members who are to receive the time off;
(b)	twenty-four (24) hours prior to release from duties for grievance processing the designated representative informs his/her immediate supervisor in order that an adequate substitute may be obtained, if such is necessary; and
(c)	that such time-off shall be limited solely to representing a grievant in a conference with a management person, beyond Level I, and in no way shall this limitation include use of such time for matters such as gathering information, interviewing witnesses, or preparing a presentation.

2.4.9	All documents and records dealing with grievances shall be kept in files that are separated from the regular personnel files. However, such separation shall not be construed as constituting a separate personnel file for purposes of the Education Code.

Leaves of absence shall not be construed to mean an interruption of service within the meaning of this section.
5.2.3.2	Unit members serving less than a school year shall be deducted one day's salary for each day of sick leave taken in excess of school months, or portion thereof, served after expiration of accumulated sick leave.

If a medical doctor's or Christian Science practitioner's certification is required the District shall bear the cost of this certification that is in excess of the unit member's health insurance coverage.
The District may make all necessary inquiries in order to be fully informed as to the nature and severity of the illness or injury, and to report such findings to the Superintendent or designee. If the report concludes that the absence is not due to personal illness or injury, or that the illness is not sufficiently severe to warrant continued absence, then the Superintendent or designee, after notice to the unit member, may refuse to grant such leave. If requested by the District management, a unit member shall not return to work until he/she submits a medical doctor's or Christian Science practitioner's authorization to return to work.
5.2.5	Unit members shall give reasonable notice to their immediate supervisor when there is a need to be absent. Reasonable notice shall be construed to be two (2) hours prior to start of class session. Exceptions to this will be untimely or emergency health conditions. Failure to provide reasonable notice as set forth in this article shall be grounds for denial of leave with pay.
5.2.6	A unit member who is absent from duty for less than a full day shall have deducted from the accumulated leave increments of one-half (1/2) hour. Any fraction of a half-hour shall count as one-half (1/2) hour.
5.2.7	Each unit member shall be notified of the accumulated sick leave total and sick leave entitlements as of September 1, by not later than October 1 of each school year.

Article 8:	TRANSFERS
8.1	Reassignments and transfers are made to schools, departments and positions so as to best meet the needs of the school district. They may be made at any time during the school year. However, each year staff members shall have the opportunity to request transfers for the ensuing school year.
Recommended reassignments and transfers of unit members shall be submitted to the Superintendent of Schools by the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services. Transfers of unit members shall be subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent of Schools.
All transfer requests shall be processed through Personnel Services. The Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services, may call upon principals, directors, and supervisors to advise in the reassignment transfer of personnel. 8.2 Transfers may be requested by the unit member or by the principal, director, or supervisor.
8.3	From time to time it may be necessary to reassign teachers from one grade level to another or from one school and subject area to another or to a substitute status or to non-employment status. This necessity is predicated upon several factors:
Decrease in enrollment in the District or within a particular school; budget reductions or limitations due to insufficient funds;

Changes in educational programs currently offered within a school or within the District as a whole;
or emergencies requiring the necessity of shutting down a school.
When the transfer, reassignment or reduction of unit members becomes
necessary all moves will be based upon voluntary requests of staff members or
upon seniority in the school district within the following groups:
General Teachers for Grades K-8
This category includes all grade level
teachers, resource teachers, department leaders, as well as all subject teachers
at the junior high level who may be assigned any grade level or general subject in Grades K-8.
Special Subject Teachers
requiring special credentials;
i.e., instrumental
music, and teachers whose credential authorization restricts them to teaching
certain subjects; i.e., in a recognized major or minor subject area.
For these unit members seniority will be considered among the unit
members comprising the particular special subject at the junior high school
under consideration for reduction, or otherwise for the special subject area being reduced. However, such transfers shall not be made until the principal
has considered reasonable options in a conscientious effort to avoid an
involuntary transfer.
Teachers Employed Under Categorical Aid Programs
with specific state
guidelines, financial, or legal requirements; i.e., Special Education, Speech Therapist, Specially Funded Educational Projects which involve a state
requirement for use of minority teachers in all schools of the District, Miller-Unruh, etc.
(a)	In the reduction of unit members of a particular subject area within a junior high school the special subject teacher assigned to the subject area at the junior
high school with the least District seniority shall:

(c)	if no vacancy exists at that junior high school for which the transferee is qualified, the transferee shall have the right to be placed in the position in that junior high school of the least senior unit member for whom the transferee has credential authorization. In such case the least senior unit member is declared surplus and is subject to involuntary transfer;
(d)	if neither a nor b are applicable, then the unit member with the least District seniority in the subject area being reduced shall be placed on the surplus list for transfer to another school to a vacancy for which the transferee is credentialed;
(e)	if no vacancy exists in subject areas of credential authorization, such transferee shall have the right to displace the least senior unit member in a special subject area for which the transferee is credentialed, and the unit member displaced thereby shall go on the surplus list for placement in a vacancy for which he/she is credentialed.
8.3.1	If no vacancy is available for the credential authorization the District shall utilize the services of the unit member at the discretion of the District; such service may include but is not limited to substitute teaching; and if no regular assignment can be made in an area of credential authorization, the District may take the legal steps necessary for layoff of surplus personnel.
8.3.2	Unit members who hold multiple credentials, including Special Education credentials; i.e., LDG, EH, or EMR, shall not be transferred involuntarily to a special subject area in which they are not presently assigned, except that a unit member may be reassigned to a special subject area if the unit member's initial assignment upon employment with the District was in the special subject area. In such instances the position shall be filled with the least senior unit member in the special subject area.

8.^^VoluntaryUmtMemberTansfe
8A1Definition^^^^^^^^^^^^B
A voluntary transfer refers to a change in position or to a reassignment during the current school year or for the upcoming school year initiated by a unit member, and which moves the unit member to a different school. Voluntary transfers shall be approved for unit members no more than once in each three-year period.
8.4.2 Limitation
Voluntary transfers shall be limited in any one (1) building for any one (1) school year to not more than fifty percent (50%) of the teaching staff, or as is established by regulations governing Equal Opportunity Laws and Affirmative Action.
In cases where more than fifty percent (50%) apply for a transfer, the applicants will be considered in the order of the applicants’ district seniority. The prescribed order will be descending from greatest to least.
8.4.3 Procedure
A unit member may request a transfer by submitting a written request directly to the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services.
A.	A unit member may submit a request for transfer at any time with or without the knowledge of his/her principal. Such request shall be submitted in writing to the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services, and shall specify either:
(1)	that the unit member is applying for a transfer to fill a currently posted vacancy, and if so, which vacancy (or vacancies in order of preference). To be considered, such requests must be submitted by the posted closing date;
(2)	that the unit member wishes to be placed on the transfer list, and if so what positions he/she would accept should such become available.

B.	All requests shall be acknowledged in writing; and the unit member shall be given, upon request, information concerning the status of his/her request for transfer.
C.	If the unit member requests that his/her application for transfer be kept confidential, the principal at his/her school will not be notified by Personnel Services of the application until an offer for transfer has been made; and the matter will be treated as confidentially as practicable.
8.4.4 Qualifications
A request for transfer will not be granted if the unit member does not qualify for the existing vacancy. In general, a unit member will be considered qualified for a particular vacancy only if he/she holds the required California credential, meets the qualifications specified in the adopted position description and meets all special requirements indicated for the posted vacancy as determined by the appropriate administrator, and does not violate regulations affecting Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action.
8.4.5	Both applications received in response to the posting of a specific vacancy and appropriate applications from those on the current transfer waiting list will be considered prior to the filling of any specific vacancy.
8.4.6	If a request for transfer is denied, the unit member shall be given, upon request, written rationale for the denial.
8.4.7	During the school year when a unit member is offered a transfer which he/she has requested as a first choice, he/she shall be expected to accept such an offer. In all other cases, a unit member may withdraw an application for transfer or reassignment within two (2) days of such offer without prejudice to consideration for future transfers or reassignment.

8.8.2	When grade combination classes are formed and there are no volunteers for the combination class, and it cannot be listed as a vacancy to which an incoming teacher to the school can be assigned, then the principal shall make a reassignment of a teacher in the two (2) grades involved on the basis of rotation, with the teacher being reassigned who has not been assigned to a combination class for the longest period of time.
In the event that a teacher is subject to a reassignment to a combination class, as cited above, in two (2) different combinations; i.e., a 2-3 and a 3-4, then the teacher in the grade involved (Grade 3) who has not been assigned to a combination class for the longest period of time shall have the choice of the two (2) combinations for reassignment, unless a teacher in the adjacent grade whose turn it is to take a combination class has not had a combination class for a longer period of time opts to take one (1) of the combination classes; i.e., the 2-3 in the example above, leaving only the 3-4 class for the third grade teacher.
In no case, in the example above, shall the 2-3 class be taken by a second grade teacher and the 3-4 class be taken by a fourth grade teacher so as to create a surplus of teachers in the third grade.

If there is a Kindergarten teacher at the school not in an A.M./P.M. rotation then this teacher shall move into the rotation vacated by the newly assigned K/1 teacher.
