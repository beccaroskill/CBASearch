a.	Vacation, or
b.	Approved Medical Leave of Absence,
such Employee will be transferred to it upon return to work unless there has been a reduction in force and the Employee cannot receive the job because of lack of seniority.
Openings under “a” and “b” above will be filled by temporary opening provisions. In the event, under “b” above, the successful bidder is unable to return to work or is unable to fill the job duties upon his return to work, the job will be posted as a permanent vacancy.

Such an Employee shall not be eligible for Sunday overtime if there are sufficient Employees in the classification, on the shift who agree to work both days. It is the intent of this paragraph to allow an Employee ineligible for Saturday overtime under the Illinois law to work Sunday before going outside the classification or shift.
An Employee scheduled to work overtime on Saturday and who works Saturday shall work overtime on Sunday should it become necessary to schedule Sunday overtime in the classification worked on Saturday.
It is the intent of this Subsection that an Employee working the sixth day of the work week on overtime shall not be prevented from working the seventh day in the work week if overtime is required in the same job classification and same shift as he worked on the sixth day in order to avoid the payment of double time.
d.	An assignment of an Employee in accordance with the above provision will be made only when the Company deems it necessary to do such work and when the assignment will not be in violation of any law.
e.	In this Section, a period of work which is connected with another shift (“early call-in” or “hold-over”), but which overlaps another work day, shall not be counted as a separate day worked, unless such “early call-in” or “hold-over” is for a full shift or longer.
f.	However, Subsection e shall not apply to a “holdover” beyond the end of an Employee’s normal afternoon shift on Saturday or to an “early call-in” prior to an Employee’s normal midnight shift on Monday morning. Any such period (excluding normal clothes change time, etc.) shall be considered as a separate day worked.
70
g.	An Employee must work at least 4 hours on his regularly scheduled shift to have that work day count* ed as a “day worked” for purposes of eligibility for seventh day double time,
h.	If an Employee is called in to work on his regular day off for a period not connected with another shift, such period shall be considered a separate day worked regardless of the length of time worked.
Section 8.10:	Call-In Pay
An Employee called in to the plant to work during a period of time unconnected with his regular shift shall receive, regardless of the actual time worked, not less than the equivalent of straight time pay for 4 hours.
Section8.il:	Reporting Pay
a.	An Employee reporting for work at his regular starting time and place, lacking notice from the Company to the contrary, and who, through no fault of his own, is not permitted to work in his regular job classification shall be given, without affecting any other regular Employee, a full day’s work at his regular rate of pay.
b.	However, such Employee shall receive not less than 4 hours’ pay, regardless of the actual time worked, unless the Employee does not work because of:
(1)	The granting of his request to go home rather than perform temporary work for which he is physically qualified,
(2)	a plant breakdown beyond the control of the Company, or
(3)	any other cause entirely beyond the control of the Company.
Section 8.12:	Hours Outside Regular Schedule
a.	An Employee working outside his regularly scheduled shift, his regular schedule of hours or on his regularly scheduled day off shall receive time and one-half.
b.	Regular schedule, as used in this Section, means 5 consecutive days, starting with the first shift of the work week, for Employees on straight shifts and rotating 2 or 3 shift schedules and 5 consecutive days of the work period for established group work schedules. Regularly scheduled hours means the 8
71
hours of an Employee’s regular, assigned shift as designated in Sections 7.1 or 7.3 of this Agreement.
Section 8.13:	Selection for Overtime Work
a.	It is recognized that overtime work is important and, on occasion, necessary and that an Employee is subject to disciplinary action for failure to work assigned overtime, unless excused by his foreman.
b.	Once the Company has determined that Employees are to do certain work at a certain time and that there will be an insufficient number of Employees otherwise available to perform the work, Employees will be selected for overtime work in accordance with working rules established by the Company and the Union.
c.	An Employee will not be allowed or required to work more than 16 consecutive hours, or to work double shifts on 2 consecutive days, unless he is the only available qualified Employee. For the purpose of this Section, 6 hours or more shall constitute a double unless provided otherwise in any agreed Overtime Working Rules.
d.	An Employee who is on vacation shall have no preference for overtime on his normal days off, except for startup activities following a shutdown.
e.	The Company will make reasonable effort not to force Employees to work overtime. However, due to Company operations, forcing of overtime may be required but, when overtime is forced, proper Employees will be forced. As a basic guideline, when possible, all forced overtime will be the responsibility of the outgoing shift unless the applicable Departmental Overtime Agreement specifies otherwise. In the event the Company might force the wrong Employee to work an overtime assignment, that Employee will be paid at 2 times his basic rate of pay for the overtime worked. Unless otherwise specified by a Departmental Overtime Agreement regarding the procedure utilized in the event of a “forced” overtime assignment, the basic guideline of “forcing the original vacancy” when available should be exercised. For known in advance Departmental openings due to vacations, leaves of absence, jury duty, funeral leave, and disciplinary suspension, the basic concept of “ask for 8 hours, ask for 12 hours, and then force for 8 hours” should be utilized as a basic
72
guideline. However Department Overtime Agreements ultimately will govern how such openings are to be covered in each of the respective Departments throughout the plant.
f.	An Employee who works an overtime assignment in a lower paid job classification shall receive overtime payment based on his regular rate of pay.
g.	In the event an Employee is forced to work overtime under Section 8.13-e above, and such overtime is daily overtime on a hold over basis and the Employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Company that he does not have transportation home, the Company shall exercise one of the following options;
(1)	Allow the Employee to work a full 8 hour double.
(2)	Provide transportation home for the Employee.
h.	An Employee who volunteers for and starts work on a full 8-hour double and whose overtime is cut short by management decision will be treated as one who is forced under paragraph g for purposes of transportation.
i.	Where more than one Employee in a classification (in the same overtime unit on the shift) is forced to work overtime, and it develops that some can leave earlier than others, the senior Employees in the classification will, if they ask, be given the opportunity to leave first, provided (1) those who remain are qualified to do the work and (2) no transportation home will be provided.
Section 8.14:	Pay’ for Overtime Work
Time and one-half will be paid for all hours worked in the work week for:
a.	All hours over 8 hours in a 24-hour work period (except those resulting from Employees trading shifts at their request).
b.	On an Employee’s regular scheduled day off in the work week.
■ c. Over 40 hours in a work week.
d. Hours outside the regular schedule as provided in Section 8.12.
Section 8.15:	Time Off Due to Overtime
a.	An Employee shall not be required to take time off from his regular schedule because of working overtime except to conform with legal requirements under appropriate laws.
73
b.	If, to conform with State or Federal law, an Employee is allowed to take a day off from his regular schedule, he shall be allowed to select the day off provided, however, that if more than one Employee is involved, such selection shall be made by group seniority.
c.	Provision b shall not take precedence over Section 8.9.
Section 8.16;	Overtime Meals
a.	An Employee working more than 2 hours immediately following an 8-hour work period shall be given a free meal on Company time and an additional meal at each 4-hour interval thereafter.
b.	An Employee working more than 6 hours prior to his regular 8-hour shift shall be entitled to a free meal on Company time after working more than 2 hours and an additional meal 4 hours thereafter. An Employee working more than 2 hours prior to his regular 8-hour shift shall be given a free meal on Company time after working more than 2 hours.
c.	An Employee who, in reporting for emergency duty prior to his normal starting time, does not have sufficient time to procure a normal meal prior to reporting for work shall be given a meal at the completion of the emergency duty, provided he continues to work his normal shift.
d.	In addition to the above, an Employee called out to fill a vacancy will be given a meal if he is not given at least 1 hour’s notice to report.
e.	The overtime meal furnished by the Company shall be adequate as to quantity, quality, with reasonable selection and service, and may be supplied from plant vending machines, the plant cafeteria or from external food suppliers.
f.	Effective 12-1-00 for the first meal in an overtime period, the Company will furnish the Employee $6.00 in cash for use in the vending machines or a meal ticket redeemable for a maximum of $6.00 worth of food in the cafeteria. For a second meal, the Company will furnish the Employee $4.50 in cash for use in the vending machines or a meal ticket redeemable for a maximum of $4.50 worth of food in the cafeteria. Effective 1-1-04, the first overtime meal amount will be increased from $6.00 to $7.00 and the second overtime meal amount will be increased from $4.50 to $5.00.
74
Section 8.17;	Holiday as Time Worked
A day for which an Employee receives holiday pay shall be counted as a day worked for the purpose of computing overtime only if he would have been scheduled to work on that day except for the observance of the holiday.
Section 8.18;	Selection for Holiday Work
a.	Employees will be selected for work on any shift on a holiday in accordance with occupational group seniority (General Machinists date where applicable) from among qualified Employees who: (1) are in the job classification needed,
(2)	are in the department (with preference given to those within the appropriate overtime unit, if any), and
(3)	normally would have been scheduled to work that shift but for the holiday.
b.	This procedure will not apply to selection of standby workers for the Christmas-New Year holiday shutdown period.
c.	If departmental overtime working rules provide a procedure for selecting employees specifically for holiday work, that procedure, rather than (a) above, will be observed. Otherwise, the overtime working rules shall not apply unless and until all qualified Employees who normally would have been scheduled to work that shift are first given an opportunity to work.
Section 8.19:	Transfer to Higher-Paid Job
a.	An Employee temporarily transferred to a job having a higher wage bracket shall receive the lowest step in such bracket which is higher than his regular rate for the actual time worked on the job or for 4 hours, whichever is greater.
b.	Such Employee will be credited for all time worked in the job classification for progression within the wage bracket.
Section 8.20;	Transfer to Lower-Paid Job
a.	An Employee temporarily transferred for the convenience of the Company to a job carrying a lower rate of pay shall receive his regular rate of pay.
b.	An Employee temporarily transferred for his own convenience to a job carrying a lower rate of pay shall receive that rate of pay for the actual time worked on such job.

An Employee who is scheduled for the day shift on Monday and who is called or scheduled in for the full
75
midnight shift on Monday morning, shall receive time and one-half for his regular day shift on Monday.
