AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT, effective as of April 4, 2004, is made and entered into by and between the WASHINGTON HOSPITAL CENTER (hereinafter referred to as the “Hospital”) and NURSES UNITED OF THE NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION (hereinafter referred to as the “Union”).
WITNESSETH
Recognizing that essential services vital to the community and the interest of its employees depend upon the Hospital’s ability to provide quality, uninterrupted patient care, the Hospital and Union agree to strive mutually to improve the care and comfort of patients and to promote orderly and peaceful resolution of all disputes and differences between the parties. With these goals in mind, the parties have entered into this collective Agreement which sets forth herein the parties’ full agreement covering wages, rates of pay, hours of work, and other conditions of employment.
In consideration of the terms and provisions herein specified, the parties agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1 UNION RECOGNITION, BARGAINING UNIT DEFINITION, AND PROBATIONARY PERIOD
§ 1.1	Union Recognition: The Hospital recognizes the Union as the exclusive representative for the purpose of collective bargaining with respect to rates of pay, hours of work, and other conditions of employment of those employees of the Hospital listed in Section 1.2 of this Article.
i
§ 1.2	Bargaining Unit: This Agreement covers all permanent, full-time clinical nurses, all permanent, part-time eligible clinical nurses, and all Float Pool nurses employed by the Hospital at its Washington, D.C. location. This Agreement excludes all nurse administrators, clinical specialists, clinical supervisors, students, supervisors as defined in the National Labor Relations Act (as amended), part-time ineligible nurses, temporary nurses, and all other employees.
§ 1.3	Probationary Employees:
(a)	All nurses who are newly hired into a bargaining unit position or transfer into a bargaining unit position covered by this Agreement from any non-bargaining unit position, either prior to or after the date of this Agreement, shall be considered probationary employees until completion of ninety (90) days of employment. The Hospital may extend this probationary period by up to an additional thirty (30) days. In the event the probationary period is extended, the Hospital shall notify the Union of such decision and state the reason(s). All rehired nurses (defined as those who have been employed as nonprobationary nurses by the Hospital within the past five (5) years) shall be considered probationary employees until completion of forty-five (45) days of employment. Any nurses who are in special training programs (except in the Operating Room) shall have a probationary period of ninety (90) days or the duration of such program, whichever is longer. The Hospital may extend this probationary period for up to thirty (30) days. In the event that the probationary period is extended beyond ninety (90) days or beyond the completion of the program, the Hospital shall notify the Union of such decision and state the reason(s). A nurse who is in a special training program in the Operating Room shall remain a probationary employee until the program is completed.
(b)	Nurses in special training programs, upon their request or if removed through no fault of their own (i.e., who have not been removed for performance, clinical skill deficiencies, rule violations or
2
1
misconduct), may be considered for transfer to other vacant bargaining unit positions for which they possess the necessary and requisite skills to perform the work or could acquire those skills within a reasonable amount of time. Failure of the Hospital to transfer a probationary nurse will not be subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of this Agreement.
(c)	A nurse transferring from one bargaining unit position to another bargaining unit position who has not successfully completed the probationary period shall be considered a probationary employee for the longer of sixty (60) days or the remainder of the original probationary period. A nurse transferring from one bargaining unit position to another bargaining unit position who has successfully completed the probationary period shall not be considered a probationary employee, but shall be subject to the trial period upon transfer (Section 1.4) if the transfer is outside the nurse’s CSA.
(d)	During the probationary period, a nurse may be discharged by the Hospital with or without cause and without recourse to the grievance or arbitration provisions of this Agreement.
§ 1.4	Trial Period Upon Transfer: A nurse transferring from one Clinical Service Area (“CSA”), as defined in Section 10.1 below, to another shall be on trial for twenty-five (25) scheduled and worked shifts. During such trial period, the Hospital may return the nurse to her/his former CSA. This trial period may be extended by the parties with mutual consent which shall be reduced to writing and signed by the parties. In the event that the nurse returns to her/his former CSA, the nurse shall be given her/his former position, if available, or if not available, an available staff nurse position within her/his CSA, If no position is available in the CSA, then the nurse will be offered a choice among current vacant staff nurse bargaining unit positions, provided that the nurse possesses the necessary and requisite skills to perform the work.

ARTICLE 2 MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
§ 2.1	The Union recognizes that the Hospital has the obligation of serving the public with the highest quality of medical care, efficiently and economically, and/or meeting medical emergencies. The Union further recognizes the right of the Hospital to operate and manage the hospital and that all management functions, rights and responsibilities which the Hospital has not modified or restricted by a specific provision of the Agreement are retained and vested exclusively in the Hospital. Such functions, rights, and responsibilities of management include, but are not limited to, the right to require standards of performance and to maintain order and efficiency; to direct employees and to determine job assignments and working schedules; to determine the materials and equipment to be used; to implement improved operational methods and procedures; to determine staffing requirements; to determine the kind and location of facilities; to determine whether the whole or any part of the operation shall continue to operate; to select and hire employees; to promote and transfer employees; to discipline, demote or discharge employees for just cause; to lay off employees for lack of work; to recall employees; to require overtime work of employees in an emergency where patient care so requires; to make or change Hospital rules, regulations, policies, and practices not inconsistent with the terms of the Agreement; to promulgate, modify, distribute, and enforce reasonable rules of employee conduct and manuals of operating procedures; to transfer work and to subcontract all or any portion of the work now or hereafter done by the employees covered hereby; and to generally manage the Hospital to attain and maintain full operating efficiency and optimum patient care. Only rules which are not inconsistent with this Agreement shall be promulgated by the Hospital.
The parties recognize that the above statement of management responsibilities is for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as restrictive or interpreted so as to exclude those prerogatives
4
not mentioned which are inherent to the management function. Provisions of this Agreement shall prevail over any past practices and working conditions which restrict management functions. The exercise by the Hospital of the rights reserved by this Article shall not be subject to the grievance or arbitration provisions herein except when such action or conduct by the Hospital is contrary to a specific provision of the Agreement.
ARTICLE 3 DISCIPLINE AND DISCHARGE
§ 3.1	Counseling: The Hospital will strive to address nurses’ performance problems in a non-disciplinary context. If a nurse has failed to meet established standards, but discipline is not deemed to be appropriate by the Hospital, the nurse’s immediate supervisor will meet with the nurse to discuss and to attempt to agree on written goals and/or expectations, and to suggest methods for achieving those goals or meeting those expectations. Any counseling activities (or the fact that counseling was not given) are not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures. Counseling is not a prerequisite to utilization of the discipline procedure outlined in Section 3.3. Documentation of any counseling shall not be sent to Human Resources for inclusion in a nurse’s personnel file.
§ 3.2	Discharge and Discipline for Just Cause:
(a)	The Hospital shall have the right to discharge, suspend without pay or impose other disciplinary action for just cause, provided, however, that the affected nurse shall have the right to defend himself/herself in connection with such action. Any disciplinary action must be initiated within ten (10) working days of the nurse’s immediate supervisor becoming aware of the conditions giving rise to the discipline. Initiate means that the Hospital has given the nurse written notice of 1) discipline, 2) intent to recommend discipline, or 3) an investigation and the possibility of disciplinary action. Discipline will
5
be administered within fifteen (15) working days of the nurse’s immediate supervisor becoming aware of the conditions giving rise to the discipline, provided that this period will be extended when circumstances beyond the Hospital’s control make it impossible to administer discipline within fifteen days. All dismissals or disciplinary suspensions shall be without pay. However, in the event a suspension or discharge is subsequently withdrawn or reversed in arbitration^ the nurse may receive retroactive pay and benefits, as deemed appropriate by the arbitrator.
(b)	Any disciplinary action may be appealed through the grievance and arbitration procedures of this Agreement. Upon request, the Union will be given copies of any documentation used to support discipline of a nurse, provided, however, that the Hospital has the right to withhold confidential or privileged information, including patient information. Documentation used to support discipline shall be provided, without charge, prior to or at the first grievance meeting. Any failure of the Hospital to supply documentation used to support discipline does not preclude its use in arbitration, provided, however, that such documentation is provided to the Union as soon as it has been discovered.
(c)	A nurse called by the Hospital to attend a disciplinary meeting or investigatory meeting which could lead to discipline shall have the right to union representation, which includes the right to interrupt a meeting that has already commenced to request union representation. It shall be the nurse’s responsibility to inform the Hospital that s/he wishes to have such representation. If no Union representative is available to attend a disciplinary meeting or investigation when it is called, the meeting will be delayed until a Union representative can be located. In no event will a meeting be delayed for more than twenty-four (24) hours. Regardless of any delay in a disciplinary meeting or investigatory meeting, nothing will prevent the Hospital from removing a nurse from work until a Union representative can be located for the disciplinary meeting or investigatory meeting.
6
(d)	When a supervisor has reason to correct and/or discipline a nurse,, it shall be done professionally. To the extent possible under the circumstances, discipline will be administered outside of the presence of other employees or the public. Nurses also are expected to conduct themselves, in a professional manner.
(e)	By August 1, 2004, and at such other times thereafter as the parties agree, the Hospital and the Union will make arrangements to jointly discuss the provisions of Article 3.2 at staff meetings on each unit and on all shifts.
§ 3.3	Discipline Procedure:
(a) Except for offenses constituting gross misconduct (which shall mean the deliberate or reckless disregard of standards of behavior that the Hospital rightfully expects and which shows a serious indifference to the interests of the Hospital, patients, and/or staff), the Hospital shall employ a system of progressive discipline, directed towards the goal of correction, as follows:
(1)	First Offense - Verbal Reprimand: In a verbal reprimand, a nurse will be informed of his/her failure to meet established standards, his/her performance deficiencies or misconduct. A verbal reprimand shall consist of a meeting between the nurse and his/her immediate supervisor, in which the supervisor will clarify goals and expectations and discuss ways of achieving those goals and expectations. A verbal reprimand will be documented.
(2)	Second Offense - Written Reprimand: In a written reprimand, a nurse will be provided with an explanation of his/her failure to meet established standards, and/or the deficiency or misconduct that must be corrected.
7
(3)	Third Offense - Discharge, Suspension or Other Disciplinary Action: Discharge, suspension or other disciplinary action shall require written notice to the nurse, setting forth the reason(s) for the action.	'■
J t
The above progressive disciplinary procedure (which does not apply to cases of gross misconduct) does not relate solely to each specified offense, but includes progressive discipline for any combination of offenses. In other words, a second offense not constituting gross misconduct shall subject the nurse to a written reprimand, whether or not it is the same offense as the first violation; similarly, the third offense not constituting gross misconduct shall subject the nurse to discharge or suspension, whether or not it is the same or different offense as the first and/or second violations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a nurse shall not be terminated under the progressive discipline system unless the nurse has been disciplined in the last eighteen (18) months for a similar offense; for the purposes of defining “similar” offenses under this paragraph, all'time and attendance related offenses are similar offenses, all clinical practice issues are similar offenses, and all other types of offenses are similar offenses. Any offense that is more than eighteen (18) months old shall not be considered in the above described progressive disciplinary procedure. Any offense that is more than eighteen (18) months old shall be removed from the nurse’s personnel file and placed in an inactive file to be used only for judicial and administrative proceedings, and in arbitrations, by either party, to show patterns and practices. Progressive discipline that is more than eighteen (18) months old may be referred to in arbitration only if it concerns a similar offense to the offense that is the subject of the pending arbitration.
ARTICLE 4 UNION RIGHTS
§ 4.1	Visitation: The Union’s authorized non-employee representative(s) shall be permitted access to the Hospital to ascertain
8
that this Agreement is being adhered to; provided, that such representative(s) give a designated Hospital official sufficient advance notice designating where and when reasonably possible, the date and time of the visit and the Hospital areas to be visited. Such access shall be limited to no more than two (2) representatives, unless the Hospital consents to a larger number. Such visits shall not interfere with or disturb employees in the performance of their work during working hours and shall not interfere with patient care.
§ 4.2	Representation: The Union may appoint a reasonable number of Shop Stewards in the bargaining unit. The Union shall provide the Hospital with a list of all Shop Stewards. All nurses, to the extent required by law, have the right to request the attendance, advice, and guidance of a Shop Steward or a Union Representative where reasonably available at any disciplinary conference or Step (1) grievance procedure.
§ 4.3	Union Bulletin Boards: The Hospital will provide space, in mutually agreeable locations, for two (2) Union Bulletin Boards. The boards will carry labels identifying them as Union Boards. In addition, the Hospital will provide one Union bulletin board per nursing unit, which may be used for the posting of notices of Union meetings or committee meetings, announcements of Union matters, or other items of official Union business.
§ 4.4	Bargaining Unit Information:
(a)	The Hospital will provide the Union each month with a list of all bargaining unit employees in electronic format. The listing will reflect name, home address, telephone number, employee number, hire date (Hospital seniority date), termination date (if applicable), classification status (e.g., full-time, part-time eligible, leave code status, etc.), base hourly wage rate, job code, unit/department assignment, date of birth, gender, and race. The Hospital will provide copies of bargaining unit vacancies on a bi-weekly basis. The Hospital also will
9
provide the Union with a copy of all discipline issued to bargaining unit nurses within five (5) working days of issuance.
(b)	Upon request from the Union, the Hospital will provide a copy of any existing Hospital or departmental policies or procedures relating to working conditions of bargaining unit nurses.;
§4.5	Maintenance of Membership/Agency Shop:
(a)	All bargaining unit members are required to pay either Union dues or agency fees. Any nurse who fails to pay such dues or agency fees shall, within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of written demand from the Union to the Hospital requesting his/her discharge, be discharged, if during such period, the required fees have not been tendered.
(b)	Any nurse now employed at the Hospital within the bargaining unit who is now a member of the Union and/or who becomes a member, or any nurse hired on or after the effective date of this Agreement who voluntarily joins the Union, may elect to change her/his status from member to agency fee payer if written notice is given to the Hospital and the Union within the ten (10) working days preceding the member’s anniversary date of membership. If such election is made, the nurse shall remain an agency fee payer for the remainder of this Agreement.
(c)	Nurses whose religious practices preclude them from joining or financially supporting the Union shall not be required to join the Union or pay either dues or agency fees to the Union. Instead, they shall be required to pay to the Union a sum equivalent to the agency fee which the Union shall donate to a non-religious charitable organization exempt from taxation under Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, as designated by the nurse and approved by the Union. Failure of the nurse to make these payments shall be treated the same as failure to pay Union dues or agency fees as stated in Section 4.5(a). A nurse shall
io
certify and affirm that s/he has a bona fide religious practice on a form provided by the Union.
§ 4.6	Dues Checkoff: The Hospital shall deduct monthly dues, except fines and penalties, as designated by the Union, from all nurses covered by this Agreement on the basis of individually, voluntarily signed authorization cards. Such monies shall be tendered by the Hospital to the Union within five (5) days following the second pay day of each month. Provided, however, that the Union agrees to indemnify the Hospital from any and all liabilities, claims, or proceedings the Hospital may suffer as a result of agreeing to be bound by this dues checkoff provision.
§ 4,7	Erroneous Payments: The Union agrees to refund any amounts remitted in error, upon presentation of evidence of error. The Hospital agrees to rectify errors in deducting dues or remittance of aggregate dues upon presentation of evidence of error.
§ 4.8	Orientation: The Union will be given at least thirty (30) days notice of the time, date, and physical location of nurse orientation, and will be permitted to schedule a thirty (30) minute address at each nurse orientation.
§ 4.9	Access:
(a)	If the Union provides ample advance notice setting forth specific dates and times requested for meeting room space, the Hospital will make reasonable efforts to provide non-unit-based meeting room space in the main Hospital building for the Union’s use for at least six (6) hours every other weekend and at least eight (8) hours on a weekday between 5:00 PM and 5:00 AM every other week, or, during the 120 days prior to the expiration of the Agreement, at least six (6) hours every weekend and at least eight (8) hours between 5:00 PM and 5:00 AM on a weekday every week. The Hospital will continue to make reasonable efforts to accommodate other reasonable requests for meeting room
ii
space on Hospital property at other time slots. The hours set forth above may not necessarily involve consecutive hours on a single day, and the parties recognize that the Hospital is not obligated to satisfy the specific requests of the Union with respect to times, days of the week, or locations.
(b)	The Hospital shall provide to the Union, during the term of this Agreement, a secure office in the East Building for the exclusive use of the Union, subject to the normal rules and limitations governing the use of office space at the Hospital. The office will be provided at a fair market rate determined by a third party who is mutually selected by the parties. The Hospital shall not be responsible for any injury or loss to any person or property relating to the use of the office.
ARTICLE 5 NON-DISCRIMINATION
§ 5.1	Non-Discrimination: Both the Hospital and the Union state that it is their policy to treat their employees/members without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, status as a veteran, political affiliation or belief, ethnic background, military draft status, or Union activity. The parties agree that procedures to redress claims of discrimination provided for by federal, state and/or local laws and regulations shall be the exclusive remedy for such claims and that the grievance and arbitration provisions of this Agreement shall not be invoked and shall not be applicable for the resolution of such claims unless the nurse notifies the Hospital’s Vice President for Human Resources, in writing, within fifteen (15) working days of the alleged discriminatory act or fifteen (15) working days from when the grievant became aware (or should have become aware) of the facts giving rise to the claim, of the specifics of the alleged discrimination and the nature of the discrimination charged. Compliance with this requirement shall be in addition to those grievance procedures set forth in Article 17.
12
ARTICLE 6 MAINTENANCE OF BENEFITS
§ 6.1	Except for a bona fide reclassification, no nurse covered by this Agreement whose wages are greater than those provided for elsewhere herein shall suffer a reduction in her/his wages.
ARTICLE 7 MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS
§ 7.1	(a) In the interest of safeguarding the health of employees and patients, the Hospital shall require nurses to take a medical examination prior to placement on the payroll. The Hospital may also require nurses to take medical examinations at such other times as the Hospital may thereafter deem advisable; provided, that the Hospital shall not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner in requiring such subsequent medical examinations. With the exception of the medical examination upon hire, a nurse, at her/his own expense, may have her/his own physician perform said medical examinations; provided, that the physician’s report of the results of the examination be on a medical form acceptable to the Hospital. A nurse’s medical records may be given to the nurse’s personal physician upon written request of the nurse.
(b) Nurses must complete all physical examination requirements prescribed by the District of Columbia. Nurses not meeting these requirements within 30 days of when their annual physical examination is due, are subject to suspension or such other action as may be necessary to obtain compliance with the District of Columbia regulations.
13
ARTICLE 8 SECURITY
§ 8.1	Examination of Packages: The Hospital may require a nurse carrying packages to and from the Hospital to submit such packages to inspection by the Hospital’s security force.
§ 8.2	Personnel Identification: For the protection of the Hospital’s patients and employees, the identification paraphernalia supplied by the Hospital must be worn or displayed in accordance with Hospital regulations.
§ 8.3	Lobbies and Waiting Rooms: Nurses may not use lobbies and waiting rooms since such areas are reserved for friends and relatives of patients.
ARTICLE 9 SENIORITY
§ 9.1	Definition: Hospital seniority is defined as length of continuous, uninterrupted service by the nurse with the Hospital and/or its predecessors. Nursing unit seniority is defined as length of continuous, uninterrupted service by the nurse in a nursing unit. The nurse’s seniority record will, upon request, be made available to the nurse in person at the Human Resources Office.
§ 9.2	Applicability of Seniority: Seniority shall govern only in respect to layoffs, recalls from layoff, and holiday scheduling as specified in Sections 10.4, 10.7, and 12.1 and shall also apply as indicated in Sections 11.2, 11.3, 11.10, 12.1, 23.1, 26.6, 34.6, and 36.1.
§ 9.3	Loss of Seniority: A nurse’s seniority shall be broken when she/he:
(a)	Quits, resigns, or retires.
14
(b)	Is discharged for cause.
(c)	Fails to return following the end of a leave of absence.
(d)	Fails to return to work within fourteen (14) calendar days after the Hospital has served notice of recall to her/him by letter.
(e)	Is laid off for a period of eighteen (18) months or the nurse’s length of employment, whichever is less.
§ 9.4	Restoration of Seniority
(a)	Any person who was employed by the Hospital as a nurse for at least twelve (12) consecutive months and is rehired as a nurse within one (1) year after a separation of employment will recover, for purposes of the circumstances specified in Section 9.2, all previously earned Hospital seniority.
(b)	Any nurse who left employment at the Hospital after January 1, 2000 and who is rehired by October 4, 2004 will recover, for purposes of the circumstances specified in Section 9.2, all previously earned Hospital seniority.
§ 9.5	Hiring Criteria: The Hospital will place newly hired nurses on the wage scale (Appendix A hereto) using the following criteria:
RN Experience (US or International)
Less than 12 months experience 12-23 months experience 24-35 months experience 36-47 months experience 48-59 months experience 60-71 months experience 72-83 months experience 84-95 months experience 96-107 months experience

For purposes of these hiring criteria, prior RN experience is defined as work as a Registered Nurse (requiring RN licensure) in an acute care, subacute care, nursing home, and/or long-term care facility. For nurses hired after April 4, 2004, prior experience in home health care will also be included for purposes of these hiring criteria. Newly hired nurses will be given credit for non-RN experience or RN experience other than the foregoing experience in accordance with Hospital practice. The Hospital will provide the Union with notice and, upon request, will bargain with the Union if the Hospital intends to change such Hospital practice. The proposed change will not be implemented without the Union’s agreement.
The Hospital will provide the Union with notice and, upon request, will bargain with the Union if the Hospital intends to place a newly hired nurse at a level and/or step higher on the wage scale than the nurse’s experience would warrant according to the hiring criteria or if it intends to give a newly hired nurse credit for greater than one hundred fifty-six (156) months of experience. While the Union will consider any demonstrable market developments and/or operational changes relating to such proposed change, any such change will not be implemented without the Union’s agreement.
The Hospital will give the Union two (2) weeks’ notice of its intent to change the sign-on bonus, referral bonus, and/or relocation reimbursement program(s).

(b)	The parties recognize that the Hospital may need to change CSAs during the term of the Agreement to address operational or
17
patient care needs. The Hospital will provide the Union with not less than forty-five (45) days’ notice prior to implementation and, at the Union’s request, shall meet with the Union for purposes of discussion, clarification, and bargaining over the effects on nurses impacted by the change.
(c)	The layoff and recall provisions in Sections 10.4 and 10.7 of this Agreement shall be applied to any layoffs or recalls utilizing the CSA structure that existed at the time of the notice of the layoff.
§ 10.2	Notice of Reduction in Force/Layoff: The Union and the affected nurse(s) will be given notice of any reduction in force/layoff not less than sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of the reduction in force/layoff.
§ 10.3	Superseniority: Shop stewards and officers of the Union shall be the last laid off where they possess the necessary and requisite skills and ability to perform required patient care. The Union shall be limited to no more than thirty (30) persons who shall be permitted to exercise such superseniority. Among officers, the President shall have the greatest seniority followed by the Vice President, Chief Shop Steward, Treasurer, Corresponding Secretary, Recording Secretary, Executive Board Members At-Large (in the order designated by the Union) and Shop Stewards (in the order designated by the Union). The Union will provide the Hospital with an initial written list of the persons holding these positions by May 4, 2004 and will subsequently provide written notice of any changes as they occur, which will become effective five (5) working days after the Hospital receives such notice; provided, however, that if there is a change in any Union officer or Shop Steward within this five (5) day period as a result of a Union election, the new officer or Shop Steward will replace the individual who previously held her/his Union position for superseniority purposes. All those claiming “superseniority” pursuant to this Section 10.3 must be eligible therefore under the law as it exists when superseniority rights are claimed or exercised. Shop Stewards may function wherever needed.
18
§ 10.4	Procedure for Reduction in Force/Layoff: When in the judgment of the Hospital it becomes necessary to effect a reduction in force/layoff, the Hospital shall give the Union the notices specified in Section 10.2 of this Agreement, and shall supply to the Union information concerning the bargaining unit positions to be affected and existing vacancies, if any. In the event of a reduction in force/layoff, no vacancy shall be deemed unavailable in the selection process specified below on the basis that any temporary nurse is working in the Hospital. After notice of reduction in force/layoff is provided, all bargaining unit vacancies will be frozen (including new hires and transfers) until the conclusion of the ten (10) day displacement interview period specified below.
The Hospital agrees to confer with the Union, and upon request, to explain the information provided and/or discuss the impending action. It is expressly agreed, however, that the Hospital shall have no obligation to negotiate with the Union concerning its decision to effect a reduction in force/layoff nor shall the parties be required to reach an agreement on the Hospital’s decision: (1) to effect a reduction in force/layoff; or (2) to select which nurses are to be laid off in accordance with this Agreement; or (3) to select which positions are to be abolished; or (4) any other aspect of the decision to effect a reduction in force/layoff.
Displacement interviews (in which nurses participate in the reduction in force/layoff procedure outlined below) must be scheduled and concluded within ten (10) working days of notice of the reduction in force/layoff. Upon advance notice to the Hospital, a Union designee may attend the displacement interview when so requested by the affected nurse to be interviewed.
In the event of a reduction in force/layoff, such reductions in force/layoffs shall be by inverse order of Hospital seniority. The following reduction in force/layoff procedure shall apply. A nurse may select any option within the First Round. If a nurse is unable to obtain a position in the First Round, the nurse may select any option within the
19
Second Round. If the nurse is unable to obtain a position within the Second Round or is unsuccessful during orientation, the nurse shall be laid off with all rights and benefits afforded under this Agreement in the event of a layoff.
(a)	First Round
(1)	Select any vacancy within the nurse’s CSA provided that the nurse possesses the necessary and requisite skills to perform the work, and can become oriented for the job within twenty (20) scheduled and worked shifts, excluding certification classes, provided, however, that the nurse successfully completes the certification course when next offered, even if it is necessary for the nurse to attend the certification classes on non-work time;
OR
(2)	Select any vacancy in any other CSA, provided that the nurse possesses the necessary and requisite skills to perform the work, and can become oriented for the job within twenty-five (25) scheduled and worked shifts, exclusive of any certification classes. It is agreed and understood, however, that such certification classes must be successfully completed when next offered even if it is necessary for the nurse to attend on non-work time.
If a nurse cannot select a vacancy within her/his same CSA, the period in which the nurse may be allowed to complete the orientation course can.be reasonably extended beyond twenty-five (25) scheduled and worked shifts for a maximum of ten (10) additional shifts, if the nurse so requests. In this instance also, the certification course must be successfully completed when next offered even if it is necessary for the nurse to attend on non-work time;
OR
20
1
(3)	Bump (displace) the least senior nurse based on Hospital seniority with the same shift and hours within the nurse’s CSA, provided that the nurse possesses the necessary and requisite skills to perform the work, and can become oriented within ten (10) scheduled and worked shifts. In the event there is no less senior nurse with the same shift and hours within the nurse’s CSA, the nurse may bump (displace) the least senior nurse based on Hospital seniority within the nurse’s CSA, provided that the nurse possesses the necessary and requisite skills to perform the work, and can become oriented within ten (10) scheduled and worked shifts.
(b)	Second Round
If the nurse is unable to obtain a position in the First Round:
(1)	Bump (displace) the least senior nurse based on Hospital seniority with the same shift and hours within any other CSA, provided that the nurse possesses the necessary and requisite skills to perform the work, and can become oriented within ten (10) scheduled and worked shifts. In the event there is no less senior nurse with the same shift and hours within any other CSA, the nurse may bump (displace) the least senior nurse based on Hospital seniority within any other CSA, provided that the nurse possesses the necessary and requisite skills to perform the work, and can become oriented within ten (10) scheduled and worked shifts;
OR
(2)	Apply for competitive transfer for any open position.
(c)	Resignations
If a position is offered but rejected, or if the nurse declines to exercise available options specified above, the nurse shall be considered
21
as having resigned and, therefore, shall not be entitled to any of the rights and benefits afforded to laid off nurses under the terms and conditions of this Agreement. However, no part-time or full-time nurse shall be considered to have resigned unless she/he declines a position with the same status. For the purposes of this provision, “status” is defined as part-time or full-time.
(d)	Subsequent Transfers
A nurse who loses his/her position in a reduction-in-force and who obtains a vacant position in the reduction-in-force process (i.e., who does not displace another nurse) may later transfer to an available position without being subject to a waiting period for transfer.
§ 10.5	Severance: In the event of a permanent layoff due to a reduction in force or abolishment of a position, nurses permanently laid-off shall be paid severance pay equal to two (2) eight (8) hour shifts of straight time pay for each full year of consecutive credited service with the Hospital, up to a maximum of sixty (60) days of pay.
§ 10.6	Retraining: In the event of a layoff due to a reduction in force, abolishment of position(s), or closing of unit(s), the Hospital shall, following the selection process outlined in Section 10.4 and prior to expiration of the 60-day notice period, provide affected nurses with the opportunity to attend, at no cost, an eight-hour career counseling/job search workshop sponsored by the Hospital.
§ 10.7	Recall: Recall to work shall be in the inverse order of layoff; the last nurse laid off shall be the first nurse recalled. No new nurse(s) shall be hired until all laid off nurses are given an opportunity to return to work. The requirements of the preceding two (2) sentences shall not be applicable in any case of (i) emergency and/or (ii) where the nurse entitled to recall did not return within the time limits set forth in Section 9.3(d) and/or (iii) when the nurse does not possess the necessary and requisite skills to perform the work. Nurses laid off shall be
22
returned to their former positions, if available. If the position is not available, the nurse shall be given the first opportunity, on a Hospital seniority basis, to fill a vacancy in any CSA for which the nurse is qualified, or may become qualified after a normal orientation period specific to that unit. Layoff status and the accompanying recall rights shall be available only to those nurses who are not actively employed by the Hospital.
ARTICLE 11 HOURS OF WORK, OVERTIME
§ 11.1	Hours: The established workweek shall be the seven day period beginning at 12:01 a.m. Sunday ending at 12 midnight on the following Saturday. Each pay period consists of two workweeks. The parties to this Agreement recognize that:
(1)	Proper care and treatment of patients is the primary consideration,
(2)	This care and treatment is continuous in nature, and
(3)	The Hospital retains the authority to prescribe assignments, hours and shifts, except as expressly modified by a specific provision of the Agreement, to insure adequate professional care and treatment to the patients.
§ 11.2	Overtime:
(a)	General. Because the Hospital must provide continuous patient care 24 hours a day, certain nurses may be scheduled to work more than 40 regular hours in one work week and less than 40 regular hours in another week of the same period. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee by the Hospital of hours worked per day, per week, or per year. Nurses shall report dressed and ready for work at their job location and quit work at their job location at the time
23
scheduled as the beginning and end of their assigned shift, unless working overtime as otherwise provided in this section.
(b)	Overtime Pay. Overtime is hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek. Such hours will be paid at time and one-half (I/2 ) the nurse’s regular hourly rate, as defined by applicable law. Holiday hours, required educational leave (limited to on-premises instructional time), and any other hours for which overtime payment is required by law shall be considered as hours worked for purposes of computing overtime. There shall be no duplication or pyramiding in the computation of overtime and other premium wages, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require the payment of overtime and other premium pay more than once for the same hours worked, unless it is expressly provided for in this Section 11.2.
(c)	Authorization. A nurse shall be paid overtime if required or permitted to work overtime. It is expected that all overtime will be authorized in advance, unless not reasonably possible. A nurse who works overtime shall be paid overtime whether authorized in advance or not. A supervisor shall have authority to direct a nurse not to work overtime, and nurses shall be required to comply with such direction, but may grieve any discipline imposed.
(d)	Voluntary Scheduled Overtime and Other Extra Shifts. After initial posting but prior to commencement of a six-week schedule, nurses may volunteer for additional shifts beyond their regular hours, including overtime hours. Provided that nurses volunteer within the established extra shifts volunteer period designated on each unit, preference in filling such shifts will be given in the following order: 1) permanent clinical nurses on the unit 2) qualified permanent clinical nurses from other units 3) Float Pool nurses 4) temporary nurses. When more than one permanent clinical nurse signs up for the same shift, it will be assigned equitably. Should the equitable assignment process result in a “tie” between two or more permanent clinical nurses for the same shift, nursing unit seniority will determine who is assigned the
24
shift. If a nurse’s voluntary scheduled overtime shift is cancelled after she/he reports to work, she/he shall be paid a minimum of two (2) hours pay at the nurse’s base rate, provided, however, this payment will not apply to a nurse who elects to go home pursuant to Section 11.10(d).
(e)	Mandatory Overtime.Mandatory overtime will be assigned in rotating, inverse order of nursing unit seniority (with consideration of specialties) and a seniority list (with place in rotation indicated) will be posted on the unit. Absent special circumstances, a minimum of ninety (90) minutes advance notice will be given to any nurse assigned mandatory overtime, and such nurse shall be provided a reasonable opportunity from within the Hospital to make arrangements for home and family responsibilities.
(f)	Restrictions on Mandatory Overtime. On all nursing units other than those referenced in subsection (g) below, the Hospital will assign mandatory overtime only to meet urgent patient care needs after soliciting volunteers on that day to perform such work and seeking to fill needs with qualified temporary nurses. An urgent patient care need means a situation which develops suddenly and unexpectedly and which creates an immediate need for a nurse to provide care. It does not include elective cases, meal/break coverage, or other kinds of non-urgent care. No nurse shall be assigned more than one occurrence of mandatory overtime in a six-week schedule, provided, however, that nurses who have already been assigned one occurrence of mandatory overtime may need to work beyond a scheduled shift to provide safe care to patients. An occurrence is defined as anything equal to or greater than thirty (30) minutes. The maximum duration of each occurrence shall be four (4) hours. In the event a nurse is scheduled to work within eight (8) hours after the end of a mandatory overtime occurrence, the Hospital will, absent compelling need(s), excuse the nurse from that shift for up to two (2) hours, provided the nurse so requests by the end of the overtime occurrence. A nurse who works mandatory overtime will not be required to work more than sixteen and one-half (16 Vi ) hours in a twenty-four (24) hour period.
25
(g)	Specialty Areas. When extra work in addition to a nurse’s scheduled shift is required on an involuntary basis in the Operating Rooms, Cath Lab, EP Lab, Interventional Radiology, MedStar Services, or PACU, the Hospital will pay a bonus of forty percent (40%) of the regular hourly rate for each hour of extra required work (regardless of whether the nurse is in overtime status). Before assigning extra work for which the 40% bonus is payable, the Hospital will solicit volunteers on that day to perform such work and will seek to fill needs with qualified temporary nurses. A nurse who volunteers on that day to perform extra work so that another nurse will not be required to perform such extra work involuntarily will be paid the 40% hourly bonus for each hour worked as such a volunteer; in the absence of a volunteer, the bonus shall be payable to the nurse required to perform extra work on an involuntary basis on that day. The 40% bonus is payable only when the involuntary extra work is one (1) hour or more in duration; after the one (1) hour period is reached, the 40% bonus is payable for the entire period of involuntary extra work, including that first one (1) hour. On these units, no nurse shall be required to work more than five (5) occurrences of extra work in addition to a nurse’s scheduled shifts in two (2) consecutive six-week schedules, provided, however, that nurses who have already been assigned five occurrences of extra work in two (2) six-week schedules may need to work beyond a scheduled shift to provide safe care to patients. An occurrence is defined as anything equal to or greater than a one (1) hour period. The maximum duration of each occurrence shall be four (4) hours. Instances of involuntary extra work beyond nurses’ scheduled shifts for periods of less than one (1) hour which are believed to be excessive is an appropriate topic for review by the Labor-Management Committee.
(h)	Right to Refuse Mandatory Overtime. A nurse may refuse a mandatory overtime assignment due to extreme personal fatigue, illness or other special circumstances. However, a nurse who refuses a mandatory overtime assignment will be required to work on the next occasion necessitating a mandatory overtime assignment (with
26
I
consideration of specialties) and shall not be exempted from the maximum number of mandatory overtime assignments applicable to his/her unit. In addition, if all nurses available for a mandatory overtime assignment refuse such assignment, the least senior nurse will be obligated to assume the mandatory overtime assignment, regardless of personal circumstances. The Hospital will make reasonable efforts to fill the assignment before the least senior nurse is obligated to assume it.
(i)	Separate Checks. The Hospital has authority to pay for overtime, premiums or any other form of compensation except regular straight time pay, in checks separate from regular paychecks. Any nurse who in addition to working a full forty (40) hour normal rotation also agrees in advance and works at the Hospital’s request a full extra scheduled shift of eight (8), ten (10), or twelve (12) hours, whichever is appropriate, may, consistent with this Section 11.2, receive in a separate check pay for such work at the rate of 1 % times her/his regular hourly rate. As of April 4, 2005, the Hospital may discontinue the separate check option, provided that it notifies the Union six (6) months prior to doing so.
§ 11.3	Scheduling:
(a)	Self Scheduling:
(i)	Self scheduling practices shall be utilized on every unit. If a unit does not currently utilize self scheduling practices, they shall be implemented by September 30, 2004.
(ii)	A time schedule, citing work shifts and days off in six week increments, shall be posted no later than two weeks prior to the commencement date of the schedule. These time schedules shall be at least six weeks in duration. Any changes in the schedule shall not be arbitrary. A nurse shall be notified of changes in the nurse’s schedule either in person or by a telephone call to the nurse’s telephone number of record.
27
(iii)	Nurses may submit their preferences for the next time schedule by no later than four (4) weeks prior to the commencement date of that schedule. After application of the unit’s self scheduling practices, the Hospital will approve the final schedule, and the Hospital will not arbitrarily deny any nurse’s submitted preference.
(iv)	Subject to departmental self scheduling rules (e.g., rotational and permanent shift requirements, etc.), priority in scheduling shall be afforded in the following order: 1) permanent clinical nurses, 2) Float Pool nurses, 3) temporary nurses. Shifts for which more than one permanent clinical nurse signs up will be assigned equitably. Should the equitable assignment process result in a “tie” between two or more permanent nurses for the same shift, nursing unit seniority will determine who is assigned the shift. Permanent clinical nurses and Float Pool nurses can, in scheduling shifts in addition to their regular schedule, displace temporary nurses who are not under contract and work the shifts those temporary nurses are scheduled to work, provided one week’s notice has been given to the Hospital.
(b)	Shift Flexibility
(i)	Each nurse may register his/her preference for length of shift (e.g., eight (8), ten (10), and/or twelve (12) hours) and may revise that designation from time to time (at least four weeks prior to the commencement of a time schedule). If a nurse registers a preference for eight (8) hour shifts exclusively, he/she shall be scheduled exclusively for eight (8) hour shifts. The Hospital will make a good faith effort to schedule nurses consistent with submitted preferences for twelve (12) hour shifts, or for ten (10) hour shifts on units where the Department Head assigns such shifts.
(ii)	Nurses will not be scheduled on the six-week schedule to work two consecutive eight (8) hour shifts (or sixteen (16) hours) in a 24-hour period unless they volunteer for such shifts.
28
I
(iii)	Upon giving notice to the Department Head no later than four (4) weeks prior to the commencement of the six-week schedule, a nurse scheduled for a night shift will be granted at least forty-five (45) hours off before being rotated to a day or evening shift. Such notice will remain in effect unless and until the nurse rescinds it. Rotation to evening or night shifts can be less than, but will be no more than, fifty percent (50%) of scheduled shifts per six-week schedule, unless a nurse volunteers for more rotation. Following orientation and training programs, scheduled rotation shall be limited to two (2) shifts (D/E, E/N, D/N).
(iv)	Consistent with self scheduling practices, and with Hospital consent, permanent clinical nurses on a unit may elect (using consensus decision-making) to trial/pilot an all-eight (8) or all-twelve (12) hour shift option. The trial/pilot length will be determined by the permanent clinical nurses on that unit, but the length of the trial/pilot period shall not be longer than six (6) months without the consent of the Union.
(c)	Permanent Shifts:
(i)	Nurses who were, or are in the future, expressly hired for or transferred into permanent shifts shall be entitled, at their option, to remain in such shifts while employed on their unit and shall be scheduled exclusively for day, evening or night shifts. The Hospital shall establish staffing levels on all shifts (e.g., days, evenings, nights, 12-hour A-P, 12-hour P-A), consistent with section 30.3.
(ii)	Permanent shift positions, under which nurses will be scheduled exclusively for a specified shift, shall be established and posted (including a posting on the unit) for each nursing unit that regularly schedules such shifts.
29
I
(iii)	When a permanent shift position becomes vacant, it will be posted as provided in Section 20.1. The applicant from within the unit with the most nursing unit seniority will be given the position. If there are no applicants from within the unit, the most qualified applicant shall be given the position. Where applicants are substantially equally qualified, the position will be given to the nurse with the most Hospital seniority in the following order: permanent full-time nurses, followed by permanent part-time eligible nurses, followed by Float Pool nurses. A nurse who transfers to a permanent shift position on another nursing unit must successfully complete an orientation period for the first twenty-five (25) scheduled and worked shifts prior to receiving the permanent shift on that unit. A temporary nurse may be utilized to staff a permanent shift vacancy only until such time as a permanent clinical nurse has applied and been accepted for the vacancy.
(d)	Nurses holding permanent evening and night shift positions will receive the 20% permanent evening shift differential or 25% permanent night differential, payable as set forth in Section 11.6. Consistent with existing practice, nurses holding permanent evening or night shifts (or permanent day shifts, as defined in subsection (f) below) may be subject to scheduling of on-call shifts on different shifts.
(e)	The Hospital shall have the right to offer evening and night shift scheduling on a “semi-permanent” basis, under which nurses will receive the permanent evening or night shift differential for the period of their semi-permanent appointment to evening or night shifts. Semi-permanent evening or night shift positions (also known as “Non-Prime-Time Shifts”) will be offered for a three-month period of time (12 weeks), and nurses will receive for that period the 20% permanent evening differential or 25% permanent night differential, payable as set forth in Section 11.6. Designation of these Non-Prime-Time shifts will correspond with the posting of each six-week schedule. No nurse shall be bumped from a permanent evening or night shift position in order for another nurse to receive a “semi-permanent” Non-Prime-Time Shift. Any nurse accepting a Non-Prime-Time Shift will be returned to her/his
30
rotational pattern (D/E or D/N or permanent days) upon completion of the assignment, unless she or he requests another Non-Prime-Time Shift. If the nurse requests another Non-Prime-Time Shift, the Hospital will review the selected options and then elect whether to post the Non-Prime Shift schedule or return the nurse to her/his rotational options, i.e., D/E, D/N, etc. Nurses not completing their agreement to work three months in a Non-Prime-Time Shift, exclusive of unforeseen and extraordinary circumstances, will have the appropriate funds (the difference between the permanent differential and rotational differential) deducted from their paycheck over a period of 12 weeks or 6 pay periods. Nurses terminating employment will have the difference between the permanent differential and the rotational differential deducted from their final paycheck and/or PDOs.
(f)	Permanent Day Shift Assignments:
(i)	The Hospital will have permanent day shift assignments in all nursing units which currently operate on a rotating shift basis under the following terms:
Permanent shift assignments will be available, as specified in (ii) below, to any full-time nurse with a minimum of three (3) years* Hospital seniority, as defined in Section 9.1 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Part-time eligible nurses with the required seniority may become full-time nurses in order to become eligible for a permanent shift assignment, provided they remain on a permanent full-time basis.
(ii)	Permanent day shift assignments will be made for all nursing units where rotational shifts occur on the following formula:
1-10 authorized weekday (excluding WIN) FTE staff nurses: 1 permanent day shift position;
31
11-16 authorized weekday (excluding WIN) FTE staff nurses: 2 permanent day shift positions;
17-30 authorized weekday (excluding WIN) FTE staff nurses: 4 permanent day shift positions;
31-40 authorized weekday (excluding WIN) FTE staff nurses: 5 permanent day shift positions;
41-50 authorized weekday (excluding WIN) FTE staff nurses: 6 permanent day shift positions;
51 or more authorized weekday (excluding WIN) FTE staff nurses: 7 permanent day shift positions.
36-Hour Scheduling Option positions may be designated as permanent day shift positions and, when so designated, will be included in the formula specified above.
(iii)	The permanent day shift provisions specified above shall not apply to the Operating Rooms. Instead, in the Operating Rooms, effective with the first full six-week schedule after the effective date of this Agreement, there shall be at least fifteen (15) permanent day shift positions in the Main Operating Room and there shall be at least eight (8) permanent day shift positions in the Third Floor Operating Room. Vacancies in these positions shall be filled based upon nursing unit seniority. The Operating Room Subcommittee of the Labor-Management Committee will explore the possibility of increasing the number of permanent day shift positions in the Operating Rooms.
(g)	An eligible nurse may transfer to another nursing unit which has a permanent day shift position vacancy for the purpose of obtaining such a position provided that:
32
1
a.	the individual does not “bump” another nurse;
b.	the individual applies and is selected for the position pursuant to Article 20; and
c.	the individual successfully completes an orientation period for the first twenty-five (25) scheduled and worked shifts prior to receiving a permanent shift assignment on that unit.
(h)	Any nurse who requests and then receives a permanent shift assignment may return to a rotating assignment upon request. Such nurses shall remain eligible for any future permanent shift vacancy which may occur.
(i)	Nothing herein shall affect the overtime or shift differential provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, or shall prevent the nurse from requesting special days off in accordance with established unit routine.
(j)	Notices concerning permanent shift vacancies will be posted in accordance with Section 20.1, except that vacancies will be kept open for 2 weeks. Notwithstanding Section 11.3(c), selection of the permanent day shift assignment will be based on Hospital seniority.
(k)	A nurse who holds a permanent day shift assignment and who applies for and is granted a 36-Hour Scheduling Option position on his/her unit will retain his/her permanent day shift assignment, provided however that the position will still count toward the available permanent day shift positions in the unit, as set forth in subparagraphs (f)(ii) and (f)(iii) above.
(1)	Weekend Staffing: Consistent with Section 11.6(d), the Hospital will strive to staff weekend shifts with WIN nurses and to
33
reduce the number of weekend shifts that permanent clinical nurses are required to work. When necessary to make any weekend assignments, the Hospital will first solicit volunteers from among the permanent clinical nurses, Float Pool nurses, and temporary nurses on the unit. If sufficient volunteers are not readily available or are otherwise insufficient to meet needs, permanent clinical nurses may be required to work weekends. All temporary nurses with fixed term contracts will work at least the same number of weekend shifts as permanent clinical nurses on the unit. Although weekend scheduling shall be within the discretion of the Hospital, where circumstances permit, and where optimum patient care will not be adversely affected, the Hospital shall make every reasonable effort to schedule nurses every other weekend off duty. Permanent clinical nurses (other than WIN) with more than twenty-five (25) years of Hospital seniority shall not be required to work more than every third weekend, provided that no other permanent clinical nurse on the unit will have to work more than every other weekend. On units in which permanent clinical nurses with more than twenty-five (25) years of Hospital seniority are required to work more than every third weekend, the opportunity to work no more than every third weekend will be rotated based on Hospital seniority. If a nurse who is scheduled to work on a weekend is unable to do so for any reason (except actual confinement in a hospital on an inpatient basis), the Hospital retains the right to reschedule the nurse and have her/him work a future weekend on which she/he was previously scheduled to be off. In such event, the nurse shall normally be scheduled for an alternate day(s) off. For these purposes the word “weekend” shall be defined as “Friday and Saturday” or “Saturday and Sunday” or “Sunday and Monday.” There shall be no split weekends, unless the nurse so agrees.
§ 11.4	Rest Periods: Whenever patient care coverage permits, Department Heads shall attempt to schedule two (2) fifteen (15) minute rest periods, one each half of the work day, for each nurse. Rest periods shall be taken, whenever possible, off the patient care area. Notwithstanding the above, the scheduling of rest periods shall remain wholly within the discretion of each Department Head, and a nurse shall
34
not be entitled to any compensation for any missed rest period(s), whether scheduled or not.
§ 11.5	Meal Time: When patient care coverage permits, nurses shall be allowed one thirty (30) minute break for eating a meal in an eight or more hour shift per day. Meal time shall not be restricted to Hospital premises. When in event of emergencies, or because of inadequate patient care coverage, as determined by the Hospital, a nurse is not able to take her/his meal time break, she/he shall be compensated for the missed meal time at her/his regular hourly rate, including shift differential as it applies.
§ 11.6	Shift Differential:
(a)	A nurse accepting and working a permanent shift assignment of at least three months’ duration shall receive a shift differential of twenty (20) percent for all hours actually worked between 3:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. if the majority of hours worked are between 12:00 Noon and 11:00 p.m. There shall be no differential for nurses who do not work a majority of hours during the time periods set forth in this Section 11.6(a).
If a nurse does not accept and work a permanent shift assignment of at least three months duration, the shift differential during the term of this Agreement shall be ten (10) percent.
(b)	A nurse accepting and working a permanent shift assignment of at least three months duration shall receive a shift differential of twenty-five (25) percent for all hours actually worked between 3:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. if the majority of hours worked are between 11:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. There shall be no differential for nurses who do not work a majority of hours during the time periods set forth in this Section 11.6(b).
35
If a nurse does not accept and work a permanent shift assignment of at least three months duration, the shift differential during the term of this Agreement shall be fifteen (15) percent,
(c)	An additional $5,00 will be paid for each hour of all scheduled weekend shifts (of 8, 10, and 12 hour allotments) worked by weekday (non-WIN) nurses who are not eligible for time and one-half the regular hourly rate, as set forth in Section 11.2, i.e., nurses who have not worked a full forty (40) hour normal rotation or do not. work the entire extra shift. For this purpose, weekend shall be defined as Saturday and Sunday, from 7:00 a.m. on Saturday until 7:30 a.m. on Monday; provided that the weekend for those working in the Emergency Room shall be from 8:00 a.m. on Saturday until 8:30 a.m. on Monday.
(d)	24-Hour Weekend Incentive Nurse (WIN) Positions: It is the intent of the Hospital to meet weekend patient care needs by seeking to fill 300 WIN positions. The Hospital will not reduce the cunent number of WIN positions. The Hospital has discretion with respect to establishing and filling more than 300 WIN positions. In filling WIN positions, the provisions of Section 11.3 will apply.
(i)	Definition of Position: A nurse holding a 24-Hour WIN position is a part-time nurse regularly assigned to work two (2) 12-hour shifts, designated as day or night shifts, on weekends.
(ii)	Shift Definitions: Weekend WIN shifts are designated either as day shifts or night shifts. Day shifts are shifts beginning at or after 4:00 a.m. but before 4:00 p.m. (e.g., 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., 11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., etc.). Night shifts are those beginning at or after 4:00 p.m. but before 4:00 a.m. (e.g., 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., 11:00 p.m. to 11:00 a.m., etc.). The weekend is generally defined for the purposes of the WIN program as shifts starting on Saturday or Sunday, provided, however, that, at the discretion of Nursing senior management, the weekend may be defined differently for selected units with little or no coverage needs on certain weekend shifts.
36
WIN nurses will not be required to rotate to shifts other than those associated with their WIN position (i.e., a day shift WIN nurse will not be required to rotate on the schedule to WIN night shifts).
(iii)	Bonus for WIN positions: A 24-Hour WIN nurse shall receive a bonus of 10/24 their base hourly rate for all weekend day shift hours actually worked (for a total bonus of 10 hours for a 24-hour weekend worked) or a bonus of 14/24 their base hourly rate for all weekend night shift hours actually worked (for a total bonus of 14 hours for a 24-hour weekend worked). No shift differential shall be payable to WIN nurses for scheduled weekend shifts, and WIN nurses are not eligible for the $5.00 bonus under Section 11.6(c) for weekend work.
(iv)	Additional Shift on Weekday: A nurse holding a 24-Hour WIN position may request to work additional shifts on weekdays. The Hospital will make a good faith effort to accommodate such requests, with special consideration given to requests to serve as preceptors on weekdays. WIN nurses working an additional weekday shift will be compensated for shift differential for the weekday shift in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement applicable to such hours, provided, however, that they will not be eligible for the “permanent” evening and night shift differential rates.
§11.7 On-Call:
(a)	Nurses may, at times, be required to keep themselves on-call for return to work. Nurses shall be given the opportunity to self schedule on-call shifts as set forth in Section 11.3(a)(i). If self scheduling does not result in full on-call coverage, the Hospital will schedule the remaining on-call shifts. In assigning on-call shifts, the Hospital will consider the potential impact on patient safety of a nurse working the combination of scheduled and on-call hours. Temporary nurses on fixed-term contracts with the necessary and requisite skills to perform the work shall have the same on-call requirements as full-time clinical nurses on the same unit. For units that do not operate 24 hours a
37
day, 7 days a week, on-call shifts shall not be consecutive unless the nurse agrees otherwise. In the event a nurse is scheduled to work within eight (8) hours after working an on-call shift, the Hospital will, absent compelling need(s), excuse the nurse from the scheduled shift for up to two (2) hours, provided the nurse so requests by the end of the on-call shift.
(b)	Nurses on-call will be paid at twenty-five percent (25%) of their base rate of pay for hours in an on-call status, provided however, nurses working in the Operating Room will be paid $12.00 per hour for hours in on-call status. On-call status will begin at a specified time and will end at a specified time or upon return to duty, whichever is earlier. Regular duty status for pay purposes will begin when nurses return to work. On-call time shall not be considered as hours worked for purposes of computing overtime and on-call pay shall not be included in the regular rate for purposes of computing overtime pursuant to Section 11.2(d). If an on-call nurse is required to be physically present in the Hospital, she/he shall be paid at fifty percent (50%) of her/his base rate of pay. On-premises on-call (but not off-premises on-call time) shall be counted as hours worked for purposes of computing overtime.
(c)	A nurse will not be assigned to call duty outside her or his own unit. Call schedules will be utilized to provide staffing needs for unit emergencies and/or procedures which have not been recorded on the unit’s procedure schedule prior to the day of the call work and to flex staffing on a particular unit.
(d)	With respect to on-call duty in the Operating Rooms, call team assignments will be posted for the purpose of voluntary sign-up at the beginning of the preceding six (6) week schedule and will remain available for two (2) weeks into the preceding schedule. Voluntary signup will be handled in the following order: first, permanent clinical nurses, then Float Pool nurses, and then temporary nurses. On-call shifts for which more than one permanent clinical nurse signs up will be assigned equitably. At the conclusion of the voluntary sign-up period,
38
the remaining call shifts will be assigned. Once the schedule is posted, all assigned call will be documented and analyzed by the Operating Room Subcommittee of the Labor-Management Committee for the identification of trends. Following the review, any demonstrated trend found consistently over a six (6) month period of time will be forwarded to the Nursing Director, Perioperative Services. Utilization of on-call in the Operating Rooms is an appropriate topic for the Operating Room Subcommittee of the Labor-Management Committee.
§ 11.8	Call-Back Pay: Any nurse who is called back to work before or after her/his regular shift shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours’ call-back pay at the regular hourly rate and a minimum of four hours shall be credited as hours worked for purposes of computing overtime.
§ 11.9	Float Pool Nurses:
(a) Scope of Coverage and Salary: Language in Article 1 of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, members of the Float Pool in Department 110 (hereinafter called “Float Pool Nurses”), irrespective of the number of hours per week or per pay period they work or are scheduled to work, shall not be covered by any of the wage or benefit related provisions of this Agreement including but not limited to Articles 11 through 16, Article 23, Article 26, Article 34, and Articles 36 and 37, inclusive of the wage scale attached as Appendix A to this Agreement, provided, however, that the hourly rate of pay for Float Pool nurses shall be $35.13 per hour for weekday day shifts, $37.32 for weekday evening shifts, $39.52 for weekday night shifts; $38.43 for weekend day shifts; $40.62 for weekend evening shifts; and $42.81 for weekend night shifts. The foregoing rates of pay shall go into effect on April 4, 2004. Solely for the purposes of this section applicable to Float Pool Nurses, a day shift is a shift starting on or after 5:00 AM but before 2:00 PM; an evening shift is a shift starting on or after 3:00 PM but before 7:00 PM; a night shift is a shift starting on or after 7:00 PM but before 5:00 AM; and a weekend shift is one starting on or after 5:00 AM
39
I
Saturday but before 5:00 AM Monday. The hourly pay rates set forth I	above shall increase by two percent (2%) effective April 17, 2005, and
1	shall increase again by two percent (2%) effective April 16, 2006.
I	■'<
I	Float Pool nurses will not be placed on call unless they volunteer
1	for such duty; if placed on call, Float Pool nurses will receive on-call
1	pay as set forth in Section 11.7. For purposes of applying Section 11.7
1	to Float Pool nurses, their “regular rate of pay” will be the hourly rate
for weekday day shifts.
Starting with the six-week schedule commencing on September 5, 2004, Float Pool nurses shall be required to work four (4) shifts per six-week schedule, at least one of which shall be on the weekend and at least one of which shall be an evening or night shift.
In addition, Float Pool Nurses may participate in any Hospital group health insurance plan, but solely at one hundred percent (100%) of the Float Pool Nurse’s own expense, irrespective of the type or scope of coverage elected.
(b)	Scheduling Preference and Holidays: Permanent staff shall have preference over Float Pool Nurses in scheduling involving the following: permanent shift, overtime, vacations and holidays. In addition, Float Pool Nurses must work two (2) out of the three (3) major holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Day), as well as one (1) of the remaining holidays. A sign-up sheet shall be posted for Float Pool nurses to express a preference for which two major holidays and shifts they wish to work; actual assignments will be made in order of sign-up. With the approval of a unit’s Department Head, Float Pool nurses may sign up directly on the unit for work shifts, provided that such Float Pool nurses thereafter seek and receive appropriate approval from the Nursing Office and that, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, such Float Pool nurses comply with the scheduling requirements (including shift rotation and on-call assignments) of permanent staff nurses on the unit. On holidays observed by the
40
Hospital, Float Pool nurses shall receive time and a half the Float Pool hourly rate for the relevant shift worked. The Hospital has the right, in its discretion, to designate specific additional shifts around observed holidays as shifts which will satisfy the holiday work requirement and for which the time and a half pay benefit will be paid to Float Pool nurses.
(c)	Performance: Float Pool Nurses’ performances shall be regularly evaluated. Float Pool Nurses shall have the same responsibilities and obligations that full-time nurses have under this Agreement.
(d)	Notice of Cancellation of Shift: The Hospital may cancel a Float Pool Nurse’s scheduled shift as required. However, every effort will be made to cancel the shift at least ninety (90) minutes prior to the scheduled shift. A Float Pool Nurse is expected to call the Nursing Office at least ninety (90) minutes prior to the commencement of a shift to ascertain whether her/his shift assignment has been cancelled. In the event that the Hospital cancels the Float Pool Nurse’s shift less than ninety (90) minutes before such shift is scheduled to begin, the Hospital will pay the nurse for two (2) hours’ wages.
(e)	Float Pool nurses will be paid to attend mandatory inservices, mandatory annual updates/competencies, and CPR recertifications at the day shift Float Pool rate.
(f)	In the event a Float Pool nurse transfers to permanent status, the nurse’s wage scale placement shall be determined by the level, step, and DNE of the nurse at the time of transfer to the Float Pool, plus any step advances or DNE adjustments that would have been implemented if the nurse had held a permanent position during the period of Float Pool status, plus any applicable equity adjustments provided under Section 37.1 (or, in the event of a nurse originally hired directly into the Float Pool, up to thirteen (13) years of credit for prehire experience).

§ 11.10 Reassignment of Nursing Staff: The Hospital may determine that it is necessary to reassign nurses temporarily. '■ When reassignments become necessary to meet patient care needs, the Hospital shall first reassign all temporary nurses on a unit, followed by Float Pool nurses on the unit, prior to reassigning any permanent clinical nurse from the same unit, provided the nurse possesses the necessary and requisite skills to perform the work. The Hospital will strive to minimize floating of nurses. No permanent clinical nurse shall be reassigned more than once per shift. When more than one nurse from a single unit is being reassigned, preference in choice of reassignment to unfilled assignments shall first be given to the permanent clinical nurse and then to the Float Pool nurse and then to the temporary nurse, provided each such nurse has the necessary and requisite skills to perform the reassignment. If it is necessary to reassign a permanent clinical nurse, the following provisions shall apply:
(a)	The Hospital shall reassign nurses in inverse order of Hospital seniority. Each unit shall document, in the same manner, the nurse reassignments and such reassignments will be made on a rotational basis.
(b)	A nurse may only be reassigned to a unit where she/he has the necessary and requisite skills to perform the work. A nurse who is reassigned to another unit will not be expected to perform any duties which the nurse is not competent to perform.
(c)	Each unit/department will have an orientation document which sets forth specific information about the unit/department. In connection with a reassignment, the nurse, upon request, will have a buddy/mentor assigned, be given a copy of the orientation document, and be given a walking tour of the essential areas of the patient care assignment. Unless based on a consideration of the skills and abilities of the reassigned nurse and patient care needs, the reassigned nurse shall not be assigned the most difficult or acute patients on the unit.
42
(d)	Permanent clinical nurses who sign up for overtime or additional shift assignments on a particular unit may indicate, at the time they sign up, their unwillingness to be reassigned outside that unit. In the event that such a nurse is not needed on that unit, that nurse will not be reassigned outside the unit involuntarily and has the option to go home. If such a nurse opts to stay, she/he shall be reassigned before any regularly scheduled permanent clinical nurse on that unit.
(e)	Reassignment of permanent clinical nurses which is believed to be excessive is an appropriate topic for review by the Labor Management Committee.
ARTICLE 12 HOLIDAYS
§ 12.1	Holidays:
(a)	Eligible nurses are entitled to receive the following paid holidays:
New Year’s Day
Martin Luther King Jr.’s Birthday
Presidents’ Day
Memorial Day
Independence Day
Labor Day
Veterans Day
Thanksgiving Day
Christmas Day
Consistent with its needs, the Hospital will make reasonable efforts, including using Float Pool and temporary nurses then working, to distribute work on holidays equitably. A holiday will be considered to be the day on which it is observed by the Hospital. When a holiday
43
falls on Saturday, the preceding Friday will be observed as the holiday. When a holiday falls on Sunday, the Monday immediately following will be observed as the holiday.
(b)	The three major holidays are Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and New Year’s Day. Recognizing that the Hospital is a twenty-four (24) hour facility with patient care the primary consideration and that it is not feasible for all nurses to be off duty at the same time, the Hospital shall have the right, to meet patient care and other operational needs, to require any nurse to work on any holiday herein specified, except that:
(i)	Any nurse with less than fourteen (14) years of Hospital seniority as defined in Section 9.1 will be entitled, upon written request as specified below, to be off-duty on one of Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, or New Year’s Day, unless patient care needs are not met. On each unit, such nurses shall decide among themselves, using consensus decision-making, how these holidays will be assigned. If consensus is not achieved, nurses will be assigned by Hospital seniority.
(ii)	Any nurse with fourteen (14) or more, but less than twenty-five (25), years of Hospital seniority as defined in Section 9.1 will be entitled, upon written request, as specified below, to be off-duty either Christmas Day or New Year’s Day but not both holidays. Any nurse with nineteen (19), but less than twenty-five (25), years of Hospital seniority may decide whether to be scheduled to work on any other holiday specified herein.
(iii)	Any nurse with twenty-five (25) or more years of Hospital seniority as defined in Section 9.1 will be entitled, upon written request as specified below, to be off-duty Christmas Day, provided the nurse works either Thanksgiving Day or New Year’s Day, but not both holidays. However, if the nurse elects to work Christmas Day, she/he will be entitled to be off-duty both Thanksgiving Day and New Year’s
44
Day. A nurse in this seniority category may decide whether to be scheduled to work on any other holiday specified herein.
; (iv) Nurses holding Weekend Incentive Nurse (WIN) positions shall not be required to work on minor holidays that fall on weekdays. WIN nurses may be required to work major holidays falling on weekdays if necessary to provide optimum patient care; scheduling will be done in accordance with the provisions set forth above and following scheduling of non-WIN nurses.
(c)	All written requests to be off-duty on Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, or New Year’s Day must be submitted in the two-week schedule planning period preceding the first day of the schedule in which the Thanksgiving Day holiday falls. Requests for other holidays must be submitted in writing in the two-week schedule planning period preceding the first day of the schedule in which the holiday falls. Any nurse desiring a holiday off must have the necessary seniority at the time the written request must be submitted.
(d)	If a paid holiday falls during a nurse’s vacation time, it will not be charged as vacation. In no case will a nurse’s paid-days-off balance be charged for an authorized paid absence on a holiday observed by the Hospital.
§ 12.2	Holiday Pay:
(a)	Holiday pay is eight (8) hours of pay (for full-time nurses) or four (4) hours of pay (for part-time eligible nurses, excluding WIN nurses) at the base hourly rate. Effective September 5, 2004, if a nurse works more than eight (8) hours on the actual holiday (e.g., a ten (10) or twelve (12) hour shift), she/he will be paid one hour of additional holiday pay for each hour (or fraction thereof) worked, up to a maximum of twelve (12) hours pay. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.2(b), holiday pay hours over eight (8) will not be considered hours worked for purposes of computing overtime. A nurse who works on an
45
I
observed holiday (whether the work is scheduled or not) shall receive compensation at the regular hourly rate for each hour actually worked on the holiday. Holiday pay, if the nurse is eligible, is paid regardless of when or if a day off is taken. If the holiday itself is not taken off, a compensatory day off without pay may be granted, if requested and staffing permits, provided it is taken within twelve (12) weeks from the date of the holiday.
(b)	Nurses assigned the 24-hour Weekend Incentive Nurse (WIN) option shall be paid holiday pay (12 hours at the nurse’s base rate of pay) for December 25 (Christmas Day), January 1 (New Year’s Day), and July 4 (Independence Day) if the holiday occurs on the weekend and they actually work either of these days, and shall receive compensation at his/her regular hourly rate for each hour actually worked on the holiday. Nurses assigned to the 24-hour WIN option who actually work on a holiday that does not fall on a weekend shall receive compensation at his/her regular hourly rate applicable to that shift for each hour actually worked on the holiday, as well as eight (8) hours of holiday pay.
(c)	Upon proper notice, nurses may, in their discretion, use their accrued PDOs to add to their hours of holiday pay in order to receive pay equivalent to that for their normal shift length. For example, a part-time eligible nurse may apply four hours of PDOs to add to four hours of holiday pay for a total of eight hours of pay, or a 36-hour Scheduling Option nurse may apply four hours of PDOs to add to eight hours of holiday pay for a total of twelve hours of pay.
(d)	During a holiday week, upon request, the Hospital will . make reasonable efforts to avoid requiring a nurse to work additional hours during the week to compensate for having celebrated the holiday.
§ 12.3	Holiday Eligibility: In order to be eligible for holiday pay, a nurse must have worked her/his last scheduled work day before and her/his first scheduled work day after the holiday except for illness or other excused absence. The Hospital may require that the nurse produce
46
a bona fide doctor’s certificate or other proof that the nurse’s absence was due to illness. A nurse will not be eligible for holiday pay if she/he has not worked at least one (1) day during the week in which the holiday occurs unless the nurse is on approved paid leave. Nurses in the leave status or under suspension are not eligible for holiday pay. A nurse who fails to report for work on the holiday when scheduled or instructed to report shall not receive pay for the unworked holiday.
ARTICLE 13 VACATION AND SICK LEAVE
§ 13.1	(a) Paid-Days Off (PDOs): Nurses earn paid-days-off and free day cash values which they must use for payment of wages during any scheduled or unscheduled absence(s). No nurse will be compelled to reduce his/her PDO bank below the level often (10) PDOs (80 hours), except when taking a scheduled vacation.
Paid-days-off cash values are accrued during each two-week payroll period and are based upon the nurses’ base hourly rates of pay at the time they are earned.
Permanent full-time nurses accrue the following:
(1)	During the first two years of scheduled employment, cash value accrual of 19 paid-days-off per year (5.85 hours per pay period).
(2)	During the third year of scheduled employment, cash value accrual of 22 paid-days-off per year (6.77 hours per pay period).
(3)	After three years of scheduled employment, cash value accrual of 24 paid-days-off per year (7.39 hours per pay period).
47
(4)	After ten years of scheduled employment, cash value accrual of 29 paid-days-off per year (8.92 hours per pay period).
(5)	After fifteen years of scheduled employment, cash value accrual of 32 paid-days-off per year (9.85 hours per pay period). Nurses who have already completed fifteen years of employment will have their accrual rate increased as of April 4, 2004.
The rate of PDO accrual set forth above will be advanced on the nurse’s relevant anniversary date. For example, a nurse’s accrual rate will change from 5.85 hours per pay period under subsection (1) above to 6.77 hours per pay period under subsection (2) above on her/his third anniversary date. The anniversary date is the anniversary of the nurse’s date of hire.
In addition to the above, two free days will be credited to paid-days-off accounts upon employment and thereafter upon completion of every year of regularly scheduled employment. Nurses with at least three (3) years of scheduled employment shall be entitled to three (3) free days. Nurses with at least seven (7) years of scheduled employment shall be entitled to four (4) free days. Free days may be used, upon request and approval, to celebrate personal days off such as birthdays or other occasions or as extra days for vacation or sickness.
Part-time eligible nurses earn one-half the cash value accrual of paid-days-off and free days that permanent full-time nurses earn. Nurses holding 24-hour WIN positions earn sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3 %) of the paid-days-off and free days that permanent full-time nurses earn. PDO hours equal to scheduled hours not worked will be applied for absences of 24-hour WIN nurses. Upon proper notice, WIN nurses may, in their discretion, supplement their pay for any full-shift absences by using accumulated PDO hours to achieve the full financial
48
equivalent of the weekend supplemental bonus (i.e., five hours per day shift or seven hours per night shift).
(b)	Use of Paid-Days-Off: During the first ninety (90) days of employment, eligible nurses will accrue, but may not utilize, paid-days-off or free day cash values nor will they be paid any cash values accrued if termination occurs prior to ninety (90) days of employment.
Nurses who terminate employment after ninety (90) days of continuous service will be paid all paid-days-off and free day cash values they have earned at the end of the pay period prior to termination if they have given proper notice; otherwise they will forfeit any such cash values they have earned in their accounts. Nurses will be paid for all paid-days-off and free day cash values upon entering leave status. It is agreed, however, that nurses on an approved medical leave of absence may elect at their discretion to retain all paid-days-off and free day cash value in their accounts, but not for a period in excess of six (6) calendar months.
Paid-days-off and free day cash values may not be used in advance of being earned or prior to ninety (90) days of employment.
(c)	Requests for Time Off: Paid-days-off or free day cash values may not be used without Department Head approval in advance except for sudden illnesses or emergencies. When use of paid-days-off cash values is requested because of sudden illnesses or emergencies, nurses should notify their Department Heads as soon as they know that they will be absent from work. Department Heads may require appropriate proof of illnesses or emergencies prior to granting approval for use of paid-days-off cash values.
A nurse may be subject to progressive discipline for abuse of leave (within a calendar year from April 1 through March 31), including, but not limited to, undocumented, unscheduled absences which amount to unwillingness or inability to attend work regularly, or when a pattern of
49
1
abuse is identified. However, the rate at which scheduled PDOs are used or the level of PDOs remaining in a nurse’s bank will not be the basis of discipline. Nurses who clock in for work less than six (6) minutes after the start of their scheduled shift will not be docked in pay, nor be subject to progressive discipline, for such instances of tardiness.
(d)	Paid-Days-Off Account Adjustments: Whenever a nurse’s pay rate changes (e.g., through a pay grade step increase, general wage increase, job reclassification, or otherwise) the nurse’s paid-days-off cash value account shall be adjusted to reflect the new rate of pay so that the paid-days-off hours balance at the time of the pay adjustment will not be changed.
Eligible nurses will be paid for cash values of all paid-days-off and free days, in excess of their annual paid-days-off allowances, which they have earned as of the pay period in which the anniversary date occurs. Payment will be made by separate check in the Payroll Office on the -same date as the nurse is paid for the week which encompasses her/his anniversary date. The check which constitutes the PDO cash-out will be clearly identified as such (which may be accomplished by any suitable means including the use of rubber stamps). Paid-days-off cash values in excess of annual accrual shall be paid when due. Nurses may not elect to leave them in their paid-days-off accounts.
(e)	Advance of Vacation Pay: A nurse will be paid vacation pay before starting a vacation of a week or more provided that the nurse submits a written request for advance payment to the Department Head at least three (3) weeks in advance of the nurse’s scheduled vacation.
§ 13.2	Negotiation Time-Off: Nurses designated by the Union shall be entitled to use their PDOs or to take leave without pay to attend joint and/or FMCS negotiation sessions associated with the renegotiation of this Agreement.

(b)	Long Term Disability Insurance: Full-time nurses with at least three (3) years of continuous employment with the Hospital shall, after one-hundred eighty (180) days of disability (by reason of sickness or accident not covered by Worker’s Compensation) receive sixty (60) percent of their pay at the base rate which shall continue until the nurse either (1) dies; (2) returns to work; (3) attains age sixty-five (65) years; or (4) ceases being qualified for coverage. Effective January 1, 2005, the period of continuous employment required for eligibility will be reduced from three (3) years to six (6) months, and nurses who work in 24-Hour WIN positions will become eligible for Long Term Disability Insurance under this subsection.
51
The Hospital will offer nurses who are eligible for Long Term Disability Insurance the option of purchasing additional coverage at their own cost, in order to receive a benefit of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of their pay at their base rate.
(c)	Certification: In all cases, claims shall require substantiation by means of medical certification as prescribed by the insurance carrier(s), which determinations shall be conclusive and binding upon the Hospital, the claimant (including the claimant’s estate, heirs, assigns, or other legal representatives), and the Unions in all cases without recourse under this Agreement, including recourse under the grievance and arbitration provision thereof.
ARTICLE 14 PAID ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE
§ 14.1	Funeral Leave: Any nurse shall be entitled to funeral leave with pay at her/his base hourly rate for a maximum of three (3) regular scheduled work days lost in the case of death of her/his or her/his spouse’s immediate family, namely husband, wife, father, mother, brother, sister, child, domestic partner living with the nurse in the same household, or other relative living with the nurse in the same household. The funeral leave must be taken during the period between the date of death and the day following the burial, both inclusive (except where bona fide religious practice may require a different period of absence), and provided that the nurse is prepared to offer valid proof of death and relationship upon request. Management will not unreasonably deny requests for additional unpaid days off up to a maximum of two (2) calendar weeks (inclusive of the three paid days). A nurse who is eligible to use PDOs in accordance with Section 13.1 may elect to use or not use accrued PDOs to cover all or a portion of the absence. Management will not unreasonably deny requests to use accrued PDOs for periods beyond this two-week period. Nurses seeking additional time off beyond the two (2) weeks who have exhausted their accrued
52
PDOs may apply for unpaid personal leave of absence in accordance with Article 16
§ 14.2	Voting Leave: A nurse who has completed her/his probationary period shall be entitled to leave of absence with pay up to a maximum of two (2) hours to vote in a national, District of Columbia, or state election where, if she/he was not given such leave she/he would not be able to vote. Prior approval for voting leave must be obtained by the nurse from her/his Department Head.
§ 14.3	Nursing License Examination: Graduate nurses shall strive to take nursing license examinations on days when they are not scheduled to work.

ARTICLE 15 SPECIAL LEAVE
§ 15.1	Jury and Witness Duty: A nurse who has completed her/his probationary period and is subpoenaed for and serves on jury duty or as a witness in a Hospital-related case shall be compensated by the Hospital in the amount of the difference between her/his regular rate for regular scheduled work days lost and the amount received as juror’s or witness’ fees. In order to receive such payment and to be released from work, a nurse must give the Hospital the earliest practical notice of such duty and furnish to the Hospital, upon request of the Hospital, a Certificate of Service, duly signed by the clerk of the court and valid proof as to the amount of juror’s or witness’ fees received. A nurse is required to report for work on a regular scheduled work day if she/he is not required for jury or witness duty on a particular day or if she/he is dismissed early enough to work her/his regular shift; provided that a nurse scheduled to work the evening or night shift will not be required to
53
work if she/he has served on jury or witness duty that day. A nurse scheduled to work a night shift immediately prior to jury or witness duty shall, upon request, be released from work on that shift. Such a nurse shall be compensated by the Hospital (in accordance with the payment rule set forth above) if she/he serves on jury or witness duty, except when the nurse is compensated for a shift from which she/he was released on the day of jury or witness duty. Any nurse who fails to report for work when released from jury or witness duty shall have her/his pay reduced by an amount equal to her/his regular rate times the number of hours of work missed.
§ 15.2	Military Training: A nurse who has completed his/her probationary period and who serves in annual active duty military training in the Armed Forces of the United States shall be paid the difference between his/her military pay and his/her base hourly rate for the said training period but in no event exceeding two (2) continuous7 weeks. This benefit shall apply to only one training period (the first if there be more than one) in any calendar year. To be eligible for such leave, nurses must present orders and verification of their military pay to their Department Heads.
§ 15.3	Education Grants:
(a)	Nurses may apply for grants to attend conferences and seminars which will benefit the Hospital by adding to or strengthening nurse skills or knowledge. Applications shall be made to and acted upon by the Education Grant Committee (EGC) composed of four (4) members; two (2) appointed by the Hospital and two (2) appointed by the Union in writing. Such grants shall be allowed to permit attendance at approved conferences and seminars. Any nurse receiving a grant shall be obligated to submit either a written or an oral report, the choice is to be made by the Hospital, to the nursing staff so that it may share the nurse’s knowledge and learning experience. Educational activities other than conferences and seminars will be applied for and paid for separately through appropriate Hospital departments.
54
(b)	The EGC shall meet monthly. Nurses attending EGC meetings will be given administrative leave for such attendance. The EGC must approve or disapprove all requests for financial assistance on a monthly basis. Decisions of the Committee shall not be subject to arbitration. However, ties shall be broken by a neutral fifth (5th) member to be elected by the four (4) Committee members.
(c)	The nurse shall make a request for grant assistance prior to the commencement of the program for which assistance is being sought. The Hospital may in rare and exceptional cases, and at its discretion, grant retroactive approval to applications for grant assistance.
(d)	The amount available to the Committee shall be $125,000 per fiscal year. Using interest-based principles and by consensus, the Labor-Management Committee may determine, subject to the Hospital’s approval, that this amount should be increased to meet Magnet Status or other educational needs.
(e)	The amount of the grant shall be in the discretion of the Committee and shall be to defray registration fees and such other expenses as allowed by the Committee.
§ 15.4	Educational Leave and Conference Attendance:
(a)	The Hospital will provide up to thirty-six (36) hours of paid leave during the term of this Agreement for a full-time nurse and up to eighteen (18) hours for a part-time eligible nurse at the nurse’s base hourly rate to attend or present at a conference in the nurse’s clinical practice area. Nurses must provide reasonable advance notice of their intent to use paid educational leave so that they will not be scheduled for work during the hours when paid leave will be utilized. Paid educational leave shall not be considered as hours worked for purposes of computing overtime.
55
I
(b)	Using interest-based principles and by consensus, the Labor-Management Committee may determine, subject to the Hospital’s approval, that the number of paid hours should be increased to meet Magnet Status or other educational needs.	* '
(c)	Nurses will be permitted to take an additional two (2) days of unpaid educational leave annually to attend or present at conferences in their clinical practice areas, and they will be given the option to use or not use PDOs for those absences. Nurses must provide reasonable advance notice of their intent to use unpaid educational leave so that they will not be scheduled for work. Management will not unreasonably deny requests to use educational leave contiguous with vacation days, provided, however, that the combination of educational leave and vacation does not exceed two (2) weeks.
ARTICLE 16 LEAVE OF ABSENCE
§ 16.1	Definition: A leave of absence is an excused but unpaid period of absence. Requests for leave of absence may be granted by the Hospital for emergency conditions and unusual home situations, education, travel, or medical needs, where the reasons for the request are justified and such leave will not interfere with or adversely affect the Hospital’s scheduling and staffing for the duration of the leave. Requests for leave of absence will not be denied arbitrarily or capriciously. A nurse on authorized leave of absence shall not be entitled to longevity DNE pay increases, paid-days-off accumulation, holiday pay, or any insurance benefits otherwise provided for in this Agreement.
§ 16.2	Written Request: Requests for a leave of absence must be approved by the Department Head and such requests must be in writing and state the starting date and the expiration date of the requested leave of absence. In the event a nurse is absent without prior approval by the Department Head for two (2) or more working days and has not notified
56
the Department Head of reasons for such absence it shall constitute abandonment of position and be just cause for discharge by the Hospital, except in cases of total medical incapacitation making it impossible for the nurse to provide any notice of the absence.
§ 16.3	Return to Work:
(a)	A nurse on leave of absence must give the Department Head two (2) weeks written notice prior to returning from a leave of absence. If the nurse is on a medical leave of absence, however, she/he must give written notice as soon as practicable, recognizing that there may be a delay in returning the nurse to work if the notice is less than two (2) weeks.
(b)	Upon return from an approved medical leave of absence of six (6) months or less in duration (inclusive of statutory leave), a nurse will be returned to her/his former position (including same hours, shift assignment, and job classification) and department, limited to once per calendar year. Upon return from a medical leave of absence of more than six (6) months in duration or any other non-statutory leave of absence, a nurse will be returned to her/his former position (including same hours, shift assignment, and job classification) and department, if available. If a nurse’s former position is not available, the nurse will be placed in an equivalent position. An equivalent position means the same job classification and hours, and, if available, the same shift assignment. If no such equivalent positions are available, she/he shall then be returned to any available bargaining unit position for which she/he possesses the necessary and requisite skills. In those instances where the nurse returning from leave cannot be returned to her/his former position, she/he shall retain the right of preference should that former position subsequently become available within a twelve (12) month period. As a condition of reinstatement following a leave of absence for illness, injury, or maternity, the Hospital may require the nurse to be examined and given a health clearance by the Occupational Health Department.
57
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit or diminish any statutory rights.
(c)	Maternity-related disability shall be treated the same as all other disabilities.
§ 16.4	Maximum Time Periods:
(a)	A leave of absence shall not normally be granted to a nurse in excess of the following time periods:
Personal leave - three (3) months
Education leave - one (1) year
Travel leave - three (3) months
Medical leave - one (1) year
Maternity leave - one (1) year
Adoption leave - one (1) year Union business leave - one (1) year Family leave - one (1) year
(b)	A nurse who fails to return from a leave of absence (including any approved extensions) will be considered to have resigned. Leaves of absence for periods longer than those specified in Section 16.4(a) shall be granted and approved upon good cause shown, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. It is agreed, however, that nurses on prolonged leaves of absence shall not accrue seniority beyond the first year of any prolonged leave of absence.
(c)	After three (3) years of employment, a nurse may be granted up to two (2) years of unpaid educational leave.
§ 16.5	Insurance Premiums: Any nurse on any form of approved leave of absence may elect to pay her/his own insurance premiums during an approved leave of absence so as to avoid lapse of coverage, but such payments (which consist of the Hospital contribution and the
58
employee contribution at the rate paid by then-active nurses) shall be at the nurse’s sole expense. A nurse on leave may choose to pay insurance premiums monthly or quarterly, provided that the nurse makes an irrevocable election to pay premiums monthly or quarterly at the beginning of her/his leave, and provided further that all payments are made in advance.
The Hospital shall continue to pay, for a maximum time period of one (1) year, its contribution for the individual coverage portion of insurance premiums for those nurses who are on leave as a result of an on-the-job injury.
The Hospital shall pay its contribution toward insurance premiums during any periods of leave of absence that are covered by the federal and/or District of Columbia Family and Medical Leave Act(s).

Any grievance by the Hospital shall first be submitted to the Chief Shop Steward or designee for resolution and if a satisfactory settlement is not effected, or, if no response is rendered by the Union within ten (10) working days after submittal of the grievance to the Union, the grievance shall be deemed denied and the Hospital may proceed to
60
arbitration; provided that in the case of any Hospital grievance concerning violation of the no strike clause the Hospital may directly call for arbitration of the matter without any prior submission to the Union, and the parties agree to immediately assign the first available arbitrator from the arbitrator panel, described in Section 18.2, below, and to hold the arbitration within twenty-four (24) hours of the Hospital’s call for arbitration.

61
duration, identity of mediator, etc.) shall also be determined by mutual agreement. Referral to mediation shall not alter any of the time limits set forth in Articles 17 or 18. The parties shall share equally the fees and expenses of the mediator; all other mediation expenses shall be paid by the party incurring them.

Any grievance upon which arbitration is requested shall be assigned to the appropriate arbitrator within ten (10) days of the request. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, once an arbitrator is assigned a grievance (even if it is later withdrawn or otherwise resolved), the arbitrator will not be assigned another grievance until each of the arbitrators on the panel has been assigned a grievance in rotation. Arbitrators may be added to or deleted from the panel only by mutual, written agreement of the parties.
62

63
ARTICLE 19 NO STRIKES OR LOCKOUTS
§ 19.1	No Strikes: It is recognized that the Hospital is engaged in a public service requiring continuous operation and it is agreed that recognition of such obligation of continuous service is imposed upon both the nurses and the Union.
Therefore, the Union, its officers, agents, representatives and members shall not in any way, directly or indirectly, authorize, participate in, or ratify any strike, sympathy strike, picketing (of whatever form or type, including but not limited to informational picketing, recognitional picketing, or sympathy picketing), patrolling, or any form or type of self-help without exception or any other interference with or interruption of work at any of the Hospital’s operations during r the duration of this Agreement.

Job openings will be posted prominently in display cases outside the Department of Human Resources and near the “GE” Corridor entrance to the Cafeteria. By July 2, 2004, the Hospital will implement a process which will allow nurses to obtain and submit applications at the Hospital seven (7) days a week. The Hospital will move toward making job postings available electronically and allowing applications to be submitted electronically. Nurses must apply to the
64
Recruitment Office. Nurses must make separate application for each opening or contact the Staffing and Recruitment Office to re-activate any previous application.

The nurse will then be responsible for applying for the opening in accordance with part (a) of this section.
§ 20.2 A currently employed nurse who applies for a posted position shall be accorded preference over a non-Hospital applicant with substantially equal qualifications.
ARTICLE 21 CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION
§ 21.1	To the extent permitted by law, whenever a nurse objects to participation in the procedure of voluntary interruption of pregnancy and notifies the Hospital of such objection in advance and in writing, reasonable efforts will be made to assign the nurse to other duties. However, patient needs as determined by the Hospital will take precedence over such objection and, until and unless assigned to other duties, the objecting nurse will, as a condition of continued employment, provide such services as are required to prepare for and assist in the procedure according to Hospital standards. Failure of any nurse to provide such care shall be considered gross insubordination and constitute just cause for discharge.
65
ARTICLE 22 LABOR-MANAGEMENT CONSULTATION
§ 22.1	(a) The Union and the Hospital will form a joint Labor-Management Committee for the purpose of working collaboratively on issues of interest to both parties. The parties intend that this committee will enhance sound labor-management relations by fostering an atmosphere conducive to communications between the parties on a regular basis. The Labor-Management Committee will address issues of joint interest, including contract administration and other issues that will enhance the work environment for nurses at the Hospital. The Labor-Management Committee will, as the parties deem appropriate, establish Subcommittees to address particular topics, such as professional nursing practice, development of a clinical ladder, and equal employment opportunity.
The parties agree that regular, direct communication will foster positive labor-management relations; thus, the existence of the Labor-Management Committee is not intended to deter the parties from meeting and/or discussing issues on a day-to-day basis outside the context of the Labor-Management Committee.
The Labor-Management Committee shall meet monthly, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The parties envision that the Labor-Management Committee will consist of four (4) individuals designated by the Union and four (4) individuals designated by the Hospital, but recognize that the number and identities of individuals may be modified by mutual agreement of the parties, as circumstances warrant.

Nothing contained herein shall be interpreted as waiving the Union’s right to file a grievance contending that any such decision conflicts with the terms of this Agreement.
§ 22.3	(a) The parties agree that improving patient satisfaction is critical to the success of the Hospital and, therefore, benefits both the Hospital and nurses. The Hospital and the Union will jointly cooperate to achieve the mutual goal of increasing patients’ satisfaction with their nursing experience at the Hospital. As appropriate, the parties will discuss rewarding measurable improvements in patient satisfaction in the Labor-Management Committee.
(b) The Hospital and the Union recognize a mutual interest in exploring the possibility of the Hospital achieving Magnet Status pursuant to the American Nurses Credentialing Center’s Magnet Recognition Program. The parties commit to working together to
67
examine the feasibility of the Hospital obtaining Magnet Status, considering issues related to Magnet Status, and, as appropriate, taking steps toward the Hospital achieving Magnet Status. The parties may discuss these issues in the Labor-Management Committee.
§ 22.4	By August 1, 2004, a subcommittee of the Labor-Management Committee will be formed to address the utilization of on-call and mandatory overtime in the Operating Rooms and to explore the possibility of increasing the number of permanent day shift positions in the Operating Rooms.

(iii)	Nurses hired after September 10, 2000 may be required to pay up to $25.00 per month for parking.
(c)	Upon request, security officers will escort nurses to their cars. It is understood that a nurse may have to wait a reasonable time for such escort.

ARTICLE 24 IN-SERVICE EDUCATION
§ 24.1	Orientation: The Hospital shall maintain an effective inservice program, including a planned orientation program.

ARTICLE 28 PROFESSIONAL NURSING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
§ 28.1	The parties agree that it is desirable to develop a clinical ladder program.

Any changes relating to a clinical ladder program involving nurses’ wages, hours, or working conditions shall be subject to Union and Hospital approval.
§ 28.2	Principles: The following principles will guide the Nursing Council or subcommittee of the Labor-Management Committee in developing a clinical ladder program:
(a)	Four levels of clinical nurse practice will be differentiated, by degrees of clinical expertise, competence, and increased professional responsibility.
(b)	Level I represents the novice practitioner with less than 12 months of nursing experience. Level II includes novice through competent practitioners. The competent practitioner can independently manage a workload of acutely ill patients. Level III is a proficient nurse
74
who demonstrates increased clinical expertise and leadership on the unit. The Level IV nurse is an advanced nurse who contributes expert skills, integrates research into practice and provides leadership across services as in the development of clinical paths.
. , (c) Education is an extension of the patient care delivery model to provide competent providers of clinical care to patients. Education includes orientation, mandatory education and clinical conferences. Clinical nurses must complete and maintain defined credentials in order to progress.
(d)	All nurses will advance to Level III following two years of entry into practice.
(e)	The number of advanced nurses is limited by the clinical requirements of the Division of Nursing, provided, however, that each in-patient nursing unit (as well as the Main OR, Third Floor OR, MedStar Services, Emergency Department, Delivery Room, Cath Lab, 3DH, GI Lab, Holding/ATC, IV Therapy, Cancer Institute, and PACU) will have a minimum of one (1) Level IV nurse. On nursing units/areas with more than one (1) Level IV nurse, the Level IV nurses will be permitted to retain their Level IV positions as long as they remain in.that unit/area, provided that they meet the expectations of Level IV nurses. These expectations will be defined by the Nursing Council or subcommittee of the Labor-Management Committee.
ARTICLE 29 PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS
§ 29.1 (a) Performance evaluations will be provided at least once annually within thirty (30) days of the date the nurse is next eligible for evaluation. Nurses in orientation (including fellowships) will receive an evaluation during the course, and at the conclusion, of orientation (and more often, as the Hospital deems appropriate). The appropriate nursing
75
division director will review and may modify annual evaluations and evaluations at the conclusion of orientation if such evaluations have an overall unsatisfactory rating.
(b)	It is the intention of the parties to assist nurses in successfully developing, maintaining, and applying their skills and to encourage best nursing practices. Performance evaluations shall, among other things, have as their purpose to be instructive and corrective. The Hospital will strive to address nurses’ performance problems promptly.
(c)	Each evaluation will be shown to the nurse being evaluated, who may enter any comment or other documentation to refute the evaluation. Such additional material will become and remain a part of the nurse’s official personnel file as long as the evaluation is a part of such file. Upon request in writing, a nurse shall receive a copy of her/his performance evaluation.
(d)	The failure of the Hospital to make a written performance evaluation as required by this Section 29.1 shall be grievable. However, the performance evaluation itself is not grievable. Nothing contained herein shall limit a nurse’s right to grieve any matter otherwise grievable under this Agreement.
ARTICLE 30 NURSING AND PATIENT CARE
§ 30.1	The nursing process involves assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, evaluation and documentation.
§ 30.2	A nurse has the autonomy to delegate or not to delegate aspects of nursing care that the nurse determines appropriate based on the exercise of her/his professional judgment.
§ 30.3	(a) The Hospital shall maintain a system for determining nurse staffing and patient assignments. The Hospital will strive to
76
provide the number of nurses deemed adequate on all shifts and to fill vacancies promptly in order to provide safe and adequate nursing care and to maximize utilization of the skills and competencies of all nursing personnel. The system will utilize the staffing guidelines of the American Nurses Association in effect as of the effective date of this Agreement, as published in “The ANA Principles for Nurse Staffing.” The system shall: 1) allow for the participation of clinical nurses in making recommendations for determining staffing needs; 2) consider evidence-based best practices, and 3) be evaluated using nurse-sensitive quality indicators, where appropriate. To assure optimum patient care and satisfaction, patient assignments and staffing patterns shall take into account, among other things, patient acuity, unit census/patient volume, intensity of care, the nursing staffs level of preparation and experience, and provision for preceptor/orientee experiences.
(b) Nurses United’s ADO (Assignment Despite Objection) form is a tool for identifying and tracking professional practice issues within the Hospital. The forms submitted by nurses will be forwarded by the Union to the Senior Vice President for Nursing. Unit-specific staffing issues identified through ADO forms or other written communications, will, if not resolved at the unit level, be referred to the Labor-Management Committee.
I?
§ 30.4	The proper allocation of nursing and non-nursing activities enables nurses to focus on the patient. The Hospital and the Union share the underlying philosophy that nurses should devote their work time to delivering optimum patient care. To the extent consistent with patient care needs, nurses will not be expected to regularly perform non-nursing duties that are the primary responsibility of other employees. It is recognized, however, that certain patient care situations may occur where it may be necessary and reasonable for nurses to perform duties which are ordinarily the primaiy responsibility of other employees. Where excessive or chronic performance of such duties becomes an issue, it will be submitted to the Labor-Management Committee.
77
§ 30.5	Resource Duty
(a)	Nurses performing resource duties shall not .be considered supervisors solely for the reason that they perform such duties. Nothing in this provision will be interpreted as a requirement that nurses be assigned to resource duties. The patient assignments of a resource nurse (if applicable) on a particular unit may be referred to the Labor-Management Committee for discussion and consideration of alternatives. The resource nurse role will be considered in the assignment of patients and reasonable attempts will be made to redistribute patients when possible and/or assign assistive personnel.
(b)	Using interest-based principles and by consensus, the Labor-Management Committee may determine, subject to the Hospital’s approval, that payments for nurses should be made for performing resource duties.
§ 30.6	The Hospital and the Union recognize the importance of good orientation and precepting. Nurses shall continue to receive preceptor training prior to their initial preceptor assignment on working time. Absent special circumstances, preceptors must have at least fifteen (15) months of nursing experience.
§ 30.7	Nurses shall not be held responsible for work performed inadequately or incorrectly by temporary nurses.

the Labor-Management Committee (Section 22.1), and any duly appointed subcommittees created by the above committees and Councils, shall receive paid administrative leave at their base hourly rate of pay for time spent actually attending Nursing Council meetings and meetings of the foregoing committees. This time shall be considered hours worked for purposes of computing overtime if the hours fall within the nurse’s scheduled work time. Nurses participating in such meetings must obtain appropriate advance approval from their supervisor(s) for release from work duty. When a nurse is scheduled to work when a meeting is scheduled, the nurse will provide notice to his/her Department Head as early as possible, but in no event less than two weeks prior to the meeting.
§ 31.2	Committee on Quality Patient Care: The Committee on Quality PatientCare will have eight (8) members, four (4) designated by the Union and four (4) designated by the Hospital. The Committee’s mission will.be to serve.as a forum to discuss and address issues concerning quality patient care, such as acuity levels, delivery of care, equipment, appropriate staffing levels, and other patient care issues. Among other possible activities, the Committee may periodically review satisfaction surveys and ADO forms and report trends or jointly recommend.changes to the appropriate Nursing Council; promote discussions between nurses and coordinators that are designed to promote quality care delivery and to foster initiatives from direct caregivers to enhance patient care and satisfaction consistent with sound nursing practice standards; and consider additional data collection activities that might provide further indicators on the quality of patient care.
§ 31.3	Hospital Committees: The Union will have the opportunity to have one staff nurse representative on each of the following Hospital committees: Code Blue Committee, Infection Control Committee, Transfusion Committee, and WHC Safety Committee. The Union will make recommendations to the Hospital’s President for the staff nurse to serve as a representative on each
79
committee, and appointment of particular representatives will not be unreasonably withheld. In a collaborative effort, the parties will discuss, through the Labor-Management Committee, which additional committees might have staff nurse participation.
§ 31.4	WHC Safety Committee: The Union and the Hospital shall cooperate in a joint effort to identify, evaluate, and control hazards in the workplace. The Hospital will make a good faith effort to implement reasonable recommendations of the WHC Safety Committee.

The Hospital may also maintain certain hours during which a nurse may come to Human Resources to examine her/his personnel file without an appointment. A nurse’s examination of her/his personnel file shall take place in the presence of a person designated by the Hospital. It is not the intent of the parties to interfere with normal business operations by requesting or permitting an unreasonable number of employees to view their personnel files simultaneously or in blocks. A nurse may place documents or any other materials of the nurse’s choice in her/his personnel file to refute or explain adverse material therein.
(b) The above Section 32.1(a) shall apply to official personnel files maintained by the Department of Human Resources. Copies of documentation which an individual supervisor or manager does not include in a nurse’s official personnel file shall, upon the nurse’s request, be provided to the nurse and the Union if used to support discipline of the nurse, provided, however, that the Hospital has the right to withhold confidential patient or privileged information.

Dorothy Hararas, RN President
Nurses United of the National Capital Region 8701 Georgia Avenue, Suite 500 Silver Spring, MD 20910
Re: Settlement of Hiring Guidelines/Pay Disparity and International Nurse Grievances
Dear Ms. Hararas:
This letter sets forth the agreement of the parties as to the settlement of the Hiring Guidelines/Pay Disparity and International Nurse Grievances.
The Washington Hospital Center (“the Hospital”) and Nurses United of the National Capital Region (“the Union”) acknowledge and agree that, as part of their agreement on the complete collective bargaining agreement that is effective April 4, 2004 through April 3, 2007, the parties settled the Hiring Guidelines/Pay Disparity and International Nurse Grievances (“the Grievances”) that were initially filed by the District of Columbia Nurses Association (“DCNA”) and assigned to the Union by DCNA on March 10, 2004. The parties’ settlement of the Grievances was intertwined with the parties’ agreement on wage increases and the overall economic terms of the 2004-2007 collective bargaining agreement and DCNA’s waiver of its right to approve settlement of the Grievances. DCNA has confirmed that, by its assignment of the right to process the Grievances to Nurses United, DCNA has waived any right to approve the parties’ settlement of the Grievances.
95
I
c
The parties agree and acknowledge that the terms of the parties’ settlement of the Grievances are as follows:
1.	The Hospital will fund the Washington Hospital Center-Nurses United Equity Backpayment Fund in the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00). The methodology applicable to payments from the Fund are set forth in Appendix C to the parties’ collective bargaining agreement.
2.	The Hospital placed permanent nurses on the wage scale attached at Appendix A of the parties’ 2004-2007 collective bargaining agreement based on Hospital credited experience, effective April 4, 2004. In addition, the following equity adjustments were made in connection with placement of permanent nurses on the wage scale:
a.	Credit of one (1) step was given for each year in which a permanent nurse did not advance a step on the then-applicable wage scale on the nurse’s then-current Date Next Eligible (“DNE”) date during the period of September 11, 1994 through September 10, 1998 and for which the nurse had not previously received credit, up to a maximum of four (4) steps; and
b.	Permanent nurses with more than five (5) years of registered nurse experience upon hire were credited with up to eight (8) years’ additional experience for each full year of registered nurse experience that was not recognized at the time of hire for wage scale placement purposes, and permanent nurses were given credit for each full year of previously uncredited international experience as a registered nurse, up to a maximum of thirteen (13) years.
Permanent nurses’ base hourly rates after placement on the wage scale effective April 4, 2004 are the pay rates specified in
96
4
the Wage Roster that the Hospital provided to the Union on March 21, 2004.
3.	Any disputes over placement on the wage scale attached at Appendix A of the parties’ 2004-2007 collective bargaining agreement as a result of credits given by the Hospital for step advancements not received on a nurse’s then-current DNEs between September 11, 1994 and September 10, 1998 and providing pre-hire credit of up to thirteen (13) years, as provided in paragraph 2(a) and (b) above (as reflected in the above-referenced Wage Roster) will be resolved as follows:
a.	Step One - The nurse and the Union must refer the dispute in writing to the Hospital’s Director of Employee/Labor Relations no later than May 18, 2004. Thereafter, a working group composed of two (2) members of the Union’s leadership and two (2) members of the Hospital’s management team will attempt to agree upon a resolution. If not resolved at this level within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of referral, the nurse and the Union may proceed to Step Two.
b.	Step Two - If not resolved in Step One, the nurse and the Union shall have the right to submit the dispute to arbitration within ten (10) calendar days of the failure to reach a resolution. The arbitrator, who will resolve all such disputes, will be selected from the four (4) arbitrators listed in Section 18.2 of the 2004-2007 collective bargaining agreement by a random selection process mutually agreed upon by the Union and the Hospital. Notice of the referral to arbitration will be provided in writing to the Director of Employee/Labor Relations. The provisions of Section 18.3 of the 2004-2007 collective bargaining agreement will apply to any arbitration pursuant to this procedure.
97
The only issues subject to arbitration pursuant to this procedure will be (1) whether the nurse received proper credit for any step movement that did not occur on the nurses’ then-current DNE between September 11, 1994 and September 10, 1998 and for which the nurse has not previously received experience credit; and (2) whether a nurse with more than five (5) years of experience upon hire failed to receive proper credit for purposes of wage scale placement for any additional full years of RN experience, as reflected in the nurse’s Human Resources Department personnel file as of March 21, 2004, for up to thirteen (13) years.
4.	In the event a Float Pool nurse transfers to permanent status, the nurse’s wage scale placement shall be determined by the level, step, and DNE of the nurse at the time of transfer to the Float Pool, plus any step advances or DNE adjustments that would have been implemented if the nurse had held a permanent position during the period of Float Pool status, plus any applicable equity adjustments provided in paragraph 2 above (or, in the event of a nurse originally hired directly into the Float Pool, up to thirteen (13) years of credit for pre-hire experience).
5.	The Union has withdrawn with prejudice the Grievances.
6.	The parties agree that nothing in its settlement of the Grievances shall be construed as an admission by the Hospital of any wrongdoing, liability, or violation of its collective bargaining agreements with DCNA or any federal, state, or local law.
Very truly yours, Victoria E. Houck Assistant Vice President, Employee/Labor Relations
Agreed and Accepted on Behalf of Nurses United:
Dorothy Hararas, RN

APPENDIX C
Payments from the Washington Hospital Center - Nurses United Equity Backpaymeht Fund will be distributed according to the following parameters: '
A. A claimant under the Equity Backpayment Fund is hereby stipulated to be a bargaining unit nurse who is or was:
1.	A currently-employed bargaining unit nurse (including nurses on an approved leave of absence) as of March 1, 2004;
2.	Hired prior to January 1, 1998; and
3.	As of either April 24, 2000, February 5, 2002, or February 1, 2004, was a permanent clinical nurse (a then-current bargaining unit member not in a Float Pool position) and was paid a lower base hourly rate of pay, as of any of those dates, than the base hourly rate of pay of a newly-hired nurse (as of the relevant date(s)), but who had the same or a greater number of years of WHC credited experience (as such experience calculation has been adjusted with respect to domestic R.N. experience by the parties’ collective bargaining agreement and appropriately back-dated to the relevant date(s) set forth above). The WHC adjusted credited experience of claimants for 2002 and 2000 will be calculated by subtracting two and four years, respectively, from the amount of WHC credited experience as of February 1, 2004.
99
The relevant hiring rates, for evaluation of a potential claimant’s possible claim under the fund were:
Jan - March 2004 Jan - March 2002 Jan - March 2000

The initial assessment of the equity backpayment potentially available for each claimant will be determined by multiplying the difference between the claimant’s hourly rate of pay (at each relevant date set forth in Section A.3 above) and the rate of pay of a hew hire at each date with the equivalent comparative level of adjusted WHC credited experience, backdated in the case of 2002 and 2000 (with a maximum comparison to the hiring rate at 13 years of credited experience), multiplied by the budgeted payperiod hours for the claimant’s position status at the relevant date, multiplied by twenty-six (26) payperiods. Upon identification of all claimants and the initial assessment of backpayment amounts in accordance with the parameters set forth above, the final equity backpayment for each claimant will be determined by setting a proportional payment based on the initial assessment, in consideration of the total funding in the Washington Hospital Center - Nurses United Equity Backpayment Fund.
In the event that the parties cannot reach agreement on the identity of final claimants and the final equity backpayment payable to each claimant, the parties will present the matter to
100
>}
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Commissioner Kurt Saunders for a final recommendation of claimants and appropriate distribution of fund amounts to nurses. The parties agree to accept the recommendation of Commissioner Saunders. Equity backpayments will be made by separate check and will be paid within thirty (30) days of agreement on the parties’ agreement on final claimants and amounts or recommendation of same by FMCS Commissioner Saunders.

Re: Various Agreements
Dear Ms. Hararas:
This letter sets forth various agreements of the parties reached in negotiations.
The parties acknowledge and agree that, by changing the language of Section 1.2 of the 2000-2003 collective bargaining agreement between the Washington Hospital Center and the District of Columbia Nurses Association, the parties do not intend to change the scope of the bargaining unit as it existed on July 12, 2003 when Nurses United was elected as the nurses1 bargaining representative, and they do not intend to waive any rights they may have or arguments they may make regarding the inclusion or exclusion of any position from the bargaining unit. Each party agrees that it will not use the changes to Section 1.2 as a basis for seeking to narrow or expand the bargaining unit.
The Hospital will investigate whether CareFirst Blue Cross/Blue Shield will provide an option for nurse retirees to participate in a group medical plan at their own cost.
During the period until October 4, 2004, the parties will explore the possibility of establishing a 403(b) plan in which all eligible nurses can participate. This will include consideration of plan options which
102
are different than the one provided for new hires in Section 26.3 of the Agreement.
The parameters for the defined contribution plan for new hires referenced in Section 26.3 of the Agreement are as follows: The defined contribution plan will provide for a matching employer contribution of fifty percent (50%) on the first six percent (6%) of pay (including base pay, overtime, differentials) contributed by the employee. The plan will further provide for a fixed employer contribution, based on service, regardless of nurse contributions. For those with less than ten (10) years of service, the contribution will be two percent (2%) of pay, and for those with ten (10) or more years of service, the contribution will be three percent (3%) of pay. Nurses must be age twenty-one (21) with one (1) year of service in order to be eligible for the employer contributions (fixed and matching). Employer contributions (fixed and matching) will be made at the end of the year, for nurses who remain employed at that time. A nurse must work at least 1,000 hours in the year to be eligible for the employer contributions for that year. The vesting schedule will be one-hundred percent (100%) at three (3) years for matching contributions and one-hundred (100%) at five (5) years for fixed contributions. The plan will provide an array of investment alternatives for the dollars contributed to the defined contribution plan.
Very truly yours,
