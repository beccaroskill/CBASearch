The parties to this Agreement agree that it is in their mutual interest to promote increased unionization in the janitorial industry and, while it is preferable to bring in new clients, new accounts, and new signatory contractors under the full terms and conditions of this Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Parties recognize that there may be occasions where a phase-in financial arrangement might facilitate the signing or acquisition of new accounts, clients, or contractors.
In such cases the Parties agree that the primary goal is to maintain a commitment to the health and welfare provisions of this Agreement, but that reduced wages may he provided to any account, client, or new signatory contractor for up to one (I) year from the date of the new bid or signature. In such case, the terms of the reduced wage rates will he provided in writing by the Union, with advance notice, to each signatory Employer, and those terms may apply to any signatory contractor bidding on that same account or client portfolio.
Should the Union become signatory to a Collective Bargaining Agreement that provides reduced or delayed participation in the Health & Welfare Trust, the Master Janitorial Agreement will be amended to provide the same identical language.
