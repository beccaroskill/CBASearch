COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT PUYALLUP PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 3 PUYALLUP EDUCATION ASSOCIATION
THIS AGREEMENT IS MADE AND ENTERED INTO by and between Puyallup School District No. 3 (hereinafter referred to as the "District") and the Puyallup Education Association (hereinafter referred to as the "Association"), as follows:
PART I - ADMINISTRATION AND STATUS OF AGREEMENT
ARTICLE 1.	RECOGNITION
The District recognizes the Association as the sole and exclusive negotiating representative for all regular certificated employees of the District and all regular substitute certificated employees. The term regular substitute certificated employees shall mean substitutes who in the previous school year worked twenty (20) full consecutive days in the same assignment or thirty (30) full days during the year in various assignments. The term Certificated Employees shall include all certificated personnel regularly employed and under contract by the District, or on an approved leave or layoff, excluding all administrative staff. Exclusions for newly created positions shall be reviewed jointly by the District and Association utilizing Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC) guidelines or services if required. Although the Association has functions not herein described, the District recognizes that the function of negotiations is exclusively accorded the Association as the representative of certificated employees as is the function of grievance representation.
Unless otherwise noted, the terms “staff”, “certificated staff”, “employee” and “certificated employee” shall mean employees of the District covered by this bargaining unit and Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
ARTICLE 2.	MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
Consistent with the provisions covered in this Agreement, or those items which are mandatory topics of negotiations, the District shall have the right to carry out management functions as required.
ARTICLE 3.	ADMINISTRATION-ASSOCIATION COMMUNICATIONS
Representatives of the Association and the District shall meet regularly during the school year to review and discuss current items of concern or of interest to either party, including this Agreement.
ARTICLE 4.	STATUS OF AGREEMENT
Section 4.1.	This Agreement shall become effective when ratified and signed by authorized representatives of the District and the Association and may be changed only after written request(s) for amendment by either party and then only by the mutual consent of both parties, with such amendments being arrived at through negotiations and formalized in the same manner as this Agreement.
This Agreement and any amendments hereto shall remain in force until August 31, 2008. Either party shall notify the other party in writing of its intent to amend, modify or terminate the Agreement not less than 120 days, or more than 150 days, prior to the expiration day of this Agreement.
6
Section 4.2.	Both the District and the Association recognize the need for adherence to rules, regulations, policies and this Agreement in carrying out their respective functions. In cases where there is a conflict between this Agreement and said rules, regulations, policies, or individual certificated employee's contracts, or the application thereof, this Agreement shall prevail.
Section 4.3.	Any part of this Agreement, or of its application, found to be contrary to law by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction shall be invalid only while contrary, and only to the extent that it is contrary, but such invalidity shall not invalidate any other portion of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is so held to be contrary to law, the Association and the District shall commence negotiations on said provisions to arrive at a valid provision as soon thereafter as reasonably possible.
Section 4.4.	Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, nothing contained herein shall be interpreted and/or applied so as to adversely affect current individual salaries and employee benefits or other provisions which have heretofore been recognized, practiced or accorded by the District.
Section 4.5.	Copies of this Agreement shall be printed by the District, made available to prospective certificated employees and distributed to certificated employees within thirty (30) days of contract ratification and Board approval. In addition, fifty (50) copies shall be provided to the Association. Upon hiring, the district shall provide each new certificated employee with a copy of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Section 4.6.	Appendices. The Appendices are integral parts of this Agreement and by this reference are incorporated herein.
PART II - BUSINESS
ARTICLE 5.	PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS
Section 5.1.	Dues Deductions
The Association shall have the exclusive right to payroll deduction of dues, assessments and fees required for membership for those certificated employees represented provided, however, that the Association shall present said deductions to the District in one billing which shall change no more than three times per fiscal year, exclusive of the addition or deletion of individuals. Authorization and/or revocation of membership shall be provided to the District on jointly developed forms, authorized and provided to individuals by the Association. In order to be effective, revocation forms shall be returned by individuals to the Association not later than September 11 in order that the Association can deliver said forms to the District by September 12. The District shall continue to provide such deduction service during the period of this Agreement.
Section 5.2.	Representation Fee
The terms and conditions of this Agreement in regard to membership in the Association, as a required condition of employment, or alternatively, the payment of an amount equal to Association dues required for membership, as a required condition of employment are as follows:
A.	All certificated employees who are members of the Association shall maintain their membership in good standing in the Association during the life of this Agreement or pay a representation fee pursuant to RCW 41.59.
7
B.	All certificated employees hired after August 23, 1979, shall become a member of the Association, or alternatively, have deducted from his/her salary a representation fee equivalent to the Association dues required for membership, as a condition of employment.
C.	Certificated employees who were in the employ of the District and not a member of the Association on August 23, 1979, and who notified the Association and the District within the prescribed ten (10) day period that they did not desire to become a member of the Association or pay a representation fee shall not be required to maintain membership in the Association or to pay a representation fee as a condition of employment during the life of this Agreement.
D.	A certificated employee who objects to the payment of representation fees based on bona fide religious tenets or teachings of a church or religious body of which said employee is a member, shall have deducted from his/her salary an amount equivalent to the representation fee, which shall be transmitted to a charitable organization mutually agreed to by such employee and the Association. If the employee and the Association are unable to agree on a charitable organization, the organization shall be determined by the Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC), provided that such organization shall not be the church or religious body described above. The District shall send the Association verification of such transmittal.
E.	Representation fees shall be deducted from employees' salaries in the same manner as Association dues and shall be transmitted to the Association. A suitable record keeping system for application, deduction, payment, transmittal, etc. of representation fees shall be developed jointly by appropriate representatives of the Association and the District.
F.	The Association, solely, shall assume the responsibility of providing such notification as it seems appropriate to bargaining unit members affected by these representation fee provisions and shall also provide a copy of said notification to the District.
Section 5.3.	Hold District Harmless
The District shall be held harmless by the Association, including reasonable attorney fees for any attorney mutually approved by the Association and the District, for compliance with Sections 5.1 and 5.2 herein, pertaining to deduction of dues, fees, assessments, and representation fees.
Section 5.4.	Other Deductions
The District shall, upon receipt or authorization from a certificated employee, deduct from said employee's salary and make appropriate remittance for medical plans, tax-sheltered annuities, salary insurance, United Way, savings plans, or any other plans or programs jointly approved for deduction by the Association and the District.
ARTICLE 6.	COOPERATION
Section 6.1.	Availability of Information
The Association President shall be furnished, upon request, reasonable and appropriate available data pertinent for use in carrying out the Association's negotiation and representation functions. All parties shall exercise discretion in the utilization of such data.
8
Section 6.2.	Association Rights
The District shall honor reasonable requests by the Association for the use of facilities and equipment, the use of in-District mail service, making bulletin board space available, and making expendable supplies available at the cost to the District plus a 10% handling charge.
Section 6.3.	Association Leave
In order to provide proper representation of members of the bargaining unit and/or to confer with the District or its representative(s), leave shall be granted by the District according to the provisions of this section. All such leave shall be granted upon request of the Association President. Request for leave shall be submitted in writing as far in advance as possible, but never later than noon of the day before the leave is to take effect. The arrangements for the leave shall be discussed with the Association President. Billing for the leave shall be made to the Association by the District using the following guidelines. According to current practices regarding frequency or for purposes as mutually agreed between the Association and the District as follows:
A.	District-scheduled meetings such as grievance processing shall not be billed.
B.	Professional meetings affecting employer/employee relationships shall be billed at the cost of the substitute including the hourly rate, employer FICA costs, Workman's Compensation and retirement compensation if applicable.
C.	Employee interest activities such as lobbying and Association training sessions shall be billed to provide full reimbursement to the District for salaries and employer costs paid.
D.	The Association President shall be on the “All-District” email communications lists.
E.	All certificated employees, including the Association President, shall be provided with email addresses. The President’s email address shall be made available to all certificated staff.
Certificated employees using such leave shall be responsible to provide appropriate preparation and lesson plans, as necessary, for their substitutes, as well as to provide appropriate follow-up after such leave. Professional Agreement Article 6, Section 6.4, and Article 37, Section 37.5.D, which provides for particular situations, is deemed not to be in conflict with this section.
Section 6.4.	Association President's Released Time
In order to provide proper representation of members of the bargaining unit, the Association President shall be released up to full-time from regular employment to perform Association duties, to conduct Association business and/or to confer with the District or its representatives. The Association shall request released time, if any, thirty (30) days prior to the end of the semester preceding the one for which the leave is sought, except in cases where such notice is not possible.
If the Association President remains a part-time employee, he/she will receive full salary and benefits as though employed full-time. However, the Puyallup Education Association will reimburse the Puyallup School District for the difference between what the Association President would have received as a parttime employee and the amount the Puyallup School District actually pays in compensations and benefits, except as specified below in items one through four. If the Association President has full-time release, the District will be reimbursed for all compensation paid by the Puyallup School District during the period of
9
release whether the full-time release is for the entire school year or a portion of a school year. However, it is agreed the Association President shall be deemed an employee of the District during the period of release and shall not be penalized in regard to salary, seniority, benefits or rights pertaining to employment. Specifically, the Association President: 1) Will accrue leaves as other full-time employees; 2) Will be eligible for TRI as approved by the Association; 3) Will receive payment for supplemental days at the same rate as other full-time employees as approved by the Association; 4) Will be eligible for State Retirement System employer contributions by the District only to the extent the law requires payment by the District during such leave.
The Association President shall have full rights to reinstatement subject to the Layoff/Recall provisions, if applicable, to his/her original job at termination of his/her term of office. If the original position is no longer in existence, the Association President shall be treated as an involuntary transferee with the rights afforded thereto. Upon request, the Association President shall also be entitled to resume any extra duty assignments (if such assignments have not been eliminated) he/she had prior to said leave.
Section 6.5.	Orientation Meetings.
An opportunity shall be provided for an Association representative to participate in the orientation meeting for new certificated employees.
PART III - PERSONNEL
ARTICLE 7.	INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS
Section 7.1.	Certificated employees shall be entitled to full rights of citizenship as granted to citizens generally. Neither the District, in employment relations, nor the Association shall discriminate against any certificated employee by reason of race, religion, color, marital status, gender, age, national origin, domicile, bona fide political activity or lack thereof, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical disability, except as permitted in accordance with this Agreement, or by law, nor shall the position on the salary schedule affect a certificated employee's assignment and/or promotion.
Section 7.2.	The private and personal life of any certificated employee may be within the appropriate concern or attention of the Superintendent only when there is an actual, or probable, potential adverse effect on the duties and responsibilities of said employee.
Section 7.3.	Certificated employees shall not be disciplined for arbitrary or capricious reasons, but only for just cause. The District agrees to follow a policy of progressive discipline. Any disciplinary action taken against a certificated employee shall be appropriate to the behavior which precipitates said action. In accordance with the law, all employees have the right to Association representation at any meeting they reasonably believe could lead to disciplinary action. All employees have the right to stop any such meeting to obtain such representation. The specific grounds forming the basis for disciplinary action shall be made available to the certificated employee and to the Association in writing, if requested. In the event that an allegation of misconduct is investigated and not supported by the available evidence, no record of the complaint or investigation shall be retained in the District.
Any complaint or accusation made against a certificated employee which could result in disciplinary action or have an adverse impact on the employee's evaluation will be promptly called to the attention of the employee, within one week. The certificated employee will be told the substance of the complaint/accusation and the source. The possible options for handling said complaint/accusation will be discussed between the certificated employee and the administrator receiving the complaint. Normally, the
10
certificated employee and complainant will be encouraged to attempt to resolve the complaint/accusation informally; however, there may be circumstances where such an approach would not be productive. After the certificated employee has discussed the concern with the administrator receiving the complaint, the employee shall have the right to have an Association representative present at any formal meeting held where the employee and the complainant are in attendance.
Any complaint or accusation not called to the attention of the certificated employee may not be used as the basis for any disciplinary action or adverse evaluation against the certificated employee. A complaint/accusation of which the employee has knowledge may be incorporated into an evaluation provided the reference shall be specific in nature and opportunities to resolve the complaint are verified.
ARTICLE 8.	STAFF PROTECTION
Section 8.1.	All certificated employees shall be covered by the District's liability insurance policy. The District shall make a reasonable effort to protect employees from bodily harm and property damage while carrying out assigned duties.
Section 8.2.	Providing a certificated employee, at the time an act or omission is complained of, was acting in a reasonable and prudent manner within the scope of his/her employment and/or under the direction of the District, the District shall use the provisions of RCW 28A.320.100 to hold said certificated employee harmless and defend him/her from any financial loss, including reasonable attorney's fees, for legal actions arising from such alleged acts or omissions.
Section 8.3.	Certificated employees covered by Worker's Compensation and State Industrial Insurance laws shall, upon loss of time due to a job-related injury or illness, and after establishment of eligibility for such benefits, have the option to be paid their regular sick leave rather than receive compensation from the ESD 121 Worker’s Compensation Co-op Trust, of which the District is a member. Determination of illness or injury shall be made using the rules of the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries. Provided further that if the employee has exhausted all sick leave prior to the effective date of the beginning of the Worker's Compensation eligibility, the District will provide up to three additional days of leave or whatever portion thereof is needed. Additionally, the District will pay the medical insurance premiums for the balance of the school year for an employee eligible for Worker's Compensation who has exhausted all sick leave.
Section 8.4.	The District shall provide insurance as specified by State statutes protecting certificated employees while they are acting within the scope of their employment obligations to the District. When certificated employees use personal property in a school-related situation with appropriate safeguards against loss or damage, the District shall provide insurance to protect the property from loss or damage to a maximum of $1,500 total value per individual. Such insurance protection shall apply only to items for which prior approval has been given each year, in writing, by the principal or program director. Items totaling more than $1,500 need prior approval of the Superintendent or designee. Such approval must also be sought each school year and in no case extend beyond the third day after the school year ends.
Section 8.5.	Damage to a vehicle parked in the school setting shall be covered by the individual's insurance policy. All damage due to acts of God are the employee's responsibility. However, when an employee's vehicle is damaged in a school setting by vandalism, or is accidentally damaged by a student, the District will reimburse the amount of the deductible to a maximum of $200. Employees who have vehicles which are not covered by insurance shall receive the same benefit. Damage to an employee's vehicle by the District, or as the result of a District action, will be fully covered by the District. Vehicles need not be listed with the principal.
11
Section 8.6.	Any case of assault, arising out of an employment-related situation, upon a certificated employee shall be promptly reported to the District. The District shall render assistance to the certificated employee in connection with handling of the incident by law enforcement and judicial authorities. This paragraph does not apply to civil litigation instituted by the certificated employee.
ARTICLE 9.	TEACHING OF CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES
Any democracy, if it is to remain a democracy, must expect and anticipate a change politically, socially and economically. In a democracy, change should come through law and through orderly procedure rather than through revolution and use of force. There are controversial issues inherent in change which, if correct solutions are to be found, must be freely and openly discussed.
Consistent with accepted professional standards and practices, all pupils shall have an opportunity to learn and certificated employees to teach, relevant to the course content; to find facts; to collect factual materials; to organize factual materials; to interpret factual materials; to examine attitudes; survey prejudices, note appeals, rethink assumptions, and to consider what ought to be as well as what is; and to generalize upon the basis of this material.
No certificated employee shall use his/her position to propagandize in the interests of any religious, social, economic or political creed. The techniques of dealing with controversial issues are the most valuable outcomes of those classes and include an ability to collect information, to refrain from passing judgments before sufficient facts have been secured upon which to base these judgments, to organize materials, to seek relationships, and to draw inferences and conclusions. Every certificated employee shall have the right to express personal views on controversial subjects but no certificated employee shall express personal views at a time, or in a manner that would interfere with the achievement of these outcomes or would condition the thinking of the pupil upon the controversial issues under consideration before that pupil has basic facts.
ARTICLE 10.	REASSIGNMENT/TRANSFER
Section 10.1.	Definitions
Vacancy: Shall be defined as a new position or a position vacated and available through resignation, termination or retirement, except as provided for in Section 10.4.5.
Length of Service: Shall be defined in this Article only as the number of years of contracted experience in the Puyallup School District, and part-years shall be calculated as they are for the S-275 Form.
Core Team: Shall be defined as employees representative of grade levels and subject areas, serving as the planning faculty for a new school.
Position: An assignment associated with a particular building or with particular building(s), and specifically connected to a grade level, secondary department, a District special program, or a related services program.
Section 10.2.	Reassignment
Reassignment shall mean a shift of an employee from one department or grade level to another within a building different from that of the previous school year, but not merely a change in the number of sections in each department. In the case of related services itinerant staff or special program staff (as defined in
12
Section 10.3.1), a reassignment shall mean a change in locations where an employee will provide a District program function.
Section 10.2.1.	Before posting vacancies, open positions shall first be filled by reassignment where possible. Length of service shall be the determining factor when two or more employees are substantially equal in regards to the following: area of experience; expressed interest of the employee; certification, including level of endorsement; academic majors and minors or subject area endorsement; and program considerations.
Section 10.2.2.	Reassignments shall be made only for valid educational reasons. These reasons shall be shared with the employee at the time of reassignment. If the educational reasons provided to the employee are considered unacceptable, it can be challenged through the grievance procedure.
The term “valid educational reason” is defined as an authentic rationale directly related to improving student learning, as distinguished from one that is arbitrary, capricious, or based on personality, race, religion, creed, gender or other irrelevant factors.
Section 10.2.3.	If a reassignment would result in an identified increase in the work year for an employee, said position must be posted as per Section 10.4.
Section 10.2.4.	A reassignment shall not result in an employee being moved from one educational program to another (i.e. K-6 teacher to related services, secondary teaching staff to a K-6 teaching position, related services staff to a special program position, etc.).
Section 10.3.	Involuntary Transfer
An involuntary transfer shall mean a transfer necessitated by an elimination or reduction in program, declining student enrollment, closure of schools, changes in school boundaries or reduction in staffing ratio.
Section 10.3.1.	Involuntary transferees will be identified in the following manner:
A.	The elementary school (K-6), secondary department, special programs or related services area in which the involuntary transfer must occur will be identified. Special programs shall include: library, full-day Kindergarten, guidance, elementary physical education, music, special education, vocational education, and remediation. Related services shall include: occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech and language pathologists, nurses, psychologists and behavioral specialists.
B.	Prior to designating involuntary transfers within the building, special program, or related service area, the Principal or immediate supervisor will solicit requests from those within the affected program or building willing to be designated as the involuntary transferee. It is recognized by the parties, that identifying involuntaries is not the most desirable method of changing staffing needs; therefore, it will be used only when voluntary methods do not accomplish the required changes.
C.	If no employee volunteers, the employee in the affected elementary, secondary department, program or related service area with the least length of service in the District will be identified as the involuntary transferee. If ties exist, Section 10.6 shall be implemented to break said ties.
13
D.	No later than April 15 of each year, employees who have been identified as involuntary transferees will be notified in writing of their transfer and the reasons therefore. If the District cannot reasonably calculate its staffing because of the State Legislature's failure to act upon a K-12 budget, the parties to this Agreement will mutually agree to a reasonable extension of the involuntary notification timeline.
E.	If during the fall of the subsequent school year, a school is determined to be overstaffed, the building administrator will identify the involuntary transferee utilizing the aforementioned process. If this occurs, the involuntary transferee will be transferred to a different building or site; however, he/she will have the option of being declared an involuntary transferee the following spring and being accorded all the rights thereof. Said involuntary transferee must notify the Human Resources Office by April 15 if he/she decides to exercise this option.
F.	When an involuntary transfer occurs during the school year, at least three (3) days of release time shall be given the affected teacher in order to complete the move and become oriented to the new building or site.
G.	When an employee is involuntarily transferred to a new subject area, grade level, special program or service area, appropriate observations of other employees will be arranged.
H.	In instances where teaching positions within a building are combined or where declining enrollment in separate buildings causes the combining of teaching positions, the principal and the employees involved who are qualified to meet the identified instructional needs will attempt to arrive at a mutually acceptable identification of who will fill the respective positions. If the employees cannot agree, the employee with the greatest length of service in the District will be given his/her choice of the remaining position(s) or of being identified as an involuntary transferee. The aforementioned process will be followed going from the most senior to the least senior employee, until no positions remain. In the case where none of the employees involved are interested in the remaining positions, said positions shall be awarded to the employee(s) with the least length of service in the District.
Section 10.3.2.	When involuntary transfers occur, employees who are involuntarily transferred will select a position for which they are qualified from a list of vacant positions. If there is no position available at that time, they will be placed in a position for which they are qualified when one becomes available. Selection of positions shall be done in seniority order. In either case, involuntary transferees shall be placed prior to other employees in filling vacancies, except in the opening of new schools as provided for in Section 10.5.
Section 10.3.3.	Due to the fluctuation in enrollment associated with the Kindergarten program, Kindergarten teachers who have been involuntarily transferred shall have the option to transfer back to their previous Kindergarten position should it become available by August 31.
Section 10.4.	Transfer
Transfer shall be defined as change from a position in one building to another, or from a position in one District special program to another position, or from one related services program to another position.
Section 10.4.1.	Prior to positions being filled consistent with Section 10.4.2 below, the District may fill ten (10) positions with external applicants.
14
Section 10.4.2.	During the month of March, continuing contracted employees may apply for a transfer to another building or special or related services program by filling out the Human Resources Transfer Request form. Employees are to indicate the school(s) or special or related services program(s) to which they wish to transfer and the subject area(s) and/or grade level they would like to teach. Such preferences shall be listed in priority order. As positions become open, the names of employees who have indicated an interest will be submitted to the building(s) or program(s). Positions being filled will be listed on the District website. If an employee accepts any position or declines his/her first choice, he/she is removed from consideration for other positions. Employees may change their request form at any time if they have not yet accepted or declined a position. Transfer Request Forms will be distributed during the month of February.
Applicants will be interviewed for the position if they meet the following criteria: areas of experience, interest in the position, certification (including level of endorsement), length of service, academic majors and minors or subject area endorsement, and valid educational reasons. Principals or immediate supervisors may prescreen applicants. If candidates are substantially equal in the aforementioned criteria, principals or immediate supervisors shall only have to interview the three most senior candidates. If the candidates are nearly equal, the candidate who has the greater length of service in the District will be awarded the position.
Section 10.4.3.	Leave returnees not guaranteed their former positions may apply and shall be considered for placement along with other regularly contracted employees requesting voluntary transfer.
Section 10.4.4.	Applicants for transfer will be advised of the selection decision within seven (7) calendar days.
Section 10.4.5.	Employees may transfer through August 31.

The parties will collaboratively establish the timeline for the posting and selection of staff for new schools and notice of involuntary transferees related thereto.
Section 10.6.	Tie Breaker
In the event ties exist in number of years in the District, the employee(s) having the highest number of college or university credits beyond the B.A. Degree earned by September 1, and as documented in the Human Resources Office by October 1 of the current school year, shall have preference. If ties remain, the employee(s) to be retained shall be determined by lot.

The short-form evaluation process may not be used as a basis for determining that an employee's work is unsatisfactory under subsection (1) of this section nor as probable cause for nonrenewal of an employee's contract under RCW 28A.405.210.
The above process will be available to building administrators but shall not be used if a staff member prefers the long-form process. If an administrator would like to use the short-form process, it is agreed that:
A.	Notice of this request will be given to the employee prior to September 30.
B.	No person being evaluated by the process will be rated less than satisfactory.
C.	The same summary form will be used as with the long form, but without narrative.
Section 15.5.2.	Professional Growth Option. The District will offer the Professional Growth Option as an evaluation component. (See WAC 392-192.)
Section 15.6.	Transferred, Resigned or Terminated Employees
If a certificated employee is transferred after October 1 to another position not under the supervisor's jurisdiction, an evaluation shall be made at the time of such transfer, if possible. If an employee resigns or is terminated during the school year, a final evaluation shall be completed prior to his final date of employment, if possible.
Section 15.7.	Relationship to the Grievance Procedure
Except for the procedural requirements of the evaluation and probation sections of this Agreement, the content of a certificated employee's evaluation, or of an administrator's report pursuant to Articles 16 and 17, shall not be subject to Article 37, Grievance Procedure, of this Agreement. Further, since the contracts of replacement employees expire automatically as per RCW 28A.405.900, procedural errors regarding the evaluations of these employees shall only be subject to Steps 1, 2 and 3 of the Grievance Procedure.

ARTICLE 16.	PROBATION
Section 16.1.	General
The probationary procedure as set forth herein shall provide a certificated employee (excludes provisional and replacement employees) with an opportunity to demonstrate improvement in the areas of deficiency and offer assistance in the improvement of performance.

Provisional employees who are experiencing performance difficulties will be advised by the District Administration of their right to contact the PEA President or Uniserv Director for representation at a meeting with the employee’s evaluator. This meeting will be conducted prior to any official personnel action.
Section 16.2.	Advisory Conference
If the supervisor contemplates recommending that a certificated employee be placed on probation, the supervisor shall confer with the employee prior to making the recommendation and shall:
A.	Review the reasons for the contemplated probation and specify which of the evaluative criteria in Article 15 the employee is failing to demonstrate satisfactorily.
B.	Review the improvements required for the performance to be considered acceptable.
C.	Discuss the specific and reasonable program of improvement being contemplated to recommend to the Superintendent.
The advisory conference may be held at any time. At the request of the employee, Association representation may be present.
The three items above will be provided to the employee in writing prior to the advisory conference and in the same document the employee shall be notified that he/she is entitled to Association representation during the advisory conference. If the decision is still to recommend probation to the Superintendent, the supervisor shall provide to the employee a copy of the written interim evaluation and the recommendation being sent. If the employee wishes to respond to the interim evaluation, the response should be delivered to the Superintendent.
Section 16.3.	Establishment of Probationary Period
If the Superintendent concurs with a supervisor's judgment that the performance of a certificated employee is unsatisfactory, the Superintendent shall place the employee in a probationary status. After October 15 but no later than sixty (60) school days before the end of the school year, said employee shall be given written notice of the action of the Superintendent which notice shall contain the following information:
A.	Specific areas of performance deficiencies.
B.	Improvements required for acceptable performance and a suggested specific and reasonable program for improvement.
27

Section 16.4.	Evaluation, Assistance and Recommendation
During the probationary period, the evaluator shall meet with the employee at least twice monthly to supervise, observe, and make a written evaluation of the progress, if any, made by the employee.
The evaluator may authorize one additional certificated employee to evaluate the probationer and to aid the employee in improving his/her areas of deficiency. The evaluator shall discuss such appointment with the probationer. If the assigned probationary duties require absence from a teaching assignment, any necessary substitute shall be paid by the District.
At the conclusion of the probationary period, the principal or director shall complete a written evaluation for each probationary employee and recommend to the Superintendent:
A.	That the certificated employee has demonstrated sufficient improvement in the stated area(s) of deficiency to justify the removal of the probationary status, or
B.	That the certificated employee has demonstrated sufficient improvement in the stated area(s) of deficiency to justify removal of the probationary status if accompanied by a letter identifying areas where further improvement is required, or
C.	That the certificated employee has not demonstrated sufficient improvement in the stated area(s) of deficiency and action should be taken to not renew the employment contract of the certificated employee.
Should the required reports of the certificated employee's probationary progress, if any, contain information not previously made known to the certificated employee, the certificated employee may submit a written statement which shall be appended to such report.
Section 16.5.	Action by Superintendent
Following a review of any report submitted pursuant to paragraph 4 above, the Superintendent shall determine which of the alternative courses of action is proper and shall take appropriate action to implement such determination.

Following the probationary period and at the Superintendent’s discretion, the Superintendent may remove the employee from his or her assignment and place the employee in an alternative assignment at the same rate of pay and benefits or place the employee on paid leave for the balance of the contract term, provided that the employee’s reassignment shall not displace another employee.
ARTICLE 17.	PERSONNEL FILES

28
review. No other individual personnel file will be kept without the employee's knowledge. Unidentified derogatory material shall not be included in the personnel file. Identified derogatory material shall be shown to a certificated employee within a reasonable time after receipt or composition. Derogatory materials from nonprofessional sources shall not be included in the personnel file, except in extraordinary circumstances. The certificated employee shall sign the material to indicate only that he/she has read it and shall have the right to attach their own written comments.
ARTICLE 18.	PROFESSIONAL GROWTH AND LEAVE
Section 18.1.	Certificated employees need opportunities for the development of increased competence beyond that which they may attain through the performance of their assigned duties. In light of their impact upon the lives of students and in keeping with the breadth of experience and training which they possess, opportunities need to be especially rich and varied. These opportunities include such activities as visits to other classrooms and other schools, conferences involving other personnel from the District, county, state, region or nation; membership on committees, training in classes and workshops offered within the District; released time and leaves of absence for travel and study; and further training in institutions of higher learning.

ARTICLE 19.	LEAVES
For purposes of this Article, leaves shall be granted in the following order of priority: 1) Section 19.1, Illness, Injury and Emergency; 2) Section 19.2, Bereavement; 3) Section 19.3, Family Illness; 4) Section 19.4, Discretionary; and 5) Other Leaves.
Section 19.1. Illness, Injury and Emergency Leave for All Certificated Employees
A full-time certificated employee shall be allowed twelve (12) days a year for the certificated employee's personal illness, injury, and emergency leave. The twelve (12) days shall be posted to the credit of the employee effective the first day each school year, but shall be reduced proportionately for an employee who fails to complete the first quarter of the school year for any reason other than illness, injury, or emergency. Such leave shall be accumulated from year to year as allowed by law. No deduction from salaries shall be made during these days. Certificated employees working less than a full year shall be allowed personal illness, personal injury and emergency leave as follows: Number of days worked divided by 180 multiplied by 12. An employee may choose to use such leave to care for his/her minor children, spouse or partner, parents, parents-in-law, grandparents, or children over age eighteen (18) with disabilities with a serious health condition as defined by the Family and Medical Leave Act.
The District may require a physician’s statement at any time to verify use of Illness, Injury and Emergency Leave.
29
An "emergency" is defined as an unforeseen and suddenly precipitated occurrence of a serious nature beyond the control of the certificated employee which threatens the physical well-being or property of the certificated employee or his/her immediate family, and is of such nature that preplanning is not possible or could not relieve the necessity for the certificated employee's absence. Application for emergency leave shall be made to the Superintendent or his/her designee.
Even though a substitute teacher is not called when certain personnel are absent, the regular policies of deductions and illness, injury and emergency leave shall be used.
Illness, injury and emergency leave shall also apply to disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, childbirth and recovery therefrom as per Section 19.8.
Eligible employees may utilize the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for their own serious health condition in accordance with section 19.5. All the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act shall be extended to employees with work assignments of seven and one half (7.5) or more hours per day and at least 180 days per year who meet all other FMLA eligibility requirements.
Section 19.1.1. Attendance Incentive Program. Certificated employees may elect an annual conversion of accumulated illness, injury and emergency leave and a conversion of illness, injury and emergency leave upon retirement or death for monetary compensation. The conversion procedures are as follows:
A.	Annual Conversion of Accumulated Illness, Injury and Emergency Leave: Any certificated employee who at the end of the immediately previous calendar year shall have accumulated in excess of sixty (60) days of unused illness, injury and emergency leave, may convert unused illness, injury and emergency leave earned the previous year in excess of the said sixty (60) days to monetary compensation at the rate of 25 percent of the employee's current full-time daily rate of compensation for each full day of eligible illness, injury and emergency leave. The employee's illness, injury and emergency leave accumulation shall be reduced four (4) days for each day compensated. Any such election shall be made by written notice to the Director of Human Resources during the month of January. Any such annual conversion of accumulated illness, injury and emergency leave shall be in accordance with law.
B.	Conversion of Illness, Injury and Emergency Leave Upon Retirement or Death. Any certificated employee who shall retire or who shall die while employed by the District may elect (personally or by a personal representative, as appropriate) to convert accumulated unused illness, injury and emergency leave days to monetary compensation at the rate of 25 percent of the employee's full-time daily rate of compensation at the time of termination from employment for each full day of eligible illness, injury and emergency leave. A maximum of 180 days, divided by a factor of four so as not to exceed 45 days, may be cashed in for monetary value upon retirement or death. Any such conversion of illness, injury and emergency leave upon retirement or death shall be in accordance with law.
C.	The Association will annually notify the District of its intent to participate in VEBA III.
Section 19.2.	Bereavement Leave
1.	A certificated employee shall be allowed a bereavement leave for the death of any relative residing in the employee's household and/or the following family members: spouse, mother, father, daughter,
30
son, siblings, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sister-in-law, brother-inlaw, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece and nephew. The number of days of leave, not to exceed five (5) per occasion of death shall be allowed according to the circumstances of each case as determined by the Superintendent or designee. These days are not cumulative or transferable. No deductions from salaries or sick leave shall be made during these days.
2.	Any certificated employee who has a death of a student in his/her classroom shall be authorized leave to attend the memorial and/or a funeral service.
Section 19.3.	Family Illness
Certificated employees shall be eligible for a non-cumulative family illness leave for serious health condition in the immediate family as defined by the employee. This leave shall warrant up to a maximum of three (3) working days during a contract year with no salary deduction to the employee. A maximum of two (2) additional days with the cost of a substitute being deducted from the employee's salary shall be allowed.
This leave may require a written statement from the attending physician.
Family illness leave shall not be deducted from accumulated illness, injury or emergency leave.
Section 19.4.	Discretionary Leave
One (1) discretionary leave day shall be allowed each certificated employee for important compelling personal matters. This discretionary leave day shall not be used for conducting income-producing business. Discretionary leave shall not be used for a strike against the Puyallup School District.
The District shall grant Discretionary Leave in the order the requests are received provided the requests are made in compliance with the above conditions. After February 1, only fourteen (14) discretionary leave requests shall be honored on Fridays. However, this cap shall be increased by one for every discretionary leave request which provides at least a three-week notice; however, said total of guaranteed discretionary leave days on Fridays after February 1 shall not exceed twenty (20). On Fridays after February 1, any additional requests will be granted only after all other substitute requests have been covered.
Due to a lack of substitutes on Career Fair Day sponsored by the Washington School Personnel Association, only five (5) discretionary leave requests shall be honored. Any additional request will be granted only after all other substitute requests have been covered.
In years when school begins before Labor Day, no requests for discretionary leave to extend that holiday will be guaranteed. Instead, requests will be granted only for compelling personal reasons, and must be submitted to the Director of Human Resources three (3) weeks in advance of the leave being requested.
An employee may utilize a discretionary leave day prior to or after a holiday or vacation period, provided, three (3) weeks’ notice is given by the employee to the District. Only twenty (20) such requests shall be guaranteed per holiday/vacation period. Any additional requests will be granted only after all other substitute requests have been covered.
A maximum of six (6) discretionary leave days may be accumulated over a period of six (6) years. A maximum of two (2) days may be used consecutively unless additional use is approved by the Director of Human Resources, or the employee utilizing more than two (2) days consecutively has given the District at least three (3) weeks’ notice.
31
Employees may receive monetary compensation for their unused discretionary leave day(s) at the current substitute rate. A request for monetary compensation must be made by June 1 on a form provided by the Human Resources Office.
To the extent permitted by law, unused discretionary leave may be shared with other employees at the option of the individual employee. Employees who choose to share discretionary leave must complete the form titled, "Discretionary Leave Sharing Authorization" before transferring leave to another employee.
Section 19.5	Family and Medical Leave (FMLA)
In accordance with the FMLA, full time certificated employees (employees who work at least seven and one half (7.5) hours per day and at least 180 days per year), who have also worked for the District at least one (1) year in the preceding year, shall be entitled to twelve (12) work weeks of unpaid Family Leave during any twelve (12) month period for the following:
A.	To care for a newborn or adopted child of the employee who is under the age of eighteen (18) at the time of placement for adoption, or a newly-placed foster child; (Section 19.8) or
B.	To care for a spouse, domestic partner, parent or child of the employee who has a serious health condition; or
C.	For a personal health condition if it renders the employee unable to perform his or her job.
FMLA shall run concurrently with all applicable paid leave time available to the employee.
Leave taken for newborn or adopted child care shall be completed within one (1) year after the date of birth or placement for adoption. Family Leave authorized under this policy must be taken full-time and consecutively unless an alternative schedule is approved by the Human Resources Department or where intermittent or reduced leave is medically necessary. Instructional staff may not take reduced or intermittent leave without the approval of the Director of Human Resources. An instructional employee may be transferred to an alternative equivalent position that would accommodate reduced or intermittent leave, if such a position is available.
The District will continue to pay its portion of the employee’s medical and dental benefit during approved FMLA leave.
A period of Family Leave is in addition to any sick leave taken due to the employee's temporary disability attributable to pregnancy or childbirth.
If both parents of a newborn or newly-adopted child are employed by the school district, they shall be entitled to a total of twelve (12) work weeks of Family Leave during any twelve (12) month period, and leave shall be granted to only one parent at a time. There is no pooling in effect for spouses if the Family Leave is related to a serious health condition.
The Human Resources Department shall require written verification from the employee's health care provider.
The District may obtain the opinion of a second health care provider, at District expense, concerning any information pertinent to the employee's leave request. If the opinions of the health care providers differ on any matter determinative of the employee's eligibility for Family Leave, the two health care providers shall select a third provider, whose opinion, obtained at the employer's expense, shall be conclusive.
32
Return to Work. Any employee returning from an authorized Family and Medical Leave within twelve (12) work weeks, shall be entitled to the same position held by the employee when the leave commenced, or to a position with equivalent benefits and pay.
Reinstatement of an employee returning from Family and Medical Leave need not occur if: (a) the specific job is eliminated by a bona fide restructuring, or a reduction-in-force resulting from lack of funds or lack of work, (b) an employee on leave takes a position with another employer outside the home, or (c) the employee fails to provide the required notice of intent to take leave or fails to return on the established ending date of leave. If an employee fails to return from leave for a reason other than the employee’s death, the District may recover the costs of the employee's health benefits paid during the leave. Instructional staff may be required to delay their return from family leave to the beginning of the next semester under the following circumstances:
A.	The employee began leave five (5) or more weeks before the end of the semester, the leave is for more than three (3) weeks, and the employee would otherwise return to work within three (3) weeks of the end of the semester.
B.	The employee began family leave (except for a personal health condition) less than five (5) weeks before the end of the semester, the leave is for more than two (2) weeks, and the employee would otherwise return to work within two (2) weeks of the end of the semester.
C.	The employee began family leave (except for a personal health condition) three (3) or fewer weeks before the end of the semester and the period of leave is more than five (5) working days.
Section 19.6.	General Leave
The District cannot always grant a leave of absence as there is no certainty of a vacancy to make room for the employee when returning. The Director of Human Resources, however, will consider such cases individually and may grant a leave of absence without pay for a period not to exceed one (1) calendar year. Leave may be granted beyond one (1) calendar year under special circumstances if approved by the District. A certificated employee granted such leave shall be guaranteed reemployment by the District at the conclusion of said leave, consistent with Article 24, herein. The returning employee will not necessarily be assigned to the identical position occupied before the leave, but will be reinstated to a certificated position equivalent in duties and salary to that held at the time the leave of absence began. Such reinstatement is contingent upon the availability of such a position. A salary increment shall not be given for the year during which the leave of absence is taken unless the individual is engaged in a District-approved teaching assignment, or has been drafted into the United States Armed Services. A leave of absence shall generally not be granted a teacher until completion of three (3) years of experience. General Leave shall run concurrently with any FMLA leave taken as per section 19.5. While on an approved general leave, an employee’s benefits, accrual of benefits and accrual of seniority shall continue as indicated in section 19.12.
Section 19.7.	Short Leaves of an Extraordinary Nature
Other unpaid leaves of a personal nature may be approved at the discretion of the Director of Human Resources, and may include, but not be limited to, personal business of an urgent nature involving possible loss of money or property, or severe hardship to self or the immediate family, or for extraordinary personal reasons after the employee’s discretionary leave has been exhausted. Application for these types of leaves
33
shall be made to the Director of Human Resources, who shall either deny the request, grant the leave without deduction, grant the leave with certificated employee paying the actual cost of a substitute to the District (including FICA, Worker's Compensation, retirement where applicable), or grant the request with certificated employee's salary reduced prorated according to the number of days in the contract. This leave shall not be deducted from accumulated illness, injury and emergency leave.
Section 19.8.	Pregnancy Disability/Adoption/Parental Leave.
19.8.1.	Pregnancy Disability Leave
A pregnancy disability leave of absence shall be granted to a female certificated employee upon her request for the period of temporary disability and as verified in writing by her personal physician or licensed health care provider. Pregnancy disability leave shall be a leave with compensation during the temporary disability within the limitations of the sick leave proviso, Section 19.1, herein.
The certificated employee who becomes pregnant shall notify her immediate supervisor and the Superintendent or designated representative of the condition by the beginning of the fifth (5th) month of pregnancy, or, if beyond the fifth (5th) month, at the earliest time the condition is confirmed by her personal physician or licensed health care provider. At that time she shall indicate in writing to her immediate supervisor and the Director of Human Resources whether she plans to:
1.	Take pregnancy disability leave only for time of temporary disability.
2.	Request a general leave in accordance with Section 19.6. herein to care for the child. If an employee is eligible for FMLA leave and has leave remaining, the general leave would include any leave available under the FMLA.
3.	Request a combination of 1 and 2, or
4.	Take FMLA leave for a period of up to twelve (12) weeks following the period of pregnancy disability, if eligible, as per Section 9.5. The District will extend the employee’s health benefits during this period of unpaid FMLA leave.
5.	Terminate her employment.
The pregnancy disability leave shall begin at a time determined suitable by the certificated employee and as verified in writing by her personal physician or licensed health care provider, after consultation with her immediate supervisor and the Human Resources Department. The official date of leave shall not begin until the school day following the day she leaves the job. Pregnancy Disability Leave, including time taken as FMLA leave and/or general leave to care for a newborn child shall not exceed one (1) year.
Assignment upon return from the pregnancy disability leave shall be guaranteed and shall be into the certificated employee's former position. She shall retain all rights, seniority and benefits commonly afforded certificated employees on leave, including those under the Continuing Contract Law.
Before returning in her contracted duties, the certificated employee's personal physician or licensed health care provider shall certify that the certificated employee is in good health and ready to resume her contracted duties. After receiving certification to return to work from her personal physician or licensed health care provider, the certificated employee shall return to her contracted duties at a time which she and the Director of Human Resources deem appropriate.
34
19.8.2.	Adoption/Parental Leave
A certificated employee shall be allowed a maximum of three (3) days leave with pay for purposes of gaining custody of an adopted child and/or transacting the legal requirements necessary in the adoption process. A maximum of two (2) additional days at the cost to the District of a substitute being deducted from the employee's salary shall be allowed. Adoption leave without pay shall be granted pursuant to the provisions of the General Leave section, Section 19.6 for the adoption of a child. It shall run concurrently with any FMLA leave for which the certificated employee is eligible. The certificated employee shall notify his/her immediate supervisor and the Human Resources Department as soon as possible of his/her intention to take adoption leave and his/her planned time for adoption. Leave shall then begin on the first school day after custody of the child is obtained provided, however, that this beginning date may be extended by the District, if needed, to obtain a satisfactory replacement. All conditions pertaining to his/her return to his/her contracted duties are the same as the above provisos for pregnancy disability leave except that the certification of his/her personal physician or licensed health care provider shall not be required at any time and that the position returned to may be a comparable.
Extension of pregnancy disability or adoption leave to the beginning of the certificated employee's next normal contract year shall be mutually reviewed by the District and the certificated employee if the leave period expires after the beginning of the fourth (4) quarter of a school year.
In addition to any other leaves, within the first year of a child’s birth to, or placement with, an employee, such employee shall be allowed three (3) days of parental leave with pay. As well, two (2) additional days may be taken upon agreement by the employee to reimburse the District for the cost of a substitute.
Eligible employees may utilize the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to care for their newborn or newly adopted child in accordance with section 19.5. All the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act shall be extended to employees with work assignments of seven and one half (7.5) or more hours per day and at least 180 days per year who meet all other FMLA eligibility requirements.
Section 19.9.	Leave Sharing
19.9.1.	Receiving Shared Leave
An employee is eligible to receive donated leave if all the following are true:
A. The employee requesting shared leave suffers from, or has a relative or household member suffering from, an extraordinary or severe illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition which has caused, or is likely to cause, the employee to:
1.	go on leave-without-pay status; or
2.	terminate his/her employment
B.	The employee’s absence and the use of shared leave are justified;
C.	The employee has depleted, or will shortly deplete, his/her annual leave and sick
leave reserves;
D.	The employee has been called to service in the uniformed services;
35
E.
The employee has abided by District rules regarding sick leave use; and
F. If the employee is later found to be eligible for industrial insurance benefits, the employee agrees to and shall reimburse the District for the time loss compensation that is paid to him/her to the extent that the employee is paid time loss compensation (temporary total disability compensation or loss of earning power compensation) and shared sick for the same day(s). An employee shall not use shared sick leave or donated leave to supplement the difference between time loss compensation and either net or full wages. If an employee has already received shared sick leave and is later found to be eligible to receive industrial insurance benefits, the remaining difference between shared leave minus the industrial insurance benefit shall be deducted from the employee’s sick leave balance, even if it results in a negative balance.
The Director of Human Resources shall determine the amount of leave, if any, which an employee may receive under this policy. Normally an employee shall not receive more leave than the number of contracted days remaining in the current school year. However, in the event that the condition requiring the employee's absence continues beyond the current school year, the employee shall not receive a total of more than 261 days of shared leave in accordance with RCW 41.04.665.
Section 19.9.2. Donating Shared Leave
District employees may donate annual leave or sick leave as follows:
A.	A staff member who has an accrued annual leave balance of more than ten (10) days may request that a specified number of days be transferred to another staff member authorized to receive shared leave. A staff member may not request leave to be transferred that would result in an accrued annual leave balance of fewer than ten (10) days. For purposes of this subsection A, annual leave does not accrue for employees who receive compensation in lieu of accumulating a balance of annual leave.
B.	A staff member may not request a transfer that would result in an accrued sick leave balance of fewer than one hundred seventy six (176) hours of sick leave. “Sick Leave” means leave for illness, injury or emergencies of extraordinary or severe nature pursuant to RCW 28A.400.300.
The donation of leave is totally voluntary. No employee shall be coerced, threatened, intimidated or financially induced into donating leave.
The number of leave days transferred shall not exceed the amount authorized by the donating staff member.
Leave transferred is based upon the current salary rate of the person receiving the leave. The receiving staff member will continue to be paid his/her regular rate while on shared leave. For example, if a staff member earning $15.00 an hour donates one day of leave to someone earning $7.50 an hour, the recipient would get two days of sick leave. However, if the $7.50 an hour employee donates one day to the $15.00 an hour employee, the higher-paid employee would receive one-half day of leave.
Any leave transferred under this policy which remains unused shall be returned at its original value to the staff member who donated the leave.
36
Section 19.10.	Jury Duty, Subpoena
Leave with pay shall be allowed for jury duty. Any compensation, other than that for meals and travel, for jury duty performed on contract days shall be deducted from the employee's net salary.
Leave with pay shall be granted a subpoenaed employee while appearing as a witness in court or in an administrative hearing, in which the employee is not a party in interest, or if such appearance is related to the employee's District responsibility. The employee shall obtain any witness fee due and such shall be deducted from the net salary.
Section 19.11.	Public and Military Service Leave
A.	Civic Service. Certificated employees shall be encouraged to take an active part in civic organizations. Such activity, however, should be outside of the regular school hours. Certificated employees who are called upon occasionally to take regular school time for club or community service may do so with prior approval of their immediate administrator.
B.	Political Leave. Subject to the conclusion of mutually satisfactory arrangements between the District and certificated employee, the District shall grant an unpaid leave of absence to such an employee for the purpose of serving in an elective or appointive public office or of campaigning for such an office. Upon conclusion of such public service leave, the employee shall be restored to his/her former position, or if this position is not available, to a substantially equivalent position.
C.	Military Leave. Certificated employees shall be authorized to participate in military service, and the District will allow leave for the same as provided in WAC 251-22-170.
Section 19.12.	Fringe Benefits While on Leave
Certificated employees on non-compensated leave may, at said employee's option, be continued in any fringe benefit programs of the District, provided said certificated employee reimburses the cost of the programs to the District in advance by the first of each month. Certificated employees on compensated leave shall receive all fringe benefits for which they are eligible.
While on an approved leave, an employee will retain accrued Illness, Injury and Emergency Leave, Discretionary Leave and seniority rights. However, Illness, Injury and Emergency Leave, Discretionary Leave and seniority shall not accrue while the employee is on a leave of absence.

Section 27.2.	Elementary Class Size Triggers
Classroom assistance will be provided as indicated in the chart below when these triggers are reached:
Grade	1.0/day	2.0/day	3.0/day	4.0/day
AM/PM Kindergarten	21	22-23	24-25	X

Fifth	29-30	31-32	33-34	35
Sixth	29-30	31-32	33-34	35
The first count for class size overload assistance will be on 4th school day in September. Based on this count, the District will assess the class size loads district-wide and identify those employees eligible for assistance using the chart above. Assistance will then be provided by placing para substitutes into classes or extending the hourly assignments of paraeducators already assigned to a building. Those classes with the larger class sizes will receive priority consideration. The final count for class size overload assistance will be taken on the 11th school day and adjustments in paraeducator time will be made according to the chart above. The same process will be used in January on the 2nd Monday.
Following the count days, District administrators and PEA representatives will meet to discuss the class size loads district-wide and any anticipated problem situations. Throughout the year, as specific class size issues arise, the parties will meet to discuss the issues.
No additional student may be added to a classroom beyond the fourth (4th) column without first having representatives from the Puyallup School District, the Puyallup Education Association, and the affected teacher(s) meet to discuss the reason(s) for needing to add another student and to reach agreement on an acceptable level of assistance and/or compensation. Solutions such as creating a new classroom, transferring students to other schools without loss of instructional time, adding certificated and/or classified support, and providing compensation will all be discussed.
Resource room teachers are excluded from the chart above. Staffing is done using a different process, which includes the consideration of individual students’ needs. A Resource staffing report will be provided to the PEA after the eleventh (11th) day of school.
An Elementary teacher whose class size qualifies him/her for one (1) hour of paraeducator time may elect to receive a stipend of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per semester instead of the paraeducator time.
Section 27.3.	Workload Relief
In recognizing the effect that an excessive workload has upon students, the following procedure shall be followed when an employee believes that his/her workload is excessive:
Informal Step. In the event that class sizes/workloads exceed goals at any level, a discussion may be held at the building level regarding the class size/workload. This discussion may be initiated by either an employee or an administrator.
Step 1: Site Level. The certificated employee and the principal will attempt to resolve issues of excessive workload at the building level. It may be necessary to confer with others, (i.e. other faculty, central administrators, other principals, or the Superintendent) in attempting to resolve the concern. The building administrator will consider possible options, such as: balancing the schedule, requesting additional staff because of increased student enrollment, requesting additional paraeducator assistance and other appropriate options.
Step 2: Executive Director Level. If no agreed-upon solution can be found at the building level, the matter will be forwarded to the Executive Director of Elementary or Secondary Education and/or the Executive Director of Special Services. Said executive director shall, in good faith, examine the various options including: busing students, reviewing building schedules, granting additional staff because of enrollment
48
growth, granting paraeducator time, moving staff across programs or grade levels, and other appropriate options.
Step 3: Workload Relief Committee. If no agreed-upon solution can be found within five (5) days, the matter shall be presented to the building staff, or chosen representatives thereof, along with other excessive workload problems identified in the same manner within the building. The staff, or chosen representatives, thereof, shall prioritize the workload needs of the building.
A committee will be established to deal with workload issues. Said Committee shall be composed of three (3) bargaining unit members appointed by the PEA President, and three (3) administrators appointed by the Superintendent or designee. The Committee shall select its own chairperson and will establish the guidelines, criteria and procedures for allocation of the workload fund. The list of building priorities with accompanying documentation shall be submitted to the Workload Relief Committee for their action on said requests. The Committee will encourage a representative of the building being present to speak to the matter.
The District will provide annually a pool of $50,000 to address workload issues at the elementary level.
Section 27.4.	Secondary Class Size Relief
To address class size issues at the secondary schools, teachers with a total workload of 150 students and above will receive a stipend based on the chart below. The total amount allocated for stipends is $75,000.
Total Student Workload	Stipend Per Semester
150 - 154	$250
155 - 159	$500
160 - 164	$750
165 - 169	$1000
170+	$1250
PE Teachers 175+	$750
Music Jr. High 230	$750
Music Sr. High Vocal 205	$750
Music Sr. High Instrumental 180	$750
Digitool teachers will receive a stipend based on the total number of 9th grade students divided by two (2).
The following are excluded from the above provision: JAG, advisory, and TA’s. These excluded positions shall be eligible for relief at the building level through the money distributed to the building on an FTE basis.
Teachers who are not 1.0 FTE will have their total student workload and stipend pro-rated based on their FTE. For purposes of this section, buy-outs will be considered a 1.2 FTE.
If a secondary school staff elects to use one (1) FTE certificated staff member in an instructional support role (instead of teaching five classes), the members of that staff will add +2 to class overload trigger numbers in each cell.
Teachers who are eligible for stipends may pool their money and purchase paraeducator time.
Stipends will be paid based on the official enrollment counts on October 1 and February 1. Following the October 1 count, money will be subtracted from the pool of $75,000 to pay for the October stipends and the
49
projected stipends in February. The remainder of the money will be distributed to the buildings on a student FTE basis. A building based committee will use the money to address workload issues and provide support to staff. If in October it is anticipated that stipends will cost more than the $75,000 pool, stipends will be pro-rated to use the $75,000.
Section 27.5.	Inclusion of Special Education Students
Where special education students from self-contained classes are in an elementary classroom for instruction, those students should count as part of the class size if they are in that class more than five (5) hours per week. However, students mainstreamed for lunch, recess, P.E. or music should not count as part of the class size.
Section 27.6.	Combination Classrooms
The principal shall conduct a staff meeting among all classroom teachers affected by the establishment of a combination classroom to discuss the criteria and the procedures for its formation. The number of students in a combination primary room should not be more than twenty-three (23) students and twenty-five (25) in an intermediate room without the teacher's approval. The District will make a reasonable effort not to assign non-sequential combination classes.
ARTICLE 28.	SPECIAL NEEDS/SPECIAL ED TRAINING AND ASSISTANCE
Section 28.1.	General
Annually, each school building office will be provided with current state and District guidelines governing the placement of special education students in the regular classroom. In addition, teachers assigned special education resource room students should receive assistance from the student’s resource room teacher in planning and evaluating the student’s work where appropriate. Placements of students with special needs in the least restrictive environment settings will be consistent with state and federal guidelines and regulations.
Section 28.2.	Special Education Supplemental Days
Each psychologist will receive ten (10) supplemental days. Each nurse will receive five (5) supplemental days. Each SLP, OT, PT, Audiologist and special education teacher will receive two (2) extra days, at per diem, to prepare individual education plans and/or assessment reports, or hold meetings related to such responsibilities as determined by the employee.
Section 28.3.	Class Balance
Classes are formed taking into consideration the balance of student needs and the consequent demands on teacher/specialist time and available resources. At all times efforts will be made to ensure that the Special Education and General Education teachers work together to create balanced classrooms. It is considered best practice to look at scheduling and placement early to provide a smooth transition for each student.
Section 28.4.	Determining Special Service Delivery Models
Each building staff will have an opportunity to review service delivery models used at sites to deliver services to special education/special needs students. Opportunities will be provided to share research, examine various options, identify resources which would be needed utilizing various options, and share any other relevant information. To the extent the law allows, staff will have an opportunity to be involved in determining what model(s) best meet the individual needs of students and be meaningfully involved in the
50
implementation of the range of options available at each site. Because of fiscal and/or human resource limitations, certain options may have to be planned for, or phased in, over a period of years.
Section 28.5.	Review of Placement
If a student is not progressing as expected or projected on the IEP, the teacher will notify the building designee. The building designee will call for an IEP Committee or SRC meeting to be scheduled as soon as possible to review the appropriateness of the current program/placement.
Section 28.6.	Students with Health Conditions
When a student who has a health condition which may require emergency procedures is placed in any program, a meeting will be scheduled before placement, if possible, to discuss and resolve concerns relating to the emergency procedures appropriate to the student and reflected in the emergency plan.
Section 28.7.	Special Education Student Information
A.	When special education eligibility information is received from another district, and upon parental approval, the special education building staff will receive authorization to provide services in areas of eligibility. When written data are received and reviewed by the psychologist, copies of current evaluation data and the current IEP will be sent to the principal of the receiving school.
B.	It will be the responsibility of the staff in the receiving school to provide relevant special education information, including IEP areas of eligibility, to general education staff within ten (10) school days of receipt, if possible. If a general education staff member desires additional information, IEPs shall be available in the respective schools.
Section 28.8.	Staff Roles in Meeting the Needs of Special Education Students
A.	Role of Regular Education Teacher: The role of the regular education teacher is to teach the general education class and help the special needs student be included as a full member of that learning community as much as possible. It is not the general education teacher’s responsibility to get the student to grade level; rather, it is to assist the student to achieve his/her IEP goals and objectives. The general education teachers in whose class the student is enrolled must be included in the development of the IEP for the particular student. Regular education teachers, in whose classes the student is enrolled, shall be invited to, and given the opportunity to participate in, the individualized education program meetings. The classroom teacher must have access to resources and support in order to successfully include the student in his/her classroom.
B.	Role of Special Education Teacher: The role of the special education teacher is to determine, based on the student’s IEP and in cooperation with the classroom teacher, areas that are a focus of growth/measurement for the particular student. The special education teacher will assist in adapting student grading, provide resource materials, provide instruction, and serve as the primary contact person with the parent(s) unless otherwise determined with the regular classroom teacher. The special education teacher is responsible for writing, coordinating the implementation of the IEP, and monitoring all IEP goal areas. The IEP will be reviewed and modified in consultation with the regular classroom teacher.
C.	Role of Student Review Committee: The role of the Student Review Committee (SRC) is to explore and recommend the most appropriate program for a special education student,_interventions,
51
accommodations, modifications and/or program change options for any student based on the student’s physical, social, academic and psychological needs.
D.	Role of Other Service Providers: The role of other service providers (SLP, OT/PT, school psychologists, etc.) in supporting and serving staff and students will be determined by the student’s IEP requirements for related services and coordinated through the building support team and/or SRC, the classroom teacher involved, and the special education teacher.
ARTICLE 29.	PARA EDUCATORS
Section 29.1.	Technicians, lay assistants and paraeducators may be employed to aid professional school personnel wherever it is indicated that such services will provide for improvement in the school programs.
Technicians, lay assistants and paraeducators shall not assume professional responsibility for the guiding of instruction or the control of students for instructional purposes. These responsibilities reside with the professionally certificated employee.
Section 29.1.1. Bargaining unit members shall not be required to do paraeducator evaluations.
Section 29.2.	Playground, bus and recess supervisors shall not be considered as performing professional instructional responsibilities.
Section 29.3.	Staff Utilization. The safety of students at school is a shared responsibility of all the certificated and non-certificated staff. The supervision of students before school, after school, in the lunchrooms, during recesses, during passing periods, and in non-instructional settings shall therefore also be a joint responsibility. In making provision for the prudent supervision of students, it shall be the goal in each building to balance the supervisory responsibility among all staff members. However, within the limits of the staff hours allocated to each building, certificated staff shall be utilized in roles where certificated persons are required to perform the work, and non-certificated staff shall be utilized where possible to release certificated staff to perform those tasks. The assignments of the personnel allocated will vary from building to building in response to the collaborative decisions of building staff and administration. If an accord cannot be reached in a building, the administrator shall implement temporary assignments and the parties shall seek facilitation of an accord in a timely fashion.
ARTICLE 30.	BUILDING STANDARDS
Section 30.1.	In order to insure that an optimum learning environment exists in a new, remodeled or rebuilt school, an advisory committee of five (5) members including the Executive Director of Facilities to represent the facility in question shall be formed. The Central Administration shall appoint two (2) members; the Association shall appoint two (2) certificated employees. The function of the committee shall be to:
A.	Assist the Executive Director of Facilities in determining the progress toward readiness of the facility to be opened, using the Board approved educational specifications as the measure of completion.
B.	Make recommendations to the Executive Director of Facilities on what planned work is to be completed before occupancy. This planned work will be incorporated into the punch list attached to the “Certificate of Substantial Completion.”
52
C.
Assist the Executive Director of Facilities in selecting alternate housing options or a delayed school opening.
Said committee shall make its recommendations on readiness or alternatives at least two (2) weeks in advance of the opening of school. If said committee finds deficiencies with respect to the Educational Specifications, it shall recommend what work needs to be completed before occupancy should occur to: (1) The Executive Director of Facilities, who will incorporate items into the “punch list” attached to the “Certificate of Substantial Completion”; (2) The Association President; and (3) The Superintendent, who will share the recommendations with the School Board as a part of his/her regular reports on the status of District facilities. If occupancy occurs before completion of the recommendations, the District shall report to the committee as to the status of the committee's recommendations and specify the date by which the work is expected to be completed.
Section 30.2.	Communications' capacity being important, the District will continue to include telephones in each classroom as buildings are built or totally remodeled.
Each existing classroom shall be equipped with a means of communicating with the Main Office. Each site will have a phone designated for faculty use for private conversations. The need for staff members to receive messages at work is recognized, and in each building this process will be collaboratively arrived at for utilizing the system and persons available. However, it is agreed that staff members will, except in emergency cases, restrict their use of phones to times that will not diminish the District from the educational process and that personal business calls should be made outside the school day.
ARTICLE 31.	STUDENT DISCIPLINE, SAFETY AND SECURITY OF STUDENTS AND STAFF
Section 31.1.	The Puyallup School District and the Puyallup Education Association are jointly committed to providing quality educational programs in a warm, open, supportive environment which protects the safety and security of all students and staff. Therefore, the parties agree that an optimal teaching and learning climate for staff and students requires a no tolerance policy for weapons, dangerous devices, and assaultive behavior. The parties recognize the increasing incidence of weapons, dangerous devices, and serious assaults in the society in general and in the nation's schools, and recognize that with such serious misbehavior, experience has shown that normal sanctions less severe than expulsion have failed to preserve a safe and orderly educational environment.
Section 31.2.	To achieve the above, it is agreed that possession or use of weapons, explosives, firecrackers, illegal knives, or other items capable of producing bodily harm shall be prohibited. Consistent with student due process and other legal requirements, the normal penalty shall be expulsion for possession or use of any weapons or dangerous devices, including but not limited to any weapon listed as a deadly weapon in RCW 9A.04.110 or local ordinances. Likewise, when any item is used by the aggressor as a weapon, or which a victim reasonably believes to be a weapon, the same sanctions will apply. Further, it is agreed that the normal penalty is emergency expulsion and other appropriate sanctions for any student who commits a serious assault. Serious assaultive behaviors are defined as either physical assaultive behavior (purposeful assaultive, aggressive behavior, with intent to do serious harm), or verbal assaultive behavior (racial threat or threat to do serious bodily physical harm, either student-to-student or student-to-staff). An emergency expulsion shall continue if the Superintendent or designee has good and sufficient reason to believe the student(s) presence poses an immediate and continuing danger to employee(s), a student, other students or school personnel, or an immediate and continuing threat of substantial disruption of the class, subject, activity or educational process of the student(s) school. In making that determination, the hearing officer shall solicit input from the staff and administration of the building(s) directly affected.
53
Section 31.3. The District shall provide prompt assistance and support to certificated employees in connection with student discipline problems. An administrator or acting administrator, volunteering to be invested with the authority to act as such shall be available during school hours. When the administrator is away from the building, but in the District, an administrator shall be on call. When the building administrator is out-of-district or absent for half the day or more, a substitute shall be provided when needed to maintain the building administrative coverage, unless a building's assistant principal is available. Teachers shall not be asked to accept the administrative responsibility and still teach their assigned classes.
Section 31.4.	In the maintenance of a sound learning environment, the certificated employee and the District shall expect and work to enforce acceptable behavior on the part of all students who attend schools in the District. Certificated employees shall operate within State law and District policy in maintaining good order and discipline in their classrooms at all times.
Section 31.5.	Without revealing specific information regarding criminal histories, medical histories, or specifically protected private information, receiving certificated employees will be notified in an appropriate manner of students who have exhibited serious assaultive behavior prior to their admittance to classrooms. Staff members so informed shall treat the information as confidential.
Section 31.6. Any student who creates a disruption of the educational process in violation of the building disciplinary standards while under a teacher's immediate supervision may be excluded by the teacher from his or her individual classroom and instructional or activity area for all or any portion of the balance of the school day or until the principal or designee and teacher have conferred, whichever occurs first: provided, that except in emergency circumstances, the teacher shall have first attempted one or more alternative forms of corrective action: provided further, that in no event without the consent of the teacher shall an excluded student be returned during the balance of that class or activity period.
Section 31.7. Further, the authority of certificated employees to use prudent disciplinary measures for the safety and well-being of students and employees as well as the authority to use standard disciplinary measures for each disabled student, except where notification to the contrary has been provided to staff, is supported by the District. In the exercise of authority by an employee to control and maintain order and discipline, the employee may use reasonable and professional judgment, including reasonable and prudent use of physical constraint, to protect harm being done to a student or to him/herself.
Section 31.8.	On or before September 30 of each school year, each building principal and his/her teaching staff shall meet to develop and/or review building disciplinary standards, and uniform enforcement of those standards. Visitor access regulations will be in the employee handbook. In addition, the special education guidelines will be reviewed.
Section 31.9.	Disruptive Students. If a mainstreamed student(s) is so disruptive that the education of other students is significantly impaired, the classroom teacher may recommend removal of said student(s) from the classroom in accordance with applicable Federal and State laws and the IEP of said student(s).
Section 31.9.1. Within three (3) days of written notification (to principal or his/her designee) of a behavior problem of a student with an IEP, an employee shall have the right to meet and confer with the principal and/or the available members of that students’ SRC (Student Review Committee).
ARTICLE 32.	SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS
Certificated employees shall not be expected to work, teach or supervise students in an area where such work would likely result in physical or emotional harm to said employee(s) or student(s). When the staff member(s) and site administrator(s) indicate a hazardous condition exists, the concern will be acted upon
54
within five (5) working days. If there is a disagreement as to the hazardous condition, the matter may be referred by either party to the appropriate state or county agency for determination. If the safety concerns relates to workload, then it shall first be taken up with the principal.
All rooms in which students are required to eat lunch shall be cleaned daily, including floor, sinks and trash removal.
Certificated employees shall promptly report any safety hazards or unsafe conditions they are aware of to their immediate administrator. The District shall advise certificated employees of any unsafe working condition(s), as determined by a state or county agency, which would pose an immediate and substantial threat to them or their students' health in the areas in which they work. A copy of the notification to the certificated employee(s) will be sent to the Association President within five (5) working days of receipt of the same by the District. Within five (5) working days following the District’s receipt of facility environmental testing prompted by an Association complaint, a copy of all environmental test results shall be provided to the Association President.
ARTICLE 33.	DISTRICTWIDE COMMITTEES
Section 33.1.	Instructional Program
The Superintendent or his/her designee shall post the existence of regular District-wide instructional program committees in each building each school year. Criteria for membership, contractual rate of pay offered, if any, and the available openings on the committees, if any, shall be listed at the time of posting. Certificated employees shall have five (5) working days after the date of posting to indicate to the appropriate administrator their desire to serve on said committee(s). Employees are not required to participate in district-wide committees outside the seven and one half (7.5) hour work day. Such participation is strictly voluntary. Administration shall not coerce or intimidate employees to participate on committees, particularly employees new to the District, and/or profession. Work required outside of the seven and one half (7.5) hour work day shall be compensated at the stated contractual rate of pay.
Section 33.2.	Other Committees
The District may request that an employee serve on a District committee, and building-level administrators may request that an employee serve on a building-level committee. Each employee shall not be subject to reprisals for choosing not to serve on District or building-level committees. When the District or building administrator deems appropriate, released time shall be provided for participation on said committee(s). Employees will not be required to participate on District-wide or building-level committees outside the seven and one half (7.5) hour work day unless compensated at the contractual rate of pay.
Section 33.3.	Composition
The composition of district-wide task forces and committees shall be reviewed by the Association prior to a committee meeting to ensure appropriate representation of Association members.
ARTICLE 34.	STUDENT TEACHERS
The Board and Association agree that the acceptance and proper deployment of student teachers in the Puyallup School District can constitute a significant contribution to the improvement of the educational profession.
55
Guidelines for consideration include: (1) only one student teacher per year per supervising teacher, (2) assignment only with an experienced teacher, (3) the program is voluntary, and (4) spring preplanning is valuable in making the program effective.
ARTICLE 35.	GRADING STANDARDS
Teachers are responsible for setting permissible standards for grading students, communicating those standards and fairly applying them. Such grades will only be changed in accordance with the law or District policy. Prior to making any decision which alters any grade or makes a recommendation to alter a grade, a building administrator/supervisor will study the records, ascertain the factors involved and consult with the employee who gave the grade. If a grade is altered by a District representative, the employee shall be notified in writing. (See WAC 180-44-010 and RCW 28A.150.240.)
PART V - PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES
ARTICLE 36.	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 36.1.	General
The purpose of the following grievance procedure shall be to provide for the orderly and expeditious adjustment of grievances at the earliest possible time. This procedure shall be utilized as a method of solving problems in the interest of educational programs and in the spirit of cooperation among the administration and the certificated employees.
Section 36.2.	Definitions
A.	A "grievant" shall mean a certificated employee(s) or the Association.
B.	A "grievance" shall mean a claim by a grievant that there exists a violation, misinterpretation or
misapplication by the District of a specific provision of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, or any other written agreement between the Association and the District. In the case of a grievance filed by the Association, the Association shall state the specific instance(s) or circumstance(s) which precipitates said grievance.
C.	"Days" shall mean school days during the period September 1 through May 30 and all weekdays during the remainder of the year.
D.	"Time Limits". If the stipulated time limits are not met by the District, the grievant shall have the right to appeal the grievance to the next step. If the stipulated time limits are not met by the grievant, the grievance is deemed satisfied and may not be appealed further. The parties involved, may, by mutual written agreement, modify any time limits contained in the procedure. The District and the Association shall receive copies of such agreements.
Section 36.3.	Procedure
The following steps are designed to secure, at the administrative level closest to the grievant, solutions to any grievance which may occur.
Step 1. The District and the Association acknowledge and the parties involved are advised that it is desirable for a certificated employee and the appropriate administrator to resolve problems through free and informal communications. If an employee chooses to meet informally with
56
his/her supervisor, s/he may have a representative join him/her at any grievance meeting. Every effort shall be made to resolve the grievance at this level. An employee must notify his/her immediate supervisor of a grievance within thirty (30) days of his/her knowledge of a disagreement or violation of the contract, or the incident will be considered invalid and subject to no further process.
Step 2.
Step 3.
If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Step 1, it may be
presented as a written grievance, by the grievant and/or his/her designated association representative, to the appropriate administrator within ten (10) days following the supervisor’s response to the informal meeting. The grievance shall state the fact(s) upon which it is based, the issue involved, any Agreement provisions allegedly violated, and the relief sought. The appropriate administrator shall arrange for a meeting with the grievant through the designated association representative within five (5) days after receipt of the written grievance. The date, time and location of the meeting shall be mutually agreeable to all parties. Within ten (10) days after the meeting between the parties involved, the appropriate administrator shall provide the grievant and the association representative with a written response. Such response shall include the reason(s) for the decision.
If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Step 2, the decision
may be appealed to the Superintendent or designated representative within ten (10) days of the receipt of the written response. The Superintendent or designated representative shall arrange for a hearing with the grievant through the association representative within five (5) days of receipt of the written appeal. The hearing date, time and location shall be mutually agreeable to all parties. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the Superintendent or designated representative shall, within ten (10) days, provide the grievant and the association representative with a written response. Such response shall include the reason(s) for the decision.
Step 4.
Arbitration:
A.	General. Any grievance which pertains to the Collective Bargaining Agreement or other written agreements between the District and the Association may be presented to the Association for submission in binding arbitration if the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition at Step 3. Such request shall be presented in writing to the Association within five (5) days of receipt of the written response at Step 3. If the Association determines that the grievance involves an alleged violation, misinterpretation or misapplication by the District of a specific provision of the Collective Bargaining Agreement or other written agreements, the Association may, by written notice to the Superintendent presented within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the request at Step 4, submit the grievance to binding arbitration. If any questions arise as to the arbitrability of the grievance, such questions shall first be ruled on by the arbitrator selected to hear the grievance.
The arbitrator shall be without power or authority to rule on any of the following conditions:
1.	The termination of services or failure to reemploy any provisional employee.
2.	The content of an employee's evaluation or of an administrator's report pursuant to evaluation or probation, except for any procedural requirements which may affect such content.
57
3.
Any matter involving non-renewal, discharge, or probation, where other remedy is provided by law.
B.	Procedure. The following procedures shall be followed in processing arbitrable grievances.
1.	Within ten (10) days after written notice of submission to binding arbitration, the District and the Association shall seek agreement upon a mutually acceptable arbitrator who will serve. If the District and the Association are unable to agree upon or get commitment to serve from an arbitrator within the ten (10) day period, a request for a list of arbitrators shall be made to the American Arbitration Association by either party. The parties involved and the arbitrator shall be bound by the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association, except as provided below.
2.	Neither party shall be permitted to assert in the arbitration proceedings any evidence which was not submitted to the other party before the completion of Step 3.
3.	The arbitrator selected shall confer with the Superintendent or designated representative and the Association and hold hearings promptly, and shall issue the decision not later than twenty (20) days from the date of the close of the hearings, or if oral hearings have been waived, then from the date the final statements and proofs are submitted. The arbitrator's decision shall be in writing and shall set forth his findings of fact, reasoning and conclusions on the issues submitted. The arbitrator shall be without power or authority to make any decisions which require the commission of an act prohibited by law or which is in violation of the terms of written agreement between the Association and the District. The decisions of the arbitrator shall be submitted to the District and the Association and shall be final and binding on both parties.
4.	The cost for the service of the arbitrator, including per diem expenses, if any, and travel and subsistence expenses and cost of any hearing room shall be borne equally by the District and the Association. All other costs shall be by the party incurring them except as provided in Article 36, Section 36.5, herein.
Section 36.4.	Representation.
A.
B.
The District recognizes the Association as the sole and exclusive grievance representative for all certificated employees represented by the Association. The grievant may, at the grievant's option, request the assignment of an Association Representative during formal grievance proceedings. The Association may investigate grievances at any level.
If in the judgment of the Association, a grievance affects a group of certificated employees or the Association, or if the grievance involves more than one supervisor or an administrator above the building level, the grievance may proceed directly from Step 1 to Step 3.
58
C.	The parties involved may include in the proceedings such witnesses as they deem necessary to develop facts relevant to the grievance.
D.	Nothing herein shall be construed as limiting the right of any certificated employee having filed a formal grievance, to have the problems adjusted without the intervention of the Association provided that: (1) the Association shall be notified of the scheduled meetings; (2) the Association shall be permitted to send a representative to scheduled meetings and may offer an opinion pertinent to the grievance; and (3) the Association shall be notified in writing of the disposition of the grievance. Such notification shall include the reason(s) for the decision.
E.	The Association on its own may continue any grievance filed and later dropped by a grievant, provided that the grievance involves the application or interpretation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, or any other agreement between the Association and the District, and the Association exercises this option within ten (10) days.
F.	Resolution of grievance shall be consistent with agreements between the District and the Association, and the grievance procedure shall not be used for the purpose of creating new agreements between the District and the Association.
Section 36.5.	Supplemental Conditions.
A.	All individuals who might possibly contribute to the acceptable adjustment of a grievance are urged to provide any relevant information that they may have to the grievant or the District at the earliest possible time.
B.	The grievant, District and Association shall cooperate in the investigation of any grievance and shall furnish such information as is required for the processing of any grievance.
C.	No reprisal will follow any involvement in this grievance procedure.
D.	Should the mutually-established meetings related to the investigation or processing of any grievance require that a grievant or an Association representative be released from his/her regular assignment, the release shall be without loss of pay or benefits. Substitute costs shall be borne by the District.
E.	All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of a grievance shall be filed separately from the personnel files of the participants.
F.	The Association and the District recognize that confidentiality and good faith are key elements to a successful grievance procedure. Accordingly, both pledge themselves to participate in good faith in the execution of this procedure, and to hold all matters pertaining thereto in confidence and to admonish and require all parties involved to limit the number of additional persons knowing of the grievance to those necessary to a successful resolution and/or implementation.
PART VI - SUBSTITUTES
ARTICLE 37.	SUBSTITUTES
Section 37.1.	The provisions of this section apply only to represented substitutes as defined in Article 1. Only the sections of this Collective Bargaining Agreement specifically referred to in this Article shall be applied to substitute employees.
59
Section 37.2.	The sections of this Agreement applying to substitutes shall be:
A.	Student Calendar
B.	Article 2 (Management Rights)
C.	Article 5 (Payroll Deductions, Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 only)
D.	Article 7 (Individual Rights, Sections 7.1 and 7.2 only)
E.	Article 8 (Staff Protection)
F.	Article 9 (Controversial Issues as set out in Section 37.4 below)
G.	Article 31 (Student Discipline)
H.	Article 32 (Safe Working Conditions)
I.	Article 36 (Grievance Procedure)
Section 37.3.	It is agreed that substitutes work on call and have no guarantee of employment on a day-today basis. When assigning substitutes on a daily basis the following factors will be the basis for selection: principal or supervisor request, teacher request, reports of previous placements, formal training, certification, endorsements, previous substituting experience, immediate availability, demonstrated willingness to accept assignments, length of time with the District and administrative convenience.
Section 37.4.	Substitutes are responsible for carrying out their responsibilities as outlined in the Puyallup School District Substitute Teacher Handbook, including, but not limited to, following the teacher's lesson plan. Substitutes, however, are protected as regular employees by Article 9, Teaching of Controversial Issues.
Section 37.5.	The District may elect in which buildings and classrooms to utilize a substitute. A substitute may be excluded from a particular classroom upon request by the classroom teacher, however, the substitute shall be provided with the nature of the complaint and shall have an opportunity to conference with said teacher. The conference shall be arranged through the building administrator. Before deciding not to use a specific substitute in a particular building again because of a complaint(s) regarding that substitute's work, the substitute shall be informed in writing of the nature of the complaint(s) and be given an opportunity to respond to the allegation. A substitute will only be excluded from a particular building if a problem is not remediable as determined by the principal. The Human Resources Department shall review any decision made by a building administrator to not use a specific substitute. However, only when the District decides to drop a substitute from its substitute list is that decision grievable and is grievable only to the extent there is no just cause. For this section, just cause shall include any material or significant breach of the duties of substitutes outlined in the Substitute Teacher Handbook, repeated parental complaints, insubordination, unprofessional conduct or conduct which reasonable educators would consider detrimental to students or to their education.
Section 37.6. Substitutes pay shall be .38% of the base salary for teachers. Senior substitutes shall be paid 103% of the regular substitute pay rate. A half-day shall be defined as 4 hours and paid at 54% of the regular substitute full days pay. On LIC Wednesdays, substitutes shall work 4.5 hours and be paid at 60% of the regular substitute full days pay. On the 20th day of work in a single continuing assignment, retroactive to the first day of the assignment, a substitute shall be paid at the per diem rate that employee would receive if paid on the salary schedule for regular employees. Further, when substitutes are placed in assignments known from the outset to extend more than twenty (20) days, that per diem rate shall be paid from day one (1).
Section 37.7.	When filling a long-term assignment (anticipated to be 20 days or more), the District may 1) elect to post the position, 2) select from its applicant pool, 3) retain in the position a substitute who can
60
provide continuity for the program, or 4) fill the assignment from the substitute pool. If the latter option is exercised, the criteria in Section 37.3 shall be utilized.
Section 37.8.	After working ninety (90) days in a long-term assignment, substitutes may request that their building administrators or program supervisors complete a formal observation of their work for their files. Pre-conferences and post-conferences shall be optional. The observation form used shall be the same as that used for regular employees by that supervisor. The substitute shall have the option of having the evaluation placed in his/her file. The content and process shall not be subject to the Grievance Procedure, Article 36.
Section 37.9. The length of the school day is 7-1/2 hours for substitutes. Except in the case of unusual circumstances, the substitute shall have the same planning time as the employee for which the substitute has been assigned. Substitutes expected to work beyond the 7-1/2 hour work day will be compensated at their extra hourly rate of pay. The hourly rate of pay will be based on a 7-1/2 hour work day and the individual substitute’s classification. A substitute assigned to work more than one-half (1/2) day, with prior notice, will be required to work a 7-1/2 hour day.
Section 37.10.	Each work site shall identify a mailbox for substitutes to receive copies of general correspondence. Each substitute shall be provided a weekly bulletin, if available, and each site will determine any other appropriate means of communicating staff information to substitutes.
Section 37.11.	Substitutes may, upon request, review the contents of the substitute personnel files kept in the Education Service Center and the reports retained at the schools.
Section 37.12.	It is agreed that FBI background check, fingerprinting and HIV/Hepatitis B training are conditions of employment, and costs are to be assumed by any person seeking employment in the District. However, if the District requires additional training of represented substitutes, the District agrees to pay a pro rata of the daily substitute rate for attending such training.
Section 37.13. Senior Substitutes: Substitutes who have been active on the District's substitute list more than three (3) school years or who have retired from teaching after at least one year of teaching in this District may apply for "senior substitute status." Senior substitutes will be called in the order of seniority for substitute assignments for other than "same day work" when:
A.	There has been no other substitute specifically requested by a supervisor or teacher;
B.	The substitute has the necessary background and training;
C.	The substitute has demonstrated competence by previous work	in the area of the assignment;
D.	The substitute is available when called; and
E.	The substitute has not already been placed in an assignment for	that time	period.
A person requesting "senior substitute status" must accept the assignment when offered unless:
1.	The substitute is ill or caring for a dependent family member; or
2.	The substitute has not requested placement at this grade level (K-3, 4-6, 7-12) or in the
subject area of the assignment.
61
3.	The substitute has not requested one week in advance to be excused from assignments during the period of the assignment.
Section 37.14.	The District will provide a Job Search Seminar at least once a year for substitutes.
Section 37.15.	Information regarding high-risk students shall be incorporated in the substitute folder.
Section 37.16.	To the extent possible under the terms of contracts with providers, and to the extent permissible under law, substitutes will be provided medical/dental insurance eligibility as set out below:
1.	Any substitute teacher who worked as a substitute teacher for ninety (90) days or more in the District during the immediately preceding school year, and who remains available to work as a substitute in the District, may participate in the Plan by notifying the District before August 15 of his/her desire to participate in the Plan for the upcoming school year.
2.	Any substitute teacher participating in the Plan shall be eligible to join, on a self-pay basis, any of the District-approved medical insurance plans or other voluntary insurance plans, subject to any conditions imposed by the District’s insurance carriers. The initial payment must be received in the District Payroll Office before August 15.
3.	Initially the substitute teacher who is eligible for insurance coverage shall make the first month’s payment and a second month’s deposit. By the fifth (5th) day of each month thereafter, the substitute teacher shall submit to the District Payroll Office a check in the amount of the premium due.
4.	In a month when the substitute teacher fails to deliver payment to the District Payroll Office, the deposit will be forwarded to the insurance carrier as payment. If the deposit is used, the District Payroll Office shall notify the substitute teacher within two weeks that the deposit was used. The substitute teacher shall be solely responsible for leaving another deposit with the District Payroll Office within two weeks to make the premium payment if it is again necessary.
5.	Failure to make the required payment to the District Payroll Office as detailed in 1 and 2 above shall serve as the substitute teacher’s notice to the District that the substitute teacher wishes to discontinue his/her medical/dental insurance coverage.
Section 37.17.	The District shall provide substitute teachers with permanent identification badges.
Section 37.18.	When a substitute teacher is asked to cover for another teacher during planning periods or when asked to teach during a planning period that has been “bought out”, they shall receive additional compensation.
Section 37.19.	The District shall provide a duty free lunch for substitutes traveling between buildings.
Section 37.20.	Substitute teachers shall be provided access to district e-mail.
Section 37.21.	The District shall notify substitutes of “the handbook” and shall make this accessible.
PART VII - MISCELLANEOUS
62
ARTICLE 38.	SITE-BASED DECISION MAKING
Section 38.1.	The parties affirm a principle of modern management that recognizes some kinds of decisions in the operation of an organization are best made by the individuals who actually provide a service. A sitebased decision-making philosophy is comprised of three main elements: a) the decentralization and democratization of appropriate building-level decisions; b) delegation of authority to the building principal, the site staff and, where appropriate, parents and community members at that school to make identified changes in the instructional programs of the school which will improve the education being provided for the students; and c) development of responsibility among site staff for the determination, execution, and evaluation of the revised instructional program. Site-based decision making shall involve those who are affected by the decision. Participation shall be direct or through representation of their choosing.
Section 38.2.	Site-based decision making shall only address topics and actions that affect the instructional delivery system of a specific school site and may include such items as staff development (building inservice), student discipline, staff utilization, early release days, school goals, programs and priorities and other building instructional concerns, but excluding hiring decisions. Staff may at times be asked for their participation in hiring processes, and their input and reactions to candidates may be solicited.
Section 38.3.	Site-based decisions shall not violate Board policies, state law, or this Agreement.
Section 38.4.	The parties to this Agreement shall work with any site which needs assistance in fulfilling the intent of this Article. The parties will, in cooperation with existing District staff development efforts, offer staff development (in-service) training and workshops in areas directly related to site-based decision making, including, but not limited to, consensus building, group dynamics, conflict management, and adult communication and learning. Funding for said training may come from block grant funds, 1200 and 1300 funds, and any funds made available by the Shared Leadership Committee. Such training will be available for clock-hour credit.
Section 38.5.	Special Services staff members who have no school site to which they are attached per se, and/or no building staff with whom they need to be involved regarding a particular site decision, shall for the purposes of this Article be considered part of a site-based team assigned to the Special Services Office.
ARTICLE 39.	SUBCONTRACTING
Bargaining unit work presently held by unit members shall not be contracted to any other employee group or entity, unless no bargaining unit member can be found to perform the work, provided however, that any such position shall be filled for up to one year only, when at such time, it shall be posted in accordance with Section 10.4.1.
ARTICLE 40.	NON-INSTRUCTIONAL DETENTION
Supervision of non-instructional detention will be offered at the site, by seniority to certificated employees. If no bargaining unit members desire the work, it may be offered as the District chooses. Payment will be pursuant to Section 22.2.A.
ARTICLE 41.	FUNDING
In the event the Legislature substantially reduces Puyallup School District funds, or there is any major financial setback to the District (e.g. substantial enrollment decline, elimination of block grants, levy failure, etc.) and recognizing that program changes are a Board decision, the PEA will still have authentic participation and a significant voice in collaborative discussions of potential District budget reductions. If
63
this financial setback occurs, this Agreement shall be subject to reopening for bargaining on the various monetary items included therein.
ARTICLE 42.	TEACHER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
The District will follow the listed criteria and processes in implementation of the Teacher Assistance Program in accordance with (WAC 392-196) and the criteria specified.
1.	Selection of Mentor and Beginning Teachers
It is recognized that funding may limit the participation of eligible teachers as per WAC 392-196. Thus selection of beginning teacher participants shall be based on their hiring seniority and willingness to participate. In the event a beginning teacher is unable to participate, the next eligible beginning teacher will be contacted by the building principal for participation.
Mentor teachers must meet the criteria specified in the legislation and participation will be on a voluntary basis. Mentor teacher selection will be based on: a) similarity of assignment to the beginning teacher (i.e. same grade level and subject area) and b) a willingness to fully participate in program seminars and related activities.
2.	Funding and Compensation
The program will be funded through an allocation provided by the state. Compensation will be based on 75% of the remaining funds to the mentor and 25% to the beginning teacher.

APPENDIX H: YEARS OF EXPERIENCE PUYALLUP SCHOOL DISTRICT
92
Years of experience means the number of years of full-time and part-time professional education employment as of August 31 prior to the current "snapshot" date.
Professional education experience is limited to the following [WAC 392-121-245]:
1.	Employment in public or private preschools or elementary and secondary schools in positions which require certification;
2.	Employment in public or private vocational-technical schools, community/junior colleges, colleges, and universities in positions comparable to those which require certification in the common schools;
3.	Employment in educational institutions in any professional position, including but not limited to, C.P.A., architect, business manager, physician, if employment is in an education agency or institution such as an ESD, OSPI, or the United States Department of Education;
Educational agency or institution, as interpreted for this purpose, means a governmental agency administratively responsible for providing public elementary and/or secondary instruction or educational support services. This does not include school districts nor is it likely to include any agency below the level of a regional education agency such as an ESD.
4.	Experience in the following areas if recognized by the district for placement on the district salary schedule:
a)	Military, Peace Corps, or Vista service which interrupted professional employment;
b)	Sabbatical leave; and
c)	For vocational instructors who hold no degree, up to a maximum of six years of management experience acquired after the instructor meets the minimum vocational certification requirements.
NOTES:
•	Employment may be in Washington, out-of-state, or in a foreign country.
•	Document years of experience in the employee's file on a letter or any other document that provides evidence of employment, including dates of employment [WAC 392-121-280(3)].
•	Report all years of experience including those beyond the experience limit of the district's salary schedule [WAC 392-121-245].
•	The traditional nine-month academic year is considered as one school year. Count no more than one year of experience for any twelve-month period [WAC 392-121-245].
•	Accumulate full- and part-time employment to three decimals and report in tenths of school years [WAC 392-121-215] and [WAC 392-121-245].
•	Report substitute days as part-time professional education employment. Calculate years of experience for substitute days, summer school and extended school year days by dividing the
93
accumulated number of full-time days by 180 and rounding to the nearest tenth. Report partial substitute days as part-time professional education employment by dividing the part of the day worked by the full day as determined by the district and rounded to the nearest tenth of a day [WAC 392-121-245].
EXAMPLE 21
A person worked 87 days full-time one year, 180 days half-time the second year, and 100 days full-time the third year. A full year in the District is 180 days. District files record this experience as .483 FTE + .500 FTE + .556 FTE = 1.539 FTE. Report 1.5 years of experience.
94
APPENDIX I:	JOB SHARE GUIDELINES PUYALLUP SCHOOL DISTRICT
1. What is the difference between a part-time position, a part-year position and a job share position?	A part-time position is funded as a fraction of a full-time single position, for example, a .5 FTE. A part-year position is a position that is for less than 180 days and, therefore, is reported as a fraction of an FTE, i.e., 160 divided by 180 would be a .89 FTE. A job share exists when two people share the responsibilities of one full-time position at their request.
2. What is the difference in benefits between job share and part-time positions?	Part-time employees will receive a prorated allocation as agreed upon by the District and the bargaining unit. Job share staff will be eligible to share 1 benefit allocation on a prorated basis. Full-year employees at .5 FTE or above are eligible for full TRI, except where staff members are job sharing. In job sharing situations, the two staff members will each receive their respective FTE times the amount for which they would qualify if in a full-time position. Part-time staff members and staff members who are less than .5 FTE will be eligible for a pro rata share of TRI based on their FTE.
3. What about planning/release, the 181st Day and staff meetings?	Planning and release days are prorated based on the job share FTE. Job share partners are each eligible for the 181st Day. One member of the team must attend building planning days and staff meetings. Both members are responsible for keeping abreast of building discussions, issues and concerns.
4. Is the District obligated to share a position?	The District is obligated to consider job sharing when there is an open position.
5. How does one get permission to job share?	Job Share Application forms are available in Personnel. One application is to be completed by each team. All applications for reassignment in a building must be submitted in time to be approved no later than May 1 of the preceding school year, provided however, applications that cause no “domino effect” may be submitted any time before the first student day. Applications for open positions will follow the same timelines required for transfers outlined in Article 10, Section 4, of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
6. What must be done before a job share request is approved?	a)	Individuals interested in being reassigned to a job sharing position must identify a job share partner within the current ranks of provisional and continuing District staff who is acceptable to the building principal. If no job share partner is found in the ranks of current employees, the job share is posted. b)	The potential job share team must then identify the position they wish to share. c)	The Job Share Application form must be completed by the team requesting the job share, approved or disapproved by the principal and returned to the Personnel Office for review.
7. Can a job share team work	Alternating weeks if approved by a Principal and District

8. Who authorizes a job share?	The Director of Human Resources will authorize a job share after reviewing the recommendation of the building principal.
9. What will be the basis for consideration of job share requests?	The consideration will be based on administrative and program needs. The District will maintain a limited number of job share opportunities per building depending on the number of administrators, staff and special programs. If a job share application is rejected, a written rationale for the denial will be provided if requested.
10. What happens to an individuals contract when job sharing?	The individual retains the present year FTE and will be placed on leave for the portion of the FTE being shared, e.g., 1.0 FTE equals .5 leave and .5 assigned.
11. How long is a position job shared?	One school year. Job share teams will have the opportunity to reapply in the following spring.
12. Can a job share be started mid-year?	The creation of job shares mid-year would be most unusual. All requests to be reassigned to a job share must be submitted pursuant to guideline #5.
13. Can job shared teams trade scheduled days?	Yes, with prior approval of the building administrator.
14. Can one team member substitute for another team member?	Yes. The request must be made through the Substitute Office and the pay for substituting will be at the regular substitute rate.
15. To whom is the job share position assigned?	a)	Where a position already belongs to one team member, it remains that member’s position when the job share team dissolves. b)	Where a position is “open,” it shall be assigned to the senior member of the team (by building and then by District seniority).
16. What happens when both members want to end the job share?	The person whose position was shared retains the position unless staff reduction provisions of the contract have been implemented. The other member may remain in the building if there is a position available; otherwise, that member must transfer. If one or both members of a team wish to job share with new partners, the application process must start over again.
17. Is special consideration for continued job sharing given to anyone?	Yes. Special consideration is given to job share teams that were in existence prior to the 1993-94 school year because at the time of the creation of those teams, the guidelines were not in place.

(2)	Definition for CSIP Team: Comprehensive School Improvement Plan Team. At the beginning of each school year, all building staff will have an opportunity to join the CSIP team. Members of the CSIP team will reflect a cross-section of the diversity within the school and community. Members will be selected by an open procedure as outlined by each school’s CSIP team. Membership is to include at a minimum: the building Principal, a teacher, a support staff member, a parent and a student, when appropriate.
(3)	LIC Implementation Support: We recognize that the Learning Improvement Calendar represents a new mode of operation in our School District and, as with most new processes and procedures, its implementation may present some challenges and concerns. Prior to the implementation of the following process, a staff member(s) should first address any concerns with a member of the CSIP team and/or the Principal.
If concerns are not resolved, the District and the Association will form an LIC Implementation Support Team made up of two District administrators and two members selected by the PEA to address concerns related to the use and/or implementation of any aspect of the LIC. Such concerns may be expressed by either a PEA member to the PEA President or a Principal to the Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources. Once the concern has been expressed, the LIC Implementation Support Team will be activated to review the concern in light of the intent of the contract and facilitate a solution. The administrative members of this team shall not include either the Principal or the Assistant Principal of the school that is the focus of concern. Likewise, the PEA representatives shall not be members of the staff of the school in question. Whenever possible, at least one member of the team will have served on the PEA and the PSD bargaining team that developed the contract language regarding the LIC.
(4)	Part-Time Employees/ LIC: Part time employees will participate in Learning Improvement work if they are assigned to work on the Learning Improvement day and they are scheduled to work in the afternoon.
