ARTICLE 12—GENERAL WAGE PROVISIONS
12.1	The Employer will pay all salaries or wages weekly. At the employee's option and where the arrangement can be made with the employee's financial institution, the Employer will provide for direct deposit of the employee's pay checks.
12.2	Experience means experience in comparable work. The Guild has 18 months from the date it is notified of an employee's employment to challenge the employee's experience rating. The Employer will consider all claims made within that period, and claims beyond that period will be considered waived. In the event of any dispute over an employee's experience rating, the parties will consider expedited arbitration under Article 40.2.
The adjustment will become effective once the Employer has been made aware of the additional experience. The Employer will retroactively adjust the wages provided the union raises the claims within 90 days following the end of the employee's probationary period.
12.3	Night Differential:	Employees will receive a night
differential of $1.40 per shift for working any shift which ends at or after 7 p.m. but before 8:00 p.m., exclusive of overtime; for shifts ending at or after 8:00 p.m., but before 1:00 a.m., exclusive of overtime, $2.00 per shift; and for shifts encompassing any portion of the period between 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m., exclusive of overtime, $3.00 per shift.
Any employee regularly assigned one or more nights to either of the shifts identified in this article will have the shift differential treated as part of their regular weekly pay for the purposes of calculating vacation, holiday, sick leave and severance pay. This provision will apply even if such employees are assigned to another shift to cover emergencies, illnesses, vacations or other similar temporary conditions. Any employee who works such shifts identified in this article, under temporary conditions, shall not be considered regularly assigned to the shift for purposes of
GUILD - 1993 - 1997
24
calculating vacation, holiday, sick leave and severance pay.
12.4	Flight Hazard Pay: A premium, of five percent (5%) of an employee's weekly salary will be paid for each shift, including overtime, during which he/she is required to fly aboard a non-scheduled flight.
12.5	Number of Inexperienced Employees: Not more than ten percent (10%) of the employees at any time in any department shall be persons with less than two (2) years' experience. For the purpose of the foregoing sentence, copypersons, office persons, Home Delivery Communications Center Clerks, and messengers shall not be included in calculating either the total number of employees or the number of inexperienced employees.
12.6	Employees no longer employed by the Employer shall be notified of the amount due them under this Article by letter to be mailed by registered mail by the Employer (a copy of each letter to be furnished to the Guild) to the last known address of such employee. Such letter is to be signed jointly by the Employer and the Guild and shall notify each employee for payment of the amount due him/her within sixty (60) days after mailing of said letter, and that failure to make such application by the employee within the time specified may absolve the Employer from making such payment, unless good cause is shown for the application being delayed beyond sixty (60) days. Said sixty-day limitation shall not apply to employees who entered or were in the war service, as defined in Article 30, either prior to or during the sixty (60) days after the mailing of said letter.
12.7	The Company will continue to provide a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) consistent with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The terms and conditions of the FSA shall be substantially the same as the plan presented and discussed during the 1989 negotiations. To qualify, an employee must work at least twenty (20) hours weekly.
12.8	The Company will continue to provide a 401 (k) plan consistent with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Such plan will be funded exclusively by voluntary salary deferrals by the employees covered by this collective bargaining agreement. To qualify, an employee must work at least twenty (20) hours weekly.
12.9	Other than 12.7 and 12.8, the provisions of this Article are superseded by Side Letter R.
ARTICLE 13—INSURANCE

GUILD - 1993 - 1997

13.4	Short-term Disability: The Employer will maintain, at its own expense, the present disability benefit for accidental injury or sickness. The policy will provide a weekly benefit of $50.00, for a maximum of 13 weeks, for that period in which the individual is not entitled to sick pay benefits. The Employer may, for each week during which he pays sick pay to the employee, retain the weekly payment due under this insurance.
13.5	This provision is superseded by the terms of Side Letter R.
ARTICLE 14—EXPENSES
14.1	Employees shall be entitled to all proper and reasonable expenses incurred in the course of their duties. This Article is superseded*by the terms of Side Letter R.

The current practice in the Inquirer Classified Department shall continue: those salespersons working on Friday nights until 7:00 p.m. will continue to receive supper money.
14.3	Auto Allowance: A "regular car user" is an employee who consents and is authorized to use a privately-owned automobile in the business of the Employer. Such employee will receive at least $10.00 per day, five days per week, 52 weeks per year, or $.23 per mile, whichever is greater. Effective 1/2/94, the mileage allowance only is increased to $.28. Parking will be provided for regular car users. If the employee uses the automobile on the employer's business an additional day, the employee will receive at least the
GUILD - 1993 - 1997
26
minimum for this additional day.
An "occasional car user" is an employee who consents and is authorized to use a privately-owned automobile, and shall be paid $ .23 per mile, but not less than $10.00 for each day on which the automobile is used. Effective 1/2/94, the mileage allowance only is increased to $.28. The company will provide a $2.00 parking supplement on those days "occasional car users” use their cars for work and provide documentation.
Mileage rate increases will be calculated at the rate of 1/2 cent per mile for each 5-cent increase in the cost of unleaded gasoline, based on a monthly reading of the Consumer Price Index of gasoline in the Philadelphia Market Region (base of $ 1.215 per gallon). Conversely, if the price drops below each 5-cent increase above the base level, the mileage allowance will be reduced accordingly, but not below the base rate of $ .23 per mile. Effective 1/2/94, the base rate is increased to $.28 per mile.
The Employer can only terminate authorization as a regular car user if the employee's job assignment changes permanently, so that regular car use is no longer necessary. The Employer must give a 180-day notice in writing of a change in status.
Any other change in the terms of this article during the life of the contract can be made only by mutual agreement.
Present company car users may elect during the term of this contract to convert to their personal cars, with the approval of the Employer, but shall not be required to do so by the Employer. Employees shall not be penalized for not electing to convert to personal car user status.
14.4	Necessary working equipment shall be provided to employees at the Employer's expense.
ARTICLE 15—HOLIDAYS

GUILD - 1993 - 1997
27

If the employee elects to take another day off, the day shall be granted during the calendar year.
15.4	If any of the paid holidays falls during an employee's vacation, or on an employee's regular day off, the employee will receive a compensating paid day off within 30 days following the holiday.
15.5	If an employee is required to work upon a holiday, or upon a day on which the employee is entitled to be free from work for having worked upon a paid holiday, the employee will be paid one and one-half times his/her regular days pay for all hours worked up to 7-1/2 and double-time for all hours worked (beyond one-quarter hour) for all worked in excess of 7-1/2, in addition to the employee's regular weekly salary.
15.6	This Article is superseded by the terms of Side Letter R.

21.2	An employee will not be entitled to sick pay until the employee is notified in writing by the Employer that he/she will be retained in his/her position, or until the employee completes three months of employment, whichever occurs earlier.
The minimum allowance for an employee with less than one year's continuous service will be two (2) weeks' pay, subject to the preceding paragraph.
21.3	If the illness of an employee extends from one service year into the next service year, the employee is not entitled to receive sick leave pay for such absence in excess of the amount indicated on the Schedule in Article 21.1.
"Service Year” is defined as the period of 365 days beginning on January 1, for those employees hired during the period from January 1 through June 30; or July 1, for those employees hired during the period from July 1 through December 31.

21.5	When an employee has been continuously absent because of illness for more than 40 weeks, the employee may then, until the end of the year which began with the first day of absence, elect to terminate employment. The employee will then be entitled to receive all accrued severance pay, his/her employment will then cease entirely and the Employer shall have no further obligation to' such employee. When an employee has been continuously absent because of an illness for more than one (1) year, the Employer may at that time elect to terminate such employee's employment by paying him/her a sum equal to the amount of severance pay which would have been due him/her had he/she retired at age 6 0. Thereupon, the employee's employment will cease entirely and the Employer shall have no further obligation to such employee.
If neither the employee nor the Employer elects to terminate employment under this article, but the employee dies during his/her absence because of illness, death severance shall be given, under Article 22, but no sum shall then be due under this article.
If neither the employee nor the Employer elects to terminate employment, the employee shall, upon recovery from illness, be reinstated in his/her regular position.
For the purpose of this article, the employee's effort to return to work when not in suitable physical condition to perform his/her normal duties on a full-time basis shall not operate to interrupt continuity of absence.
21.6	The Employer may require an employee absent because of illness to submit a physician's certificate or may have him/her examined by a physician selected by the Employer.

In the latter case, a doctor's certificate may be required before sick pay is allowed. In the case of employees who are scheduled to report for work in the afternoon or early evening the call to report illness shall continue to be made in accordance with past practice, before the scheduled time for actually reporting for work. In the case of an
GUILD - 1993 - 1997

21.7	The provisions of the Article shall in no way affect, modify or waive the Employer's right and liabilities or the employee's right under the Workers' Compensation Laws.
21.8	Employees on such leave are expected, to the extent possible, to notify the Employer of the probable date of their return.
21.9	In case of payment of sick leave pay to an employee under this Section 21, the Employer shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all rights of the employee for lost wages against any third party, who or which by act of commission or omission caused the absence of the employee, which required the payment of sick leave pay by the Employer. Such rights shall be assigned to the Employer by the employee immediately upon receiving the first week's sick leave pay. The Employer shall be authorized to sue, compromise, or settle in the employee's name and the employee will, when requested by the Employer, execute any and all documents pertaining to such litigation. Any action taken by the Employer shall be without cost to the employee. Amounts recovered shall be used as offsets against sick time charged to the employee.
21.10	Where the pattern of an employee's absences allegedly due to illness, or other circumstances surrounding an absence alleged by an employee to be due to illness, indicated, in the Employer's opinion that an employee may be malingering, the Employer shall promptly send a letter to the employee, and a copy to the Guild, (1) describing such pattern or circumstance and why, in the Employer's opinion, such pattern or circumstance indicates to the Employer that an employee may be malingering, and (2) notifying the employee a physician's certificate will be required of him/her on the next occasion of his/her absence by reason of illness.
21.11	This Article is superseded by the terms of Side Letter R.
ARTICLE 22—SEVERANCE PAY
22.1	An employee shall immediately receive severance pay, in the case of discharge, retirement at age 60 years or more, or death, except in the case of an employee who deliberately provokes his/her discharge in order to obtain severance pay, or if an employee is required to be discharged because of failure to maintain good standing in the Guild, as provided in Article 4.1, or because of failure to pay the Guild's service fee-.
The schedule for severance payments shall be the same as provided

26.3	Probation Period: The first three months after an employee's hire, shall be a probationary period, except that, for any inexperienced employee, hired as a Copyreader, Rewrite Person, or Outside Salesperson, the first six months after hire shall be the probationary period.

GUILD - 1993 - 1997
40
Political Columnist, Local Columnist and Sports Columnist may be retained in such jobs despite their having less seniority than other employees who might be assigned to such work, if the Employer and the Guild agree that the performance of the former employees is so skilled and unique that preference of assignment based on length of service is inappropriate. In the absence of such agreement, the matter may be submitted for arbitration.
27.5	High level supervisors covered by the contract, and their assistants, are each to be considered in a separate group within their respective departments in the event of a reduction in force in their departments, if they have held their supervisory posts for at least one year.

Before hiring a new employee into a classification from which an employee has been displaced to another position, the employee will,
GUILD - 1993 - 1997
41
for a period of two years following displacement, be offered the opportunity to return to his/her previous classification.
The Employer may, at its discretion, for a period of two years following the displacement, reassign an employee displaced to a higher classification back to his/her former classification at the then current rate of pay for the former classification.
27.11	Any disagreement between the Employer and the Guild as to whether the cause for dismissal is, of itself, good and reasonable and whether the criteria above set forth have been fulfilled, shall be subject to arbitration.
27.12	If an employee is displaced to either a lower or higher classification within a grouping, the employee's rate of pay in the new classification will be based on current rates in that classification, except the adjustment shall not exceed two adjacent job groups (Group I-XV) in Article 11 of the contract. If the job is not included in the Group I-XV structure, the adjustment shall not be greater than 10%, higher or lower, than the employee's current minimum. In cases where the employee's adjusted rate of pay exceeds the contract minimum for that position, such employee's rate of pay will not be increased until his/her rate is commensurate with the minimum for that classification.

(a)	An employee's byline or credit line shall not be used over his/her protest. In the event substantive changes are made in a reporter's story and it is not practicable to call such changes to his/her attention, the byline shall be taken off such story by the editor.
GUILD - 1993 - 1997
48
The Guild and Employer agree that news stories and feature articles will be presented in accordance with sound journalistic practice without distortion of any facts, without malice, and without creating false impressions. If a question arises as to the accuracy of the printed material, the employee concerned will be consulted prior to any retraction of the material involved.
(b)	The Employer, believing that a free press best gathers news without external pressures, and the Guild, believing that a news employee should be responsible in his work only to his/her conscience and to his/her employer, agree that protection of a news employee's sources is of prime importance to his/her work. The Employer and the Guild further agree that:
When any request is made by a Federal, state or municipal court, grand jury, agency, department, commission, or legislative body for the production or disclosure of confidential information or confidential news sources utilized by any reporter, photographer, editor, writer, correspondent or any other person employed by, and directly engaged in the gathering of news for the Employer of such request, the Employer will make interim arrangements for immediate legal guidance and assistance for the employee through the Employer's Legal Department.
If necessary, arrangements for providing the employee with long-term legal representation of his/her choice will be made, as agreed upon by the Employer and the employee.
An employee so represented in any such proceeding by the Employer's Legal Department or by another representative agreed upon by both parties shall not suffer any loss of pay or other benefits and shall further be made whole to the extent permitted by law against any fines or damages levied by any final judgment or decision in the action except to the extent that such employee has taken a course of action contrary to the advice of his counsel.
Where there has been a breach of trust by the employee toward the Employer, the Employer has no obligation to provide legal protection to the employee.
This Article is superseded by the terms of Side Letter R.
ARTICLE 35—OUTSIDE WORK
An employee may engage in outside work provided it does not interfere with his/her work for the Employer and provided that such work is not in the service of another daily newspaper whose main production and publication office is located, and which is directly in competition with the Employer, in Philadelphia, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania, and Camden County, New Jersey.
GUILD - 1993 - 1997
49
Under no circumstances shall an employee use his/her connection with the Employer to exploit his/her outside work. Any employee taking on regular or recurrent outside work shall so inform his department head.
ARTICLE 36—SPACE WRITERS AND FREE-LANCERS
Not more than eight (8) space writers shall be employed in The Inquirer Sports Department. No space writer shall be used for rewrite or copyreading in The Inquirer Sports Department.

No space writer shall be used more than five (5) days in any one (1) week. Not more than three (3) space writers will be used to cover general sports assignment. This does not, however, prevent The Inquirer Sports Department from using the services of recognized sports reporting bureaus as it has in the past. Present practice as regards space writers for the Daily News shal'l continue. The Inquirer agrees that it will not use free-lancers beyond the number being used in 1958 excepting for specialized work which cannot be performed by a member of the bargaining unit defined in Article 1 of this contract, and only where such work does not require a full-time working week for its performance.
ARTICLE 37—BULLETIN BOARDS
Bulletin boards shall be provided for the exclusive use of the Guild in all departments where Guild members are employed. A minimum of two bulletin boards will be provided in departments where there are more than 75 Guild members and three where there are in excess of 150. The Company agrees to provide additional bulletin boards in any new departments or sub-divisions where Guild members are employed. The use of bulletin boards will be confined to the posting of notices and official Guild business.

When the Employer sells for syndication any product of an editorial employee for publication outside of The Inquirer or Daily News, the employee shall be paid fifty percent (50%) of the net return.
v	ARTICLE 39—GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
39.1	Any dispute over the interpretation of any clause of this agreement, or over the carrying out of any of its terms, shall be settled by negotiations between a committee representing the Employer or its authorized representative, and a committee chosen by the Guild.

to the Representative Assembly of the Guild within twelve (12) days, the matter will be referred to a local Joint Board.
39.2	Joint Board: The local Joint Board shall be comprised of two representatives of the Guild and two representatives of the Employer, all of whom shall be selected and convene within five (5) days after the serving of a detailed and written complaint by the aggrieved party upon the other party. Within one week after it convenes, the Joint Board shall hold any necessary hearings, and render a decision of the majority in writing. The decision shall be final and binding upon the Guild and the Employer.
ARTICLE 40—ARBITRATION
40.1	If the Joint Board is unable to arrive at a majority decision within seven (7) days of its first meeting, the dispute shall, upon written demand of either party, be submitted to arbitration by an impartial arbitrator to be designated in accordance with the current rules of the American Arbitration Association.
The arbitrator shall render a decision in writing as soon as possible. This decision will be final and binding upon the Employer and the Guild. The fee of the arbitrator, including expenses, and the American Arbitration Association's bill for administrative costs, shall be borne equally by the parties. Neither party shall be required to pay any part of the cost of a stenographic transcript without express consent.
40.2	Expedited Arbitration: Upon mutual agreement, the parties will meet and consider such steps as may be appropriate to expedite the arbitration of a given grievance.

ARTICLE 42—DURATION / ■ • 42.1 At least ninety (90) days before August 31, 1997, either party may give the other notice in writing of the specific terms and provisions which said party may desire to change in the new contract, which becomes effective upon the expiration of the present contract on August 31, 1997. Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such proposal, the other side may submit its counter proposal in writing.	<

Gentlemen:
The Guild is executing this contract despite the management's refusal to include in Article 10.2, "No Reduction in Pay," the last sentence of Section (e) of Article 19 of the contract between the Guild and the Philadelphia Daily News, entered into on May 2, 1963, because the Employer has not taken the position that the omission of said last sentence constitutes an agreement that the term* " sa 1 ary" or "wages" does not include any and all f orms o f compensation as well as the bases and rates for computing commissions and bonuses.
The Guild is executing this contract on the basis of an understanding between the Guild and the Employer that the positions expressed by both parties prior to and during contract negotiations regarding the above-described exclusion are not prejudiced by the Company's refusal to include the sentence in the new agreement.

This letter is to confirm the agreement at which we arrived during the negotiation of our collective bargaining agreement dated December 14, 1964, namely, that the differences between the language of Article 1, Section 2, of that agreement and the language of the analogous provisions of the Guild's agreement with The Inquirer which became effective on November 25, 1962, and of the analogous provisions of the Guild's agreement with the Daily News which became effective on September 23, 1962, are not intended to, and do not affect for the future any contraction or expansion in the heretofore prevailing application of any of the said analogous provisions or any other provisions of said agreements, nor will such differences be used as a basis for any such contraction or expansion in the future.
Similarly, the inclusion in the Agreement dated December 14, 1964, of Section (g) of Article 21 of the Guild's Agreement with the Daily News which became effective on September 23, 1962, is not intended to and does not effect or permit an application of Article 1, Section 2, of our agreement of December 14, 1964, which would expand or contract the heretofore prevailing application of the analogous provisions or any other provisions of the above-mentioned agreements of November 25, 1962, and September 23, 1962.

(No Discrimination); 3 (To Whom Applicable); 4 (Guild and Agency Shop); 5 (Check-off); 6 (Information to the Union); 12.7, 12.8 (General Wage Provisions);	23 (Health and Welfare Fund);	24
(Pension) (For the purpose of this memorandum concerning commission sales employees, commission equals salary.); 25.1, 25.2 (Job Posting and Bidding); 26.1, 26.2, 26.4 (Security); 27 (Reduction in Force) as modified by paragraph 8 below; 29.3 (Leave of Absence); 30 (Leave for United States Service); 31 (Health and Safety); 32 (No Strike Breaking); 35 (Outside Work); 37 (Bulletin Boards); 39 (Grievance Procedure); 40 (Arbitration); 41 (Seniority); and 42 (Duration). All other contract provisions are inapplicable to commission sales employees.
2.	Notice of commission sales positions shall be posted under the terms of Article 25 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Current employees who elect to apply will be given first consideration before other applicants are hired. Current employees who elect to apply and are selected shall have the option of returning to their former salaried positions within three (3) months. After three (3) months, an employee, on request, may return to his/her former classification, if, or when, a position is available. Except as provided for in Article 27 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, an employee seeking to return to his/her former classification may not bump any other employee. No current employee shall be transferred to a Commission Sales position without the employee's consent.
3.	Within the areas of responsibility assigned by the Employer to each commission sales employee, said employee shall solicit orders for advertising in Company publications or products except as set forth below. Without the prior written consent of the Company, said employee shall not solicit orders for advertising from:
a.	An advertiser whose advertising has been published in The Philadelphia Inquirer or Daily News within the
GUILD — 1993 -1997

then-preceding 13-month period or advertisers who have spent more than $5,000 within the then preceding 13-month period.
b.	Advertisers or categories of business appearing on the Company's protected business list; or
c.	An advertiser with one or more locations outside the Philadelphia PMSA who opens a location within the Philadelphia PMSA. The prohibition in subparagraph (c) applies only for the first six (6) months after the advertiser's location within the Philadelphia PMSA has opened.
4.	The commission sales employee will solicit accounts as defined in paragraph 3 above and will relinquish such accounts when the dollar volume of that account reaches $100,000 in any 12-month period. At that time, the Employer will assign said accounts to the regular outside salesperson handling that advertiser's territory or category.
5.	The Employer will furnish monthly to the Guild a report listing the salesperson, new accounts solicited, advertising sold, total revenue from each account, total inches of advertising and commission paid.
6.	For the first three months of employment each commission sales employee shall receive a monthly draw against commission of $2,000 that will be forgiven.
7.	The employer will determine the structure of commissions and any modifications thereto. No commission rate will be less, than eight (8) percent.
The Employer reserves the right to establish and/or change goals for each commission sales employee. These goals are not subject to grievance procedures. Each employee's performance will be evaluated after ninety (90) days and every six (6) months thereafter. Any employee who has not met his/her goal may be placed on probation for a minimum of thirty (30) days. For purposes of Article 26, being placed on probation two successive times constitutes a good and reasonable cause for dismissal. Nothing in this section will prohibit the Guild from representing any commission sales employee in the grievance and arbitration process provided for in Articles 39 and 40 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
8.	For the purpose of Article 27 (Reduction in Force), commission sales people shall not be grouped in Article 27.2 (K) (2)

Classified Advertising Salesperson, Display Advertising Salespersons). In the event of a reduction in force pursuant to Article 27 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, no full-time salaried sales staff (i.e., Display Advertising Salespersons, Classified Advertising Salespersons, Inside Telephone Sales Representatives and Ad-Visors) will be laid off as long as the Publisher continues to employ commission sales employees.
9.	Nothing in this agreement restricts the company's right to continue using outside agencies as currently practiced.
