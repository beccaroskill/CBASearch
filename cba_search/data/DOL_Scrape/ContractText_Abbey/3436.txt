Section 6.4	Use and Destruction of File Material
(a)	Police Department: Disciplinary Investigation Files, other than Police Board cases, will be destroyed five (5) years after the date of the incident or the date upon which the violation is discovered, whichever is longer, unless the investigation relates to a matter which has been subject to either civil or criminal court litigation prior to the expiration of the five year period. In such instances, the Complaint Register case files normally will be destroyed five years after the date of the final court adjudication, unless a pattern of sustained infractions exists.
(b)	All Departments:	Any information of an adverse
employment nature which is unfounded, exonerated or otherwise not sustained, shall not be used against the employee in any future proceedings.

For example, if an Aviation Communications Operator (ACO) is on vacation, a Data Entry Operator shall not be assigned as a replacement for the ACO. The Employer shall not arbitrarily extend the period of any emergency beyond the need for that emergency.
ARTICLE 7 GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION
Section 7,1 - Discipline Procedures
a.	Discharges shall be governed exclusively by the City of Chicago's Personnel or Police Board Rules. An employee may be discharged for just cause before the Personnel or Police Board hearing, provided that said employee shall be guaranteed, upon request, a full hearing before said Board in accordance with said Board's rules. An employee who may be subject to disciplinary action for any impropriety has the right to ask for a Union representative to be present at any interrogation or hearings. The
16
175843.1
grievance procedure provisions herein and the Personnel or Police Board appeals procedures are mutually exclusive, and no relief shall be available under both. Included in the procedures to be followed are the respective time frames for each of the appeal procedures. That is, the Employer, Union and employee shall adhere exclusively to the specified time frames of the selected appeal procedure.
In the event that a discharged employee appeals an adverse decision of the Personnel or Police Board to the Circuit Court of Cook County, or thereafter to the Appellate Court of Illinois, and the decision of the Personnel or Police Board is reversed or remanded resulting in restoration of the job, the Employer will pay the employee's reasonable attorney's fees which he or she has incurred in connection with the court proceeding, excluding fees incurred before the Personnel or Police Board. The employee shall submit a post-appeal fee petition to the Employer, which shall be supported by full documentation of the work performed, the hours expended, and the rates paid by the employee. Should the parties be unable to agree on the proper amount of the fees to be paid to the employee, either party may refer the dispute to arbitration under the relevant provisions of this agreement.
b.	The Employer within its discretion may determine whether disciplinary action should be an oral warning, written reprimand, suspension or discharge, depending upon various factors, such as,
17
175843.1
but not limited to, the severity of the offense or the employee's prior record. Such discipline shall be administered as soon as practical after the Employer has had a reasonable opportunity to fully investigate the matter.
c.	In cases of oral warnings, the supervisor or her/her designee shall inform the employee that he/she is receiving an oral warning and the reasons therefore. For discipline other than oral warnings, the employee's immediate supervisor or his/her designee shall meet with the employee and notify him/her of the accusations against the employee and give the employee an opportunity to answer said accusations. Specifically, the supervisor or his/her designee shall tell the employee the names of witnesses, if any, and make available copies of pertinent documents the employee or Union is legally entitled to receive, to the extent then known and available.

Before a formal grievance is initiated, the employee and/or the Union shall meet with and discuss the matter with the employee's immediate supervisor. A steward may be present at such discussion. If the problem is not resolved in a discussion, the following procedure shall be used to adjust grievances.
STEP I	_
A.	The employee and/or the Union shall raise the grievance in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days of having knowledge of the event which gives rise to the grievance.
19
175843.1
B.	The immediate supervisor will render his/her decision to the employee and the Union in writing within ten (10) calendar days after the grievance is presented.
STEP II
A.	If the grievance is not settled at the first Step, the Union representative and/or the employee shall have the right to make an appeal in writing on a mutually agreed upon form to the Department Head's designee, a senior supervisor, within ten (10) calendar days after the date of the decision by the immediate supervisor, or the date such answer was due. The name of the senior supervisor, who is the Department Head's designee shall be posted for employees in areas where employee notices are normally posted and submitted to the Union.
B.	The Department Head's designee will notify the employee in writing with a copy to the Union of his/her decision on the grievance form within seven (7) days of receipt of the Step II appeal form.
STEP III

B.	The Department Head or his/her designee shall meet with the Union in an effort to resolve said grievance and reply in
20
175843.1
writing or his/her decision within seven (7) calendar days from receipt of Step III to the employee and the Union.
C.	If an arbitrable dispute is not settled at the third step, either the Union or the Employer may notify the other in writing within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the Step III decision, that it requests final and binding arbitration of its grievance.
D.	Any settlement at Step I, II or III shall be binding upon the Employer, Union and the aggrieved employee or employees. Failure of the Employer to answer a grievance within the time limits herein shall permit the Union to refer the case to the succeeding step of the procedure. Upon request, there shall be a meeting at each step of the grievance procedure. A Union steward or a Union Staff Representative may be present at each step meeting. The Union will be informed of an allowed to be in attendance at and participate in all grievance or disciplinary hearings. A grievance may be withdrawn without prejudice to the Union. Failure of the Employer to answer a grievance within the time limit herein shall automatically cause the grievance to advance to the succeeding step of the procedure.

21
175843.1
shall advise the Employer when it knows the grievance affects a group or class of employees.
F.	Even though a grievance has been filed, employees are obligated to follow instructions or orders of supervisors of the Employer, except where the instruction or order is so inherently dangerous to the employee that it could cause death or serious physical harm. The Employer agrees that by following instructions or orders the employee does not waive the employee's right to process his or her grievance. Refusal to follow instructions or orders shall be cause for suspension or discharge at the option of the Employer.
STEP IV
If the matter is not settled in Step III, the Union or the Employer, but not an individual employee or employees, may submit the dispute to arbitration by serving a written request to arbitrate, setting forth the facts and specific relief requested, within ten (10) calendar days after the answer is given at Step III hereof.
A rotating Roster of Arbitrators shall be used by the parties. The Employer and the Union will select a roster of eight (8) arbitrators. All arbitrators shall be selected by mutual agreement.
In the event the parties cannot mutually agree upon the selection of a full roster of eight (8) arbitrators, the parties
22
175843.1
shall contact the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) for a list of arbitrators in the Chicagoland area (excluding those upon whom agreement may be have been reached). The parties will then alternately strike names from such list until the remaining number of arbitrators are left to make up a roster of eight (8). The Employer will strike first. Arbitrators will advise the parties of their fees and expenses prior to selection and will be expected to charge such fees and expenses. The fee and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally between the Union and the Employer.
The arbitrator shall have the right to subpoena witnesses and require the production of pertinent documents at the request of either party. Each party shall be responsible for compensating its own representatives and witnesses. The cost of a transcript shall be shared if the necessity of a transcript is mutually agreed upon between the parties. Arbitrators shall select a date for arbitration within sixty (60) days of notice that a grievance is ready for arbitration and submit their decision within thirty (30) days following such hearing. The Roster of Arbitrators will be listed in alphabetical order on a list retained by both the Employer and the Union.
Upon a Step IV request for arbitration, arbitrators will be designated by the parties in alphabetical rotating order and subsequently contacted to obtain an arbitrator's commitment to
23
175843.1
arbitrate the respective grievance within the stated time limit within seven (7) days from the date the grievances are submitted to the arbitration process. If an arbitrator is not available to hear a case, the next arbitrator in rotating alphabetical order will be chosen. The parties may mutually agree not to use a particular arbitrator for a specific case, or to select an arbitrator who is not on the roster. The parties may agree to submit more than one (1) grievance to a selected arbitrator.
Every year each party has the right to remove up to two (2) arbitrators from the Roster of Arbitrators and have them replaced with other arbitrators selected in the same manner as the initial selection. The parties may mutually agree at any time to remove any arbitrator from the panel of eight (8) . If the parties so agree, they may mutually agree to replace such arbitrator with another arbitrator who is mutually acceptable. If, because of such removals, the Roster of Arbitrators falls below six (6), and the parties cannot agree on replacement arbitrators, the parties shall contact the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) for a list of nine (9) arbitrators (excluding those already on or removed from the roster) in the Chicago area for each vacancy on the roster below the complement of six (6) .
The parties will then alternately strike names from each such list of arbitrators until one (1) remains from each so that the remaining number of acceptable arbitrators is sufficient to bring
24
175843.1
the total roster to at least six (6), or such number greater than six (6) as the parties may agree.
An arbitrable matter must involve the meaning and application of interpretation of a specific provision of this Agreement. Question or arbitrability shall be decided by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have no power to amend, add to, subtract from, or change the terms of this Agreement, and shall be authorized only to interpret the existing provisions of this Agreement and apply them to the specific facts of the grievance or dispute. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties to the dispute, including the employee or employees involved. Section 7,4 Grievance May Be Filed At Step III
An Employer or Union grievance may be filed at Step III. Certain issues which by their nature are not capable of being settled at a preliminary step of the grievance procedure or which would become moot due to the length of time necessary to exhaust the grievance steps, may be filed at the appropriate advance step where the action giving rise to the grievance may be resolved.

The Employer and the Union maintain a strong commitment to protect people and property, and to provide a safe working environment.

(iii)	a test may be required as part of a follow-up to counseling or rehabilitation for substance abuse for up to a one year period.
