After 20 years of continuous service, a one-time bonus of 56 hours shall be credited or paid for shift employees and 40 hours for 40-hour employees.
The decision to credit or pay longevity vacation is at the employee’s discretion subject to budget.
City of Grants Pass/IAFF
9
Time credited is subject to maximum accrual limitations.
An employee that transfers from a 40-hour work week schedule to an average 56-hour work week schedule shall have the employee's vacation accrual balance multiplied by 1.5 to obtain the employee's new vacation accrual balance; if transferred from an average 56-hour work week schedule to a 40-hour work week schedule, the employee's vacation accrual balance shall be multiplied by .667 to obtain the employee's new vacation accrual balance.
7.3	Continuous Service
Continuous service, for the purpose of accumulating vacation leave credit, shall be based on regular paid hours. Time spent on unpaid leave shall not be counted as continuous service, provided that employee returning from such leave and employees on layoff status shall be entitled to credit for service prior to leave or layoff. Employees returning from military leave will retain all seniority and seniority-based rights and benefits as if the employee had remained continuously employed.
7.4	Accrual Limitations
Vacation time must be taken by shift employees within 18 months following the date of accrual. Forty-hour employees may accrue up to a maximum of 200 hours of vacation time; such vacation shall be deemed forfeited if not taken, unless mutually agreed in writing in advance. An employee who is about to lose vacation credit because of accrual limitations may, by notifying the employee's supervisor 15 days in advance, absent himself to prevent loss of this vacation time. The City shall establish a procedure to notify an employee 30 days in advance of impending loss of accrued vacation time.
Such action taken by the employee shall not constitute a basis for disciplinary action or loss of pay. Vacation leave shall not accrue during a leave of absence without pay. No payment shall be made for vacation time lost by an employee because of accrual limitations, unless the failure to take vacation is caused by the City's insistence that the employee be at work during a scheduled vacation period.
7.5	Scheduling
Vacation time shall be scheduled based on the needs of efficient operations and the availability of vacation relief.
Subject to the foregoing, employees shall have the right to determine vacation times: Vacation times shall be selected on the basis of seniority (date of hire) within each shift and conflicts in vacation schedules between bargaining unit personnel and non-bargaining unit personnel shall have no effect on request for vacation by bargaining unit personnel. However, such employee will be permitted to exercise the employee's right to seniority only once within the bidding period. The vacation schedule shall be posted annually as of November 1 and the employees shall sign up for their annual vacation on a seniority basis
City of Grants Pass/IAFF
10
for the period January 1 through December 31. If conflicts occur in scheduling during the sign-up period of November 1 to November 30, the senior employee's selection shall prevail. The seniority bid for vacations shall be a minimum of two (2) successive days. After the seniority bids are submitted and posted on the vacation calendar, all other vacation will be allotted on a seniority basis. The employee with highest seniority may choose up to two (2) days (not required to be successive), then the employee with the second highest seniority may choose two (2) days and so the rotation continues. The list shall be closed as of November 30 and subsequent changes or selections shall be made only by mutual consent of the parties. All further selections of time off will be done on a first come first serve basis. Scheduling of vacation periods beyond the seniority choice, to the extent consistent with operating requirements of the City, and vacation credits of the employee, shall be permitted on a three (3) hour minimum.
Two employees may schedule time off for each shift with priority to the first person on a first-come first-served basis, without regard to bargaining unit status. The second person desiring the same time off may arrange for a qualified employee to be available to cover the employee's shift regardless of rank or seniority in accordance with Section 5.14.
7.6	Payment on Termination
In the event of death or termination of an employee during the initial 12 months of the employee's employment, no payment in lieu of vacation shall be made.

The maximum time any employee may apply to the sick leave conversion formula shall be 3300 hours. It shall be paid in the following manner:
Two and one-half percent (2.5%) times each full year of the employee's continuous years of service times the employee's sick leave accumulation, but no greater than the maximum allowed accrual, at a rate equivalent to the employee's current gross hourly salary.
An employee may opt to use the employee's accrued sick leave as provided in ORS 238.350.
8.6	Conversion for Shift Change
An employee that transfers from a 40-hour work week schedule to an average 56-hourwork week schedule shall have the employee's sick leave accrual balance multiplied by 1.625 to obtain the employee's new sick leave accrual balance; if transferred from an average 56-hour work week schedule to a 40-hour work week schedule, the employee's accumulated sick leave accrual balance shall be multiplied by .616 to obtain the employee's new sick leave accrual balance.
8.7	Light Duty
Many slight injuries and sickness may prohibit the performance of regularly assigned duties; however, there may be other duties that such employees may be able to perform without aggravating such injuries or sickness. Providing the physician states that "light duty" is acceptable, the employee may, at the City's option, report to the employee's supervisor for assignment to duties related to public safety operations. The division may assign such duties as the health and condition of the involved employees permit only in cases where bonafide public safety related jobs or duties are available.

Firefighter Physical Ability Examination
TEST PREPARATION
The following suggestions should help you prepare yourself physically for the test:
•	Avoid junk food and maintain a well-balanced diet for several days before the test.
•	Avoid tranquilizers and stimulants such as caffeinated beverages, especially on the day of the test.
•	Get a good night’s sleep before the test.
•	Do not drink a lot of liquids or eat a large meal before the test.
•	Avoid alcohol several days prior to and especially on the day of the test.
On the day of testing, all applicants are required to wear:
•	Long pants (shorts are not allowed for safety reasons)
•	Sport shoes
•	Other gear will be provided by the department
PLEASE NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EXAMINATION IF YOU ARE NOT WEARING LONG PANTS (e.g. jeans, sweats).
DESCRIPTION OF THE TEST
An orientation and walk through will be given by a test administrator to all applicants prior to the actual examination. Applicants must fully understand what is expected of them before being allowed to take the test. All events must be performed safely and as designated.
The test is composed of the following events:
Un-timed Events
1.	Claustrophobia Crawl: Applicants will be led to the entrance of a doorway where they will grab on to a section of rope. With a darkened facemask covering the eyes, applicants must follow the rope through to the other side of a dark room. Letting go of the rope will result in disqualification. Maintaining a grip on the rope is important when fighting fires so one does not get lost in a smoky building. The Grants Pass Fire Department requires applicants to maintain a grip on the rope at all times. Applicants will be advised they may encounter obstacles along the way and that if this happens, they are to maneuver around or over all obstacles. When passage to the other side of the room has been completed, applicants will be permitted to remove the darkened mask.
2.	Aerial Climb: The fire department’s aerial apparatus will be extended 75 feet off the ground at an angle of 70 degrees. A belay line will be strung through the top rung of the ladder to serve as a safety line. Applicants will be tethered to the belay line and will, upon instruction, ascend and descend the ladder without stopping. Applicants shall be
City of Grants Pass/IAFF
33
considered to have reached the top of the ladder when they can place both hands on the top rung. Applicants will be given plenty of time to complete the aerial climb event.
Timed Events
During the sequence of timed events, it is extremely important to pace yourself. Over-exerting yourself early in the test may reduce the amount of energy you have left for exercises at the end of the test, such as the victim rescue. Applicants are not allowed to run between events since this is usually not permitted on the training ground and on the job. However, you may walk at a brisk pace during the examination.
3.	Hose Drag: Timing starts with this event. Once the aerial climb has been completed successfully, applicants will pull a 5 inch supply hose with a coupling attached a distance of 50 feet and set it on the ground. The end of the hose may be placed over a shoulder or grasped with both hands. The hose will be pre-arranged on the ground in a similar pattern for each applicant.
4.	Cap Loosening: Applicants will then go to a hydrant whose steamer cap has been torgued to approximately 135 foot pounds of torgue. Applicantswill loosen the cap with a hydrant wrench attached to the front nut of the steamer cap. The applicant shall turn the cap nut counterclockwise for about a half a turn. After each applicant, the cap will be retightened to approximately 135 foot pounds of torque.
5.	Charged Hose Advance: The applicant will pick up the nozzle and move a 1 3/4 inch charged (i.e. filled with water) hose for a distance of 75 feet and set the nozzle on the ground. The end of the hose may be placed over a shoulder or grasped with both hands. The hose will be pre-arranged on the ground in a similar pattern for each applicant.
6.	PPV Carry: After advancing the hose line, the applicant will pick up a positive pressure ventilation fan (PPV), carry it a distance of approximately 25 feet and set it on the ground.
7.	Ladder Extension: The applicant will then pull the halyard rope until the ladder is fully extended, as confirmed by a test monitor. Applicants must raise the halyard using a hand-over-hand motion and they have to control the lowering of the ladder using a hand-over-hand motion. If applicants drop the ladder, they must repeat the event from the beginning.
8.	Stair Climb: After raising and lowering the ladder, the applicant will pick up the hose pack and carry it up a single flight of stairs, place both feet on the second floor landing, turn and descend the stairs, placing both feet on the ground floor, turn and repeat for a total of three ascents and descents while carrying the hose pack. Upon descending the stairs for the third time the candidate will set the hose pack on the ground. The applicant will perform this exercise by maintaining control of the hose bundle in an under arm or over shoulder fashion. The applicant is not allowed to skip steps during the ascent or decent portion of the test.
9.	Victim Rescue: The applicant will grasp a dummy weighing approximately 150 pounds and drag (not carry) the dummy a distance of 75 feet whereupon timing of the events will stop. The applicant may grasp the dummy by whatever means necessary without the aid of any extra equipment. The dummy shall be dragged head first.

Additional Information
1.	The examination will be administered only as weather permits.
2.	Before testing begins, conserve energy by sitting and waiting for your turn. The
examination is physically demanding and you will need your energy. You may want to stretch your muscles, but do not overexert yourself.
3.	Before beginning the test, each applicant will try on the Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and adjust the straps as necessary to ensure it is comfortable. A test monitor will be present to assist with any equipment adjustments.
4.	Bunker coat and helmet, which are provided, shall be worn throughout the course of the examination. In addition, applicants are required to wear long pants (e.g. jeans, sweats) and encouraged to wear sport shoes. Applicants are not permitted to wear shorts.
5.	The test begins with two un-timed exercises. These are the aerial climb and the claustrophobia crawl. Applicants unable to successfully complete either of these exercises will not be allowed to continue with the testing process.
Applicants able to complete the entire sequence of exercises successfully within 4 minutes and 48 seconds pass the test. In accordance with the Civil Rights Act of 1991, a single cut-off score is used for applicants of both genders and for all ethnicities.
