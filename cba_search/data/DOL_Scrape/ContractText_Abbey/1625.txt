The following master contract covering certain terms and conditions of employment for teachers has been developed through negotiations between the Board and its representatives and the Association and its representatives.

A.	A grievance shall be defined as a difference between the Administration representing the Board and the Association or one or more teachers involving an alleged violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any rule, regulation, or policy of the Board which directly affects the teacher or teachers in their teaching assignment, except that only timely grievances involving an alleged violation of an express provision of the master contract may be presented to binding arbitration. Arbitration of all other grievances shall be advisory.
B.	If a potential grievance involves an individual teacher, it shall be discussed informally with the building principal. The teacher may involve the Association’s building representative in the discussion at the teacher’s option.
The teacher may request representation by the FWEA President or UniServ/Executive Director at this meeting. If a request for this representation is made, FWEA will forward the request to Employee Relations for disposition of the request. Employee relations will notify FWEA of its disposition of the request.
C.	If after this discussion, the teacher believes there is a basis for a formal grievance, or if the Association believes there is a basis for a class grievance, the aggrieved party shall file a written grievance with the building principal or Employee Relations Department no later than eighteen (18) school days after the occurrence that gave rise to the alleged grievance or after the aggrieved party became aware of the occurrence, whichever is later. The prescribed form shown in Appendix 1 signed by the grievant and/or the Association shall be used.
D.	Within fifteen (15) school days of the filing of the grievance, the parties shall meet to review it, gather facts, and discuss possible resolution. If the grievance is not resolved, a written answer with copies to all concerned shall be returned within five (5) school days of the meeting.
E.	If the grievance is not resolved at the meeting or by the written answer, the aggrieved party may, within fifteen (15) school days after the receipt of the written answer, or if no answer is given within twenty (20) school days of the meeting, file a notice of arbitration with the Joint Communications Committee. The grievance shall be discussed at the next meeting of the Joint Communications Committee. If it is not resolved, either party may request arbitration.
F.	Arbitration is requested by letter, with a copy to the non-requesting party, to the American Arbitration Association requesting that they select an
20
Article 4: Grievance Procedures
impartial arbitrator and conduct the arbitration proceedings. Both parties agree that the American Arbitration Association shall conduct the arbitration according to its rules. If the grievance is subject to binding arbitration, the arbitrator may apply this agreement to the case under consideration but shall have no authority to add to, subtract from, or modify the terms of this master contract. If within the terms of his/her authority, the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties. If the grievance is one subject to advisory arbitration, it is hoped that in an atmosphere of good faith, the decisions of the arbitrator will be accepted by both parties. Upon request, the parties shall exchange information reasonably necessary to prepare for any scheduled arbitration, including lists of witnesses and exhibits.
G.

5.	Written notification to teachers of surplus status will be one week before the first job fair posting.
6.	Surplus teachers not placed in the first job fair shall be placed through the efforts of the Joint Communications Committee or designees. Efforts will be made to match the preference of the surplus teacher with preferences of principals/unit heads where vacancies exist after the first job fair.

43
Article 11: Placement, Assignment and Promotion
4.	A teacher who becomes aware of a vacancy during the non-posting period may apply for the vacancy. Selection for the position may be made at the discretion of the Board without regard to qualifications as defined in paragraph A-4. If a current teacher is selected by the Board for the position, the Board may, at its discretion, treat the vacancy as filled immediately but hold the actual assignment of the teacher selected until the end of the school year or semester and fill it temporarily by some other means.
5.	Teaching vacancies during the school year which are filled by teachers on temporary contract or by substitute teachers shall be posted for the ensuing year as new openings.
F.	Reduction in Teaching Staff
1.	In the event of conditions necessitating a reduction in the number of teachers employed by the Board, the following procedure shall be followed:
a.	If a reduction in staff is necessary, teachers with the least amount of continuous service under a regular teacher’s contract in this school corporation shall be laid off first within their area of certification. Service under a regular teacher’s contract does not include service under supplemental, temporary, substitute, and/or other contract.
b.	Those holding limited licenses will be subjected to layoff before those holding standard licenses in the area of certification regardless of service credit unless a waiver is agreed to by the Joint Communications Committee.
c.	Elementary teachers with multiple certifications who are protected from layoff in one area of certification may not transfer to another area of certification if there are qualified teachers for that area in layoff status. Teachers protected from layoff due to multiple certifications must teach in those areas the following school year. If no one qualified for a vacancy remains on a recall list and/or there are no bounce-back rights for that vacancy, and if there is a vacancy in the area of the multiple certification of the teacher, the teacher may leave the protected area after all contractual processes for filling that vacancy are followed.
2.	Service shall commence to accumulate the date the Board approved the individual teacher contract or the date the teacher
44
Article 11: Placement, Assignment and Promotion
starts to teach, whichever is earlier, and shall continue to accumulate during approved leaves of absence and layoffs due to staff reductions as provided in this section. If more than one teacher commenced service on the same date, the following procedure will be used to break the tie:
a.	The sum of the last four digits of the social security number will be added. The higher sum of the two is granted the greater seniority.
b.	If an additional tiebreaker is needed, representatives of FWCS and FWEA will draw lots with the first drawn granted the greater seniority.
3.	The Association shall receive the proposed list of teachers to be subjected to a reduction-in-force no later than five (5) school days prior to notification of the bargaining unit members of his/her reduction. The list will be by area of certification or delivered in such a fashion that the Association can promptly divide the list into areas of certification.
There will be a meeting of the Joint Communications Committee to review the proposed list and resolve any issues in dispute. The meeting will take place after the receipt of the proposed list by the Association but before teachers are formally notified of the reduction-in-force.
4.	The parties may agree to extend an opportunity for teachers to voluntarily participate in a reduction-in-force. However, no teacher will be allowed to voluntarily participate in a reduction-in-force, in order to avoid teaching in a protected multiple certification area.
5.	Teachers receiving notice of layoff as provided in this section shall have the due process rights and privileges of this master contract and of state tenure laws at the time of notice of layoffs, but teachers exercising such hearing rights shall not be subject to recall. All other teachers released from teacher contracts as provided in this section shall be recalled in reverse order of layoff.
6.	A teacher laid off shall be notified in writing of his/her recall number based upon elementary certification - any grade; secondary-licensed area/areas at the time of notice of layoff. Certification on file with the Human Resources department on the deadline date agreed upon by JCC’s, but no later than the date the Board acts upon the reduction in staff, shall be the basis for determining certification for purposes of layoff.
45
Article 11: Placement, Assignment and Promotion
7.	A laid-off teacher or any part-time teacher on the recall list has the right to be recalled to any available position for which the teacher is qualified after teachers who have not been laid off have had the opportunity to fill those vacancies. The teacher must accept any position offered for which he/she is qualified in line with other provisions of this article or forfeit all rights to recall. The parties recognize the need to minimize the disruption a reduction-in-force may have on a building and/or program, and therefore, a joint effort will be made through the Joint Communications Committee to restore recalled teachers to original buildings and/or similar assignments whenever possible. For example, after vacancies become available for recall, the number of vacancies may be pooled and that number of teachers placed back in the original building or assignment. All teachers in the pool are placed at the same time.
8.	Teachers on the layoff/recall list may only be recalled up to the amount of the FTE held by the teacher at the time of layoff.
9.	A teacher recalled shall be contacted by registered letter. If the recalled teacher does not respond by registered letter within seven (7) calendar days from the date the recall letter was received, the teacher will be terminated.
10.	A teacher laid off and signing a contract with another school corporation will be allowed to complete contractual obligations with no penalty and may return to FWCS in surplus status.
11.	If there are permanent teachers (i.e., those who have signed their sixth contract with FWCS) on the layoff list as of the first student day of the school year, then the following procedures shall apply:
a.	The Administration shall place up to 20 of the most senior permanent elementary teachers and up to 20 of the most senior permanent secondary teachers under regular teacher’s contract as permanent substitutes with salaries and benefit days that are standard for regular, full-time, and part-time teachers. No insurance subsidy is available for this assignment; however, laid-off teachers placed into this status will be given the first right of refusal for any temporary contract position that becomes available for which that teacher is qualified. Should one or more of the eligible elementary teachers or one or more of the eligible secondary teachers refuse the permanent substitute option, the Administration shall continue down the seniority list, if
46
Article 11: Placement, Assignment and Promotion
applicable, until the specified number of regular contracted substitute positions are filled. As teacher vacancies occur during the school year, teachers working as permanent substitutes shall be placed in the vacant positions in accordance with certification and length of service and thereafter receive insurance benefits. If recall does not occur within the first school year, the regular recall process will be followed.
b.	Any laid-off teacher not accepting option (a) or any laid-off teacher not having option (a) available shall be placed on the substitute teacher list at the teacher’s request.
c.	Except by mutual agreement of the Association and Administration, a recalled teacher shall be assigned to teach only those endorsement areas for which the teacher is properly certified to teach in Indiana.
d.	Association representatives (President and Executive Director) shall be informed of the teacher(s) to be laid off or recalled, the order of recall, and the date of commencement of continuous service prior to notification of the teacher(s) involved.
e.	A teacher on layoff shall have access to copies of the Reporter or any other official Board/Administration communication for certified employees normally distributed to classroom teachers.
G.	Adjustment of Allocations
1.	If a teaching vacancy for which the surplused teacher is qualified occurs in that school during the following school year after the student count day, or in allocations for the school year after that, the surplused teacher shall be given the opportunity to return to that assignment using a temporary fill if during the following school year.
2.	When possible, special area teachers assigned to more than one unit or building shall be notified in writing at least four weeks prior to the opening of school of a change in assignment from that of the preceding year.
H.	Administrative Intern Program
Any teacher may apply for the Administrative Intern Program by contacting the coordinator of that program. When interested in an administrative or supervisory position, it is the responsibility of each teacher to make known
47
Article 11: Placement, Assignment and Promotion
his/her promotional goals in writing through the Administrative Intern Program or by applying for a posted administrative position. Teachers may also be recruited by the Administration for the Administrative Intern Program.
1.	Administrative interns must be selected early enough so that positions vacated will be posted in Job Fair 1. The Joint Communications Committee can make exceptions to this timeline.
2.	All other provisions of the FWCS/FWEA master contract, except those specified in this section (Article 11, Section H), will be suspended for the intern for the term of their administrative intern assignment.
3.	The teacher hired to replace the administrative intern shall be issued a regular teacher’s contract.
4.	At the conclusion of the administrative intern assignment, the intern shall return to his/her former teaching assignment unless a permanent administrative assignment is accepted.
5.	The teacher hired to replace the intern shall be surplused or laid off (per Article 10 of this contract) upon the intern’s return to his/her former teaching assignment.
6.	Administrative interns shall not evaluate other bargaining unit members but may observe the evaluation process by shadowing the administrative evaluator. This means the intern may observe but have no input into the evaluation. The teacher being evaluated may request that the intern’s involvement be terminated. The teacher being evaluated need give no reason.
48
Article 12:	Emergency Permits
A.	Teachers may be employed to teach in an area that would require the teacher to obtain an Emergency Permit as defined by 515 IAC 1-2-20. This type of license requires the teacher to pursue a standard license in a sequence defined in 515 IAC 1-2-20, as well as meet all requirements established by the Indiana Professional Standards Board (IPSB).
1.	Teachers who accept assignments on an Emergency Permit must comply with the requirements of 515 IAC 1-2-20, IPSB, as well as any requirements of FWCS (to include signed letter of commitment), as long as those requirements have been discussed with FWEA prior to implementation.
2.	Teachers who accept assignments on an Emergency Permit are covered by the provisions of the Master Contract, except as expressed in this article.
B.	If a teacher’s initial employment with FWCS is based on the holding of an Emergency Permit, the following limits are placed on the contract rights of that teacher until the teacher obtains a standard license in the area he/she holds on an Emergency Permit.
1.	The teacher hired on an Emergency Permit will be released before any teacher holding a standard license if a reduction-in-force is necessary and is subject to reduction-in-force without any protection of holding any other standard license.
2.	The teacher shall not be eligible for a transfer or reassignment to a position for which a standard license is held while holding an Emergency Permit. A teacher may seek a transfer to another position, which is in his/her area of limited license. Once a standard license is obtained, the teacher will enjoy full transfer rights.
3.	For evaluation purposes, the teacher holding an Emergency Permit shall be considered a probationary employee, as that term is used in the evaluation article of the Master Contract, for as long as the teacher holds an assignment in which an Emergency Permit is used.
4.	If a teacher who is teaching in an assignment that requires an Emergency Permit is terminated for incompetence, that teacher shall not have the option of waiving a hearing before the Board of School Trustees in Article 6, Section B (e) of the Master Contract.
49
Article 12: Emergency Permits
C.	Any teacher who was previously employed by FWCS while holding a standard license, but is assigned to a position requiring an Emergency Permit has the following rights:
1.	The first year in the assignment will be considered teaching out of his/her area of certification and therefore will not be evaluated during that school year unless the Joint Communication Committee waives the provision for a particular special circumstance.
2.	The second year in the assignment on an Emergency Permit the teacher will be subject to evaluation if the year falls into the teacher’s three-year evaluation cycle or the teacher’s evaluation status as defined in the evaluation article of the Master Contract.
3.	The teacher has no restrictions on his/her transfer/reassignment rights.
4.	The teacher is eligible for protection from reduction-in-force if his/her certification warrants such protection.
5.	The teacher enjoys full due process protections found in this contract.
50
Article 13:	Teacher Evaluation
The parties agree that a memorandum of understanding be established to outline a process to be used to evaluate teachers who have assignments based on a limited teaching license.
A.	Evaluation
1.	The purpose of evaluation is to elevate the level of teaching performance. For most teachers, that will involve working with school Administration on a periodic basis to promote professional growth. For some, the process will involve identifying needs for improvement, monitoring, and providing documentation for employment decisions. The procedures of this article do not apply to teachers under temporary contract, substitutes, or others not under regular contract, but when those teachers are evaluated, they should be evaluated on a Teacher Evaluation Summary form (Appendix 5).
2.	Before the end of the first four weeks that school is in session each school year, the unit head shall have a conference with teachers who are scheduled to be evaluated that school year for the purpose of explaining and discussing the evaluation procedure. The conference may be conducted individually or in a group setting.
3.	The unit head has overall responsibility for the evaluation process. However, by mutual agreement between the unit head and teacher, another administrator may be designated to evaluate teachers who are not on probation and/or work with teachers on their Professional Growth Plan. The evaluator must conduct all components of the evaluation and shall hold an administrative license unless by mutual agreement an administrator without such a license is chosen.
4.	Evaluations shall be based upon the domains listed on the Teacher Evaluation Summary.
5.	A teacher may not be evaluated on student behaviors which do not relate to the performance of the teacher.
6.	There shall be no evaluation of a teacher’s instructional performance based on student scores from the Indiana Statewide Testing for Educational Progress (ISTEP) or its successor(s), or on student scores on any standardized test(s) required by ESEA. The preparation of a teacher to administer the test(s) and the teacher’s use of test data to facilitate instruction may be considered in evaluations subject to this Article.
51
Article 13: Teacher Evaluation
7.	Classroom observations shall be a minimum of thirty (30) minutes in length.
8.	Each observation shall be followed by an observation conference within ten (10) school days after the observation of the teacher. During this conference, the teacher shall be given the observer’s Notes of Observation form (Appendix 6). An evaluation (Evaluation Summary Form) and evaluation conference shall follow one or more observations. The teacher must be given enough time to consider comments made at the observation conference and provide additional input, if desired, before the evaluation.
9.	A teacher may, but is not required to, add comments, rebuttals, materials, etc., to any Evaluation Summary Form or other evaluation or observation file. Failure to add materials may not be considered in any evaluation.
10.	Any required conference may be waived by mutual consent.
11.	If at any time during the school year the unit head becomes aware of information which negatively reflects on a teacher’s performance, this information shall be brought to the attention of the teacher, in writing, no later than fifteen (15) school days after the occurrence, or after the unit head become aware of the occurrence, whichever is later. If appropriate, the unit head shall also offer specific suggestions, in writing, concerning the appropriate action which the teacher should consider as result of the information. If requested by the unit head or teacher, a conference shall be held to discuss the information and suggestions. If information which negatively reflects on a teacher’s performance is not brought to the attention of the teacher in writing within the time limits of this paragraph, that information may not be considered as a part of the teacher’s evaluation.
12.	Only teachers on probation may be terminated for incompetency.
13.	All non-permanent teachers are on probation.
14.	Semi-permanent and permanent teachers may be placed on probation if the teacher’s performance is unsatisfactory in three (3) or more components in at least one of the four (4) professional practice domains. These teachers may possibly be terminated for just cause.
15.	A teacher placed on probation may ask for a transfer at the end of the school year in which he or she is placed on probation. The
52
Article 13: Teacher Evaluation
transfer shall be granted to a school selected by the Board, and evaluated in the new school by the new unit head.
16.	If a semi-permanent or permanent teacher is in danger of being placed on probation, the teacher must be notified of the danger, given the reasons the teacher is in danger of being placed on probation, and a Monitored Assistance Plan (MAP) prepared. The teacher shall have at least thirty (30) days of working under the Monitored Assistance Plan (Appendix 7) to correct deficiencies before being placed on probation and may not be terminated in the school year in which they are placed on probation.
17.	Any teacher for whom a recommendation of termination has been made for incompetency may waive the right to a Board hearing. In the event that the Board hearing is waived, both the merits of the evaluation as well as the procedures of this Article shall be subject to binding arbitration. If the Board hearing is not waived, only the procedures of this Article shall be subject to binding arbitration.
18.	The provisions of this Master Contract supersede any forms or administrative manuals dealing with evaluation.
19.	Nothing in these procedures shall be construed to limit or supersede Indiana law.
20.	The Board shall not require members of the Association’s bargaining unit to make classroom visits, observe, evaluate the instructional skills of other teachers, or provide a written report to the administrative staff.
B.	Professional Growth Plan (PGP) Evaluation
1.	This procedure applies to semi-permanent and permanent teachers who are neither on probation nor in danger of being placed on probation. The normal cycle for this procedure is once every three (3) years.
2.	The PGP evaluation sequence is as follows:
a.	In the spring of the school year preceding the cycle, the unit head shall meet with the teachers who will be required to develop a Professional Growth Plan. The conference may be conducted individually or in a group setting. The Professional Growth Plan form is in Appendix 8.
53
Article 13: Teacher Evaluation
b.	In the fall of the cycle year, and no later than November 1, the unit head and teacher shall meet in a conference to discuss and develop the Professional Growth Plan.
c.	At least once during the cycle year, and no later than May 1, the unit head shall conduct a minimum of one observation, prepare Observation Notes, and hold an observation conference.
d.	Following the observation conference, and no later than June 1, the unit head shall prepare a Teacher Evaluation Summary and hold an evaluation conference.
3.	If a teacher not identified as being in danger of being placed on probation needs assistance, a Monitored Assistance Plan (MAP) may be prepared after the reasons for the need for assistance have been given to the teacher. Reasons for the teacher being placed on a MAP must be based on direct evidence by an administrator and related to the four domains listed on the teacher evaluation summary. The MAP must be completed by the end of the school year while the teacher is in the PGP cycle.
C.	In Danger of Being Placed on Probation
1.	This procedure applies to semi-permanent or permanent teachers who are in danger of being placed on probation.
2.	If a unit head believes that a teacher is in danger of being placed on probation, the evaluation shall follow this sequence:
a.	An observation shall be made on or before November 5.
b.	The areas considered deficient shall be made known to the teacher in writing on or before December 15 using the Teacher Evaluation Summary.
c.	A conference shall be held between the teacher and the unit head for that purpose. At that conference, the components in which the teacher is deficient shall be discussed.
d.	A Monitored Assistance Plan (MAP) shall be prepared by February 1.
e.	The unit head, or a mutually agreed upon administrator assigned by the unit head, shall meet with the teacher on a continuing basis to assist the teacher.
54
Article 13: Teacher Evaluation
f.	Following preparation of the Monitored Assistance Plan, the unit head shall conduct one or more observations, prepare Observation Notes, and hold observation conference(s).
g.	After the Monitored Assistance Plan has been in effect a sufficient time for the teacher to have had an opportunity to improve, but no less than thirty (30) days, the unit head shall prepare a Teacher Evaluation Summary, hold an evaluation conference, and make a determination whether to place the teacher on probation. If the teacher is placed on probation, the teacher will have until February 1 of the following school year to correct the deficiencies before being subject to possible recommendation for termination for incompetency.
h.	If the teacher is placed on probation, a Monitored Assistance Plan shall be prepared prior to the end of the current school year for implementation the next school year.
D.	Probationary Teachers
1.	The procedures of this section apply to non-permanent teachers and teachers who have been placed on probation.
2.	The evaluator of a teacher on probation shall be that teacher’s unit head.
3.	Probationary teachers are evaluated using the following sequence:
a.	Teachers on probation shall be observed using the Notes of Observation form and an observation conference held:
on or before November 5;
on or before February 1; and on or before March 1.
b.	A Teacher Evaluation Summary shall be prepared and an evaluation conference held at least:
once by December 15, and, once by March 15.
c.	Classroom observations and evaluations shall be scheduled in advance with the teacher at least one school day in advance unless mutually agreed to the contrary. Additional classroom observations and evaluations beyond these minimums may be made at the discretion of the unit head and/or at the request of the teacher.
55
Article 13: Teacher Evaluation
d.	If necessary, a Monitored Assistance Plan will be prepared or revised.
e.	Following the second Teacher Evaluation Summary, probationary teachers other than non-permanent may be removed from probation, continued on probation, or recommended for termination.
f.	A teacher shall not be continued on probation for more than two consecutive years without just cause.
E.	Out of Cycle Evaluations
1.	After the procedures in A -11 of this article have been followed and there is documentation that the teacher’s performance has not improved, a teacher may be evaluated out of the normal evaluation cycle.
2.	The principal shall meet with the teacher and give the teacher the written reasons for the teacher to be placed into the evaluation cycle.
3.	If the evaluation process is initiated after November 5 of a school year, the principal shall follow Section B-3 of this article.
4.	If at the end of the school year, the teacher’s performance is documented to be successful, the teacher shall return to his/her regular three-year evaluation cycle.
5.	If at the end of the school year the teacher’s performance is documented to be unsatisfactory, then the teacher shall be placed in the evaluation process following Section C of this article for the following school year.
56
Article 14:	Teachers Hours and Conditions
A. Teacher Work Days
It is recognized that optimum school facilities for both student and teacher are desirable to ensure the high quality of education that is the goal of both the Association and the Board. It is also acknowledged that the primary duty and responsibility of the teacher is the education of the student. The organization of the school and the school day should be directed toward ensuring that the energy of the teacher is primarily utilized to this end:

2.	Amounts forfeited upon termination of employment because of the failure to meet the applicable vesting requirements shall not be reinstated or re-credited if an individual is subsequently rehired or reemployed by the school corporation. However, if the Board approves a leave of absence of an employee, such period of leave shall not result in forfeiture, provided the employee shall promptly return to employment following the expiration of the period of leave.

4.	If an employee retires or otherwise terminates employment before satisfaction of the requirements set forth in subsection B of this Article, the terminated employee’s 401(a) plan account shall be forfeited. The forfeited amounts shall not be returned to the school corporation. Instead, forfeited amounts shall be reallocated at the end of each plan year only among the then remaining separate 401(a) plan accounts in a manner similar to that used in initially determining the present value calculations and shall be determined by the Nyhart Company or its successor. Therefore, the 401(a) plan accounts of the following employees will not share in the reallocation of a forfeiture of a 401(a) plan account:
a.	Employees who forfeited their 401(a) plan accounts in the same year;
b.	Employees who previously forfeited their 401(a) plan accounts; and
c.	Employees who have attained the age of fifty-nine (59) and terminated employment in or before the year of the reallocated forfeiture.

D.	Future Adjustments
The parties agree that this Section, or any other provision of this Agreement, does not constitute an expectation of receiving the enumerated retirement benefits by any current employee, future employee, prospective employee or applicant beyond the expiration of this Agreement. Therefore, except as otherwise limited by applicable law, it is understood that the Board and Association may in the future bargain modifications of any kind to this provision, provided however, that the future revision of this Section shall not affect the retirement benefits of teachers already receiving benefits pursuant to this Section.
96

The Board shall deposit its annual contribution on or before July 10 of each year, based on employee deposits the prior fiscal year (July 1 - June 30). There will be no commingling of accounts and each employee may determine how his/her account shall be invested among the investment options made available by the investment vendor for the 401(a) Plan. The single investment vendor for the 401(a) plan shall be ISTA Financial Services Corporation.
C.	Each bargaining unit member is immediately vested in these individual 401(a) accounts upon signing his/her 6th contract with the Board. Forfeitures will be returned to the Board as an offset to future Board contributions.

Article 21: Professional Compensation
2005-2006 and 2006-2007 Salary Schedules
Salary Schedules for school years 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 shall be determined by the following formula, but shall increase a minimum of 1.5% for school year 2005-2006, and a minimum of 1.0% for school year 2006-2007:
Formula for 05-06 & 06-07
Base
Percent increase in total revenue in General Fund for calendar year 2006 (for 05-06) and 2007 (for 06-07). Increase equals difference between General Fund total revenue on Budget Forms 2 and 3, as adopted by the Board of School Trustees:
•	Percent increase in 2006 revenue (adjusted for any actual enrollment differences after board adoption and adjusted for items below) over 2005 revenue.
•	Percent increase in 2007 revenue (adjusted for any actual enrollment differences after board adoption) over 2006 revenue equals 06-07 increase. In addition, if the legislature adjusts any of the Base Adjustment items gradually, that should be considered in the same manner as in the 05-06 increase.
Base Adjustments
Three budget items were introduced for 2004 and 2005 that are not included in the General Fund Budget Forms 2 and 3. If these items continue through 2007 at the same level then no adjustment is necessary. If these items are removed or changed, then an adjustment is necessary. The adjustments are as follows:
1.	Remediation - For 2004 and 2005 remediation dollars were added beyond the normal funding formula. For 2005 that amount is $1,086,740. These dollars should be considered subtracted from our comparative total revenue so that those remediation programs can remain in affect.
2.	Teachers Retirement Fund (TRF) Reduction - For 2004 and 2005 the state decreased the rate that districts pay into the Teachers Retirement Fund. For FWCS that reduction created $791,700 of additional funds. It is possible that the rate will be reinstated to its former level and that General Fund will have to absorb this cost. These dollars should be considered subtracted from our comparative total revenue so that funds are available for this increased expenditure.
3.	Utilities & Insurance Funding in CPF - For 2004 and 2005 the legislature allowed districts to raise a rate in the CPF to pay for growing utilities and insurance. For 2005, FWCS expects to pay $3,434,498 from CPF that was formally paid from the General Fund. These dollars should be considered subtracted from our comparative total revenue so that funds are available for this increased expenditure.

Article 22: School Calendar
C.	Standard School Day Make-up Provisions

D.	Standard Schedule Emergency Closing of School
1.	In the event the Indiana Department of Education, in evaluating the factors submitted by the Board, does not determine the circumstances extraordinary to justify granting a waiver under IC 20-10.1-2-1 (d) subsection (i), then the days which shall be used to make-up the missed student days (time) due to emergency school closing shall be in priority order as follows:
a.	Last Day of the First Semester
