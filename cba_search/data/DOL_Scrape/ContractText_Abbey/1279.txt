Failure to initiate arbitration within the time limits stated herein shall mean acceptance of the Contractor's final answer in Step Two of the Grievance Procedure, provided the answer is timely and in writing to the International Union as required.
In the event either party should initiate arbitration, the Union and the Contractor shall mutually agree upon an impartial arbitrator within five (5) working days of the written request for arbitration. Subsequently, if the Union and the Contractor cannot agree on an arbitrator within five (5) working days, the American Arbitration Association shall be requested by either party to submit a list of arbitrators from which the arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the Union and the Contractor. In the event of failure to agree on such arbitrator, the Union and the Contractor shall strike off the names on the list that are not acceptable and shall indicate the order of preference of those remaining.
