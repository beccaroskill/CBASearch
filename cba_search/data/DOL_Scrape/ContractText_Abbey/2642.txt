ARTICLE 4.00 - ASSOCIATION RIGHTS
SECTION 4.01 - EXCLUSIVITY
Throughout this Agreement certain rights and functions are accorded and ascribed to the Association. These rights and functions are afforded to the Association as the legal representative for all employees covered under this Agreement. The rights and privileges afforded the Association as specifically enumerated in this Agreement shall not be granted to any competing labor organization or any minority organization seeking to represent employees represented by the Association except as otherwise provided in Sections 4.02 and 4.07.

The Association may use District buildings (including the civic auditorium at cost) for meetings in accordance with the following guidelines:
A.	For meetings that are intended to involve only members of the Association and/or the bargaining unit at a particular school and their invited guests, an Association representative shall notify the building principal or his/her designee at least two (2) days prior to said meeting so that conflicts in scheduling of said facility can be avoided. The building principal or designee shall not unreasonably deny an emergency request if the use of said facility does not conflict with other use of said facility. Such meetings may be held at times before or after the employee workday or during the lunch time.
B.	For meetings that are intended to include members of the Association or members of the bargaining unit from a number of different schools, an Association representative shall notify in writing the District business office at least one (1) week in advance of the meeting for the purpose of avoiding conflicts with the District's or building's calendar, provided that an emergency request to the District for the use of the building will not be denied if said use does not conflict with other use of said building. Such meetings may be held before or after the regular employee workday.
SECTION 4.03 - MEMBERSHIP COMMUNICATION
The District will make available bulletin board space in each school for the exclusive use of the Association to post notices of their activities and matters of organizational concern. Such bulletin board space shall ordinarily not be available to students and the public.
The Association will have the right to use intra District mail service and mailboxes (including electronic mail) for Association communication provided said use does not interfere with the operations of the District or require added costs for the District. An Association official shall be responsible for placing such notices in the mailboxes. Association use of these resources does not create an expectation of privacy for their use. The Association agrees to comply with any other limits placed on the District’s use of the resources identified in this section by the District’s provider or by legal authorities.
5
Only materials which relate to the Association's role as bargaining representative shall be placed on bulletin boards and/or distributed through the District mail. Such materials shall be on official Association letterhead or by-lined by the appropriate Association official issuing the communication and shall not contain anything of a partisan political nature. Status reports on legislation shall not be considered partisan political materials. A copy of all materials distributed pursuant to this provision will be provided to the Superintendent or his/her secretary. The Association, when distributing materials only at one building will provide a copy of the material to the principal of that building.
The Association may use regularly established District or building communication forums (intercoms, staff newsletters, staff bulletins, etc.) which are used to communicate with employees to inform members of Association business, such as meetings, deadlines or coming events.
The Association, in the exercise of the privileges granted herein, shall not violate any state or federal law.
Failure by the Association to abide by any of the provisions set forth herein shall be cause for the Superintendent to discuss the matter with the Association President. After such discussion any further abuse of this provision shall be cause for the District to cancel the Association's use of District mail service and/or bulletin board privileges.
SECTION 4.04 - AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION
When available for release, the Board or its agents shall furnish to the Association, at no cost to the Association, the District's official budget and other regularly prepared financial reports.

Minutes of public Board meetings shall be mailed to the Association.
SECTION 4.05 - PRESIDENT'S CONTRACT
The District agrees to release the Association President from his/her regular assignment on a full-time basis. Such release will be without loss of salary, tenure standing, salary advancement, or other rights accorded full-time employees, subject to the Association reimbursing the District the total cost of the President's salary and benefits. Reimbursement shall include such costs as salary, social security, industrial insurance, pension, health and welfare, and other related employer payroll items. Such reimbursement shall be paid monthly, in advance, upon receipt of a billing by the District.
The parties agree that the President's release is for the benefit of the school district, its students, employees and patrons, in that its purpose is to achieve harmonious labor relations and a cooperative effort between bargaining unit members and school district management. The Association President shall provide service to the District by submitting a written annual report to the Board, setting forth the manner in which activities undertaken during the release benefited the District, its students, its employees and its patrons.
The above provision is permissive and will be implemented at the Association's request and upon the Board's receipt of written notice prior to May 30 of any term.
At the discretion of the District and upon request of the Association with reasonable advance notice, the District may release employees in addition to the President for an extended and specified period of time to assist the Association and the President in efforts described above in paragraph 2. Compensation and reimbursement shall be handled in the same manner as described above for the Association President.
6
SECTION 4.06 - SUBCONTRACTING
In the event that the District is considering subcontracting work customarily performed by the District in its own facilities utilizing nonsupervisory employee positions which are and have been held by members of the bargaining unit represented by the Association, the Association shall be notified by the District at least thirty (30) days before any final decision is made.
SECTION 4.07 - ASSOCIATION DUES DEDUCTION AND AGENCY SHOP
A.	Association Dues Deduction
1.	Upon receipt of a written employee Dues Deduction Authorization form from an employee, as defined under the "Recognition" section, the District will make the appropriate payroll deduction as certified by the President of the Association and transmit the monthly dues as designated by the Association, provided that no additional authorization over what has been provided previously will be required of employees hired before the effective date of this Agreement. Any change in the annual rate of membership dues as determined by the Association will require notification to the payroll department no later than by September 1 of each year, such rate to be irrevocable for the term of one (1) year.
2.	Dues deduction authorization by an employee shall be on a form consistent with the "Association Dues Deduction" section.
3.	It is understood and agreed that this dues deduction system is only for the collection of dues, assessments, and agency shop fees, and shall not be used for the collection of any Association imposed fines or penalties; nor will it be used for the collection of initiation fees or any other Association charge, except for duly received authorizations for WEA/PAC or NEA/PAC deductions. Employees who no longer wish to be members of the Association shall provide written notice to the Association and to the District Human Resources Department between August 1 and September 21 of any school year.
4.	The dues deductions authorized by the above provisions shall be made in twelve (12) equal amounts from each paycheck beginning the pay period of September through the pay period in August of each year. Employees who commence employment after September or terminate employment before June shall have their deductions prorated at one-twelfth (1/12) of the total annual amount for each month the employee is employed.
5.	Nothing in this section is intended to affect the District's obligations under RCW 28A.405.400.
B.	Agency Shop
No employee will be required to join the Association; however, those employees who are not Association members will have deducted from their salaries a representation fee. The District is authorized to deduct the required amount from each monthly pay warrant. The amount of the representation fee will be determined by the Association and communicated to the Business Office in writing. The representation fee shall be regarded as fair compensation and reimbursement to the Association for fulfilling its legal obligation to represent all members of the bargaining unit.
In the event that the representation fee is regarded by an employee as a violation of his/her right to non-association, such bonafide objections will be resolved according to the provisions of RCW 41.59 and Chapter 391-95 WAC.
C.	Hold Harmless
The Association will indemnify, defend, and hold the District harmless against any claims made against and any suits instituted against the District on account of the dues deduction and/or
7
agency shop provisions of this Agreement. The District and Association will mutually agree as to selection of attorney. The Association agrees to refund to the employee any amount paid to it in error on account of the dues deduction authorization provision. If the Association or one of its agents is found to be in violation of any state, federal or other law, or the provisions of the preceding sections, the Association agrees to compensate the District for all legal fees incurred by the District in regard to such violation. The District agrees to notify the Association promptly in writing of any claim, demand, suit or other form of liability in regard to which it will seek to implement the provisions of this paragraph.
SECTION 4.08 - ASSOCIATION LEAVE
Upon written request of the Association, the District may grant employees a leave of absence for the purpose of conducting Association business. Such leaves will be consistent with the orderly conduct of the District's total educational program, and are subject to the approval of the Superintendent or his/her designee.
The Association will make reasonable efforts to use non-school time as much as possible. Except for unforeseen circumstances, requests for Association leave shall be made ten (10) days in advance.
Such leave will be with pay and benefits. The Association shall reimburse the District at the short term substitute pay rate for each Association leave day utilized. Reimbursement shall be paid upon receipt of a billing by the District.
Utilization of Association leave must be consistent with the terms and limitations of law.
SECTION 4.09 - LIMITATIONS
Rights of employees and the Association are limited to those set forth in this Agreement or provided by state or federal law.
8
ARTICLE 5.00 - EMPLOYEE RIGHTS
SECTION 5.01	- INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS
The District and the Association affirm their adherence to the principles of free choice and agree that the obligations of law related to non-discrimination will be met by the Association and District. Neither the District nor Association will engage in discrimination of any kind that infringes on the civil or human rights of employees. The District acknowledges the right of its employees to a private and personal life except as may be impacted by law.
SECTION 5.02	- RIGHT TO JOIN AND SUPPORT ASSOCIATION
Employees have the right to freely organize, join and support the Association for the purpose of engaging in collective bargaining. The District will not discriminate or take reprisals of any kind against any employee who exercises rights under this Agreement. The District will inform all those newly employed contracted certificated personnel at the time of their employment that the Association is their bargaining representative.
SECTION 5.03	- JUST CAUSE
A.	No employee shall be disciplined without just and sufficient cause. The specific grounds forming the basis for such disciplinary action will be made available to the employee in writing.
B.	The District is committed to a policy of progressive discipline. Any disciplinary action shall be appropriate to the behavior which precipitates such action.
C.	An employee shall be entitled upon request to have present Association representatives during any meeting to discuss or investigate matters that may result in disciplinary action against the employee. When such a request is made, the investigative meeting or disciplinary action will not be taken until the representatives have been given the opportunity to be present, provided the meeting is not delayed more than three (3) working days.
D.	Complaints against an employee by parents, students, or other nonschool personnel or employees covered by this Agreement will be promptly called to the attention of the employee except when the complaining party requests Confidentiality. Any complaint not called to the attention of the employee may not be used as the basis for any disciplinary action against the employee.
E.	No action shall be taken upon any complaint by a parent of a student directed toward an employee nor shall any notice thereof be included in said employee's personnel file unless such matter is reported within ten (10) days in writing to the employee concerned.
F.	Personnel actions that result in discharge, nonrenewal, or adverse effect against an employee's contract status are not subject to the Grievance Procedure.
G.	Letters of direction are not disciplinary in nature and will not be issued in response to findings of misconduct. The Association shall be sent copies of a letter of direction at the time it is issued to the employee.
H.	The District and Association acknowledge that there are times when it is appropriate to temporarily remove an employee from his or her regular assignment pending an investigation into alleged misconduct. This action shall not be considered disciplinary, shall be an administrative leave with pay and shall only be taken in situations when the employee’s continued presence in the workplace could threaten or endanger children, self or others, disrupt the educational or work environment, or interfere with an investigation. If administrative leave is anticipated to extend beyond the investigation period, the District shall first confer with the Association.
9
SECTION 5.04	- ACADEMIC FREEDOM
Education may be fostered and promoted in an atmosphere in which academic freedom for staff is encouraged and promoted, with due consideration to the rights of the students and community in connection therewith.
Teachers are entitled to academic freedom subject to accepted standards of professional responsibility. These responsibilities are defined as commitment to democratic tradition; a concern for the rights, welfare, growth and development of children, an insistence upon objective scholarship; and recognition of the maturity level of students. The rights herein must be exercised consistent with any prescribed course of study determined by the Board as allowed by law.
SECTION 5.05	- PERSONNEL FILES
Employees shall be permitted to inspect during normal District business hours the District's personnel files of the concerned employee kept with the school district. Inspection must take place in the presence of an authorized secretarial employee as designated by the District, except that no prearranged appointment will be necessary for such inspection to occur. Confidential letters of recommendation and other confidential records received prior to employment shall be destroyed or returned to the source. All materials placed in personnel files will have date of entry placed on them. Anyone, at the employee's request, may be present for this review.
Upon request, one (1) copy of any documents contained therein shall be afforded the employee at employee expense.
A copy of formal District generated written material concerning discipline or the final annual evaluation will be furnished the employee at the time it is placed in the District personnel file.
Letters of direction or such directives of a similar nature may be retained in the building administrator’s working file for up to one year and shall not be placed in the employee’s personnel file at any time.

ARTICLE 10.00 - EVALUATION PROCEDURES
SECTION 10.01 - INTRODUCTION TO THE EVALUATION PROCESS
The evaluation procedure set forth herein shall provide for a positive attitude to be maintained by all parties toward the development and improvement of the instructional program of the District. The evaluation procedure shall recognize various levels of performance and encourage improvement in specific, identifiable areas through the systematic assessment of the instructional program. It shall be understood by the parties that the purpose of this evaluation procedure is to improve the instructional program being offered by the District, as well as meet state requirements for the evaluation of certificated personnel.
SECTION 10.02 - EVALUATION
A.	Performance Evaluation Analysis
1.	Responsibility for Evaluation
Within each school the principal shall be responsible for the evaluation of employees assigned to that school. An employee assigned to more than one (1) school shall be evaluated by one (1) principal considering information provided by principals of each school. The administrative organization plan of the District shall be used to determine lines of responsibility for evaluation of any employee who is not regularly assigned to any school. Any principal or administrator may designate other administrators to assist in the observation and evaluation process. If an employee believes he/she cannot receive an objective evaluation from a designated administrator then he/she may make a written request before November 15 that an alternate evaluator be appointed. If the Association concurs with the request, and the employee has not been recommended for probation, the principal will then designate another individual to perform the evaluation which may include input from the principal.
2.	Evaluation Criteria
All employees shall be evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in the appropriate" Criteria for Analysis" section below (10.03 or 10.04). Evaluations required hereunder shall be documented on the appropriate evaluation report form attached hereto as Appendices 5B & 6.
3.	Required Evaluations
a.	All employees, including new employees, shall be evaluated annually, such evaluations to be completed no later than two (2) weeks prior to the last student day.
b.	If an employee is transferred to another position not under the administrator's jurisdiction, an evaluation may be made at the time of such transfer.
c.	If an employee resigns during the school year, a final evaluation shall be completed prior to the resignation date.
d.	If the administrator contemplates recommending that an employee be placed on probation, an evaluation shall be made on or before January 15.
e.	The evaluation of an employee shall be based upon the observations of the employee's performance as provided in paragraph B below together with such other sources of information as may be pertinent to the specific criteria, provided that when any evaluation is to be based upon information other than
55
observations and evaluator-employee contacts, the employee shall be informed (of the source and nature of such information) orally within ten (10) working days or in writing within fifteen (15) working days after such information came to the evaluator's attention.
f.	Evaluations may make suggestions or recommendations for changes and improvements in subsequent school years, however, evaluation judgments and conclusions shall be based on the employee’s performance during the school year in question.
g.	The judgments reflected in staff evaluations will be based on the professional performance of the employee (as reflected in the criteria for analysis in Sections 10.03 and 10.04) and not the standardized test or performance assessment scores of the students taught by that employee.
B.	Observations
1.	As early as possible in each school year, the building principal or other evaluator will hold a conference with each employee prior to any observations. During the conference the evaluator should ask about planning for instruction and discuss goals with the employee. The employee shall have the opportunity to suggest specific items to be observed. Specific items may include, but not be limited to, the appropriate "Criteria for Analysis".
2.	During each school year each employee (including new employees) shall be observed for the purpose of evaluation at least twice in the performance of his or her assigned duties. For those employees under contract by October 15 of each year, the first observation shall be no later than the end of the first semester. Total observation time for each employee shall be not less than sixty (60) minutes; at least one (1) observation shall be at least thirty (30) minutes in length. The first observation for new employees shall occur within the first ninety (90) calendar days of employment and shall be of at least thirty (30) minutes in length. The evaluator shall give at least three (3) work days prior notice of a required observation, such notice to specify the specific time or class period for the observation. If possible, the time for the observation shall be mutually worked out between the evaluator and employee.
3.	In addition to the observations required under paragraph B.2 above, the evaluator may make additional observations at any time during the school year.
4.	The supervisor or other designated evaluator shall promptly document each observation and shall provide the employee with a copy thereof within three (3) days after each report is prepared. A series of observations conducted within a period of twenty (20) working days may be considered to be a single observation for documentation purposes. A postobservation conference between the evaluator and employee shall be held if either person requests. The employee shall sign the school district's copy of the observation report to indicate that he/she has seen the report and has been given a copy thereof. The employee's signature on the observation report does not necessarily imply agreement with the contents thereof.
5.	In the event that any observation report indicates that the employee has performance deficiencies in one (1) or more areas defined in the evaluation criteria, the evaluator and the employee shall have a post-observation conference which shall include discussion of the deficient area(s) and recommendations for improvement.
6.	Observations shall be documented on the form attached hereto as Appendix 5A.
C.	Evaluation Documentation

3.	Following the completion of each evaluation report, a meeting shall be held between the evaluator and the employee to discuss the contents thereof, if either party so requests.
4.	The District's copy of each evaluation report shall be forwarded to the District Human Resources Department for filing in the employee's personnel file.

Paragraph 7 applies to any provisional employee with a provisional contract in his/her first (or if applicable second) year of employment with the District.

a.	The evaluation report prepared pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs A.3.d and C.1 above, and
b.	A recommended specific and reasonable program designed to assist the employee in improving his or her performance.

b.	During the probationary period the evaluator shall meet with the probationary employee at least twice monthly to supervise and make a written evaluation of the progress, if any, made by the employee.

a.	That the employee has demonstrated sufficient improvement in the stated areas of deficiency to justify the removal of the probationary status, or
b.	That the employee has demonstrated sufficient improvement in the stated areas of deficiency to justify the removal of the probationary status if accompanied by a letter identifying areas where further improvement is required; or

ARTICLE 11.00 - LAYOFF AND RECALL
SECTION 11.01 - PROCEDURE FOR STAFF REDUCTION
This Article shall govern staff reductions which may be required as a direct result of:
A.	Enrollment decline;
B.	Failure of a special levy election or other events resulting in a significant reduction in revenue;
C.	Termination or reduction of funding of categorically funded projects.
This Article shall have no application to and shall place no limitation upon the right of the District to discharge, nonrenew or adversely affect the contract status of employees for any reason other than those enumerated above.
It is not the intent that these procedures would be used to lay off any employee on the basis of job performance. If the conditions identified in A, B, and C above cause the District to adopt a reduced educational program, those employees who will be laid off or adversely affected in their contract status will be identified by using the procedures enumerated below.
1.	Determination of Vacant Position: The District shall determine, as accurately as possible, the total number of certificated staff known as of April 1 leaving the District for reason of retirement, family transfer, normal resignations, discharge or nonrenewal, etc. and these vacancies will be taken into consideration in determining the number of available certificated positions for the following school year.
2.	Certification: Possession of any valid Washington State Certificate which may be required for the position(s) under consideration shall be a prerequisite for retention.
3.	Notification to Association: In the event the Board anticipates a layoff of employees, it will notify the Association with a report stating that a reduction-in-force necessity exists. Said report shall include any such data, information, reports that are utilized by the Board in making the decision.
4.	Gifts and Categorical Funds: All received and anticipated voluntary gifts, contributions, donations, bequests, or pledges shall be identified to the Association. All such funds shall be placed in a special fund for operation expenditure as determined by the Board.
5.	Employment Categories: The following categories and specialties are established to ensure the qualifications of personnel to retained positions:
a.	Elementary employees will be considered for retention in one (1) category (K 5). (Elementary employees shall include classroom teachers, elementary teachers of the gifted, elementary reading specialists, elementary music teachers, elementary P.E. teachers, elementary counselors, and elementary librarians.) If any of the specialist positions listed above are reduced or eliminated due to a reduction of staff hereunder, thereby causing reassignment of some specialist personnel to regular classrooms or other positions, a specialist so reassigned shall have a preferential right to return to a position in his/her specialty when an opening or vacancy occurs, provided this preference right shall not exist if the opening or vacancy is to be filled during the school year after more than ten (10) days from the first student day of school.
b.	Except as provided in paragraph A.5.c middle and high school employees (6-12, including alternative education) will be considered for retention by teaching specialties such as science, math, social studies, language arts and reading, industrial arts, art, homemaking (including FEAST, child care, and Teen Family), business education, driver education, music, physical education and health, and individual foreign languages (e.g. French, Spanish, and German). Middle school
67
employees teaching more than one (1) of the subjects of language arts, reading, and social studies during three (3) or more periods to most but not necessarily all the same students in a "block" format will be grouped into a category called "block" assignment.
c.	Other nonsupervisory employees will be considered for retention according to their specialties which will include counselors (6-12), librarians (6-12), special education classroom teacher, ESL teacher, special education personnel (by fields of specialty such as: psychologist, social worker, speech/language pathologist, audiologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, teachers of the sensory impaired, nurses) and vocational employees (by field of specialty such as: auto body repair, automotive technology, horticulture, machine operator, carpentry, graphic arts).
6.	Retention in Employment Category: Each employee will, in accordance with the criteria set forth in paragraph 7 hereof, be considered for retention in category or specialty held at the time of the implementation of these procedures. For the purpose of this paragraph, an employee is currently performing in a given category or specialty if .4 FTE or more of such employee’s assignment is devoted to such category or specialty.
Employees shall also be considered for retention in such additional categories or specialties as any such employee may designate in writing to the Superintendent or his/her designee, provided that in order to qualify for consideration in any such additional category, the employee:
a.	Must have had a minimum of one (1) year professional experience, at .4 FTE, in each such additional category; and
b.	Such experience must have occurred during the immediately preceding ten (10) years.
In addition to the above, block teachers teaching at least five (5) block periods (i.e. five (5) periods in blocks of two (2) or more consecutive or nonconsecutive periods, in which blocks some combination of language arts, reading, and/or social studies is taught to most but not necessarily all the same students in a "block" format) may also qualify for consideration for retention in either, but not both, of the categories of language arts/reading and social studies. In order to qualify for consideration in such additional category, the employee must:
a.	Be currently teaching the equivalent of two (2) periods per day in such category; and
b.	Have a college major or an advanced degree reasonably matching such category. (Majors and advanced degrees that will be deemed to match the language arts/reading category, and majors and advanced degrees that will be deemed to match the social studies category are identified in Appendix 7.) Where the major(s) and advanced degree(s) match both the language arts/reading and social studies categories, the latest advanced degree shall control. Where there is a double major matching both the language arts/reading and social studies categories, the selection between language arts/reading and social studies shall be based on the highest number of credit hours; in the event of a tie, the category shall be that deemed most appropriate by the employee by written designation.
All written designations for consideration in additional categories shall be submitted in writing within twenty (20) working days after any request for such information is made by the Superintendent or his designee. A copy of all requests for consideration in additional categories will be provided by the District to the Association at the end of the twenty (20) working day period specified.
68
7.	Selection within Employment Categories: Employees shall be considered for retention in available positions within the categories or specialties for which they qualify under paragraph 5 and 6 hereof. In the event that there are more qualified employees than available positions in a given category or specialty the following criteria shall be used to determine which employees shall be recommended for retention:
a.	Placement on the District's K-12 salary schedule and excluding any supplemental contracts shall be the basis for retention for those categories and specialties identified in paragraph 5 above. Within each category or specialty the employee(s) having the higher salary shall be recommended for retention. In the event ties exist, total seniority as a certificated employee shall be the basis for retention, the senior employee(s) having preference. "Seniority" within the meaning of this provision shall mean years of certificated experience of the nature eligible for recognition by the District for salary purposes, regardless of whether actually recognized on the given salary schedule. If ties still exist, the employee(s) having the highest number of college or university credits beyond the BA degree as recorded in the District Human Resources Department by October 20 of the current school year shall have preference. In the event that more than one (1) individual employee has the same number of credits after applying the above provisions, all employees so affected shall participate in a drawing, by a lot, to determine position on the retention list.
b.	When it becomes apparent to the District Board of Directors that a reduction in force is necessitated the District will provide to the Association and all employees a list identifying the ranking of each employee within the specialties or categories identified in paragraph A.6 as allowed by the Right of Privacy Act. An employee believing his/her ranking is in error shall have the right to file a grievance under the grievance procedure contained in this Agreement. Notification of additions, deletions or corrections shall be provided within thirty (30) days of their determination.
c.	It is recognized that certificated employees of the District holding administrative positions and not included in the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement may be eligible, under appropriate Board policy and administrative procedures, for retention in one (1) or more of the employment categories. This provision shall apply only to certificated administrative employees who have prior service in a bargaining unit position and who have maintained a continuous employment relationship with the District since leaving said unit. Further, retention shall be on the same basis as for employees in the bargaining unit and will be consistent with the criteria for retention as contained in this Article.
8.	Action by Superintendent: The provisions of paragraphs 1 through 7 above shall be implemented on or before May 15 of the school year prior to the school year in which any staff reductions may be necessary. The Superintendent shall take such action as may be required by statute to nonrenew or adversely affect the employment contracts of affected employees. All employees so notified will have the option of seeking reinstatement through appeal procedures provided by law.
9	. Recall Procedures:
a.	These recall procedures govern the recall of employees laid off pursuant to this Article.
b.	Benefits. All benefits to which an employee was entitled at the time of his/her layoff, including unused accumulated sick leave and credits toward sabbatical eligibility, will be restored upon his/her return to active employment, and the employee will be placed on the proper step of the salary schedule for the employee's current position according to the employee's experience and education.
69
c.	Method of Recall. In the event that additional students enroll in the District or additional funds become available to the District, or vacancies occur as a result of retirement, resignation, or other cause, the Board shall first recall, according to categories or specialties identified in paragraph 5 above, all employees in the bargaining unit who have been laid off (nonrenewed) for economic or enrollment decline reasons before the Board employs or assigns any additional personnel to fill assignments within those categories or specialties. Employees with the highest ranking shall be recalled to available positions first. From among those persons in the employment pool, those who have entered said pool in the more recent year(s) shall have preference to vacancies, under the provisions herein, over those who entered said pool in an earlier year.
d.	Employment Pool. All employees who are not recommended for retention in accordance with these procedures and are laid off shall be placed in an employment pool for possible reemployment for a period from May of the reduction-in-force year to the third October 1 following. Employment pool personnel will be given the opportunity to fill open positions within the categories or specialties identified in paragraph 5 for which they qualified under paragraph 6. If more than one (1) employee is qualified for an open position, the criteria set forth in 7 shall be applied to determine who shall be offered such position, provided that each employee's qualifications under 7 shall be deemed the same as when the employee was selected for layoff.
i.	When a vacancy occurs for which person(s) in the employment pool qualify, notification from the School District will be by certified mail or personal delivery to said employee at his/her last known address. It shall be the responsibility of the individual to notify the District of any change of address. Such employee will have seven (7) calendar days from the receipt of the letter to accept the position. If an individual fails to accept a position offered, such individual will be dropped from the employment pool.
ii.	The District will provide employment pool personnel with the opportunity to be placed on the substitute call list. Employment pool personnel who accept placement on the call list will be utilized as substitutes on a first priority basis.
10. Seniority List: By January 20, 1984, and every third year thereafter, the District shall publish a complete seniority list ranking all employees in accordance with the seniority definition contained herein. For each employee, said list shall also identify the number of credits beyond the Bachelor's degree as recorded in the Human Resources Department by October 20 of the current school year. A copy of said seniority list shall be provided to the Association President.

The parties agree that it is desirable for problems to be resolved between the employee and his/her immediate supervisor, and nothing herein shall prevent an employee from taking up any claimed grievance with his/her immediate supervisor before formal filing of said grievance. The following procedure must be utilized to process a grievance. (Grievants and administrators are encouraged to use the appropriate grievance forms as set forth in Appendix 8.)
74
A.	Step One:
Within thirty (30) days of the date an alleged grievance is discovered or reasonably should have been discovered, the grievant must present the grievance in writing to the immediately involved administrator with a copy provided to the Superintendent or his/her representative. The administrator will arrange for a meeting to take place within ten (10) days after receipt of the grievance. Said administrator shall provide the grievant and the association with a written answer to the grievance together with the reasons for the decision within ten (10) days after the meeting.
B.	Step Two:
If the grievance is not settled at Step One, then the grievance may be referred in writing to the Superintendent or his/her representative within ten (10) days after the grievant's receipt of the administrator's answer at Step One. The written grievance shall give a clear and concise statement of the alleged grievance, including the facts on which the grievance is based, reference to the specific terms of the Agreement which have been violated, the issues involved and the relief sought. The Superintendent or his/her representative shall arrange for a hearing with the grievant to take place within ten (10) days of his/her receipt of the grievance. The parties shall have the right to include in the hearing such witnesses and counselors as they deem necessary to develop facts pertinent to the grievance. Each party shall pay for its witnesses. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the Superintendent or his/her representative will have ten (10) days to provide his/her written decision, together with the reasons for the decision to the Association and grievant.
C.	Step Three:
If the grievance is not settled at Step Two, the grievant may, within ten (10) days after receipt of the District's Step Two response to the grievance, request in writing that the Association submit his/her grievance to arbitration. The Association may by written notice to the Superintendent, within seven (7) days after receipt of the request from the aggrieved person, submit the grievance to binding arbitration. Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions which follow:
1.	Selection of Arbiter - By Agreement: In regard to each case that reaches arbitration, the parties will attempt to agree on an arbiter to hear and decide the particular case. If the parties are unable to agree to an arbiter within ten (10) days after submission of the written request for arbitration, the provisions of "2" (Selection of Arbiter-American Arbitration Association) shall apply to the selection of an arbiter.
2.	Selection of Arbiter - American Arbitration Association: In the event an arbiter is not agreed upon as provided in "1" above, the parties shall jointly request the American Arbitration Association to submit a panel of seven (7) arbiters.
Such request shall state the general nature of the case and ask that the nominees be qualified to handle the type of case involved. When notification of the names of the seven (7) arbiters is received, the parties shall each independently strike from the list those unacceptable arbiters and shall rank, in order of preference, the remaining arbiters. The parties shall then meet and compare lists. From among the mutually acceptable arbiters, the one (1) with the lowest combined preference number shall be the arbiter. In the event of a tie between two (2) or more arbiters, a single arbiter shall be chosen by lot. In the event there are no mutually acceptable arbiters on the panel, the parties, in turn, shall have the right to strike a name from the panel until only one (1) name remains. The remaining person shall be the arbiter. The right to strike the first name from the panel shall be determined by lot.
In the event either party is dissatisfied with the credentials of the arbiters whose names are on the first panel offered by the American Arbitration Association, such party can summarily reject that panel and insist on a second panel. Selection must be made from the second panel.

f.	The arbiter shall rule only on the basis of information presented in the hearing and shall refuse to receive any information after the hearing except when there is mutual agreement in the presence of both parties.
g.	Each party to the proceedings may call such witnesses as may be necessary in the order in which their testimony is to be heard.

ATTENDANCE INCENTIVE LAW AND WAC REGULATIONS
RCW 28A.400.210 Employee attendance incentive program—Remuneration or benefit plan for unused sick leave. Every school district board of directors may, in accordance with chapters 41.56 and 41.59 RCW, establish an attendance incentive program for all certificated and classified employees in the following manner, including covering persons who were employed during the 1982-'83 school year:
(1)	In January of the year following any year in which a minimum of sixty days of leave for illness or injury is accrued, and each January thereafter, any eligible employee may exercise an option to receive remuneration for unused leave for illness or injury accumulated in the previous year at a rate equal to one day's monetary compensation of the employee for each four full days of accrued leave for illness or injury in excess of sixty days. Leave for illness or injury for which compensation has been received shall be deducted from accrued leave for illness or injury at the rate of four days for every one day's monetary compensation. No employee may receive compensation under this section for any portion of leave for illness or injury accumulated at a rate in excess of one day per month.
(2)	Except as provided in RCW 28A.400.212, at the time of separation from school district employment an eligible employee or the employee's estate shall receive remuneration at a rate equal to one day's current monetary compensation of the employee for each four full days accrued leave for illness or injury. For purposes of this subsection, "eligible employee" means (a) employees who separate from employment due to retirement or death; (b) employees who separate from employment and who are at least age fifty-five and have at least ten years of service under the teachers' retirement system plan 3 as defined in RCW 41.32.010(40), or under the Washington school employees' retirement system plan 3 as defined in *RCW 41.35.010(31); or (c) employees who separate from employment and who are at least age fifty- five and have at least fifteen years of service under the teachers' retirement system plan 2 as defined in RCW 41.32.010(39), under the Washington school employees' retirement system plan 2 as defined in *RCW 41.35.010(30), or under the public employees' retirement system plan 2 as defined in RCW 41.40.010(34).
(3)	In lieu of remuneration for unused leave for illness or injury as provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, a school district board of directors may, with equivalent funds, provide eligible employees a benefit plan that provides reimbursement for medical expenses. Any benefit plan adopted after July 28, 1991, shall require, as a condition of participation under the plan, that the employee sign an agreement with the district to hold the district harmless should the United States government find that the district or the employee is in debt to the United States as a result of the employee not paying income taxes due on the equivalent funds placed into the plan, or as a result of the district not withholding or deducting any tax, assessment, or other payment on such funds as required under federal law.
Moneys or benefits received under this section shall not be included for the purposes of computing a retirement allowance under any public retirement system in this state.
The superintendent of public instruction in its administration hereof, shall promulgate uniform rules and regulations to carry out the purposes of this section.
Should the legislature revoke any benefits granted under this section, no affected employee shall be entitled thereafter to receive such benefits as a matter of contractual right.

This balance does not include any front end loaded or other days which may be posted for sick leave purpose but not earned for sick leave buy out purpose.
(2)	Commencing on January 31, 1984 and on the end of each month thereafter there shall be added to the accumulated sick leave balance of each employee for sick leave buy out purpose sick leave earned during that month.
(3)	Each employee whose sick leave balance for buy out purpose exceeds one hundred eighty days on midnight December 31, computed in accordance with the first paragraph of this section, shall lose days accumulated that are in excess of this maximum in January of each year if such employee fails to exercise the annual buy out option provided for in this chapter or if such employee's sick leave buy out balance exceeds this maximum for any other reason.
WAC 392-136-085 School districts--Previous payments in connection with excess accumulations of sick leave disregarded. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring or allowing, on account
of a previous accumulation of sick leave in excess of one hundred eighty days, the recovery of payments for either used or converted sick leave made during the period of June 13, 1980, through July 23, 1983, to any school district employee who had been allowed by his or her school district of employment to accumulate an unused sick leave balance in excess of one hundred eighty days.
