1.	Highmark Blue Cross/Blue Shield shall continue as the single health insurance carrier at least through calendar year 2005.
2.	Addressing whether to continue "fully-insured Highmark BC/BS coverage" or to convert to "self-insured Highmark BC/BS coverage" [i.e., an Administrative Services Contract (ASC) with Highmark]:
a.	The PFT agrees either to continue "fully-insured Highmark BC/BS coverage" or to convert to "self-insured Highmark BC/BS coverage," whichever the School District determines, following negotiations with Highmark by the School District with the participation of the PFT.
b.	In the event of a changeover from "fully-insured Highmark coverage" to "selfinsured Highmark coverage," the parties (PFT and PPS) agree that the total dollar and/or percentage share of premiums for the various coverages in all three (3) Highmark Health Care Plans (HMO, POS, and PPO) that will be paid by teachers/professionals following such a changeover shall be equivalent to the dollar and/or percentage amounts which are paid by teachers/professionals under "fully-insured Highmark coverage." This agreement includes the formulae which apply to the year-to-year sharing of premium increases (or decreases) between the School District and the insurees.
c.	The parties (PFT and PPS) agree that for any conversion to self-insured health care coverage (ASC) with Highmark that takes effect for the start of calendar year 2004 or at any point during calendar year 2004, the teacher/professional employee contribution amounts toward each of the three (3) Highmark Health Care Plans (HMO, POS, and PPO) for the entire 2004 calendar year under such a newly-adopted ASC will be the exact same employee contribution amounts that would have applied under fully-insured Highmark health care coverage for calendar year 2004.
3.	Under all three (3) Highmark BC/BS Plans, change the prescription drugs copayments to $10 generic, $20 formulary brand, and $40 name brand, commencing January 2004. [Ability to purchase 90-day supply of maintenance prescription drugs by mail order or through participating retail outlets shall continue in effect, with these new $10, $20, $40 co-pays applying commencing January 1, 2004.]
Note: Apply these new prescription drugs co-pays to all three (3) Agreements.
4.	Effective January 1, 2004, employee to pay generic prescription drug co-pay plus difference between brand prescription drug cost and generic prescription drug cost, only when brand drug is purchased instead of available generic drug which has FDA approval as a generic substitute and regardless of whether brand drug is prescribed or chosen.
Note: Apply this change to all three (3) Agreements.

b.	$20 per month (for 10 months), i.e., $200 per year, for enrollees in the various family coverages HMO Plans.
c.	These special HMO Plan payment provisions shall apply only to the Teachers/Professionals Agreement and shall terminate beginning with the month of December 2004.
8.	Commencing with December 2004, apply the 20% share of premium increases formula (already in effect for the POS Plan) to the HMO Plan for teachers and professional employees, using calendar year 2004 as the base year.
9.	Paraprofessionals shall contribute 3/4% of their base wages (salary or hourly rate) as their share of premium payments for individual HMO Plan coverage and 1% of their base wages (salary or hourly rate) as their share of premium payments for the various family HMO Plan coverages, commencing with payments in December 2003 for coverage in calendar year 2004 and thereafter.
10.

12.	Continuing BC/BS Health Care Plans Enrollment Provisions Applying to Teachers/Professionals Agreement
a.	Article 137, Section 4.e.
New teacher/professional hirees shall continue only to be able to enroll in either the HMO or the POS Plans.

Articles 137,138,139 — Three (3) Health Care Coverage Articles (continued)
b.	Article 137, Section 5.d.
Teacher/professional employees not covered by Article 140, Teacher-Retiree Group Health Care and Medicare-Supplement Program, and who were not enrolled in the PPO Plan prior to calendar year 2001 shall continue to be able to enroll only in the HMO Plan or POS Plan. This stipulation continues to apply to such teachers/professionals during any annual open enrollment period.
13.	BC/BS Health Care Plans Payment Provisions Applying to Teachers Not Covered by Article 140; Article 137, Section 5, and Article 139, Section 3
Teachers in the teacher/professional unit who are not covered by Article 140, Teacher-Retiree Group Health Care and Medicare-Supplement Program, shall continue to pay the same contribution levels and rates toward their Health Care Plans participation as apply to personnel in the Federation's two (2) other Pittsburgh School District representation units (i.e., the paraprofessional unit and the technical-clerical unit).
a.	Such teachers (those not covered by Article 140) shall contribute 3/4% of their base wages (salary or hourly rate) as their share of premium payments for individual HMO Plan coverage and 1% of their base wages (salary or hourly rate) as their share of premium payments for the various family HMO Plan coverages, commencing with payments in December 2003 for coverage in calendar year 2004 and thereafter.
b.	Such teachers (those not covered by Article 140) who are already enrolled (during calendar year 2003) in the POS or PPO Plans and who elect to continue in whichever of these two (2) Plans they are currently enrolled may continue to do so on the following bases:

Articles 137,138,139 — Three (3) Health Care Coverage Articles (continued)
14.	Consideration of "domestic partner" health care coverage provision for Teachers/Professionals Agreement:
Such domestic partner health care coverage, if implemented, would permit teacher/professional employee, where a permanent domestic partner relationship has been established, to acquire domestic partner health care coverage. Such coverage would require the employee to pay the entire difference between the cost of his/her individual health care coverage and the cost of coverage applying to two adults under spousal health care coverage. The parties, PFT and PPS, will examine this provision for possible implementation no later than for calendar year 2005.
15.	Make any necessary changes and updatings in Articles 137,138, and 139.
Article 140 - Teacher-Retiree Group Health Care and Medicare-Supplement Program
Make any necessary updatings.
Important Notes Involving Health Care Coverage Provisions
1.	Highmark BC/BS remains the exclusive carrier for health care insurance, with all three (3) Plans --- HMO, POS, and PPO --- continuing fully.
2.	New co-pays comply with standard BC/BS co-pays for the Pittsburgh Area.
3.	Purchase of maintenance prescription drugs by mail order or through participating retail outlets will continue to be available on a 90-day-supply basis, with the new $10, $20, $40 co-pays applying.
4.	While various co-pays are increased commencing January 2004 (to adjust to current standard co-pays), all deductibles under all three (3) Highmark BC/BS Plans remain unchanged throughout the term of the Two-Year Teachers/Professionals Agreement.
5.	All employee premium payments continue to be made with pre-tax dollars. [See Article 139, Section 6, and Article 142 in Teachers/Professionals Agreement.]
6.	Through direct negotiations with Highmark BC/BS by the PFT, Highmark BC/BS reduced its initially proposed 2004 composite rate increase for the HMO Plan from 54.66% to no more than 42.25%, in recognition of continued exclusivity as health care carrier for both 2004 and 2005 and because of changes agreed to by the parties (PFT and PPS) in the structure of the HMO Plan. Highmark also reduced its proposed 2004 composite rate increases for the POS Plan and the PPO Plan.

Lenqth-of-Contractual-Workdav/Contractual-Workweek Provisions for Teachers, Commencing 2004-05 School Year (continued)
The following are additional provisions and agreements relating to the changes in the contractual workday/contractual workweek for teachers which takes effect at the start of the 2004-05 school year:
1.	The additional time at the three (3) school levels may be assigned as follows:
a.	To add instructional time to class periods
b.	To utilize in homeroom periods
c.	To adjust time between periods, i.e., change of class times. [Utilization for this purpose would not qualify as additional instructional minutes in terms of the state's mandated 990 instructional hours annually (high schools and middle schools) and mandated 900 instructional hours annually (elementary schools).]
d.	Any combination of the above.
2.	The parties (PFT and School District) agree as follows:
a.	Neither party (PFT or School District) will advance as an issue in the negotiations for a successor Agreement to the 2003-2005 Two-Year Teachers/Professionals Agreement either the length of the contractual workday at the three (3) school levels or the length of the 45-minute lunch period for elementary teachers.
b.	The additional instructional time at the high school and middle school levels will bring the School District into clear compliance with the state's annual-instructional-hours mandates.
c.	The PFT agrees that shifts may continue to be utilized at schools in order to provide further instructional periods and/or instructional time for students.
d.	Six-day rotation of schedules may continue to be utilized and/or expanded, particularly in elementary schools, to improve the availability and flexibility of instructional time for students.
e.	The School District may also utilize the provisions of Article 114, Extended Teaching Day Differential, to cover a class period that a teacher agrees to teach beyond the contractual teacher workday.

Mandatory, Pro-Rata-Paid, Professional Development Day for Teachers/Professionals during 2004-05 School Year
1.	On a trial basis for one (1) school year, a mandatory, pro-rata-paid, professional development day for teachers/professionals will be scheduled during the 2004-05 school year.
2.	Teachers and other professionals will be paid a full day's pay at their pro-rata rate of pay for their participation in this mandatory professional development day.
3.	This full day's pro-rata pay will be separate and additional to the participating professional employee's regular annual salary.
4.	During the one (1) school year trial period (2004-05 school year), all teachers/professionals will be scheduled for this professional development day. In subsequent school years, this mandatory, pro-rata-paid, professional development day may be continued at the discretion of the School District. Such continuation shall be in accordance with the same provisions as applied during the 2004-05 trial school year.
5.	Mandatory means that if a teacher/professional employee is unable to attend this specific professional development day, he/she shall not be paid for that day — irrespective of the reason or the cause for absence. This is an extra, pro-rata-paid day, which is additional to the regular workyear and which is paid additional to the regular annual salary. This extra workday is a day on which there is no paid absence — for illness, personal leave, or any other reason.

Conversion of One fl) Open House/Parent Conference Dav (in Second Semester) to a Professional Development Dav
1.	Beginning in the second semester of the 2003-04 school year (i.e., in March of 2004), the scheduled open house/parent conference day will be changed to a professional development day.
a.	Monday, March 15, 2004, for elementary schools
b.	Monday, March 22, 2004, for senior high schools and middle schools
2.	Continuing in the 2004-05 school year and in subsequent school years, there shall be one (1) open house/parent conference day per school year, during the first semester.
3.	The professional development day designated in Section 1. above shall continue to be part of the school calendar/workyear in the 2004-05 school year and in subsequent school years, but it may be scheduled in the first semester.
Article 24 - Schedule for Closing Days of School in Senior High Schools
Starting in June of 2004, the final student day in high schools [which now occurs immediately preceding the two (2) closing non-instructional/clerical days] shall be moved to a full student day immediately preceding the two (2) scheduled final examination days.
1.	The purpose of this change is to have this day be a full instructional day rather than a book-return day.
2.	This calendar change in high schools at the close of the school year is consistent with the crediting of a full instructional day toward the state's 990 annual-instructional-hours requirement for high schools.
3.	The parties agree that both end-of-the-school-year non-instructional/clerical days will allocate the maximum available time to teachers — in order for teachers to finish the correction of final examinations and to complete final grades.

Article 42 — Coaching Vacancies
1.	Introductory paragraph for Article 42 and Sections 1., 3., 4., 5., and 6. remain unchanged.
2.	Additions to Section 2.
Section 2. Current paragraph remains unchanged. Add the following two Subsections to Section 2:
a.	If no qualified candidate is available from within the bargaining unit, the vacant coaching position will be open to a qualified applicant not employed by the School District.
b.	When a qualified, non-employee coach has been hired from outside the School District to fill a coaching position, pursuant to Section 2.a. above, he/she shall be able to continue in the coaching position in succeeding school years so long as his/her service in the coaching position is satisfactory. Should such a coach subsequently leave coaching employment or be terminated, that coaching position shall again be internally posted citywide as a vacant coaching position.
Compilation of Internal Hiring List to Fill Coaching Vacancies
1.	The parties agree to develop a list of teachers system-wide who are available to fill coaching vacancies. Compilation of this list will be completed by the end of May 2004. The purpose of this list is to take full advantage of the fact that coaching vacancies are already posted citywide and may be filled by any qualified and available teacher. The list will enable the School District to know who the qualified and available coaching candidates are, from across the school system, when coaching vacancies are being filled.
2.	The 2004-05 school year will be a trial year to test how the new citywide list works in terms of enabling coaching vacancies to be filled effectively by qualified applicants from within the school system.
