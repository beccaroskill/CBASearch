MASTER CONTRACT
This Agreement, made and entered into this 1st day of December? 2018 by and between Teamster Local 627, Laborers’ Local 165, Carpenters’ Local 237, and Painters’ District Council 30/Local 157 (hereinafter referred to individually and collectively as “the Union”) and the City of Peoria (hereinafter “the City”). In order to facilitate collective bargaining and to achieve stability of wage rates and working conditions, the parties’ desire this to be a multi-union agreement established for the classes of employees referred to in Appendix A (Wages) herein. The parties recognize that each Union retains its status as exclusive representative of the employees for whom it is recognized by the City as bargaining agent. Neither Union has the authority to bind the other nor shall one be held liable for the acts of the other.
PREAMBLE
WHEREAS, the City and Union have endorsed the practices and procedures of collective bargaining as a fair and orderly way of conducting their relations with one another; and
WHEREAS, it is the intent and purpose of the parties to set forth herein their agreement covering rates of pay, hours of work, and other conditions of employment; and to provide a procedure for the equitable and peaceful resolution of differences;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements herein contained, the parties do mutually promise and agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1 RECOGNITION
The City voluntarily agrees to continue its recognition of the Union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining representative of the employees listed in Appendix A (Wages) pursuant to the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act.
ARTICLE 2 UNION RIGHTS
SECTION 2.1 - UNION SECURITY: The City agrees to continue to deduct the dues, assessments and initiation fees for the Union upon the receipt of a written and signed authorization form from any employee. Such money deducted shall be remitted to the official designated by the Union for receipt of such funds in accordance with the current practice. The Union shall advise the City in writing of any change in the amount to be deducted at least fifteen (15) days prior to the effective date of the change. No deduction shall be made which is prohibited by applicable law or which is not affirmatively consented by the employee.
SECTION 2.2	- UNION INDEMNIFICATION: The Union shall indemnify, defend, and save the City harmless against all claims, demands, suits, or other forms of liability and for all reasonable legal costs that shall rise out of or by reason of action taken or not taken by the City in properly complying with the provisions of this article. The City will promptly notify the Union of all such charges received by the City. The parties shall mutually agree upon legal representation.
Should the City make an error in the Union’s favor of any deductions, the Union agrees to refund to the City within fifteen (15) days.
SECTION 2.3	- UNION ACCESS: Union business agents shall have reasonable access to the premises and work sites of the City in order to meet with represented employees or to help resolve a dispute or problem. The Union will notify a member of management prior to a work site visit and the visit shall not disturb the work of employee(s) on duty. Notification of management will not be necessary for safety sensitive issues.
SECTION 2.4	- UNION MEETINGS ON PREMISES: The Employer agrees to make available conference and meeting rooms for Union meetings upon prior notification by the designated Union representative, unless to do so would seriously interfere with the operating needs of the Employer, or cause undue inconvenience to the Employer.
SECTION 2.5	- PERSONNEL RECORDS: The Employer and the Union agree to abide by the Employee Access to Personnel Records Act during the term of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section can be the basis of a Grievance under this Agreement, if the same or similar facts are also in dispute or at issue in a pending claim filed by the same employee at the Illinois Department of Labor.
ARTICLE 3
MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
Except as specifically restricted by the express language of this Agreement and Letters of Understanding, the City retains the exclusive right to manage and to direct the work force pursuant to its legal responsibilities in the manner it determines to be in the best interests of its citizens.
SECTION 3.1	- RIGHTS RESIDING WITH MANAGEMENT: Except as amended, changed or modified by the Agreement and side letters, the Employer retains the exclusive right to manage its operations, determine its policies, budget and operations, the manner of exercise of its statutory functions and the direction of its working forces, including, but not limited: the right to hire, evaluate, allocate, and assign employees subject to the seniority provisions of this agreement; to discipline, suspend and discharge for just cause; to relieve employees from duty because of lack of work; to make and enforce reasonable rules of conduct and regulations (upon prior notice and discussion, if requested by the union); to determine the departments, divisions and sections and work to be performed therein; to introduce new methods of operations and to eliminate work; and to maintain efficiency.
SECTION 3.2	- STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS: Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to modify, eliminate or detract from the statutory responsibilities and obligations of the Employer except that the exercise of its rights in the furtherance of such statutory obligations shall not be in conflict with the provisions of this Agreement. The parties understand that, in the event there is a direct conflict between a statutory obligation and an explicit provision of this Agreement, the statute will govern.
2
ARTICLE 4
NON DISCRIMINATION
SECTION 4.1	- PROHIBITION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION: Both the Employer and the Union agree not to discriminate against any employee based on the protected class status of race, sex, religion, mental and/or physical disability, or any other form of discrimination prohibited by applicable federal, state, and local laws. The Parties also agree to work cooperatively to provide reasonable accommodations for disabled employees to the extent required by law. This Section 4.1 cannot be the sole basis of a Grievance, but it can be an issue in dispute in a hearing relative to the application of a different section of this agreement.
SECTION4.2-E	QUAL EMPLOYMENT/AFFIRMATIVE ACTION: The parties recognize the Employer’s obligation to comply with Federal and State Equal Employment and Affirmative Action Laws. Upon written request, the Union(s) agree(s) to provide the City with a copy of its current EEO-3 Local Union report.
SECTION 4.3	- GENDER CLAUSE: The use of the masculine pronoun throughout this Agreement has been adopted by the parties for clerical convenience and shall in all instances include the feminine gender as well as the masculine.
SECTION 4.4	- EMPLOYMENT PRACTICE: Family members shall not be employed in positions which could be considered a conflict of interest, such as positions in supervision or positions with access to confidential information. The head of the department may reassign persons to avoid such conflicts to the extent permitted by law. For this purpose, a member of a family is defined as a mother, father, brother, sister, husband, wife, civil union partner, son, daughter, mothers and fathers-in-law, son or daughter-in-law, step-children, grandparents, and any person living in the household of a covered employee.
ARTICLE 5
GRIEVANCE
SECTION 5.1 - DEFINITION: A grievance, for purposes of this Article, is a claim that the City has violated this Agreement regarding the interpretation or application of any of the terms of this Agreement affecting employees or unions covered by this Agreement. An individual employee, a group of employees or the Union may institute a grievance. All parties shall make a good faith effort to resolve grievances informally.
SECTION 5.2	- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE: The following is set forth as an orderly procedure for resolving all grievances:
Oral Discussion: If an individual employee, a group of employees, or the Union shall have a grievance against the City, it shall first be taken up in oral discussion with the supervisor involved, the steward and the aggrieved employee within ten (10) regular working days of the knowledge of an alleged violation. If a group of employees is involved, one (1) employee from that group shall participate in the oral discussion.
The discussion shall take place as soon as practical, and no later than five (5) regular working days from the request for oral discussion, to expedite disposition. The supervisor shall
3
provide his verbal disposition at the conclusion of the discussion if the disposition has been made; and if not provided then, he shall provide his written disposition within the two (2) regular working days following the discussion.
Step 1. In the event that the grievance is not resolved through oral discussion, the aggrieved party through his/her shop steward shall deliver a written statement of the grievance to his/her manager within ten (10) regular working days of the oral discussion response. The grievance shall state the facts, date, cite specific sections of the contract that have been alleged to be violated, and the specific remedy(s) requested. A diligent effort shall be made to adjust the grievance at this step. A First Step grievance meeting shall be scheduled within five (5) regular working days of the manager’s receipt of the written grievance. The grievant, shop steward, supervisor involved and the manager shall attend this meeting. The manager shall have ten (10) regular working days to give his or her written answer and a brief explanation of his/her reasons to the shop steward who presented the grievance and the grievant. Grievances not raised within the 10 ten regular working day time limit from date of occurrence will be dropped. Once the grievance has completed Step 1 of the grievance procedure, it cannot be modified beyond this Step in terms of the facts, specific violations and remedy requested unless new or additional material facts are discovered regarding the events of this grievance which were not known at the time of filing of the grievance and are necessary to modify the grievance.
Step 2. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step 1, the grievance shall be appealed by the Union business representative to the Department Head within ten (10) regular working days after receipt of the Step 1 answer. The written grievance shall state the facts involved in the grievance and the contract provisions allegedly violated by the City. A Second Step grievance meeting shall be scheduled within ten (10) regular working days of receipt of the written grievance appeal by the Department Head, subject to the availability of all parties. The Second Step meeting shall be attended by the Union business representative or his designee, the shop steward, the grievant, the Department Head, manager and supervisor involved. The City Labor Relations Manager may also attend this meeting. The Department Head shall give his/her written answer and a brief explanation of his/her reasons to the Union business representative within ten (10) regular working days after the Second Step grievance meeting.
Step 3. If the written grievance as submitted in Step 2 has not been satisfactorily settled, it shall be appealed in writing by the Union’s business representative to the Human Resources Director. The writing referring the grievance to the Human Resources Director shall state in what respects the Step 2 answer is inconsistent with this Agreement. Such submission shall be made within ten (10) regular working days after the receipt of the answer in Step 2. A Third Step hearing shall be scheduled within ten (10) working days of receipt of the written appeal by the Human Resources Director, subject to the availability of the parties. The Third Step hearing shall be attended by the Union business representative, the shop steward, the Human Resources Director, the Labor Relations Manager, the Department Head, and the manager. The Human Resources Director shall submit an answer with a brief explanation of his reasons to the Union business representative within ten (10) regular working days after the close of the hearing.
Step 4. If the written grievance has not been satisfactorily settled by the operation of the grievance procedure as outlines hereinabove, the Union shall have the right, upon notification to the City, in writing, within fifteen (15) regular working days after the answer is given in Step 3, to
4
submit the grievance to arbitration. The parties will make a sincere effort to mutually agree upon an arbitrator within five (5) regular working days after the notice is received. If the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator, the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service will be requested to supply a list of seven (7) arbitrators, from which list each party alternately shall strike one name. However, either party may reject the first list submitted in its entirety and request a second list. The Union shall strike first. On alternate arbitration cases when it is necessary to select an arbitrator in this manner, the City shall strike first. The parties shall continue striking names until only one remains on the list and that person shall be the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be designated to hear the grievance, and his decision shall be final and binding. The arbitrator, however, shall not have the right to change, add to or subtract from the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The fee and expenses of the arbitrator, shall be borne equally by the City and the Union provided, however, the fees and expenses of witnesses including experts, court reporters, cost of the hearing room (if off site), the cost of documentary evidence, and matters of that nature shall in all cases be borne by the party procuring the same if only one party requests that resource.
SECTION 5.3	- INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSION: The City will cooperate with the Union in the investigation of any grievance provided that grievances when investigated or discussed during the employees’ regular work day will not disturb the employees’ work duty and provided the supervisor has granted prior approval for the meeting if it occurs during working time.
SECTION 5.4	- ADVANCED GRIEVANCE STEP FILING: Certain issues which by nature are not capable of being settled at a preliminary step of the grievance procedure, may be advanced to the appropriate step where the action giving rise to the grievance was initiated by mutual agreement.
SECTION 5.5	- EFFECT OF SETTLEMENTS: A grievance may be withdrawn or settled at any step without creating a precedent.
SECTION 5.6	- PERTINENT WITNESSES AND INFORMATION: In the interest of early settlement of disputes, both parties agree to provide directly applicable documents, and witnesses, reasonably available to them which are pertinent to the grievance under consideration.
SECTION 5.7	- EXCLUSIVITY OF GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE: The procedures set forth in this Article shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for resolving contract disputes. Individuals have legal rights that may coexist with topics within this Agreement. The rights of such individuals are not limited or in any manner abridged by the operation of this Section except as provided in Article 4, Section 4.1
SECTION 5.8 - TIME LIMITS: In order to further expedite the settlement of grievances, time limitations have been agreed upon. Except with respect to the time limits in the Oral Discussion stage of the grievance procedure, if there is no timely response from either party within time limitations stated in Steps 1, 2, and/or 3, of the grievance procedure (or an agreement upon extension; email is fine) the grievance will progress to the next step in the grievance procedure., Extensions may be granted under the following provisions:
5
a.	when the representatives of either party are not available, or
b.	when mutually agreed upon in writing by both parties (email is sufficient).
ARTICLE 6
NO STRIKE AND NO LOCKOUT
SECTION 6.1	- NO INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE: The Union and the employees covered by this Agreement recognize and agree that the rendering of services to the community cannot, under any circumstances or conditions, be withheld, interrupted, or discontinued. Therefore, during the term of this Agreement, neither the Union nor its agents nor any employee, for any reason, will authorize, institute, aid, condone, or engage in any slow down, (a concerted effort to systematically delay or diminish services to the City), work stoppage, or strike (including sympathy strike), by bargaining unit employees. During the term of this Agreement, neither the Employer nor its agents for any reason shall authorize, institute, aid, engage in or promote any lockout of employees covered by this Agreement.
SECTION 6.2 - UNION RESPONSIBILITY: In the event of a violation of Section 6.1 of this Article, the Union agrees to notify all bargaining unit members and representatives of their obligation and responsibility for maintaining compliance with this Article, including their responsibility to remain at, or return to, work during any interruption which may be caused or initiated by others, and to encourage employees violating Section 6.1 to return to work.
SECTION 6.3	- PENALTY: The Employer may move to discharge or discipline any employee who violates Section 6.1. The Union agrees that the City has the right to deal with any such strike activity by the above measures, including suspension without pay on any, some or all of the employees participating therein, depending on the individual facts of each alleged violation.
SECTION 6.4	- MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY: Nothing contained herein shall preclude the employer from obtaining judicial restraint and damages in the event of a violation of this Article.
SECTION 6.5 - PICKET LINES: It shall not be a violation of this Agreement if an employee refuses to pass through legally established primary picket lines. However, the City and its employees have a responsibility towards assuring both public safety and property protection. If a bonafide emergency exists, an employee will not unreasonably refuse to cross a picket line. The City shall notify the Union of its actions when ordering an employee to cross a picket line in compliance with this Section (email is sufficient).
ARTICLE 7
LABOR MANAGEMENT RELATIONS
SECTION 7.1	- AGREEMENTS: All formal negotiations or bargaining with respect to the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be conducted by authorized representatives of the Union and authorized representatives of the City. Agreements reached as a result of such negotiations shall become effective only when signed by the authorized representatives of the parties and ratified by the City Council.
6
SECTION 7.2	- COMMITTEE: There shall be labor/management meetings for the areas of discussion set forth below. Such meetings generally shall be held quarterly, unless mutually agreed otherwise.
The committee shall be composed of up to five (5) bargaining unit representatives and five (5) City management personnel. In addition, the business representatives of each union, the Public Works Director and City Labor Relations Manager may also attend. The selection of bargaining unit representatives shall be done by the unions. The selection of management personnel shall be done by the City.
The purpose of the meetings is to deal with matters of general concerns to members of the organization as opposed to individual complaints of employees. Accordingly, the committee will not discuss grievances which are properly the subject of the procedure outlined in Article 5. Areas of discussion shall include:
1.	Disseminate general information of interest to the parties.
2.	Give representatives an opportunity to express their views, or to make suggestions on subjects of interest to employees of the bargaining units.
3.	Notify the Union of changes in non bargainable conditions of employment
contemplated by the Employer, which may affect employees in the bargaining unit.
The Union representatives shall be released from work with pay to attend Labor/Management Committee meetings that are scheduled during their normal hours of work. In no event shall the total lost time pay for union representatives’ attendance at these meetings exceed ten (10) hours pay for each meeting. The Union co-chairperson of the committee shall provide the names of the bargaining unit personnel to attend such meeting to the City co-chairperson of the committee at least one (1) work day prior to the meeting.
SECTION 7.3 - MEETINGS: Quarterly meetings will be scheduled at the beginning of the calendar year by the City and the City will provide notice of the schedule to all four (4) collective unit representatives and their business representatives. At least one (1) calendar week prior to scheduled meeting, all four (4) bargaining unit representatives and/or their business representatives should submit topics for the meeting agenda to the Public Works Director or his designee. In addition, at least one week prior to the scheduled meeting, all four (4) bargaining unit representatives and/or their business representatives should identify who will be attending the meeting on their behalf.
If there are no agenda items proposed by any of the four (4) bargaining unit representatives and/or their business representatives at least one (1) week prior to the scheduled meeting and the City has no agenda items to discuss, all parties will be notified by the Public Works Director or his designee that the meeting is not necessary due to lack of agenda items.
7
ARTICLES DRUG & ALCOHOL POLICY/FITNESS FOR DUTY
SECTION 8.1 - DRUG AND ALCOHOL FREE WORK PLACE: It is the policy and commitment of the City of Peoria and the named labor unions to provide an environment within the work place which is free from prohibited drugs and alcohol in order to protect the employees as well as the health and safety of the public. The City recognizes that alcohol and drug abuse is considered by many to be an illness and encourages its employees to voluntarily utilize the City’s employee assistance program before such abuse affects the employee’s job performance. It is specifically agreed that no employee shall be disciplined or the subject of adverse employment action for the first instance where the employee notifies the employer that he has a problem with drug or alcohol use, and voluntarily seeks assistance prior to initiation of an investigation of suspected drug or alcohol abuse by the employee or pending discipline. Such employees shall be referred by the managerial employee who is notified to the City’s Employee Assistance Program for confidential counseling and treatment. The managerial employee shall not divulge any information received from the employee who voluntarily seeks the help of the Employee Assistance Program. Such voluntary referral to the Employee Assistance Program, however, does not relieve the employee from the responsibility to adequately perform their job. In addition, voluntary submittal does not eliminate the employee from the requirements to take required drug or alcohol tests as described in Section B below.
Consistent to the requirements of the Federal Drug Free Workplace Act:
1.	Any employee who consumes, possesses or distributes alcohol or controlled
substance while in the workplace or while conducting City business shall be terminated from the employ of the City.
2.	Any employee who fails to notify the City within five (5) days after they are convicted of a criminal drug offense for a violation taking place in the workplace or while conducting City business, will be terminated.
3.	Any employee convicted of the manufacture, sale, or distribution of prohibited drugs, regardless of when or where that act takes place, will be terminated from the employ of the City.
4.	The City shall endeavor to provide employees and supervisors with a positive program of drug education and to make everyone aware of help that is available for such a problem.
No employee shall be under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or illegal drugs while at work. No employee shall report to work to perform a safety sensitive function within 4 hours after using alcohol. If an employee is called in for overtime, he/she shall inform the supervisor in charge of the callout if he/she has consumed alcohol within 4 hours prior to the scheduled reporting time, or if he/she is impaired by drugs or alcohol.
No employee shall fail to report to their immediate Supervisor any known adverse side effects of over the counter medication(s) or prescription drugs which the employee is taking, and
8
no employee shall be disciplined or discharged or otherwise prejudiced by reason of such disclosure.
A. Drug and Alcohol Testing: To further achieve the goals of the drug and alcohol policy, the City may require all employees to be subject to drug and alcohol testing prior to employment, for reasonable suspicion, as a part of physical exams otherwise requested or directed by the City, or upon completion of voluntary self-referral to the City’s employee assistance program or as follows:
1.	As soon as practicable following an accident involving a City vehicle or equipment where the accident involved loss of human life, an injury requiring medical treatment, where there is damage to City property reasonably believed to be in excess of $1,000 and/or when the operator was issued a citation for a moving violation, the employee shall be tested for alcohol and controlled substances. Alcohol tests must be performed within 8 hours following the incident and controlled substance tests within 32 hours following the incident. The employee shall remain readily available for such testing or may be deemed by the City to have refused to submit to testing. The employee shall not consume alcohol or controlled substances until the test occurs or the time expires.
2.	Random testing - The City shall annually random test for alcohol 25% of the average number of employees. The City shall also annually random test for controlled substances 50% of the average number of employees.
It being the desire of the parties to protect the safety of the public and other employees, and to safeguard the rights of individual employees, the parties agree that drug and alcohol testing shall be conducted as follows:
1.	The City may order individual employees to submit to breath, blood or urine
tests to determine the presence of alcohol and/or drugs where the City has a reasonable suspicion to believe the individual employee is then under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances. The City shall set forth in writing to the employee within 24 hours after the order to submit to the testing is given, the objective basis for such reasonable suspicion, including all objective facts and reasonable observations and conclusions drawn from those facts;
2.	Employees ordered to submit to drug and alcohol tests shall promptly comply with the order. Refusal to submit to such tests demanded after a determination by the City that reasonable suspicion exists to suspect that an employee is under the influence of alcohol or illicit drugs, shall be grounds for immediate discharge. The City shall present each employee, prior to issuing the order to test, this Agreement and the policy of the City concerning drug and alcohol abuse;
9
3.
The City agrees that its testing procedure for the presence of drugs or alcohol shall conform to the following:
(i)	Use only a SAMHSA certified licensed clinical laboratory to test body fluids or materials for alcohol or drugs (illicit substance), and only a breath testing devise and operator currently certified by the Department of Transportation;
(ii)	Establish a chain of custody procedure for both sample collection and testing that will insure the integrity of and identity of each sample and test result;
(iii)	Collect a sufficient sample of the same body fluid of material to permit for an initial screening, a confirmatory test and a sufficient amount to be set aside and reserved for later testing if requested by the employee;
(iv)	Collect all samples in such a manner as to preserve the individual employee’s right to privacy, insure a high degree of security for the sample and its freedom from adulteration. Proper procedures and testing shall be conducted to prevent the submission of a false or adulterated sample;
(v)	Confirm any body fluid sample that tests positive in the initial screening for alcohol or drugs (illicit substance) by use of gas chromatography, with mass spectrometry or an equivalent scientifically accurate and accepted method that provides quantitative data about the detected alcohol or drug metabolites;
(vi)	Provide the employee tested with an opportunity to have, an additional portion of the same sample tested by a licensed testing facility of his or her own choosing;
(vii)	Require that the clinical laboratory report to the physician who ordered the test, positive results only in the case where both the initial and confirmatory test results of body fluid are positive as to the same sample;
(viii)	The Medical Review Officer (MRO) shall provide each employee with the report of the results of each drug or alcohol test that includes the types of tests conducted, the results of each test, the detection level used by the laboratory, and other information provided to the MRO by the laboratory;
(ix)	Insure that all positive samples are maintained for a period of not less than one hundred twenty (120) days to permit additional testing at the election of the employee or union.
10
(x)	Body fluid specimen samples shall be sealed in front of the person providing the sample, labeled and checked against the identity of the employee to ensure the results match the tested specimen. Samples shall be stored in a secured and refrigerated atmosphere until testing or delivery to the testing lab representative.
(xi)	If an alcohol test reveals that there is a concentration of alcohol in the employee’s blood stream (blood alcohol concentration shall mean either grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grains of alcohol per 210 liters of breath), of .04 or more the employee will automatically be deemed “under the influence” of alcohol within the meaning of this Policy, and therefore, shall be subject to discipline under this Policy.
If an alcohol test reveals that there is a concentration less than those specified above, there is no presumption that the employee is “under the influence”, but the City may discipline the employee (subject to the grievance procedure) under this policy in the presence of other indicia that the employee is under the influence. If a breath test under this Section 8.1 reveals an alcohol concentration higher than those specified above, the employee may promptly secure a blood test, which, if it contradicts the breath test result, will be paid for by the City.
(xii)	The testing or processing phase for body fluids shall consist of a two-step procedure:
a.	Initial screening test
b.	Confirmation test
(xiii)	The body fluid sample is first tested using the initial drug screening procedure. An initial positive test result will not be considered conclusive; rather, it will be classified as “confirmation pending.” Notification of test results to the City shall be held until the confirmation test results are obtained.
(xiv)	A body fluid specimen testing positive will undergo an additional confirmatory test. The confirmation procedure shall be technologically different and more sensitive than the initial screening test.
(xv)	Personnel utilized for testing will be certified as qualified to collect samples or adequately trained in collection procedures.
(xvi)	Concentrations of a drug at or above the levels established by SAMHSA for screening tests shall be considered a positive test
11
result when using the initial immunoassay drug screening test. At the present time, these levels are:
INITIAL TEST
Level Nanogram/Milliliter (hereafter referred to as (ng/ml)
Marijuana metabolite.	50
Cocaine metabolite	300
Opiate metabolites	2000*
Phencyclidine	25
Amphetamines	1000
* A test for 6-Acetylmorphine will be conducted when the specimen’s morphine concentration exceeds 2000 ng/ml.
Concentration of a drug at or above the levels established by S AMHS A for confirmatory tests shall be considered a positive test result when performing a confirmatory Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectophotomotry test on a urine specimen that tested positive using a technologically different initial screening method. At the present time, these levels are:
CONFIRMATORY TEST	Level (ng/ml)
Marijuana metabolite.	15*
Cocaine metabolite	150*
Opiate	2000*
Phencyclidine	25
Amphetamines:
Amphetamines	500
Methamphetamine	500***
*	Delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol 9 carboxylic acid
*	*Benzoylecgonine
*	**Specimen must also contain amphetamine at a concentration greater than or equal to 200 ng/ml.
(xvii) The laboratory selected to conduct the analysis shall be experienced and capable of quality control, documentation, chain of custody, technical expertise and demonstrate proficiency in urinalysis.
(xviii) Employees having a negative drug test result shall, upon written request, receive a memorandum stating that no illegal drugs were found. If the employee requests such, a copy of the letter will be placed in the employee’s personnel file. Any initial drug test wherein the level of purported drugs is reported below that specified within the scale set forth under “INITIAL TEST” shall be considered a negative drug test by the City and no action whatsoever shall be taken against said employee under this policy. This shall not preclude the City from disciplining an employee for a correlative
12
disciplinary offense which would otherwise subject the employee to discipline.
(xix)	Each step in the collecting and processing of the drug testing shall be documented to establish procedural integrity and the chain of custody.
(xx)	Where a positive result is confirmed, specimens shall be maintained in secured, refrigerated storage for at least a period of one hundred twenty (120) days.
(xxi)	All records pertaining to City required drug tests shall remain confidential, and shall not be provided to other employers or agencies without written permission of the person whose records are sought.
(xxii)	The drug tests obtained pursuant to this policy shall be confidential in nature, shall be solely for employment purposes and shall not be utilized in any civil or criminal proceeding (unless required to be released pursuant to court order).
(xxiii)	If an employee is required to leave work to take a drug/alcohol test, the City will pay the employee for time lost from scheduled work for that day.
(xxiv)	For random drug tests the following additional conditions shall apply:
a.	The City will contract with an independent third party to provide random selection services through use of employee social security numbers. The City shall determine how many dates the random testing shall occur on, and the actual dates shall be selected by a random number generator.
b.	To maintain the security of the selection system, the contractor shall deal exclusively with the Deputy Director of Operations and Maintenance, or in his/her absence, the Director of Operations and Maintenance, for purposes of notifying the City of testing dates and individuals selected, verifying and updating the pool and supplemental selection of employees, if necessary. The Director or Deputy Director may oversee another employee, who has been trained in the applicable procedures, in the performance of the actual duties outlined in this section.
c.	When the City contact person is notified by the contractor of the employees to be tested, he/she shall promptly require
13
them to report to a designated collection site to provide specimens of breath and/or urine as required by the selection.
d.	Any employee selected who is on authorized time off which was applied for and approved prior to notice to the City of the date of the test shall be required to report to the collection site on his/her first day back from pre-approved lave. Any employee who requests leave of any type after the City has been notified on the testing date shall be required to report to the collection site on the shift he/she would otherwise have been required to report unless he/she is excused by the Deputy Director of Operations & Maintenance for good cause shown. Any employee so excused shall be required to report to the collection site on his/her first day back to work.
e.	When an employee is selected in the random process, he/she shall promptly report to the appropriate collection site upon the direction of his/her supervisor. For purposes of drug testing, he/she shall provide specimens of urine sufficient to allow for “split sample” collection and processing of the specimens. For purposes of alcohol testing, he/she shall supply a breath sample sufficient for a breath alcohol test. All breath alcohol testing shall be performed by a DOT certified operator employed by an independent third party which either operates or is affiliated with the NIDA certified laboratory selected for drug testing. All breath tests shall be performed on a DOT certified breath analysis machine. In the event that the initial breath test shows a result of .02 or greater, a second test shall be performed. Only if the second test shows a result of .04 or greater shall it be considered a positive result.
4.	Except as provided herein, the parties agree that there shall be no random, periodic or mass testing of employees for alcohol or drugs.
5.	The City agrees to maintain all records concerning drug or alcohol problems
of its employee in the utmost confidence, releasing such information only upon written authorization of the affected employee or to other management personnel on an as needed basis, or upon proper court order.
B. Discipline/Rehabilitation: The parties agree that the decision as to whether an employee will be disciplined and/or referred for treatment and rehabilitation shall be based upon the employee’s length of service, the nature and extent of the problem and all other relevant factors on a case by case basis. Violation of any of the provisions of this Policy may be considered “just cause” for discipline. If, as a result of the investigation and/or completion of a positive alcohol or drug test, just cause is present, discipline may be imposed, but no more harshly than as follows
14
(NOTE: Discipline shall be subject to the grievance procedure under the collective bargaining agreement):
SECTION 8.2 - PHYSICAL & MENTAL FITNESS: It shall be the responsibility of each employee to maintain the standards of physical and mental fitness required for performing his essential job functions (either with or without a reasonable accommodation if disabled). Whenever the Employer has a verifiable just cause to suspect that the physical or mental condition of an employee is endangering his own health or the safety of fellow workers; or when the employee appears unable to perform the essential functions of the job, the employee may be requested by the Director or Deputy Director of Operations & Maintenance to submit to an examination by a physician without expense to the employee which shall only be for the purpose of determining his physical and mental condition relative to City employment.
Employees shall have the right to secure similar testing at their own expense from psychiatrists, psychologists or physicians of their own choosing. The employer and the employees shall only utilize the services of qualified, certified medical doctors, psychiatrists or psychologists. Where there is disagreement between physicians regarding an employee being medically released to return to work, a third physical specialized in the field of medicine involved shall be selected jointly by the disputing physicians. The decision of the third physician shall be final and binding. The cost of the third physician shall be borne by the City.
SECTION 8.3 - POLYGRAPH TEST: No employee shall be required to take a polygraph examination as a condition of retaining employment with the Employer nor shall they be subject to discipline for the refusal to take such.
SECTION 8.4 - EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM: The City agrees to provide an Employee Assistance Program to assist employees who are experiencing personal problems which the employee believes may be affecting his job performance. This program is available to all employees and their immediate family. Except as provided otherwise in this Agreement, employee participation in the Employee Assistance Program shall be voluntary, confidential, and not used for or considered in matters relating to performance evaluations, discipline or promotions. Participation in the program shall not be used as an excuse for his/her poor job performance.
ARTICLE 9 SENIORITY
SECTION 9.1 - DEFINITION OF SENIORITY: City seniority shall mean the continuous, full time employment with the employer beginning with the latest date of hire with the employer and shall include layoffs and other periods of absence authorized by and consistent with this Agreement. To accommodate earlier definitions of seniority for older employees, it is further agreed that persons employed as of the effective date of this Agreement shall retain City seniority dates as presently held. City seniority is to be used to determine the amount of fringe benefits earned.
Each member of the individual labor unions covered by the Agreement shall have a seniority date that measures the length of continuous employment with the City while performing the work assigned to the individual union. Such seniority date is subject to Section 9.3 below.
15
Union seniority may be used for the purpose of shift assignments, job bidding, selection of time off, selection of vacation times and for lay off/recall unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement. Where more than one (1) person is hired as a regular full time employee on the same date and any of those employee(s) hired was/were a temporary employee, seniority shall be determined first by the initial date of hire as a temporary employee and then by drawing numbers out of a hat with a union steward present. In the event two or more temporary employees are being hired as full time employees and those temporary employees have the same hire date as a temporary employee, determination of seniority as a full time employee shall be determined by drawing numbers out of a hat as provided above.
SECTION 9.2	- TERMINATION OF SENIORITY: Seniority and the employment relationship shall be terminated when an employee:
a.	Quits, resigns or retires;
b.	Is discharged (unless reversed by grievance procedure);
c.	Is absent without leave for three (3) consecutive working days without notifying the City except where failure to notify is due to documented circumstances beyond the control of employee
d.	Is laid off for a period of time which exceeds two years or is laid off and fails to notify the City of his intent to report for work within seven (7) working days and will report within fourteen (14) days after having been recalled by certified letter to last known address, provided advance notice is given to the City during the seven (7) day period referenced above, the Parties agree to extend the fourteen (14) day period for a reasonable period of time due to unanticipated documented circumstances. Failure to notify or to return to work as provided above will not result in the loss of seniority where there is documentation of unanticipated reasonable circumstances beyond the control of the employee.
SECTION 9.3	- TRIAL EMPLOYMENT: When an employee accepts City employment outside of the work covered by this Agreement and returns within six (6) months, their Union seniority shall be deemed continuous. If they return after the end of six (6) months, their Union seniority shall start at the time they return to the Union position.
SECTION 9.4	- SENIORITY LIST: The City shall maintain and keep current a roster of the employees showing the applicable employment seniority for each employee. This roster shall be provided annually to the Union, upon request (email is sufficient).
ARTICLE 10 PROBATIONARY PERIODS
SECTION 10.1	- PROBATION PERIOD: All newly appointed employees will serve an original probation period of six (6) months. Temporary and/or part time employees do not serve, nor ever complete a probation period while in that status. However, any temporary or part-time employee will serve a probation period of six (6) months upon being hired as a regular employee,
16
(this period shall be reduced to three (3) months for temporary employees who have perform bargaining unit work a combined total of six months as a temporary employee before being made a regular employee.)
SECTION 10.2	- ORIGINAL PROBATION: At least twice during the probationary period, (at two (2) months and at four (4) months), the supervisor shall give each probationary employee a written and oral evaluation of his work. Should a new employee’s performance be judged unsatisfactory, the employee may be terminated. The decision of the City to retain or dismiss the employee shall be final and binding on all parties. This notification is to be made within two (2) weeks of the end of the probationary period
The City may adjust the probationary period by the length of time equal to the length of any authorized leave of absence, period of light duty assignment or other approved breaks in service taken by the employee during the probationary period. If the cumulative break in service and/or period of light duty assignment during probation is more than two (2) months, the City may require the entire probationary period be restarted.
SECTION 10.3	- PROMOTIONAL PROBATION: The rules regarding evaluations for original probationers also apply to promotion. Should an employee, who was promoted from another classification within the same bargaining unit, not complete his probationary period, he shall be reinstated to his former position from which he was promoted.
ARTICLE 11
LAYOFF AND RECALL
SECTION 11.1 - NOTICE: Subject to the following, it is understood and agreed that the City retains the exclusive right to determine appropriate staffing levels and reserves the right to contract out work it deems necessary:
A.	If the employer adjusts staffing levels downward, (during the month of December),
it shall notify the Union twenty 20 days prior to the intended effective date of the planned layoff. For the remainder of the year, a thirty (30) day notification period shall apply. The employer and Union will promptly meet to discuss alternatives and/or exceptions to Section 11.2. If alternatives to lay off are not found, employees to be laid off will be notified ten (10) working days prior to the effective date of the layoff.
B.	Where contracting out would result in the layoff of existing bargaining unit employees, the City will notify the Union at least 60 days before such contracting and will offer the Union an opportunity to meet and discuss the matter before the date of any existing bargaining unit employee is laid off as a direct result of such contracting out. Such good faith bargaining may include, among other items, the relative economic costs and the effects of such action upon existing bargaining unit employees who may be laid off as a result of such contracting. The grievance and arbitration procedures set forth in this Agreement may be implemented should the parties fail to reach agreement during bargaining.
C.	The length of notice or the duty to bargain contained in paragraphs A and B, do not
apply to periods of declared emergency, (natural and/or manmade disasters), situations or to temporary layoffs in Section 11.3.
17
SE	CTION 11.2-PROCEDURE FOR LAYOFF/RECALL: The exact procedure for layoff/recall is different for each labor organization and is covered by Letters of Understanding or side agreements.
SE	CTION 11.3 - TEMPORARY LAYOFF: Temporary layoff of sixty (60) calendar days or less. In such cases, employees will be laid off by inverse seniority and recalled by seniority. Temporary layoff will only be used for:
a.	Unanticipated loss of revenue or funding which the City does not expect to obtain or make up within the temporary layoff period; or
b.	Emergency (natural and/or manmade disasters), lack of utilities or civil disruption that makes premises at a work location inaccessible or unusable.
ARTICLE 12
EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE
We believe that the purpose of the Collective Bargaining Agreement is to provide for an orderly collective bargaining relationship between the City and the Unions, to encourage and improve efficiency and productivity, and to prevent work interruptions from interfering with the operations of the City. One area that plays a role in accomplishing this purpose is employee discipline.
In the interest of enhancing employee discipline, the Parties wish to adopt a new employeediscipline system. This new system, described in detail below, places a premium on correcting employee behavior through counseling. It also separates Minor Offenses from Major Offenses and places them on separate discipline tracks. The new disciplinary system seeks to balance the employees’ need for certainty in how the City will administer discipline with the City’s need to retain its broad authority under Article 3, Management Rights, to manage its workers.
The City shall use the principles of progressive and corrective discipline to improve employee behavior and/or performance. However, when the severity of an infraction is great, discipline outside the normal progression, up to and including dismissal, may be considered an appropriate remedy. It should be recognized that when using the principle of progressive discipline, all aspects of performance are taken into consideration. Individual infractions standing alone, may not warrant action beyond the first level, but when viewed cumulatively with other warnings, more extreme action may be appropriate, The City will not reprimand, relieve from duty, suspend, discharge, or discipline a non-probationary employee without just cause. If the City has reason to reprimand an employee, said reprimand shall be done in a manner that will not embarrass the employee before other employees or the public.
Minor and Major Offenses: The City and Unions recognize that not all offenses are the same in terms of their seriousness and their effect on the safety and efficiency of the work environment. In light of this recognition, the Parties draw a distinction between Minor Offenses and Major Offenses, The Parties will treat each type differently as described below.
18
Minor Offenses: Minor Offenses are those that are not Major Offenses. There are two categories of Minor Offenses: 1) Preventable Vehicle Operation Accidents and Injuries; and 2) All Other Violations.
a.	Counseling: The Parties recognize that the purpose of progressive and corrective discipline is twofold. First, its purpose is to change an employee’s behavior so that the behavior conforms to the needs of a safe and efficient workplace. Second, its purpose is to demonstrate the importance of following workplace rules by imposing progressively harsher discipline when an employee repeatedly violates rules.
To accomplish these dual goals, the City will implement counseling before starting an employee on the discipline track. The purpose of the counseling is to identify and correct employee behavior in a positive, non-threatening environment. Counseling is separate and distinct from discipline.
For Category 1 Minor Offenses, each employee shall receive one counseling session before the City places him or her onto the discipline track described below,
For Category 2 Minor Offenses, each employee shall receive one (1) counseling sessions before the City places him or her onto the discipline track described below.
For both Category 1 and 2 Offenses, if an employee receives a one-day suspension, the Parties shall schedule a counseling session to discuss the employee’s behavior and performance issues. The purpose of this session is to find a solution to the problem to avoid the need for future discipline.
The City shall make a written record of the counseling session and shall furnish the employee and the Union with a copy of such record.
The Unions agree that the City’s issuance of verbal counseling shall not be a grievable action.
b.	Category 1 — Preventable Vehicle Operation Accidents and Injuries: A Preventable Vehicle Operation Accident or Injury is an occurrence involving City vehicles or equipment that the offending employee could have avoided had he exercised due care in performing his work responsibilities. Counseling and discipline shall progress as follows:
1st offense	-	Written Warning
2nd offense	--	1 to 3 day Suspension
3rd offense	--	4 day Suspension or more
4th offense	--	Subject to Discharge
19
* As described above, the Parties shall schedule a counseling session when this discipline level occurs.
c.	Category 2 — All Other Violations: This Category includes All Other Violations, which are any work rule violation that does not rise to the level of a Major Offense, All Other Violations include Personnel Policy and Personal Protective Equipment violations and any other Minor Offense the City has just cause to discipline for, Counseling and discipline shall progress as follows:
1st offense — Written Warning
2nd offense -	1 to 3 day Suspension
3rd offense	--	4 day Suspension or more
4th offense	-	Subject to Discharge
* As described above, the Parties shall schedule a counseling session when this discipline level occurs,
Major Offenses: There is one category of major offenses.
d.	Major Offense: This type of offense is the more serious of the two categories
and an employee will be subject to suspension as well as possible discharge for even one offense. The following is a list of Major Offenses:
(i)	Willful destruction of City property;
(ii)	Fighting on the job;
(iii)	Possessing a weapon while on duty;
(iv)	Theft while on duty;
(v)	Making physical threats to any other person while on duty
(vi)	Gross insubordination;
(vii)	Unauthorized person in vehicle;
(viii)	Refusal to follow a direct and reasonable order from supervision;
(ix)	Recklessness resulting in serious accident while on duty;
(x)	Engagement in racial or other unlawful discrimination or harassment as defined in Title VII and/or City policy; and
20
(xi)	Any other employee action that the City determines, in its sole discretion, to rise to the level of a Major Offense. Examples of additional Major Offenses may include, but are not limited to the following: falsifying official documents; drinking while on duty; buying or selling illegal substances while on duty; theft of City property or property of another; having sex while on duty, indecent exposure while on duty; sleeping while on duty; distributing pornography while on duty; or bringing the City into disrepute. The City must have just cause to impose discipline under this subpart. The purpose of this subpart is to retain the City’s discretion under Article 3, Management Rights.
e.	Pre-discipline Meeting: Before the City discharges or disciplines an employee for these Major Offenses, there shall be a pre-disciplinary meeting between the City, the employee, and the Union. At this meeting, the City will document the reason or reasons for the contemplated disciplinary action and disclose the names of witnesses and copies of relevant documents. The employee and the Union may present rebuttal evidence. After this meeting, the City will inform the employee and the Union in writing the discipline it gives the employee and the reasons for such discipline. If the employee and the Union wish to grieve the discipline decision, the grievance will proceed pursuant to the grievance procedure outlined in Article 5 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Personnel Department Records: The City shall retain counseling and disciplinary records of its employees as described below.
f.	Minor Offenses: Each offense has a corresponding period where counseling
and discipline will remain on an employee’s record. Because the counseling and disciplinary track for minor offenses escalate in seriousness with each new offense, the City will base record retention on each new offense. Thus, each counseling session or disciplinary action—including lower level offenses—shall remain on an employee’s record until he or she is offense-free for the retention time period of his most recent offense. Once the employee goes without an offense for the entire corresponding duration, his entire record is removed and he starts back at the beginning of the disciplinary track.
Minor Offenses: Each Minor Offense shall have the following time periods:
Counseling	--	1 year
Written warning	—	1 year
1	day suspension	—	2 years
3	day suspension	-	2 years
21
More than 3 day suspension - 3 years
g. Major Offenses: Major Offenses shall remain on the employee’s record indefinitely.
Progressive Discipline By Category: Discipline for Minor Offense Categories 1 and 2 are on separate tracks and thus an offense in one category will not be used to advance discipline in the other category.
The Unions recognize that Minor Offense Category 2 is a broad category of offenses. It includes offenses that vary in nature. Nonetheless, each Category 2 offense, regardless of nature, will advance an employee’s discipline level within Category 2. For instance, a Personal Protective Equipment violation and a Personnel Policy violation will not advance along separate tiers in the Category 2 disciplinary track. Both types of offenses will advance the employee on the same Category 2 disciplinary track.
The City will not use Major Offenses to advance discipline in either Minor Offense category.
The City is free to use past Major Offenses, in determining discipline for a subsequent Major Offense.
Notification: If the City imposes disciplinary action or counsels an employee per this Article, it shall furnish the employee and the Union a copy of any reports.
Right to Representation: Employees shall have the right to Union representation at all meetings with the City where the Employees reasonably fear that disciplinary action may result. No suspension or dismissal will occur without a prior offer to the employee to provide Union representation. If the Union Steward or a Business Manager is unavailable, the employee may select another employee from the unit to act as a witness,
Employer and Union Agreement: Nothing in Article 12 precludes or prohibits the City and the Union from agreeing to resolve disciplinary matters on a case-by-case basis without setting precedent or establishing a past practice.
ARTICLE 13
RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT
SECTION 13.1 - RESIDENCY: Employees shall establish and maintain their principal place of residence within a twenty (20) mile radius of Peoria City Hall. Employees shall establish and maintain their principal place of domicile in the City within 30 days of the end of their probationary period or one (1) year whichever is greater. At the conclusion of five (5) full years of active service and of Peoria City limits residence, they may establish and maintain their principal place of domicile within the City of Peoria or outside the City within a twenty (20) mile radius of Peoria City Hall.
On the effective date of this Agreement a current employee with less than five full years of Peoria City limits residence or a new employee hired on or after July 1, 2009 may elect to waive
22
the Peoria City limits residence requirement by agreeing to forfeit 2% of his annual base salary for the time that remains on such Peoria City limits residence requirement. An employee who makes such election must complete a Waiver of Residency form at Human Resources prior to establishing the principal place of domicile outside the Peoria City limits. A probationary employee who elects to not establish Peoria City limits residency shall begin the five full year salary reduction period upon completion of the Waiver of Residency form.
An employee’s unauthorized residency outside the city or county or twenty mile (20) mile radius from City Hall in violation of the applicable residency requirements established above shall be grounds for immediate dismissal. For the purpose of this Article, an employee’s place of residency shall be considered to be his principal place of domicile.
The need to establish residency within the probationary period may cause an extreme hardship on individuals. In such cases, the Department Head may grant extensions of the time limit, not exceeding one year.

SIDE LETTERS

Keith E. Gleason
Teamster Local 627
7101N. Allen Road
Peoria, IL 61614
RE:	Side Letter Agreement - Issues Unique to Mechanics
Dear Keith:
This side-letter indicates my understanding of our agreement on the mechanics side issues. This side-letter updates and replaces the previous side-letter dated March, 2016. Unless otherwise noted, these changes will be effective upon the signing of this agreement.
CLOTHING SERVICE: The City of Peoria will continue the provision of a uniform service to all mechanics in lieu of the clothing allowance. This includes the provision of required uniforms and the laundering of such at no cost to the employee. The number of uniforms provided will remain at seven per week.
SAFETY SHOE ALLOWANCE: The safety shoe allowance for mechanics effective December 1, 2018 is $190 per year. This allowance will be paid on a separate check. Effective December 1, 2019 it shall increase to $200 per year and to $210 per year on December 1,2020
TOOL ALLOWANCE: The tool allowance for mechanics effective December 1, 2018 is $550 per year. It shall be increased to $570 per year on December 1, 2019 and to $590 per year on December 1,2020. This amount will continue to be paid under the current procedures.
FIRE MECHANIC STANDBY: Effective December 1,2016 the standby pay for Fire Mechanics is $210.
SHIFT PREMIUM: Effective December 1, 2008 Fire and Equipment Mechanics regularly assigned to the evening shift shall receive a $0.25 per hour shift premium for hours worked on the evening shift.
OVERTIME: Each shift in the Fleet Management and Fire Garage functional units will be primarily responsible for filling overtime requirements occurring on their respective shift. However, the City of Peoria retains the right to assign or order employees to work overtime on any shift if a sufficient number of employees cannot be called in from the respective shift.
When overtime occurs on a shift, it will first be offered to employees on that shift by seniority. If a sufficient number of employees do not respond to the offer, overtime will be offered to employees on the other shift by seniority. If a sufficient number of employees have still not responded, individuals on the shift where the overtime occurred will be ordered in to work the
Appendix - 3
4837-3382-8402.V1-6/2/2016 10:55 AM
overtime starting with the least senior employee. If there is still a need for additional employees, employees from the other shift will be ordered to work starting with the least senior person. Individuals who do not inform supervision that they were sick when they refused the first offer of overtime may be subject to disciplinary action if they refuse the order to report to work.
The City of Peoria retains the sole discretion to determine the number of mechanics to be called in to cover overtime needs.
Personnel on sick leave are not normally eligible for overtime work until they have reported back to work on their regular shift. Authorized leave begins at the beginning of the next scheduled shift. Employees on authorized leave shall be placed at the bottom of the call-in list for voluntary overtime that occurs on their shift. If needed, these employees will be offered the overtime prior to contacting employees on the other shift. If sufficient numbers of employees do not volunteer to take the overtime to meet the needs of one shift, employees from the other shift will be offered the overtime based on the same eligibility guidelines.
CLASSIFICATIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS
The assignment of employees to shifts shall be done by bidding the shifts effective January 1 and July 1 of each year. Seniority shall be the determining factor on shift assignments except that the City retains the right to assign and transfer employees to meet the requirements of the Department.
One employee on each shift shall be classified as the Crew Chief based upon knowledge, skills qualifications and abilities. If those are relatively equal between employees, seniority shall be the determining factor. Crew Chief shall be considered a permanent classification in the Fleet Management and Fire Garage functional units and selection shall be made through the job bidding process.
LAYOFF AND RECALL
Functional unit seniority will be used for determining the layoffs and only time classified as a permanent or conditional employee will count towards seniority. Recall will be by seniority for up to a 24 month period.
SENIORITY
Seniority rights for employees shall prevail. Seniority shall be the governing factor for vacation preference and personal day preference. It is understood that there shall be functional unit seniority. Employees transferring from Fleet Management to the Fire Garage will have a six month trial period. Employees transferring from the Fire Garage to Fleet Management will have a three month trial period. After completing the trial period, the employee would lose his/her seniority in the former functional unit and go to the bottom of the list in the new functional unit. Functional units are defined as Fleet Management and Fire Garage.
If this reflects your understanding of our Agreement, please sign in the place indicated below and return one signed original to me for our records.

Re: Temporary Teamster representation - Case No. S-RC-04-114
Dear Keith,
On September 23, 2004 the Illinois State Labor Relations Board pursuant to Case No. S-RC-04-114 conducted an election among temporary Teamster employees who had met the requirements as public employees per statute. The election results certified Teamsters Local 627 as the collective bargaining representative for this class of employees.
During recent contract negotiations the parties folly discussed in detail all items pertinent to temporary Teamster employees. Any items not specifically set forth in the Agreement are not considered a part of the Agreement. A final item of those discussions was the provision of health care funding by the City of Peoria for temporary Teamster employees.
It was mutually agreed that the Employer contribution per hour under the Participation Agreement for eligible temporary Teamster employees to the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Health and Welfare Fund would be limited to $9.71/hour effective 12/1/18, $10.29/hour effective 12/1/19, and not to exceed $10.91/hour effective 12/1/20. The Employer contribution would be deducted from the outside scale (prevailing wage) agreement package to insure that the maximum employer costs would not exceed the outside scale (prevailing wage) agreement. The initial deduction of such health care contributions for a temporary Teamster employee would begin with the employee’s date of hire. Pension deductions for IMRF eligible temporary Teamster employees would be handled in a similar manner consistent with Article 29.3 of the Master Agreement.
If this is your understanding relative to the agreements reached concerning representation issues of temporaryTCeamsfer^employees during these negotiations, please sign in the place indicated.

RE: Side Letter Agreement - City of Peoria and Carpenters Local 237 Issues unique to Carpenters
Dear Jacob:
The purpose of this letter is to update the Side Letter Agreement dated March 2016 between Carpenters Local 183 and the City of Peoria, and set forth the issues that are unique to the carpenters. This side letter replaces all previous side letters.
It continues to be understood that the provisions set forth in this Side Agreement are controlling in the event there would appear to be a conflict with the Master Contract.
SECTION 11.2 - LAYOFF/RECALL:	Without regard to labor classification (Carpenter or
Lead Carpenter), the employee with the least amount of union seniority within the City employment will be removed from the job first, provided that the remaining employee(s) then possess the ability to perform the work expected of that job classification.
SECTION 25.1 - CLOTHING AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT: Effective December 1, 2019 the City of Peoria shall pay one check per year to each covered employee in the amount of $420.00 to be applied to clothing, safety shoe, inclement weather gear and concrete boot purchases. This payment shall be on a separate check. The payment date shall be consistent between covered unions. Effective December 1,2020, this allowance will increase to $440.00.
I believe that this covers all of the side issues required. If you agree, please sign in the place indicated.

RE: Side Letter Agreement - Issues unique to Painters
Dear Todd:
The following sets forth my understanding of our agreement on the Painters side issues. This sideletter updates and replaces the previous side-letter dated March 2016 and incorporates the changes agreed to in our current round of negotiations.
SECTION 11.2 — LAYOFF AND RECALL: The employee with the least amount of seniority within the Public Work Department will be removed from the job first, provided that the remaining employees possess the ability to perform the available work. Recall shall be in the inverse order of layoff.
SECTION 20.2 - OVERTIME: Qualified painters will be called out by seniority in their respective functional units, except for daily job continuation. When there is a known probability of overtime, the senior most painter within the functional unit will be offered the overtime at the beginning of the shift.
A painter is not qualified for overtime if one of the following circumstances exist:
a.	The painter is physically unable or untrained to perform the task.
b.	Personnel on leave are not eligible for overtime work until they have reported back to work
on their regular shift. Authorized leave begins at the beginning of the next scheduled shift.
c.	In the event an insufficient number of qualified painters are available for overtime, painters
on authorized leave may be offered overtime.
If the overtime requirements exceed the number of painters within either Facilities Operations or Traffic Operations, the additional painters will be called in by seniority from the other functional unit. Once all permanent employees have been offered the opportunity for overtime, temporary painters may be utilized for overtime assignments.
If an adequate number of painters do not volunteer for overtime using the procedures set down above and additional painters are still needed, then management will start with the junior qualified painter in the primary section and require him/her (or them) to come into work.
Appendix - 8
4837-3382-8402.V1-6/2/2016 10:55 AM
Employees shall work extra hours when authorized and directed. A change in the allocation system for overtime is to be by mutual consent. All employees required to work overtime shall receive pay at the rate of time and one half.
SECTION 20.3 - CALL BACK PAY: Any employee contacted outside his/her normal work shift to be called into work shall be paid at the overtime rate for a minimum of two (2) hours. This provision shall not be implemented when overtime is scheduled on their regular shift or is consecutive with their regular work shift.
SECTION 20,6 - SCHEDULING PRACTICES:
Existing scheduling practices with respect to the length of the normal work week, starting and quitting times, lunch periods, days off, shifts, and overtime distribution shall continue during the term of this Agreement.
Any change in the current scheduling practices and starting times will only be done by mutual agreement.
SECTION 25.1 - CLOTHING AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT: Effective December 1, 2018 the City of Peoria shall pay one check per year to each covered employee in the amount of $400.00 to be applied to clothing, safety shoe, inclement weather gear and concrete boot purchases. This payment shall be on a separate check. The payment date shall be consistent between covered unions. Effective December 1,2019, this allowance will increase to $420.00; and on December 1,2020 to $440.00.
SECTION 27.1 - RATES OF PAY: The amount of the general increase and the effective dates will be covered by the master agreement. The purpose of this addendum is to document the premium pay treatment for painters. The present practice of a 50 cent per hour premium for hand lettering signs, etc. will continue.
Effective December 1,2008 a painter shall receive lead pay of $1.00 per hour only when assigned to and actually directing the daily activities of others (lead pay). Only one lead person per functional unit will be paid the premium rate. A person can only receive one type of premium pay for any one period, premium pay cannot be pyramided.
Premium rates are only to be paid when an individual is actually performing the work associated with the premium pay. This premium will not be paid for time off. Premium pay received shall be included in the employee’s base pay for the purposes of retirement, overtime, and longevity pay.
The City of Peoria has a pavement marking truck equipped for two part epoxy pavement marking application. This machine has historically been staffed with two (2) painters (one (1) driving and one (1) applying paint) and one (1) laborer for normal operations. The painters assigned to the vehicle will be classified as Traffic Painters.
If the above reflects your understanding of our agreement, please sign in the place indicated below and return one signed original to me for our records.

APPENDIX F WORK RULE AGREEMENT
WORK RULE AGREEMENT Between
City of Peoria-Operations & Maintenance Divisions and Teamster Union-Local 627 & Laborers Union - Local 165
These work rules are designed to cover and apply to all covered employees (Teamsters, Laborers, and Maintenance Workers) in the Operations & Maintenance Division. To this end, the term “employee” has been used and should be read as including Teamsters, Laborers, and Maintenance Workers only. However, portions of these work rules are only applicable to certain designated employees. In those circumstances, the work rules designate applicability by indicating the group of employees to which they apply.
ARTICLE!. PERSONNEL RULES
All personnel rules of the City of Peoria shall apply to all employees to the extent they do not conflict with a specific provision of the master agreement or these work rules.
ARTICLE II. HIRING
Section 1.
Permanent employees hired after 1/1/19 must possess at time of hire a CDL-B permit and obtain a CDL-B within three (3) months. Temporary employees may apply and be considered for permanent employment in available bargaining unit positions. Temporary maintenance worker employees may be hired from both the Local #627 Teamster and Local #165 Laborer union halls and applicants from the general public. The City’s practice of first considering previous temporary employees for re-hire will be continued. If additional individuals are needed to fill the vacancies, the Unions shall make equal referrals for consideration with any other applicants. Temporary employees will not be used to circumvent the normal hiring process for permanent or conditional employees. Qualifications, in this case, include the topics of skill, ability, verifiable work experience and may also include race and gender requirements. Temporary and conditional employees must possess a valid CDL-B permit within fourteen (14) calendar days of hire and shall obtain a valid CDL-B within ninety (90) calendar days of hire except for the snow season hiring period where they shall have a valid CDL-B license on date of hire.
Where more than one (1) person is hired as a regular full time employee on the same date and any of those employee(s) hired was/were a temporary employee, seniority shall be determined first by the initial date of hire as a temporary employee and then by drawing numbers out of a hat with a union steward present. In the event two or more temporary employees are being hired as full time employees and those temporary employees have the same hire date as a temporary employee, determination of seniority as a full time employee shall be determined by drawing numbers out of a hat as above provided.
Any temporary or part-time employee will serve a probation period of six (6) months upon being hired as a regular employee (this period shall be reduced to three (3) months for temporary
Appendix -11
4837-3382-8402.vl-6/2/2016 10:55 AM
employees who have perform bargaining unit work a combined total of six months as a temporary employee before being made a regular employee.)
Section 2.
Temporary employees paid outside scale will receive no holiday pay, sick leave or fringe benefits that regular City employees receive. When a temporary employee is assigned a job that runs into overtime, he/she will remain on the job. Job continuation shall be limited to a two (2) hour period, except there shall be no job continuation on snow removal.
Temporary employees who work for City more than one thousand (1000) hours in a twelve (12) month period shall be enrolled in the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund (IMRF). The employee shall have the statutorily required employee contribution (currently 4.5% of hourly pay/salary) deducted from his hourly pay/salary on a tax deferred basis. The statutorily required employer contribution of the City as determined by IMRF for this pension shall be deducted from its pension, annuity, other funds or hourly wage contribution in the outside scale labor agreement.
Section 3.
A.	“Conditional” employees may be hired to fill vacancies of employees that are on disability or extended leave. These employees will accrue vacation, personal leave, sick leave, and seniority as any other permanent employee for the time that he fills such vacancy. Permanent conditional employees shall be laid off by seniority. Such layoff will permit the employee to return to temporary status as an option.

Section 4
Permanent and conditional vacancies may be filled by the transfer of a qualified permanent employee to a different functional unit, a qualified temporary employee, or a new hire. Permanent or conditional vacancies filled by qualified permanent or temporary employees may be filled by employees represented by either labor union. A qualified permanent or temporary employee selected to fill a permanent or conditional vacancy who is not a member or represented by the same union as the previous employee who held the vacated position may be required, for the purpose of attempting to maintain the hiring ratio, to be represented by or be a member of the same union of that previous employee in that vacated position as a condition of accepting the position. For the purposes of representation the City will attempt; where it is necessary to do otherwise, to establish and maintain a ratio of one (1) teamster to one (1) laborer. Non-members wages, and benefits will be determined by which Labor Union they will be represented by due to maintaining a one to one ratio.

Section 1.
A.	When overtime within a functional unit occurs, it will first be offered to all employees within that functional unit that are covered by the maintenance worker concept and qualified to do the work. For overtime purposes, functional units are defined as Streets/Sewers, Urban Forestry, Facilities Operations, Traffic Operations, Fleet, and Fire Garage, Sewer Inspection. Overtime work will be offered by seniority and qualifications to employees within the functional unit that normally performs the available work. If additional personnel are still needed, overtime may be assigned to qualified individuals outside of the functional unit within their traditional work jurisdiction. . The assignment will be made on a basis beginning with the most senior employees, and working down the seniority list by qualifications. Employees must be qualified to operate equipment or perform work functions during normal hours of operation to be eligible to do that work on overtime. An employee who has not presently qualified or, has been deemed to be disqualified is not eligible for these overtime opportunities.
Snow removal of streets and parking lots shall be performed by Maintenance Workers following the overtime guidelines laid out in Article V Section 2A of these work rules. This would not preclude any existing outside agreements (e.g. Park District plowing) when every available person is working.
B.	Certain emergency conditions (tornado, windstorm, flood, and snowstorm) may arise to require a splitting of the employees into crews for “around the clock” operation. This may be done with the scheduling done by the Streets/Sewers, Urban Forestry supervisors. When an emergency condition is declared assignment to work overtime is mandatory.
C.	It shall be the employee’s responsibility to carry his/her share of the overtime work, as well
as, his/her right to receive his/her share of the overtime pay. When a sufficient number of employees do not respond to the initial call from the top of the seniority list down, another call by qualifications will be made from the bottom of the seniority up until sufficient manpower responds. This second call will be an order. Individuals who do not inform supervision that they were sick when they refused the first offer of overtime may be subject to disciplinary action if they refuse the order to report to work.
D.	When overtime is not known in advance, an employee or crew is assigned to a job that runs into overtime, this employee or crew will remain on the job as a “job continuation”.
Appendix -16
4837-3382-8402.V 1-6/2/2016 10:55 AM
Job continuation is defined as it relates to the equipment performing the particular function - i.e., street sweeping in front of sealcoating. There shall be a two (2) hour limit on this time and up to an additional thirty (30) minutes for travel time will be permitted.
E.	When overtime for a job is determined during a shift that management believes could run
longer than the (2) hour time limit for job continuation they can adjust crews by offering the overtime based off of functional unit and seniority.
F.	When overtime for a job is known and scheduled at the start of the shift, the most senior qualified employee will be offered the job at the start of the shift.
G.	Night shift employees may be called into work two (2) hours prior to the starting of their shift without any consideration of the day shift employees. The night shift employees on this call-out shall be called into work by seniority and qualifications. If, during the day shift, more than two (2) hours of overtime is anticipated, the night shift shall be called in by seniority and qualifications for the remaining work that runs into the night shift.
H.	Employees on sick leave are not eligible for overtime work until they have reported back to work on their scheduled shift. However, if a 12-hour A/B shift is scheduled, an employee on sick leave is eligible for the overtime.

If management determines that a more qualified employee is needed to perform a particular daily assignment within category #3, management retains the right to make that particular daily assignment without regard to seniority and this cannot be the basis of a grievance.
Appendix -19
4837-3382-8402.V1-6/2/2016 10:55 AM
An employee may file a grievance in the event that management exercises its rights under the second sentence of Section (C)(1) of this Article in an arbitrary or capricious manner.

ARTICLE VIL RATES OF PAY
Section 1.
There shall be four (4) pay classifications, depending on the function of work being performed. The classification and pay attached to each are as follows:
Pay Class 1 (Probationary Period)	Maintenance Worker 1 (one dollar less than
Maintenance Worker II)
Pay Class 2	Maintenance Worker II
Pay Class 3	Operator
Pay Class 4	Foreman
The Service Truck as used by Street & Sewers Division employees shall be for general preventative maintenance on equipment and shall not replace duties historically performed by the Fleet Division.
The Foreman classification will be instituted where and when needed as determined by the City. In the Streets/Sewers Division, the Foreman assignment will be first made available to candidates who are permanently assigned to the Maintenance Worker II or Operator pay grade. Foreman position openings will be selected based off qualifications and applicants holding the title of Maintenance Worker II or Operator shall be eligible regardless of which functional unit they are assigned. Management shall determine the best qualified candidate. Any employee that holds the pay classification of Foreman shall be compensated at that rate while they hold that classification for all paid leave.
Successful applicants for Foreman shall be required to successfully complete a six (6) month probationary period in that pay classification, unless they have previously held that classification.
After completion of two (2) years in the Foreman assignment an employee shall annually have the right to leave that pay classification and return to his former pay classification. If an employee exercises their option to return to their former pay classification they will be paid from that point forward at the rate of the position they are in for all leave. The City may disqualify an employee or an employee may disqualify himself from the position provided it is demonstrated that the
Appendix - 22
4837-3382-8402.V1-6/2/2016 10:55 AM
employee can no longer mentally or physically perform the job. In such event, the employee shall be returned to his former pay classification, provided the City determines that he can perform such work. Upon returning to their former pay classification the employee will be paid at that rate of pay for leave.
In general, the Foreman will be responsible for performing on-site direction and assignment of work of a large crew of individuals and multiple crews. The Foreman is expected to exercise independent judgment and act on behalf of the supervisor without detailed prior instructions, and will carry out other duties and responsibilities related to the work as directed by his supervisor or department/division manager. The Foreman will assist with work scheduling and coordination, determination of supply requirements to perform the assigned work or project, training of new employees and assisting fellow workers as required. The Foreman is a working member of the crew and when qualified, may perform all job-related tasks assigned to and/or expected of the crew. The Foreman shall in no way be responsible for supervisory duties related to hiring, firing and exercising discipline.
The City, for the purposes of leadership skills development, may initiate a Foreman “in training” program. Management shall have the discretion to select employees for such training, provided employee participation is voluntary. An employee participating in such training shall receive his permanent pay classification rate for such assignment and shall perform the duties of his permanent pay classification when not performing the duties of a Foreman. Training will be limited to four (4) employees per construction season for a period not longer than a total of four (4) weeks per employee unless otherwise mutually agreed upon.

ARTICLE X. SNOW STORMS
Section 1.

8.	The first 12 hour period of around-the clock operation must have been worked in a complete 12 hour shift prior to any cancellation during the week or weekend. If the 12 hour snow shift schedule begins at the A shift starting time, then employees assigned to the A shift would work the first shift of around-the-clock operation. If the 12 hour snow schedule begins at the B shift starting time, then employees assigned to the B shift would work the first shift of around-the-clock operation. Any additional 12 hour shift after the first 12 hour shift scheduled may be canceled at any time provided that employees assigned to and able to work that shift, except during weekends, are afforded the opportunity work eight (8) hours that day. In the event that such eight (8) hours of work is not provided, an employee shall be compensated for the difference between the eight (8) hours work and the actual hours scheduled. When a twelve (12) hour shift operation is cancelled, all employees shall be notified.

Any loss of regular pay on that work day due to such assignment of hours shall be covered as stated in (8).

If additional manpower is needed, it will be assigned by volunteers in the bargaining unit, and then by reverse seniority. A regular, full-time employee on sick leave, duty injury leave or light duty will be permitted to bid on a route. The City shall temporarily replace such employee on his route with the senior regular, full-time employee who had bid for a route, but lacked seniority to be assigned a route, or if all regular, full-time employees who had bid for a route are assigned a route, with a temporary employee. Such temporary replacement shall not result in subsequent bumping and/or bidding of routes. The replacement of the regular, full-time employee on sick leave, duty injury leave or light duty who has bid and been assigned a route shall be until he returns to regular duty and reclaims his route or the next October route bidding period, whichever occurs first.
The temporary replacement of a regular, foil-time employee assigned a route who is placed on sick leave, duty injury leave or light duty after such assignment shall be administered in the same manner as the previous paragraph.
