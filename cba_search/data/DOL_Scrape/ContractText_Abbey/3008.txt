If a death occurs during an employee's vacation, an additional three (3) days with pay will be granted provided the employee attends the funeral or memorial service.
SECTION 5:	LEAVE DUE TO INJURY OR DISEASE INCURRED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF DUTY

In accordance with this agreement, all employees covered by this bargaining unit are now subject only to reasonable suspicion testing for drugs and alcohol. The drugs that will be subject to this testing are Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamines, Opiates (including heroin) and Phencyclidine (PCP).
Testing will only be ordered if a trained Department Head has reasonable suspicion that an employee has engaged in prohibited use of drugs and/or alcohol.
Employees' alcohol and drug test results and records will be maintained under strict confidentiality' by Niagara County, the drug testing laboratory, the alcohol testing facility, and the medical review officer. The results cannot be released to any party except a substance abuse professional without the written consent of the employee. Statistical
39
records and reports will be maintained by Niagara County and the alcohol and drug testing provider. Records concerning an employee’s treatment for alcoholism, or drug related problems shall remain separate from other personnel files.
Refusing to submit to an alcohol or illegal drug test may result in disciplinary action. Any violation of this agreement by a covered employee may be grounds for disciplinary action in a progressive manner.
No employee shall use, distribute, dispense, possess or manufacture any illegal drugs on a job site or county property while on duty or while in a County owned vehicle, a vehicle leased for County business, or a privately owned vehicle being used for county business during the employee’s work hours.
The Director of Human Resources or his/her designee shall arrange for training of all Department Heads who may be utilized to determine “reasonable suspicion”.
DEPARTMENT HEAD RESPONSIBILITIES
Department Heads arc responsible for participating in a certified training program approved by the EAP Administrator to include the following:
1.	Department Heads are responsible for determining, through direct observation, whether an employee is capable of performing his/her assigned duties. Symptoms of being under the influence of alcohol and drugs include incoherent or belligerent speech, smell of alcohol, difficulty working, or erratic or unusual behavior uncommon to the employee will constitute reasonable suspicion.
The Director of Human Resources shall ensure that all employees covered by this agreement receive a copy of this County policy and educational materials that explain the requirements of the drug and alcohol testing procedures prior to the start of alcohol and illegal substance testing. Union Representatives shall also be notified of the distribution of this information.
2.	Employees who arc suspected of being unfit for duty may not remain at the w orkplace. Such incidents and situations as described in #1 should be witnessed and documented in writing immediately. Clearly, an employee who is impaired should not be allowed to drive home from the workplace, (sec #4 for further direction).

4.	After reasonable suspicion testing issues have been resolved, the employee may arrange transportation home with a member of his/her family or a friend of the employee or in a taxi at the employee's expense. If all other alternatives are exhausted, a Department Head may allow an employee to be driven home in a County vehicle.
5.	The fact that an employee, allegedly under the influence of alcohol or drugs, was not allowed to remain at work is not considered a disciplinary suspension. The employee will be paid for the day in full without charge to accruals. After removal is achieved the
40
Department Head will review whether disciplinary charges and suspension or other administrative actions are appropriate. Each situation will be evaluated on a case-by-casc basis.
COUNTY RESPONSIBILITES
It is the Policy of Niagara County that:
1.	A drug and alcohol free workplace be maintained through the efforts and personal examples of management.
2.	All employees and Department Heads understand its Drug-Free Workplace policies and -Drug Testing Procedures. Niagara County will also train Department Heads how to recognize behaviors that indicate reasonable suspicion for requesting drug and/or alcohol tests.
3.	The County of Niagara or its agents will not harass its employees with regard to this policy. Copies of any documentation relating to this policy will be made available to the union upon the written request of the employee affected.
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Testing will be performed by an outside agency, in order that impartiality and confidentiality are ensured. Both the drug and alcohol tests will be conducted by certified professionals. In both instances, confirmation tests will be conducted should the initial test prove positive. In the case of alcohol testing, all testing shall be done by breathalyzer, and/or blood test. In the case of the drug test, specimen collection may be observed if the testing agency deems it necessary, and all specimens will be separated into two (2) samples. If the initial sample is positive, then the employee has the right to request that the split sample be tested at a laboratory of his/her choosing (within 72 hours of being notified by the Medical Review Officer), at the employee’s expense. However, if the results of the second test show the initial test results to be a false positive, the County will assume the cost of the second test and the employee will be reimbursed for any work time lost based on action taken on the first sample results. The County shall pay all costs associated with the administration of the alcohol tests.
All time spent administering testing, including travel time, will be paid at the employee’s regular rate of pay, or at their overtime rate if applicable. Employees win be on payroll up to the time that a positive test has occurred.
POSITIVE TEST RESULTS
If the employee tests positive, they will be provided with information available for an Employee Assistance Program.
For a first occasion, in lieu of discipline, an employee who tests positive under this agreement may volunteer to submit to an evaluation through EAP which will screen the employee and may make a determination if treatment will be necessary. If additional
41
treatment is necessary periodic reports on the employee’s progress and/or compliance will be made to the County. Failure by the employee to comply with the rehabilitation program could result in disciplinary action.
Positive test results for an employee shall be defined as refusal to take a drug or alcohol test, refusal to give a sample, or positive test results as determined by testing and confirmation. The following lists the consequential actions concomitant with positive results:
POSITIVE TEST
ALCOHOL (concentration of .08 or greater)
a.	First Instance:	Voluntary EAP

Accruals - An employee who is absent from work as a result of a positive test or as a result of his or her undergoing treatment in an EAP sponsored rehabilitation program will be allowed to use any leave time pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, in accordance with the regulations and restrictions contained within the current bargaining agreement.
Nothing in this policy is to be construed as a denial of rights guaranteed by the Collective Bargaining Agreement except those of this policy which supersede State or Federal Law. Any discipline that may result from a violation of the alcohol and drug policies shall be subject to the Discharge and Discipline provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.
The Union President shall be immediately provided a complete listing of all bargaining unit members who are tested. The Union may thereafter review any negative reasonable suspicion testing. Such review shall be through the contract’s grievance and arbitration mechanism. Each such question should be initiated by the Union directly at Stage 3. Should an arbitrator ultimately determine that there was bad faith on the part of the Department Head who initiated the reasonable suspicion test, or that he/shc otherwise
42
acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner, the arbitrator may award the employee involved up to one-day’s pay at his/her regular straight time rate, and any other penalty deemed appropriate by the arbitrator.
IN SUMMARY
Niagara County agrees that it shall not unilaterally act to change the terms or procedures encompassed within this policy.
THE TESTING POLICY WILL NOT GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL THE COUNTY HAS AN EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN PLACE.
