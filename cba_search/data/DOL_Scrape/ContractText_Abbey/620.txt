LABOR AGREEMENT
shall be scheduled for lunch periods between three (3) and five and one-half (5 1/2) hours after their regular scheduled starting time.

When part-time employees are called in who are not scheduled and not filling in for a bona fide absence, the hours must be put on the schedule.
The Employer will not purposely create schedules so that part-time employees are blocked in from claiming additional hours. The Union recognizes, however, the Employer's need for satisfactory coverage to meet the overall needs of the business. To insure that this paragraph and paragraph 8.6 are being properly administered, the Human Resources Manager and/or the Director of Operations and the Local Union President will meet at least quarterly (unless mutually waived) to review this overall situation and take whatever corrective action necessary.

week shall consist of forty (40) hours to be worked in five (5) days Monday through Saturday.

Section 7.4	Part-time employees, excluding Courtesy Clerks, shall be
scheduled and work a minimum of fifteen (15) hours in a week unless the employee absents himself from work or is called in to work on Friday or Saturday and fifteen (15) hours is not available or the employee is called in to replace another employee who is absent.

Those above holidays designated by the federal government to be observed on Monday will be observed on Monday.

Employees wishing to work eight (8) hours will be so scheduled up to fifty percent (50%) of the shifts scheduled on the Sunday or holiday. When work is performed on a holiday mentioned in Article 7, paragraph 7.7 above and/or on a Sunday, it shall be rotated among employees (who normally perform the work that is needed on the holiday or Sunday) in the individual store on a voluntary basis, provided, however, that if a sufficient number of employees to perform the necessary work do not volunteer, the work may be assigned to qualified employees on an inverse seniority basis. Holiday and/or Sunday work offered an employee but refused shall be counted as time worked for the purpose of rotating holiday and/or Sunday work. In order to be placed on the Sunday and holiday roster, an employee must be available for such work on a continuing basis. Senior employees who do not desire to work on Sunday because of religious beliefs will be allowed to exercise their seniority for holiday work.

Section 8.3	The Employer shall maintain seniority lists and shall furnish the

Section 8.4	It is the intent of the Employer that a part-time employee who

The part-time employee with seniority must advise the store manager that he is available for a posted schedule of hours within twenty-four (24) hours after the store schedule is posted or he has no claim on such hours. An employee cannot claim hours that would reduce another employee's hours below fifteen (15) in a week (fifteen (15) hours for a Courtesy Clerk).
Section 8.6	Hours which are being worked by a part-time employee shall not
be reduced for the purpose of hiring a new part-time employee. It is understood, however, that this is not to be construed as a maintenance of hours guarantee for any employee.
Section 8.7	At the end of each Kroger four (4) week period, a senior
part-time employee may request a transfer to another store in the bargaining unit, provided a younger employee in his classification in such store has been working more hours during the four (4) week period. Such request must be made by Wednesday of the week following the four (4) week period, with the transfer effective the following week. An employee requesting

Section 8.8	In case a full-time employee is involuntarily reduced, he shall be
entitled to claim up to any eight (8) hour shift of a younger employee, full-time or part-time in his store. In case a full-time employee would be laid off or reduced below forty (40) hours for more than one (1) week, he shall have the right to displace a less senior full-time employee in his classification in the bargaining unit. The full-time employee who is thus displaced shall have the right to displace a less senior full-time employee in his classification on the same basis. This will be limited to three (3) bumps.

Section 8.9	When the Employer contemplates major changes in working
conditions which will result in large scale layoffs or large scale reductions in hours, the Employer agrees to discuss such changes with the Union before putting such changes into effect.
Section 8.10	Before any voluntary or involuntary reduction of a person
holding a department head job or a classified job can take place, the Company will meet with a Union representative in an effort to assist in helping the department head or classified person to maintain their present position. Every reasonable method of helping such person shall be effectuated, including further training.
Section 8.11	Job opening notices shall be sent to all stores and union office

Employees desiring job opening shall sign notice in store office. A copy of the signed notice shall be sent to union office immediately after receipt of such notice in the Human Resources Department. These positions would be filled by the senior person that signs the bid.
Full-time and part-time employees must be on record, in writing, of their continuing interest to be chosen for work in another department in their store. The request must be filed with the Store Manager and the Union prior to the occurrence of the opening. When management deems a full-time or part-time opening exists in a department, those full-time and part-time employees who have expressed an interest in writing, as described above, shall be transferred to that department by seniority. For the purpose of complying with this paragraph, each store would maintain a list per department.
-16
LABOR AGREEMENT
By November 1st each year, employees in the presence of management, would date, print, and sign their name to each department list in which they have an interest in working for the next twelve (12) months.

Employees holding positions as listed in Section 7.31 of the contract will not be required to give up their positions as the result of signing these interest letters. All other interest requests are voided for that year once an employee is transferred to a department that they have requested.
Section 8.12	When a full-time employee permanently leaves the bargaining
unit, the Employer will post a full-time job for that store provided the store's overall business is the same or has improved over the preceding year. It is understood that this is not in any way a maintenance of full-time job guarantee. The Employer and the Union agree to continue their past practice in regard to filling full-time vacancies.
The Employer agrees that upon each quarterly closing they will inform the Union of the overall business condition of each store in its jurisdiction, such as Sales and EBITDA.
Section 8.13	When an opening for a Head Meat Cutter, Head Checker, Head
Produce Clerk, Head Grocery Clerk, and Head Non-Foods Clerk occurs, a job opening notice for that Department Head position will be posted in every store within the bargaining unit. The most senior back-up in that department, who signed the job opening notice, will be awarded the position. If no back-up in that department accepts the position, the position will be filled by the most senior clerk who has their request filed in accordance with Section 8.11.
Present back-ups as of October 10, 1999, will maintain their position. The back-up list will be kept current and sent to the Union office. As back-up positions become available, they will be filled by senior employees that have signed the appropriate department letter.
If a back-up fails to bid the department head position in his home store when it becomes vacant, they will be removed from the back-up position.
Section 8.14	It is understood that signing a job opening notice, and/or a job
bid, is acknowledgment by the employee that if awarded the position, the employee must accept the position.
