Agreement between
COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS
OF AMERICA
*
and
Ha (?(F
@ BELLSOUTH
BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc.
EFFECTIVE August 5,2001 — §7//o y
I
TO EMPLOYEES:
The Communications Workers of America is the official bargaining representative for all employees in your collective bargaining unit. This official relationship carries with it serious obligations and responsibilities which the Company and the Union are determined to fulfill. As a sign of good faith between BellSouth Telecommunications and the Communications Workers of America, a "Responsible Relationship" clause, Article 28, is included in the Agreement, which governs your wages, hours and working conditions.
Simply stated, "mutual respect and responsibility" means an honest regard 'for equality in the official relationship between Company and Union representatives. It does not allow for a supervisor attempting to "pull rank" on a Union representative nor does it allow for a Union representative attempting to intimidate or "badger" a supervisor merely because there is a difference in point of view. It further means that no Company representative at any level should regard a grievance as merely an irritant, just as it also means that no Union representative should offer "grievances" which are designed only to harass management. Additionally, this clause means that Union and Company representatives must not engage in activities to undercut or belittle each other.
Company representatives, especially the first level of supervision, have the day-to-day responsibility to deal reasonably and in good faith with Union representatives. They have the right, in return, to expect responsibility and respect from the Union's representatives. To insure continually improving relations between the Company and Union, it is the intent of both organizations to deal with one another at all levels in a sincere, honest and businesslike manner. This effort by both parties should insure a better feeling for the needs of the employees.	■
For the Union;
James E, Smith Vice President
Sincerely,
For the Company:
Richard Sibbemsen
Vice President

2.	When the break in service has been 6 calendar months or more, the former service shall be bridged after 3 continuous years of service, and the seniority date adjusted accordingly.
C.	Part-time employees hired on or after January I, 1990 and full-time employees hired after January 1, 1990 who are subsequently reclassified to part-time will accrue seniority on a prorated basis.

ARTICLE 2 WAGES
2.01 Wage Rates.
A.	Full-Time Employees. The rates of pay and progression wage scales for full-time employees shall be those shown in Appendix B, Part I attached hereto and made a part hereof.
B.	Part-Time Employees.
1,	Except for payment for overtime hours worked, all hours worked by a part-time employee in DM/DR (Direct Marketing/Direct Response) Centers and any equivalent retail sales or service centers operation, shall be paid at the
10
1.37-2.0IB4
equivalent basic hourly rate for a comparable full-time employee working a normal daily tour in the same job title, classification, and work group. Payment to a parttime employee for hours worked in excess of an equivalent normal daily tour or work week for a comparable full-time employee shall be at the applicable overtime rate for a comparable full-time employee based on such part-time employee's basic hourly rate.
2.	Any regular employee who is on the active payroll of the Company as of December 31, 1980, and who works parttime on or after January 1, 1981, shall thereafter continue, during the current term of employment, to be paid on the same basis as was applicable to such a part-time employee on December31, 1980as follows:
a.	The rate of pay and amount of increase for a part-time employee shall be prorated by relating his/her hours of work to the normal work week.
b.	A part-time employee shall receive progression increases at the same intervals as a full-time employee.
3.	The classification of a part-time employee is based on the employee's "part-time equivalent work week" which shall be determined prospectively by dividing the employee’s total normally scheduled hours per month by 4.35 and rounding the result to the next higher whole number. (Illustration: 68 hours per month divided by 4.35 equals 15.6 rounded to a "part-time equivalent work week” classification of 16.)
4.	The "part-time equivalent work week" classification of each part-time employee shall be reviewed by the Company on April I and October 1 of each year and more often if appropriate. Indicated adjustments, if appropriate, will be on a prospective basis. In determining whether such adjustment is appropriate, the Company will consider the actual average number of hours worked per month during the preceding 6 month period and the likelihood
11
Article 2
	that such number of work hours will continue for a reasonably foreseeable period of time except that any hours worked which are paid at the overtime rate shall not be counted in computing the average number of hours worked. 5.	For employees who are hired on or after January 1, 1981, and who work as regular part-time employees, payments to a regular part-time employee for sickness disability, accident disability, or death benefits under the "Short Term Disability Plan", vacations, holidays, anticipated disability leave, sickness absence (not under the "Short Term Disability Plan") or termination allowance (or its equivalent) shall be prorated based on the relationship of the individual part-time employee’s "part-time equivalent work week" to the normal work week of a comparable full-time employee in the same job title, classification and work group. 6.	Regular employees who are on the active payroll of the Company as of December 31, 1980, and who work parttime on or after January 1, 1981, shall thereafter continue, during the current term of employment, to receive payments for the benefits and other items listed above on the same basis as was applicable to a part-time employee on December 31,1980.
2.02	Starting Rates. A.	Except as provided in ”B" of this Section, a person engaged to work in one of the titles listed in Appendix A, Part 1, shall receive the rate designated "Start" on the progression wage scale for his/her title in the appropriate schedule for his/her location as shown in Appendix B, Part 1. B.	Appropriate allowances for wage experience calling for rates higher than such "Start" rates may be made as outlined in the sub-sections of this paragraph. (CPE see Customer Markets Addendum)
12
2.01B5 - 2.02B3a
1.	Honorably discharged veterans of Armed Forces who were discharged from the Armed Forces within 2 years prior to their employment may be granted wage experience credit for a maximum of 75% of their period of military service, except that this credit shall not exceed 30 months.
2.	Persons without previous telephone experience upon initial employment may be granted wage experience credit for previous experience or special training of value. Normally this credit shall not exceed 50% of such actual experience or training time nor result in an allowable maximum credit of more than 30 months.
3.	An employee formerly employed by the Company, another BellSouth company, or any company as required by applicable law(s), shall have his/her former wage experience credit adjusted in accordance with the following table if re-employed in the same or lower-rated job classification:
For Months Out of Service
Less than 6 Months
6 but less than 12 Months 12 but less than 18 Months 18 but less than 24 Months 24 but less than 30 Months 30 but less than 36 Months 36 but less than 42 Months 42 but less than 48 Months 48 but less than 54 Months Over 54 Months
Number of Months to be Deducted from Former Wage Length of Service
0 Months
2	Months
3	Months
5	Months
7	Months
8	Months
9	Months
10	Months
11	Months
12	Months
a.	If the employee had experience or training during his/her absence from the Company or another BellSouth company which the Company considers of value, he/she will be given credit for this experience or training in addition to the credit provided above.
13
Article 2
Normally this credit shall not exceed 50% of such actual experience or training time nor result in an allowable maximum credit of more than 30 months of this outside experience or training.
b.	Each of a series of successive breaks in service shall be computed in the same manner using the table above.
c.	The above table does not apply to an employee reengaged within 4 years after layoff as provided in Article 7 or employees returning from authorized leaves as provided in Article 6, but he/she will receive credit for the outside experience or training of value under "a*1 above.
4.	The provisions of '*3" above shall also be applicable to such a former employee when re-employed in a higherrated job classification except that his/her wage rate and wage length of service on the higher-rated job shall be established as follows:	-
a.	The wage rate to be received on the higher-rated job shall be either the same as that calculated by the use of the above table for the lower-rated job at the exchange/WRA to which the employee is re-employed or the starting rate of the higher-rated job, whichever is greater. If the calculated rate is not an exact step on the wage scale for the higher-rated job, the employee shall be paid the nearest higher step rate.
b.	The wage length of service shall be the number of months applicable to the wage rate determined by '*a" above.
5.	An employee of another BellSouth company transferring to this Company on a higher-rated job classification shall have wage rate and wage length of service computed according to "a" and "b" of 2.02B4. An employee of another BellSouth company transferring to this Company in the same or lower-rated job classification will be given
14
2.02B3b - 2.05
credit for the wage experience accrued with the other BellSouth company. The employee’s wage rate will be determined by reading the wage length of service directly into the wage scale being entered.
6.	Upon employment, persons who have previous experience with telecommunications companies shall be given wage experience credit commensurate with such previous training and experience that is of value to the Company, but in no event shall the wage experience credit allowed be more than the employee would have received had such previous training and experience been with this Company or another BellSouth Company as determined under the provisions of 2.02B3 of the Agreement.
C. This section shall not apply to persons initially engaged for technical assignments, or to persons engaged for typing or stenographic work or other work comparable to the work performed by such persons prior to their engagement by the Company.
2.0	3 Wage Progression Schedules.
Wage progression increases shall be automatic unless the wage scales specifically state otherwise.
2.0	4 Effective Date for Progression Increases.
The effective date for progression increases shall be the beginning of the payroll period nearest the first day of the calendar month for employees engaged between the first and fifteenth days of the month, and shall be the beginning of the payroll period nearest the first day of the next succeeding month for employees engaged ’ between the sixteenth and the last day of the month.
2.05 Flexible Starting Rates.
It is agreed that the starting rate specified for any of the wage scales listed in Appendix B for any exchange or in Customer Markets Addendum for any WRA may be increased when the Company determines that the employment situation warrants such action in accordance with the following:
15
Article 2
A.	In the event that such action is taken, the progression steps on the wage scale or scales affected at such exchange/WRA or exchanges/WRA’s shall be revised in accordance with the following procedure unless otherwise agreed between the Company and the Union:
I.	Establish the new starting rate which shall be an increase of not less than $3.00 per week.
2.	Establish new progression steps in multiples of 50#, but not less than $1.00, to meld the increased starting rate into the existing wage scale.
3.	The new progression steps shall be established at intervals of not less than 3 months nor more than 12 months.
B.	On the date the new starting rate is placed in effect, the Company agrees to adjust the wage rates of all employees on the payroll as of that date to the new rates established in accordance with their wage experience.
C.	At any time after the above action has been taken, the Company may reinstate the wage rates provided in the related wage scale or scales listed in Appendix B. However, if this is done, no employee on the payroll at that time will have his/her wage rate reduced because of this action.
D.	The Company shall notify the Union in all instances where changes in starting rates are to be made. The Union shall have the right within 30 days from receipt of notice by the Company to conduct negotiations concerning such changes.
2.06 Promotional Increases.
Employees promoted from one job to another within the bargaining unit will be accorded the following pay treatment:
A.	Promotional increases will be the higher of the start rate of the job to which promoted or 10% of the same step rate on the promoted-to wage scale added to the current pay, rounded up to the next higher step of the promoted-to wage scale, not to exceed the maximum rate for the promoted-to job.
16
2.05A-2.07A1
Example:
Office Assistant on 24th month of WS 10, is promoted to a Special Assistant on WS 14
Current Pay for WS 10, 24th month = $517.50
WS 14, 24th month $563.50 x 10% = $56.35 (Promotional
Increase)
$517.50+ $56.35 = $573.85 (Proposed rate of pay)
The nearest higher step on WS 14 is the 30th month. The employee will be moved to this step at $593.50 and wage experience adjusted to provide the employee with 30 months wage experience.
B.	For wage experience credit treatment for employees reclassified to a lower-rated job and who are subsequently promoted to a job on their previous wage scale within 5 years, see 8.03D.
C.	Where an employee is transferred to another exchange/WRA pursuant to a promotion, the transfer will first be made under 2.07 as appropriate, then the rate of pay will be calculated as shown in this article.
2,07 Transfers Without Change in Wage Scale to Exchanges/WRAs Having Lower/Higher Wage Zones/Wage Areas,
A.	Employees with 6 months service transferring to a lower wage zone/wage area shall suffer no change in their rate of pay unless their rate of pay is more than the maximum of the new zone/area. If their rate of pay is above the maximum at the new zone/area, the rate shall be reduced to the maximum. For employees with less than 6 months of service, the rate of pay shall be adjusted at the time of transfer to the rate applicable to their wage experience credit on the wage scale for the lower zone/area.
1.	If his/her rate is not above the maximum at the new location he/she shall continue at such rate until his/her
17
I
Article 3
wage length of service entitles him/her to an increase on the wage scale in effect at the new location.
B.	When an employee transfers to a higher wage zonc/area, his rate of pay shall be adjusted to the same wage length of service for the higher zone/area.
C.	"A" and "B*1 above do not apply to transfers from other BellSouth companies. (See 2.02B5 for details on how to determine wage rates and wage experience credit for employees transferring from other BellSouth companies.)
ARTICLE 3 SCHEDULING
3.01 Work Schedules.
A. Work schedules for all employees shall be posted officially by 1 i:00 A.M. on each Thursday to show for each such employee his/her scheduled or assigned tours for the next 2 calendar weeks, except that all holiday schedules shall be posted not later than 11:00 A.M. on Tuesday of the second week preceding the week in which the holiday falls.
B Work schedules shall stipulate the starting and ending time of such tours, together with the starting and ending time of each session. Intervals between sessions shall not be shifted, at the instance of the Company, except as necessary to meet service requirements.
1.	Lunch or meal periods between sessions which are shifted by the Company shall not be considered as a shift of tours under 3.03G.
2.	"B" above does not require the posting of starting and ending time of sessions for those tours that have no meal period.
C. Where employees work common hours as a group, a statement stating the hours may be posted for the work group.
18
2.07B-3.02B
	D. At locations where no management person is assigned to supervise the employee involved, a letter to such employee which meets the requirements of 3.01B may be addressed to him/her advising that until further notice he/she is to work that schedule. At such locations, this shall be considered as complying with 3.01A.
3.02	Choice of Tours. A. Employees shall have the opportunity to exercise their seniority in preference for choice of tours, not less frequently than every 13 weeks (except where an employee enters the work group after assignment of tours have been made as outlined in Article 3). Employees returning from leaves of absence, layoff, employees coming in by transfer or employees who have their service bridged (entitling them to additional seniority), shall be granted choice of tours in accordance with their seniority at the next revision of the schedule. Once the basic schedule is completed on the basis of the above, no change shall be made in basic tour assignments until the next selection period except that the Company finds it necessary for service requirements to revise the basic schedule in less than 13 weeks. With each such revision in a basic schedule, the opportunity to exercise preference for choice of tours will be afforded. B. Preference for choice of tours as set forth in this section does not contemplate the choice of furlough days (meaning nonscheduled days) which shall be assigned by the Company in such a manner as to arrange for every employee periodically to secure desirable furlough days. Sunday and holiday schedules shall be rotated among the employees within a work group in such a manner as to provide for the approximate equalization of both premium pay work opportunity and the privilege of securing Sundays and holidays as furlough days. Each holiday will be considered separately insofar as practicable in the rotation of holiday schedules. For Operating Room Forces of Operator Services only, Christmas Eve, Mother's Day, New Year’s Eve, and Easter shall also be
19
Article 3
	rotated even though they are not considered authorized holidays. i.	When December 25th and January 1st fall on Sunday, holiday schedules for Operating Room Forces of Operator Services will be rotated for work on Sunday rather than Monday which is considered the holiday under 5.02. For employees who express a preference, choice of tours on such days worked shall nevertheless be assigned in the order of seniority. 2.	Employees on vacation for one or more full weeks will be considered unavailable for rotation of Sunday and holiday schedules beginning with Sunday of the first week and 1 ending with Saturday of the last week.
3.03	Scheduling Tours. A. Insofar as service requirements permit, the Company shall assign tours in accordance with the preference of employees in the order of their seniority, except that seniority shall not entitle any employee to select a tour assigned by the Company to an Operator having less than six weeks' service. Training tours for Consumer Service Representatives will normally not exceed 8 weeks, but may last up to 12 weeks with discussion with the Local President. Tours will be scheduled and assigned in accordance with 3.04 or 3.05 below. It is not the intent of this article or any other provision in this Agreement to require the Company to revise a posted work schedule so as to assign an employee entering the work group the tours to which his/her seniority would otherwise entitle him/her. B. Tours may fall on any day of the week necessary to meet service requirements, except that the tours and part tours which make up the normal work week may not be spread over more than 6 days of the calendar week.
20
3.02B1 -3.O3F
1.	Scheduled time is comprised of tours and/or part tours, and the scheduled time for any work day shall not exceed the length of a normal tour.
2.	Operating Room Forces week day schedules shall not include part tours that are the equivalent of morningafternoon tours, unless it is necessary to use such part tours because of service requirements.
3.	In the event it becomes necessary to schedule an employee to work more than 5 tours in a calendar week, the sixth and seventh day shall be considered as premium days on the weekly work schedule.
C.	No employee will be scheduled to work more than 13 consecutive days nor be required to work six days per week for more than two consecutive weeks without his/her consent except where acute service conditions develop caused by unanticipated service needs, fire, flood, storm, or other natural disaster. (See Appendix C, Part XII.)
D.	Insofar as service requirements will permit, a minimum time interval of 12 hours (11 hours for Operating Room Forces) shall elapse between the scheduled ending time of one tour and the scheduled starting time of the next, except when a tour is assigned to an employee with less than the minimum interval between tours because of that employee exercising his/her seniority for the choice of tours. In such case the Company may change the employee’s schedule, at his/her request, pursuant to section 3.O3G, to provide for the minimum interval between tours. Such a change will not be made in violation of the seniority rights of any other employee.
E.	Part tours may be scheduled for full-time employees; however, the Company recognizes the undesirability of scheduling such part tours for full-time employees.
F.	Employees shall be either scheduled and excused or scheduled to work on authorized holidays.
21
Article 3
1.	Insofar as service requirements permit, employees shall be excused on authorized holidays.
2.	Insofar as service requirements permit, holiday assignments shall be rotated among the employees within a particular work group in accordance with 3.02,3.04 and 3.05.
G.	Changes from officially posted weekly work schedules may be made, provided such changes do not result in a full-time employee being scheduled for less than a normal week and further provided such changes do not result in the payment by the Company of additional overtime, premium or penalty hours during the week involved, to provide for changes in hours, work days, or off days in accordance with the following:
1.	At the instance of the Company.
2.	At the written request of employees.
a.	Such requested changes shall be made when no replacement of the employee's schedule is required and when the services of the employee making the request may be profitably used during the hours to which he/she wishes to change.
b.	When a replacement of the employee's schedule is required, the change shall be made provided an agreeable shift can be made in the schedule of another employee and provided such other employee agrees to work the shifted tour at the regular rate. ’
c.	If the Company contacts an employee in connection with a shift of his/her tour and the employee agrees to the shift, the shift shall not be considered to be made at the request of the employee.
d.	Employees who are normally scheduled for tours ending after 7:00 P.M. will be scheduled for day tours (comparable to day tours worked by other employees in the work group) with starting times as near as
22
3.03F1 -3.03H3
possible to the court convening time, (or their schedule changed to such day tours) on the days they are to serve as jurors or witnesses. This will not be considered a shift of tours under 4.01E.
H.	Flexible Scheduling Concepts.
!. The concepts listed in this section are designed to provide a variety of flexible schedules. The provisions listed in this section apply to all of the concepts, except as specified in 3.031, J, K. and L. It is mutually agreed that neither party will support efforts to derive incidental or indirect benefits not specifically addressed in the various flexible concepts.
2.	Eligibility:
The flexible concepts may be applied to regular or temporary employees. It is recognized that these concepts may not be applicable for all work groups. Where utilized, the concepts) will normally be offered to all eligible employees in the work group or administrative work unit which for the purpose of these concepts is defined as one or more supervisory groups of employees in the same title and department who have a common place of reporting and who perform essentially the same type of work. However, there may be situations justifying departure from this rule.
3.	Implementation:
Prior to implementation of a flexible concept, agreement must be reached between the local Union President and the Director of the involved work group concerning specific guidelines which fail within the general parameters for the pertinent concept. These agreements must be concurred in by the CWA State Representative and the Director - Labor Relations prior to implementation. Each party reserves the right to discontinue use of a concept with at least 30 days written notice. Disputes arising from implementation or
23
Article 3
discontinuance not resolved at the local or State Level will be referred to the Executive Level,
4.	Scheduling Tours:
Tours will be scheduled in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 and will incorporate any specific tour requirements necessary for a certain concept It is recognized that certain conditions, such as attendance in schools, may necessitate the temporary reverting to a normal work schedule. It is not intended that the 30-day notification rule apply in these cases, nor would this be considered a change in schedule.
5.	Absences:
Excused absences (HP, MP, UAP, IP, etc.) would be paid at the appropriate number of hours for the scheduled day. Full weeks of IB absence and leaves of absence would be calculated based on a normal 5-day schedule.
6.	Overtime:
The overtime provisions outlined in Article 4 apply for overtime worked in excess of the scheduled tour.
7.	Differentials:
No evening or night differentials will be applicable for a person on flexible scheduling concepts unless some or all of the hours he/she works would have fallen within the differential period of 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. had the person not been on a flexible scheduling concept.
L Four-Day Work Week - Provision allowing the scheduling of a normal work week over 4 days.
I.	Tour Hours:
For employees normally scheduled 40 hours per week, each tour will be of 10 hours duration except as noted in 2 below. For those normally scheduled 37 1/2 hours per week, the maximum tour length will be 9 1/2 hours and the minimum tour length will be 9 hours. The length of a
24
3.03H4 - 3.0313
session will not exceed 5 3/4 hours with one 15-minute relief period assigned or allowed as near to the mid-point of each session as practicable.
2.	Holiday Week:
During a week with a specified holiday or Company Designated Excused Work Day, the employee will be scheduled 7 1/2 or 8 hours, as appropriate, on the holiday. For the remainder of the hours, the Local President and Director may mutually agree to allow the option of reverting to a normal 5-day schedule or scheduling the remaining hours over a 3-day period for any or all employees on a 4-day week. In the latter case the 3 nonholiday tours may be up to 11 hours duration.
3.	Time Off:
One week segments of vacation will be scheduled and paid at either 37 1/2 or 40 hours per week as appropriate, based on the employee's normal work week. Vacation days taken in less than a full week segment, excused work days, and optional holidays will be based upon the length of the scheduled day and will be subtracted from the total hours of annual time-off entitlement (See chart below). Where there are insufficient hours remaining in any one category (vacation, EWD or optional holiday) to equate to a full tour, employees may combine hours from any of the three categories up to the length of a full tour. As an exception, a four-day work week employee excused on a Company Designated Excused Work Day will be paid for the entire day regardless of the remaining hours of paid EWD hours to which he/she is entitled. It is not intended that an employee would be forced to report to work in cases where less than a session remains after the exhaustion of vacation/EWD/optional holiday hours; however, if he/she wishes to take the entire session or tour off, he/she would be required to take non-paid time for the remaining hours of the session/tour.

4.	Differential:
With the exception of differentials described under 3.03H7, the payment of evening and night differentials shall be based upon tours which fall wholly or partly within the period from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a m. (For the job titles listed in Paragraph 3.07, evening and night differentials will not be paid for any tour with an ending time earlier than 8:00 p.m.)
J.	Flexible Time Scheduling - Provisions allowing flexibility in starting or ending times for tours.
1.	Eligibility:
Occasional employees are excluded.
2.	Implementation:
This concept does not require concurrence at the State Level.

3.0314 -3.O3K1
3.	Tour Hours:
Certain hours will be designated as core hours during the full range of hours which employees in a work group may be required to cover. At least 60% of the group’s normal work day should be covered by the core hours. Each employee will be required to be at work during the core hours; however, he/she may vary his/her beginning and ending times within the full range of hours in compliance with scheduling guidelines. Once basic tours are chosen, employees will be considered to be working these stated scheduled hours, even if they are on flextime.
4.	Overtime:
Call-outs which precede and connect to the basic schedule, and connecting overtime which is required prior to the start time of the basic schedule will be calculated based on the basic schedule, not on the flexible start time which an employee may have chosen. Connecting overtime following the completion of the employee's tour will be calculated based on the hours actually worked, not on the scheduled hours.
5.	Reverting to a basic schedule:
Employees on Flexible Time Scheduling may be required to revert to a basic schedule on a specified holiday.
K.	Flexible Length Tour Scheduling - Provision which allows the number of hours which presently constitute a normal work week to be scheduled in various length tours over either 4 or 5 days.
1.	Tour Hours:
There must be a minimum of 1 hour's difference between the shortest and longest tour for the week. No scheduled tour may exceed 10 hours nor be less than 1/2 the length of a normal tour under a 5-day schedule. A tour must be comprised of two sessions with a minimum length of 2 hours and a maximum of 5 hours. Relief periods will be
27
Article 3
allowed as near the mid-point of the session as practicable. For tours of 6,5 hours or less, one 30-minute relief will be allowed as near the mid-point of the session as practicable,
2,	Time Off:
The provisions of 3,0313 will also apply to Flexible Length Tour Scheduling,
3.	Holiday Week:
During a week with a specified holiday or Company Designated Excused Work Day, all employees will revert to a normal (7 1/2 or 8 hour) length tour for that day.
L. 30-30-30 Concept - Provisions allowing the normal work day to be broken into four parts, separated by three 30-minute breaks.
1.	Eligibility:
30-30-30 will normally be applied to employees working a four-day work week; however, where mutually agreed, the concept may be applied to 5-day work week employees. Where implemented, 30-30-30 will be offered to all members of the affected group unless otherwise agreed upon by the Local President and Director. Employees will be allowed to choose individually whether they wish to be placed on 30-30-30 or a traditional schedule.
2.	Tour Hours:
For the purpose of this concept, a session is considered to be 2 of the 4 parts of the tour, separated by the second 30-minute break. In determining the handling of relief and meal periods, the first 15 minutes of the first break will be considered the first relief period; the last 15 minutes of the last break will be considered the second relief period; all the break time between these 2 relief periods will be considered the meal period.

3.03K2 - 3.04B2a
3.04 Assignment of Tours Other Than Open-End Scheduling.
A.	For all forces, other than employees scheduled in accordance with 3,05 where employees in the work group are not scheduled identical tours or sessions, the following principles and general procedures for the selection of tours will govern with the following exceptions:
1.	In work groups of 3 or less employees, the Company is not required to post the list described in "B2a" and ''B2b" below.
2.	An employee assigned to a work group to relieve an absent employee will work the tour assigned to the absent employee.
3.	In the Business Office where an employee is temporarily assigned to a work group other than his/her own during a peak load period, his/her regular lunch period may be changed to meet service requirements during such temporary assignment.
4.	In the Network Department, the provisions of 3-04B7 will apply for tours on Sunday or holidays although separate schedules are not used.
B.	In conformity with Article 13, the following procedures shall be followed in the assigning of tours:
I,	Employees will have the privilege of exercising seniority in preference for choice of tours in accordance with their seniority dates posted on the seniority list, and the Company will assign tours as chosen insofar as service requirements will permit.
2.	Not more than 4 weeks prior to the specified effective date of a new basic week day schedule (Monday through Friday or Monday through Saturday, as appropriate) or in the reassignment of an existing basic schedule, the Company will concurrently post:
a.	A copy of the schedule (or a notice) indicating the starting and ending time of tours, together with the
29
Article 3
starting and ending time of each session and the number of each group of tours.
Example-
Number
Schedule Tours	of Tours
8:00 A.M. to 12:00 Noon-
12:30 P.M. to 4:00 P.M.	6
8:15 A.M. to 12:15 P.M.-
1:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M.	4
9:30 A.M. to 1:00 P.M.-
5:00 P.M. to 9:00 P.M.	3
3:00 P.M. to 7:00 P.M.-
8:00 P.M. to 11:00 P.M. 3
The posting shall also show the effective date of the new schedule and the date (not earlier than 3 days following the date of posting) on which the Company will begin contacting employees as provided under "3" below.
b.	A list for each work group indicating the seniority date of each employee as of the effective date of the new schedule. For employees who will have their service bridged in accordance with 1.26B prior to or on the effective date of the new schedule, the seniority date to be indicated will be the new seniority date arrived at by such bridging of seniority. No change shall be made in the seniority date shown on the list for an employee after his/her new seniority date has been passed in the assignment of tours. For the purpose of this section, employees temporarily assigned to a different work group in the same exchange/WRA will be considered as members of their regular group.
Employees with "Acting'* titles in work groups other than those in which they regularly work will be included on the seniority list for the work group in which the "Acting" title is held, unless it is expected
30
3.04B2b - 3.04b3a
that the employees will return to their regular work group on or before the effective date of the new schedule.
c.	Where it is known prior to contacting for choice of tours that employees are to enter the work group under the provisions of Article 7 on or after the effective date of the new schedule, such employees will be listed on the seniority list referred to in "b” above and contacted for choice of tours under the provisions of "3*' below.
3.	The Company will make a reasonable effort to contact employees on the seniority list in the order listed for the purpose of obtaining preferences for choice of tours except for the following: employees on vacation, employees absent from the town of their residence and employees on leave of absence. Since such contacts and the assignment to basic tours or to the relief force will be made in the order of seniority in accordance with the list referred to in "2b" above, the time consumed in attempting to contact each employee will be necessarily limited. Accordingly, it is contemplated that employees will express in advance assignments they prefer if they will not be readily available for such contact. Changes shall not be made in any assignment after an assignment is made to the next person on the list
a.	Employees on vacation, employees on leave of absence who are expected to return on or before the effective date of schedule, employees absent from the town of their residence, and employees whom the Company was unsuccessful in its efforts to contact, unless they have expressed in advance a preference for a different available tour or an assignment to the relief force, shall be given assignments identical with their present assignments, if available. Employees who have not expressed a preference for an available tour, and for whom an identical assignment is not available, shall be assigned a tour of the same general type (MA,
31
Article 3
ME, A, etc.) with the nearest ending time to the ending time of their present assignment, or if a tour of the same general type is not available then a tour of a different type with the nearest ending time to the ending time of their present assignment.
b.	Employees on leave of absence who are expected to return on or before the effective date of the schedule who did not work during the present schedule and have not expressed a preference for choice of an available assignment on the new schedule shall be assigned any available tour or to the relief force.
c.	Employees who are assigned to the relief force under this Section may exercise their seniority in preference for choice of tours to be worked by the relief force. If preferred tours are not available, they shall be assigned tours of the same general type with an ending time nearest the ending time of the preferred tour. If tours of the same general type are not available, they shall be assigned tours of a different type with the ending time nearest the ending time of the preferred tour.
4.	After one or more employees with less seniority have been assigned, employees shall be placed on the seniority list described in "B2b" above immediately following the last employee who was assigned and shall have the next preference for choice of the assignments, upon any of the following conditions:
•	Employees on leave of absence who were not expected to return before the effective date of the schedule.
•	Employees reporting into the work group for duty by transfer, engagement, re-engagement, etc.
•	Where it becomes known during the contacting for choice of tours that employees are to enter the work
32
3.04B3b - 3.04B7
group under the provisions of Article 7 on or after the effective date of the new schedule.
5.	Employees who enter the work group or who return to work (except those returning from vacation or benefits) after all employees on the seniority list have been assigned shall have no seniority for preference in choice of assignments on this schedule. However, employees (except those re-entering by transfer or re-engagement) who have been given an assignment on the new schedule, who return to the work group during the period the schedule is in effect, shall continue on such assignments for the duration of the schedule.
a.	Where employees enter the work group under the provisions of Article 7 after all assignments have been made, such employees shall exercise full seniority for choice of tours in the relief force and on separate schedules.
b.	Employees mentioned in "5" above, who are considered as having no seniority for choice of assignments, will have no seniority for this purpose; but, where there are 2 or more such employees in the work group, they shall be afforded an opportunity to exercise seniority among themselves in preference for choice of assignments on the weekly work schedule.
6.	Employees having their service bridged after the effective date of the new schedule, thus entitling them to additional seniority, shall have the opportunity to express preference for choice of tours at the next time all employees within the group have an opportunity to express this preference. Until that time the old service date will determine seniority for choice of tours.
7.	Where separate schedules are used for Saturday and/or Sunday, Holidays, Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, and on days observed locally as holidays (which affect work
33
Article 3
loads, but are not observed as Company holidays), the following procedures shall be followed:
a.	Concurrently with the posting of the basic schedule, the Company shall also post copies of separate Saturday schedules, if any, and Sunday schedules (or notices as illustrated in "2a” above).
1)	When changes are made in separate Saturday and/or Sunday schedules, the Company will post the new separate schedule (or a notice) by not later than Monday of the second week preceding the week in which the new schedule becomes effective.
2)	When separate holiday schedules or other separate schedules (as referred to above) are to be used, the Company will post a copy of the schedule (or notice) by not later than Monday of the fourth week preceding the week in which the schedule involved becomes effective. However, the rotation of holiday work, as provided under 3.02B, is to be applied only on holidays observed as authorized Company holidays.
b.	Employees shall have the same seniority for preferences for choice of tours on separate schedules as they have for preference for choice of tours on the basic schedule. Where such separate schedules are used, employees who have different preferences for choice of tours for work on such schedules shall express a preference for choice of tours to be worked on such schedules at the same time they express a preference for choice of tours on the basic schedule. For employees who do not express a different preference for choice of tours to be worked on such schedules, their preferences for choice of tours on the basic schedule shall be considered to be their
34
3.04B7a - 3.04B8
preference for choice of tours on such separate schedules.
c.	Preferences for choice of tours shall continue in effect for the duration of the basic schedule unless changed as provided in "d" below. Employees who are to be assigned to work on Sundays or holidays, under the provisions of 3.02B shall be assigned, in accordance with their seniority, tours of their preference (or the nearest available tours as described in "3a" above), insofar as service requirements permit. Employees who express preferences for choice of tours under "d" below shall be assigned tours of their preference, if available, or the nearest available tour, in the order of seniority, among all those employees who are to be assigned to work on the day or days involved.
d.	Employees who wish to change their preferences for choice of tours on separate Saturday and/or Sunday schedules shall notify their supervisor of their preferences for choice of such tours by not later than noon Monday preceding the Thursday on which the work schedule involved will be posted. Employees who wish to change their preferences for choice of tours on other separate schedules shall notify their supervisor of their preference for choice of such tours by not later than noon Monday of the third week preceding the week in which the other separate schedule is to be worked. Such changes in preferences for choice of tours should specify that the change is for a particular day or for such separate schedules during the remainder of the basic schedule.
8.	Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article and 3.02, employees entering or returning to the work group who have not been given work assignments in the current weekly work schedule may be assigned any available tours until the assignments on the next posted weekly work schedule are effective.
35
Article 3
3.05 Force Movement - Operator Services Department (Operating Room Employees).
A.	The term "force group" as used herein applies to a group of Operating Room employees who may exercise their seniority for choice of tours on the same basic schedule and who report to the same Manager-Operator Services. Any reference io a "work group" in the Working Agreement shall be considered as applying to a "force group" insofar as Operating Room Forces are concerned.
B.	Employees may submit requests in writing to their ManagerOperator Services for reassignment to another force group under the same Manager-Operator Services or to another force group in a different Manager-Operator Services Unit at the same place of reporting. Such requests will be valid for a period of 6 months.
C.	Requests, in order to be actively considered, must meet the following conditions and limitations:
1.	The employee has been a member of his/her present force group for at least 6 months,
2.	The employee feels such reassignment will permit him/her to better exercise his/her seniority for choice of tours in the new force group.
3.	Service requirements will permit the release of the employee from the present force group.
4.	The services of the employee can be utilized in the other force group.
5.	The employee has been trained and is presently qualified to perform the work of the other force group.
D.	Requests which meet the conditions and limitations of "C" above shall be granted in the older of seniority among all employees having a valid request in, and, insofar as practicable, such reassignments shall be made effective as of
36
3.05 - 3.05G
the effective date of the next basic schedule for the force group in which the employees are to be reassigned.
I.	Employees who are to be reassigned to another force group as of the effective date of the new basic schedule shall be included in the order of their seniority on the posted seniority list for such force group prior to the date on which the Company begins contacting employees for choice of tours, even though they will not be reassigned until the effective date of the new schedule.
2.	Employees reassigned to another force group shall have the same seniority for choice of tours on separate schedules as they have for choice of tours on the basic schedule.
E.	Employees entering a force group by reassignment at their request who have not completed their vacation for the vacation year shall make a selection from any of the remaining available vacation periods, if service requirements do not permit them to take the periods previously selected.
F.	Employees who request reassignment from one force group to another at the same place of reporting who are not reassigned because of their failure to meet the conditions of "C5" above will be placed on a training list and shall remain on this list until reassignment is made or the expiration of the 6 months period, whichever comes first.
1.	While the Company does not cross-train solely to provide more desirable tours, cross-training for such employees may, nevertheless, be appropriate. Insofar as service requirements permit, such employees will be given training in the order of seniority before other employees are given training on the work involved.
G.	During periods of light traffic, such as night, Saturday, Sunday and Holidays, one or more force groups or ManagerOperator Services Units may be assigned to handle the work which would otherwise be handled by other force groups and/or Manager-Operator Services Units.
37
Article 3
	H.	Ordinarily, a Manager-Operator Services Unit should consist of one force group for Operators. However, where there are multi-services provided within a Manager-Operator Services Unit and one force group is not practicable separate force groups (with separate schedules, seniority lists, and relief forces) may be used, provided each force group handles the work assigned to it without regularly relieving Operators in other force groups. I.	When reassignments are to be made at the instance of the Company, consideration shall be given to the wishes of the employees insofar as service* requirements permit.
3.06	Assignment of Tours - Open-End Scheduling Procedures will apply for the following: ♦	Operating Room Forces of Operator Services, •	Centralized Repair Centers, •	Service Evaluation Forces, •	Service Representatives (not applicable for CPE), •	Collections Representatives, •	and any other administrative work unit as may be agreed to by the Company and the Union at the local level and concurred in at a higher level. A. In conformity with Article 13, the following procedures will be followed in the assigning of tours in 3.06 above. 1.	Where separate schedules are used for Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, and on days observed locally as holidays, the Company will post a copy of the hours of operations by no later than Monday of the third week preceding the week in which the schedule involved becomes effective. 2.	Employees will express their preferences for tours by completing and signing a "Choice of Hours" form and submitting it to the immediate supervisor or designated representative. Four separate preferences will be shown as follows: Weekday, Saturday, Sunday, and holidays. Employees will be assigned in accordance with their
38
3.05H - 3.06A3b
seniority tours for which they have expressed a preference, or, if such tours are not available, another tour of the same type, for Operating Room Forces only, tours (as specified in Table A of 3.07) or, if not available, a tour of a different type with an ending time nearest the ending time of the stated choice insofar as service requirements permit Preferences recorded on this form will remain in effect until they are changed by the employee as provided below.
a.	Weekday, Saturday or Sunday Schedules -• Any employee may change his/her preference for choice of hours for Weekday, Saturday or Sunday Schedules by submitting a revised "Choice of Hours" form by not later than Tuesday noon of the third week preceding the week he/she desires the change to be effective.
b.	Holiday Schedules •• Any employee may change his/her preference for choice of hours on holiday schedules by submitting a revised "Choice of Hours" form by not later than noon Tuesday of the third week preceding the week in which the holiday schedule is to be worked.
3.	Employees entering the work group (returns from leaves, transfers-in, instances where seniority has bridged, etc.) will, upon their entry, be inserted in the seniority list at the point their seniority dates indicate they should be placed. These employees will have the opportunity to exercise their seniority for choice of tours on the next posted weekly work schedule in accordance with the provisions of "2a" and "2b" above.
a.	For Operating Room Forces, Clerks and Service Assistants who are assigned to work as Operators will be placed on the seniority list below all Operators.
b.	Regardless of any other provisions of this Article, employees entering or returning to the work group who have not been given work assignments in the current weekly work schedule may be assigned any
39
Article 3
available tours until the assignments on the next posted weekly work schedule are effective in accordance with the provisions of "2a" and "2b" above.
4.	Regardless of the provisions of 1.26C, the determination of seniority credit for the choice of tours for a part-time employee will be made at the end of each calendar month. Where a part-time employee is changed to full-time status, such determination will be made at that time.
5.	During periods of lower call volume, such as night, Saturday, Sunday and Holidays, one or more units or Manager-Operator Services Units may be assigned to handle the work which would otherwise be handled by other units and/or Manager-Operator Services Units.
6.	Ordinarily, a Manager-Operator Services Unit should consist of one force group for Operators. However, where there are multi-services provided within a ManagerOperator Services Unit and one force group is not practicable, separate force groups (with separate schedules, seniority lists and relief forces) may be used, provided each force group handles the work assigned to it without regularly relieving Operators in other force groups.

1.	In case of Operating Room Forces of Operator Services working die Afternoon-Evening Short (6-1/2 hours) and the Evening-Night Short (6 hour) tours, one 30 minute relief period shall be assigned as near the mid-point of the tour as practicable instead of the two 15 minute periods.

B.	All other employees shall be allowed appropriate relief treatment which shall be one period of 15 minutes during each session worked. The Company shall have the right to designate the time or hours during which any employee or group of employees may take such relief period. It is not the intent of the parties that the practices of the Company in the matter of granting relief periods shall be changed except in those instances where an employee or group of employees abuse or take improper advantage of rights under this Section.
C.	In cases of overtime connecting work, as defined in 1.04, when an employee requests time off for a meal period such request will be granted, without pay, if practicable in view of the nature or expected duration of the overtime work.
When an employee works at least the equivalent of a session, he/she will be granted a relief period, as described in “B” above, with pay.
ARTICLE 4

1.	At 11:00 A.M. on the Friday following the close of each payroll period an overtime report will be posted by each employee's supervisor and made available to others who participate in the allocation of overtime. This list will be used for any overtime assignments made after the 11:00 A.M. posting that are to be worked during the 2-week period beginning at midnight on the Saturday following its posting. A separate report will be prepared for each work unit and will list the employees in order of the number of overtime hours worked during the report period. The overtime hours will include non-scheduled hours worked and scheduled weekly overtime hours worked.
a. The overtime report will show for each employee, his/her name and the cumulative total of overtime hours worked during the elapsed portion of a 12-week period. The 12-week period will begin on the first day of a payroll period and conclude at the end of the twelfth week (sixth payroll period). Such 12-week periods will run consecutively. At the start of each 12-week period the overtime report will begin anew. Employees entering a new work unit (either temporarily or permanently) will be credited with an average of the cumulative hours accrued by the members of that work unit as shown on the current overtime report.
I)	If 2 or more employees in the work unit worked the same number of overtime hours, such employees will be grouped and listed in inverse order of their seniority.
2)	Overtime hours worked during the work day at a temporary location will be recorded on the overtime report for the temporary location as well as the home location.
52
4.06B1 -4.06B3

3.	When an employee declines, after being offered a nonscheduled, non-connecting overtime assignment, the next qualified employee on the overtime report, omitting those who do not desire overtime, will be contacted. This procedure will be followed until someone accepts or all available qualified employees in the unit have been contacted and offered the assignment. Should all available qualified employees in the unit decline, the overtime will be assigned to the employee lowest in seniority and qualified, including those who do not desire overtime, unless the employee has a valid personal reason for not accepting the assignment or unless the employee has already worked 12 of overtime in the current week. Network Operations employees will be assigned no more than 10 hours of overtime in a calendar week during 3 months in a calendar year or no more than 12 hours in a calendar week during 9 months in a calendar year.

5.	When a supervisor fails to offer non-scheduled, nonconnecting overtime to available qualified employees in the inverse order listed on the report and offers the assignment to another employee or employees, the bypassed available qualified employees will be paid a penalty of 4 hours pay at the overtime rate. This penalty pay will be due only if the employee was available and qualified, but was not offered the call-out. The number of employees who are due penalty pay under this section will not exceed the number of employees who erroneously worked the overtime assignment. Penalty payments due under this section are to be reported the next work day following the date the employee, or the Union, and the supervisor agree that penalty pay is due the by-passed employee. Such penalty pay hours will not be included in determining the equivalent of 5 normal tours in computing weekly overtime.
6.	Under this procedure an employee may be offered nonscheduled, non-connecting overtime without regard to his/her position on the overtime report if he/she has been working on such assignment to the extent that it could be completed in an economical manner.
7.	Employees who are on vacation for one or more full weeks will be considered as unavailable beginning with Sunday of the first week and ending with Saturday of the last
54

d.	The Company will give the participants and Local President 14 days advance notice prior to discontinuing the stand-by technician in a work unit. Employees who desire to be removed from the standby technician duties will give written notice 14 days prior to being removed from the list.
55
Article 4
Any employee who subsequently wants to be placed on the stand-by technician list should notify his/her immediate supervisor and will be placed at the end of the rotation list. The stand-by technician(s) will be the first called for non-connecting, non-scheduled overtime assignments except in cases of full-day callouts.
e.	When more than one stand-by technician is designated in a work unit, the call-out assignments will be rotated among the designees for that period. Pay provisions for a stand-by technician on call are as follows:

56
i
I
4.06B8e - 4.06E
employees will be so advised when they are initially contacted. In this event they will be expected to accept the overtime assignment unless they have a valid personal reason for declining.
2.	The Company will not be required to reassign a work assignment in progress at the end of the employee's tour because of his/her position on the overtime report.
3.	If all available (on duty) qualified employees decline the offered overtime, it will be assigned to the employee lowest in seniority and qualified on the overtime report including those who do not desire overtime unless there is a valid personal reason for not accepting the assignment or unless the employee has already worked 12 hours of overtime in the current week. Network Operations employees will be assigned no more than 10 hours of overtime in a calendar week during 3 months in a calendar year or no more than 12 hours in a calendar week during 9 months in a calendar year. The level of assigned overtime for each month shall be at the sole discretion of the Company. Months with equal levels of assigned overtime need not be contiguous.
4.	The penalty pay provision specified in 4.06B5 will not be applicable, as such, in the resolution of disputes which may arise as to the allocation of connecting overtime.
D.	Scheduled overtime in excess of 5 tours per week for employees described in 4.06B (4 tours for employees on 4-day work week schedules) will be allocated to qualified available employees in the inverse order of appearance on the overtime report in effect.
E.	When an employee in one of the titles listed in 4.06B has worked 12 hours of overtime in a week he/she will have the right to refuse further overtime without giving a reason except when long term service difficulties exist or when substantial service interruptions occur.

57
Article 4
calendar week during 3 months in a calendar year or no more than 12 hours in a calendar week during 9 months in a calendar year. The level of assigned overtime far each month shall be at the sole discretion of the Company. Months with equal levels of assigned overtime need not be contiguous. The parties recognize that service difficulties for an extended period may develop from time to time during which suspension of the above overtime limitations would be appropriate. In the event such service difficulties develop, the Company and the Union will meet to discuss the problem and determine how to best deal with the situation.
F.	Insofar as practicable, the Company will give 2 hours notice prior to assigning connecting overtime.
G.	Nothing in this procedure will require the Company to offer a new overtime assignment to an employee who has already worked 15 hours of overtime in the current week.
H.	All employees have the option of either time off or overtime payments when the employee works overtime. (For CPE see Customer Markets Addendum)

C.	The reinstatement rights of an employee returning at the expiration of an authorized leave, other than from leaves granted under the Anticipated Disability Program Agreement, are as follows when such employee has experienced no impairment which would render him/her unqualified to do the work and has not been guilty of misconduct during the leave which would have been proper cause for discharge.

Consideration will be given his/her request for such reinstatement before any new employees are hired or temporary employees are reclassified to regular.
E.	When an employee on an authorized leave is offered work for a limited period and such work is accepted, the authorized leave will be suspended. Such work shall not affect the expiration date of the leave and does not affect the
87

B.	The term Military Service includes active duty, active duty for training, initial active duty for training and full-time national guard duty with the Armed Forces of the United States.
C.	Absence from the job to perform military service with the Armed Forces will be categorized as follows:
1.	Military absences less than 31 Days - Granted to employees who are members of a federally recognized Component of any branch of the Armed Forces, who are called out for a training period normally not to exceed 2 weeks or for active emergency service not in excess of 30 days. (If emergency extends beyond one month, a Persona] Leave will be granted.) Requests to be excused for military training or duty involving absence of more titan two weeks in one year will be considered individually.
91
Article 6
2.	Military Leaves of Absence - Granted to an employee entering "active duty", as described in "B" above, covering the period from the date of entry through the date of discharge.
a.	Military Leaves of Absence will be granted to regular and temporary employees. For the purposes of this section, temporary employees will include all temporary employees within the meaning of this Agreement except those who leave a "temporary position" within the meaning of the Act.

2.	An employee whose military service was more than 30 days but fewer than 181 days must submit a request for re
92
6.06C2 - 6.06E3

"Government Pay" for the purposes of this section will include basic pay, pay for special or hazardous duty and, for those with dependents, the difference between quarters allowances established for members of the uniform services with dependents and those established for members of the uniform services with equal rank without dependents. Government pay is based on 7 calendar days per week when-used to determine the differences between Company pay and Government pay.
2.	"Company Pay" for the purposes of this section will be the amount of the employee's basic pay as defined in 1.23 of this Agreement. Company pay is based on the employee's regular weekly pay for the 5 scheduled work days per week prior to the beginning date of the absence for military service when used to determine the difference between Company pay and Government pay.
3.	Employees ordered as members of a Component or Unit to attend a training period, normally not to exceed 2 weeks, or to active emergency service for a period not to exceed 30 days, will be paid the amount, if any, by which their regular Company pay exceeds Government pay. However, it is not the intent of any of the foregoing to provide such payments for more than 10 work days in any one 12 month
93
Article 6
period unless such payments are made with Department Head level or higher approval.
4.	Employees who are granted leave for military service under this Agreement will, when their Company pay is greater, receive the difference between their Company pay and their Government pay in accordance with the provisions of this section. Moreover, the period during which an employee is eligible for such difference in pay, if any, will be based on the employee’s term of service and the type of entry into military service. Such pay determinations will be as follows:
a.	Employees with less than one year of seniority who (1) are drafted or inducted or who are subject to induction and enlist for the minimum period into the military service, or (2) who are members of a Component (including the Reserve and National Guard) and the Unit or employee as an individual is involuntarily ordered or called into active duty will be paid for the first 2 weeks with an additional 3 months if the employee has a spouse and/or dependent children under 18 years of age on the beginning date of the leave for military service.

c.	Employees who have not previously served on active duty and who voluntarily enlist in a Reserve
94
6.06E4 - 6.06F3
Component of the Armed Forces which requires the employee as a condition of the enlistment to perform a period of training duty usually for a 6 month period and upon completion of such training returns to Reserve status will be paid in accordance with "a" and "b" above.
d.	Employees not subject to induction but who voluntarily enlist in the Armed Forces for a period of active duty, regardless of seniority, will be paid the difference in pay for the first 2 weeks with no dependent pay.
e.	Employees who have dependents other than a spouse or child under 18 years of age at the commencement of the leave will, upon submission of proof of dependency, receive special payments from the Company not to exceed those provided for dependents herein.
F.	Vacation Treatment.
1,	Employees entering the military service, for which a leave has been granted, will be given such vacations to which they are entitled under this Agreement.

2.	Upon being re-employed after returning from leave, employees will receive any vacation to which they are entitled under the provisions of the Agreement then in effect to the extent that such vacation may be taken within the current calendar year. The limitations contained in 5.10 of this Agreement will not be applicable,
3.	Participation in training or emergency duty as outlined herein will not affect the regular vacation to which the employee may be entitled.
95
Article 6
G.	Concession Telephone Service.
i.	When an employee is granted a military leave, concession telephone service may be continued during the period the employee is on leave provided the service is being furnished within the Company to the employee or a member of his/her family to whose support he/she contributes,

2.	The amount of pay as provided above for an employee granted a military leave will be reduced by payments, if any, made (for absences during the 60 days prior to the effective date of the leave) to such employee excused and paid under this section.

1.	Employees re-employed by the Company under the provisions of 6.06 and in accordance with the Act will be entitled to full seniority for the period of absence in the Armed Forces.

96
6.06G-7.01A2
if the employee is then incapacitated, all in accordance with the terms of the Short Term Disability Plan.
a.	Death benefit payments, where payable in death cases occurring during the period of a leave for military service, will be based upon term of seniority at the time the leave was granted plus the elapsed time on the leave to the date of death and will be computed at the rate of Company pay which the employee was receiving at the time the leave began,
b.	Sickness disability benefit payments, where payable, will be based upon seniority at the time the leave for military service was granted plus the elapsed time on leave to the termination of the leave and will be computed on the basis of the rate of Company pay in effect at the time of the employee's re-employment.
c.	Nothing contained in this Section will prohibit the Employees' Benefit Committee from making payments of "Other Benefits" in certain cases.
ARTICLE 7
FORCE ADJUSTMENTS
7.01 Reduction in Force. (Also see Appendix A - Family of Skills).
A.	The Company will determine the necessity, extent and procedures for adjusting forces, subject to the procedural limitations set forth in this Article.
1.	These procedures apply to both technologicai/operational efficiency and economic surplus except where specified.
2.	The Company will endeavor to keep at a minimum the number of regular, full-time employees within a work group who will become surplus. To this end, the Company will utilize temporary employees as appropriate to supplement affected work groups prior to a known change which will diminish the total number of employees.
97
Article 7
Notwithstanding 1.32, the Company may hire such employees on a temporary basis for an 18-month period (or less) prior to the scheduled date of a technological change. In the event the actual date of the change exceeds the scheduled date by 6 months, temporary employees will be reclassified to regular employees. Such temporary hiring may take place in the exchange/WRA where the change is to occur and in other exchanges/WRA to which the Company reasonably believes that regular employees affected by the change may desire to transfer.
3.	A vacancy will not be considered to exist when an employee desires to follow his/her work to another exchange due to reorganization, relocation of existing work or centralization.
a.	If the number of employees performing the work in the current exchange(s)/WRA(s) exceeds the number needed to perform the work in the new exchange/WRA, affected employees will be allowed, in seniority order, regardless of their current exchange/WRA, to follow their work to the extent that jobs are available.
b.	Employees may elect to follow their work across state lines.
4.	Surplus declarations will be made effective among regular employees performing essentially the same type of work within the surplus exchange/WRA* and the affected organizational unit. (See 1.16 for definition.) The Company will notify, in writing, by 15th of month preceding surplus quarter the Vice President and appropriate State Director of the Union or their designees of all anticipated force reductions prior to the reductions.
* Timeline for notification not applicable for economic surplus declaration within CPE organization.
98
7.0IA3-7.0IC
5.	Except as limited by 7.01C3, employees announced surplus are eligible for Employment Security PARTNERSHIP services as described in Article 24. This program provides guidance to surplus employees on career counseling, training and retraining, job opportunities, etc.
6.	The seniority of employees will be determined as of the date of displacement.
B.	Temporary employees hired under 7.01A2 will be separated first.
In the event it is unnecessary to terminate the services of all such employees, those to be retained will be selected in the order of seniority.
C.	If further force reductions are necessary, the following procedures should be followed.
If there is more than one force adjustment occurring simultaneously or within the same general time frame in the same exchange/WRA, the affected employees should be grouped for the purpose of reclassifying such employees to vacancies for which they qualify. However, subsequent force surpluses announced within the same general time frame will not affect the status of an employee who has previously been notified of assignment to a vacancy under these procedures.
The following employees (regardless of their present organizational unit) will, in order of seniority, receive priority consideration when the Company fills vacancies at and below the employee’s current wage scale (regardless of the organizational unit in which the vacancies exist).
-	- Surplus employees identified in 7.01A4.
—	Employees on technological or sabbatical leaves whose leaves of absence are expiring in the exchange/WRA.
-	Employees who have return rights to the title pursuant to 7.01K. (Present title or previous title in original exchange/WRA.)
99
Article 7
—	Employees who are participants in the Job Bank as described under 24.05D4.
-	- Employees described under 12.02F.
-	Employees displaced from their current jobs because of permanent medical restrictions. (See 8.06B.)
—	Employees holding part-time jobs in the same title where the vacancy exists, who were displaced into such status. The failure of an employee to accept a full-time status offer relieves the Company of any further obligation to offer that employee full-time status.
The normal sequence for handling this procedure shall be in accordance with the following steps and shall apply to both technological and economical surplus unless excluded in the step(s):
1.	Up-front Bump
a.	When the most junior employee performing essentially the same type work is located in another exchange/WRA within 35 miles, the employees identified in 7,01 A4 may bump such employee.
b.	Any employees bumped in “a” above become the surplus employees for applying the Force Adjustment procedures in 7.01C.
c.	Two calendar days will be allowed for this determination of which employees to process as surplus.
2.	They will be reassigned to equal level vacancies for which they qualify within the Family of Skills in the exchange/WRA or any exchange/WRA within 35 miles.
3.	SIPP, as described in 8.04, is granted in seniority order to employees performing essentially the same type work, first in the exchange/WRA, then in any exchange/WRA within 35 miles of the surplus exchange/WRA. Employees opting to take SIPP must have at least 1 year of seniority, are not
100
7.01C1 - 7.01C5b
entitled to enter the PARTNERSHIP Job Bank, and do not have recall rights.
4.	Surplus employees may fill available vacancies for which they qualify, first in the exchange/WRA or in an exchange/WRA within 35 miles.
a. Employees who decline an equal level vacancy will forfeit bumping rights and will forfeit termination pay unless equal level vacancy is filled.
5.	Surplus/bumped employees will be provided with information on the current surplus and all their options and will have five (5) calendar days to rank their options:
•	Current vacancies within state
•	Supplemental Income Protection Program (SIPP), including ES1PP
•	Transitional Leave of Absence
•	Sabbatical Leave of Absence
*	Technological Displacement Leave of Absence
-	Bumping rights or for bumped employee (remaining choice, if applicable, from the list of the original surplus employee who bumped).
a.	Surplus employees may fill available vacancies for which they qualify anywhere in the state.
b.	The Company will expand the SIPP option (ESIPP) to other employees or groups not affected by force adjustment as an additional method to reduce the surplus. Expanded SIPP will not be offered in order to create placement opportunities for employees who are not qualified or for whom extensive training in excess of 14 weeks would be required.
To be considered for SIPP or ESIPP, all employees other than surplus employees must notify the appropriate Company representative in advance that they will accept such an offer. The Company may
101
Article 7
offer, but is not required to offer, ESIPP to non-surplus affected employees for economic surplus.
Any placement opportunities created by SIPP and ESIPP will be filled in the order of seniority by surplus employees and will not be treated as vacancies under other provisions of the contract relating to the filling of vacancies.
SIPP may also be granted when the return of a regular employee at the expiration of a leave of absence with mandatory return rights will create or add to a surplus. A senior employee performing essentially the same type work in the exchange/WRA or in an exchange/WRA within 35 miles may relieve such a surplus with SIPP. If no such employee has volunteered, the employee on leave may choose not to return to work and will be paid a termination allowance computed under 8.O5B in lieu of processing. Otherwise, except for a Sabbatical Leave of Absence, the employee on leave will return to active employment and all the provisions of 7.01C will be applied.
c.	Surplus employees who receive no equal level job offer in an exchange within 35 miles (for economic surplus, in the state) may elect to bump junior employees from the following groups:
1)	Employees with less than 5 years seniority in the same title who are performing essentially the same type work in the exchange/WRA or any exchange/WRA within 35 miles, in any organizational unit
2)	35-Mile List:
. Essentially the same type work in the exchange/WRA and in any exchanges/WRA(s)
102
7.01C5c - 7.01C5f
within 35 miles, same organizational unit, THEN
•	Same title in the exchange/WRA and in any exchanges/WRA(s) within 35 miles, same organizational unit, THEN
•	Family of Skills in the exchange/WRA and in any exchanges/WRA(s) within 35 miles, same organizational unit.
3)	State List:
• Same title within the state, same organizational unit, THEN
* Family of Skills within the state, same organizational unit.
Jobs that require extensive training (more than 14 weeks) will be excluded except when the surplus is in the same Family of Skills. Refusal of an offer to bump qualifies the employee for termination pay.
d.	Surplus employees who are within 24 months of actual age and/or service requirements for service pension eligibility may take a Transitional Leave of Absence. Both SIPP and ESIPP may be combined with a Transitional Leave.
e.	Surplus employees with at least 5 years seniority who have not taken a Sabbatical in the past 5 years may take an unpaid Sabbatical Leave of Absence for nine to 24 months. An expiring Sabbatical may be extended at the employee’s option in increments of at least three months up to the maximum total period of 24 months.
f.	Surplus employees (unless the surplus is economic) may take a Technological Displacement Leave of Absence. An employee who chooses to accept a leave of absence does not thereby forfeit his/her right to accept a transfer to another location to perform the same or related work or to be paid a termination allowance (technological leaves only), provided he/she
103
Article 7
gives notice that he/she wishes to change his/her option to accept a transfer or the allowance before the expiration of one year following his/her acceptance of the leave. In the event notice of a desire to change his/her option is given:
1)	The employee will be notified, in the order of seniority, of the next job vacancy at the exchange/WRA of his/her preference by letter to his/her last known address; or
2)	He/She will receive a termination allowance computed under 8.O5B as of the date of his/her leave of absence.
6. An employee to be laid off who previously declined an opportunity under 7.0IA3 may follow his/her work, provided vacancies still exist in the new location. Any such moves will be considered to have been made at the instance of the Company.
D.	Surplus and bumped employees who cannot be placed under 7.01C are laid off with termination allowance computed under 8.05B. They are eligible for recall under 7.02.
E.	The determination by the Company of the qualifications of an employee under 7.01 will be subject to the grievance procedure set forth in Article 21, and after the exhaustion of such procedure a charge of arbitrary action or bad faith will be subject to the arbitration procedure set forth in Article 23.
F.	In the event the Company proposes, or agrees, to a termination allowance under 8.05A3 within 6 months after an employee has been reclassified under 7.0IC and has been given training and has unsuccessfully performed new duties, such employee will be given a termination allowance under 8.05B, or, at the option of the employee, a transfer to an available vacancy for which he/she is qualified. (If the employee elects the termination allowance he is eligible to enter the Partnership Job Bank as described in Article 24).
104
7.01C5H -7.01J
1.	Prior to invoking these provisions, the procedures outlined in 12.02F1 and F2 will be applied.
2.	In the event an employee offers impelling personal reasons for not accepting reassignment within the exchange/WRA, and elects not to accept a transfer to another exchange/WRA, he/she will be entitled to a termination allowance under 8.O5B and will have recall rights under 7.02 as if he/she had been laid off from his/her former job.
G.	Employees accepting lower-rated jobs under 7.0IC will be treated under the provisions of the Reassignment Pay Protection Plan (8.03B or C, as appropriate).
H.	Employees accepting offers of jobs that are not in the exchange/WRA or in an exchange/WRA within 35 miles under 7.01 A3 or 7.01C will receive reasonable transfer and/or moving expenses as described in 9.0IB.
I.	Any regular employee whose job is affected by a force surplus may elect not to accept reassignment involving
•	a lower rate of pay or reassignment to an exchange/WRA	more than 35 miles away
(technological/operational efficiency surplus ) or
•	a lower rate of pay (economic surplus)
and will be paid a termination allowance. Any such regular employee who refuses to accept a transfer to a job title having die same or greater rate of pay (and, for technological/operational efficiency surplus, which does not require a change in residence), will not be paid a termination allowance.
J.	An employee one step out of the bargaining unit who is notified by the Company that his/her job is declared surplus locally may, if he/she has 5 er more years of seniority, be reassigned to a bargaining unit job within the same organizational unit in a title which he/she formerly held - including "acting*' titles, or to a job which he/she can satisfactorily perform, provided there are no employees with
105
I
Article 7
Article 7 .OIK rights and further provided such moves will not create a force surplus. The temporary loss of seniority provisions of 12.01G will apply if there is a subsequent force adjustment of any type.
K.	Employees transferred (including transfers across state lines) and/or demoted under 7.01C or 12.04 shall have the right, in order of their seniority, to return within 5 years to service in the exchange/WRA from which they were displaced as jobs become available in the job title they now hold or which they were holding at the time of transfer provided the employee has a valid request on file under 12.01B. The employee may only have one 7.01K request on file. The rejection by the employee of an offer of a job pursuant to the above shall discharge the Company of any further obligation hereunder.

The rejection of an offer of a job, in the exchange/WRA, in the title held at the time of the demotion shall discharge the Company of any further obligation hereunder,
Employees who were originally displaced in this bargaining unit as a result of a surplus condition and as a result accepted a lower level job in the same exchange/WRA or an equal or lower level job in another exchange/WRA, and who were subsequently transferred at the instance of the Company to another bargaining unit, may be considered under the provisions of 7.01K if there are no surplus employees within this bargaining unit who have rights for these vacancies.
Vacancies that are filled under the provisions of 7.0IK by such reinstatements will not be subject to the provisions of Article 12.
106
7.01K-7.02AI

exchange/WRA will be considered as being in the organizational unit and exchange/WRA where they are located.
M.	Although the filling of vacancies across entity lines under Article 7 is not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures, the Company recognizes its obligation to make a good faith effort to consider employees who have been identified as surplus in other entities and to place such employees in vacancies.

107
Article 7
exists and who has requested such job will be offered the equal or lower level vacancy in order of seniority, from the list of laid off employees, provided they are qualified to perform the duties of the vacant job, and provided they were laid off from any exchange/WRA within the same state in which the vacancy exists.
a. Vacancies that are filled by the recalling of such laid off employees will not be considered as vacancies to be filled by the transfer and upgrade provisions of the Agreement.
2.	When a vacancy exists for a regular employee in an exchange/WRA and there are no employees who are to be placed in the vacancy under the procedures described in 7.0IC or employees who have mandatory return rights, any employee in the state who is laid off in an equal or higher level title, who has an Article 12 request on file for the vacant title will be considered for the vacancy along with other active employee requestors under the appropriate provisions of Article 12.
3.	Laid off employees may submit up to 6 requests for equal or lower rated titles, anywhere in the Company. Such requests will remain active for a period of 4 years from the date of layoff,
4.	Any refusal of an offer of a requested equal or lower level job will discharge the Company of all obligations hereunder.
5.	Notification under "Al" and "A2’1 above, will be sent by certified mail to such employee’s last known address. The employee is responsible for keeping the Company advised of any change in address.
6.	A former employee who wishes to accept such offer of reemployment will notify the Company of such intention within 5 work days and will normally return to the employment of the Company within 14 days from the date
108
7.02Ala-7.03
	of such notification, which is conclusively to be presumed to have been given as of the date of the mailing of such notification. a. Where the time periods specified in "A6" above will work an undue hardship on an employee, they may be extended, 7.	No impairment which existed at termination of last preceding period of Company service will be considered as just cause fora denial of re-employment. 8.	Any employee recalled under the provisions of this section within 4 years from the date of his/her layoff will have the continuity of his/her service protected, including seniority, and if his/her layoff was not for more than 6 months duration, he/she will be allowed service and seniority credit for such layoff unless it began within 12 months of a previous layoff. 9.	Laid off employees selected for a lower rated job than the one from which they were laid off will not be eligible for the Reassignment Pay Protection Plan (RPPP), as outlined in 8.03B of the Agreement. 10.	Laid off employees selected for jobs under 7.02A, in other exchanges/WRAs or who are selected for lower level jobs will have return rights as described under 7.0IK. 11.	Laid off employees will be recalled based upon their seniority date on the date of layoff. 12.	Decisions regarding the recall and filling of vacancies of employees under the provisions of 7.02 may be discussed between the appropriate CWA and Company representative. Such decisions, however, are not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures.
7.03	Temporary Hiring of Laid Off Employees. As a general practice the Company will endeavor to offer laid off employees any temporary vacancies for which they are qualified.
109

8.03 Transfers to Lower-Rated Wage Scales. (Including Reassignment Pay Protection Plan)
A.	When an employee is involved in an interdepartmental transfer, or a reclassification within his/her department, to a lower-rated job as a result of asserting his/her seniority rights under 7.01 J, a transfer under Article 12, or a demotion for misconduct, gross negligence, lack of effort or other such extraordinary circumstances, his/her rate of pay shall be reduced to that applicable to his/her wage length of service on the lower wage scale and he/she shall thereafter progress on such scale.
B.	RPPP (Reassignment Pay Protection Plan). When an employee is reclassified to a lower rated job under 7.01C, 12.02F, 24.05D4d or as a result of being permanently medically restricted the employee's rate of pay will be reduced over a period of time based on the employee's length of seniority.
The reductions in pay will be effective at periods following reassignment as shown in the following chart and each reduction is based on the difference in the appropriate rates for the old and new jobs:
112
8.02Dlc - 8.03C
WEEKS
Reduction In Difference In Old & New Rate
Employees with 0-10 Years of Seniority

No Reduction 1/3 Reduction 2/3 Reduction Full Reduction
C.	An employee with 15 years or more of seniority who, due to technological changes or as a result of being permanently medically restricted, is assigned to a vacancy with a lower rate of pay than the then current rate of the employee’s regular job shall continue to be paid in the lower level job, an amount equivalent to the rate of pay of the higher paid job in effect at the time of the downgrade. Such wage treatment will continue for 36 months following the effective date of the downgrade. Any employee involved in such downgrades shall receive any increases in pay in amounts which are applicable for a comparable employee in the lower-rated job to which downgraded. At the end of the 36 month period following the date of the downgrade, the employee's wages will be reduced ■ on the following scale:
113
Article 8
Weeks 1 through 4-------No Reduction
Weeks 5 through 8-------1/3 Reduction
Weeks 9 through 12------2/3 Reduction

E.	In all other instances in which an employee is involved in an interdepartmental transfer, or a reclassification within his/her department, to a lower-rated job, his/her rate of pay shall be computed as follows:
1.	His/her rate of pay will not be reduced if it is not above the maximum rate for the new job and he/she shall continue at such rate until his/her wage experience credit entitles him/her to an increase on the scale for his/her new job. He/she shall receive initial credit for wage length of service on the new job in an amount equal to the wage length of service credited to him/her in his/her old job, except that if he/she had formerly held a job in the lower classification to which he/she is being reclassified, his/her wage experience credit will be established as the wage experience credit formerly attained in the lower classification plus the time spent on the higher job or jobs, subject to any adjustments as provided in 2.02, when applicable.
2.	If his/her rate of pay is above the maximum for his/her new job, his/her rate of pay shall be reduced to that maximum.
F.	Employees involuntarily transferred under the provisions of 12,04 shall have the right to claim the job from which they
114
8.O3D-8.04Ala
were moved if the job should become available within five years after such move as described in 7 .OIK.
8.04 Supplemental Income Protection Program and Extended Medical Coverage;
A. Supplemental Income Protection Program.
1,	If during the term of this Agreement the Company notifies the Union in writing that an employee is unable to remain in his/her current job because of a permanent medical restriction or if a surplus in any job title in a work location will necessitate lay-offs or involuntary permanent reassignments of regular employees to different job titles involving a reduction in pay (or, in the case of technologicaVoperationai efficiency surplus, to work locations requiring a change of residence) employees in the affected job titles and work locations, who have at least I year of seniority may elect, in the order of seniority and to the extent necessary to relieve the surplus, to leave the service of the Company and receive Supplemental Income Protection Program (SIPP) benefits described in this Section. The Company will offer Expanded SIPP (ES1PP) as provided in 7.01C for technological/ operational efficiency surplus, but is not required to offer ESIPP for economic surplus.
a.	SIPP/ESIPP Expression of Interest form: To be considered for SIPP or ESIPP, all employees other than surplus employees must notify the appropriate Company representative in advance that they will accept such an offer by submitting a SIPP/ESIPP Expression of Interest form. The form will become valid at the beginning of the quarter following the quarter in which they are received by Staffing and must be received at least one month in advance. An Expression of Interest form may be canceled by the employee at any time.
115
Article 8
b.	The Company will determine the job titles and work locations in which a surplus exists, the number of employees in such titles and locations who are considered to be surplus, and the period during which the employee may leave the service of the Company pursuant to this Section, Neither such determination by the Company nor any other part of this Section will be subject to arbitration.
c.	The number of employees who may be considered will not exceed the number of employees determined by the Company to be surplus.
d.	Irrevocable SIPP/ESIPP Acceptance form: An employee's decision to leave the service of the Company and receive SIPP/ESIPP benefits must be in writing and transmitted to the Company on the Irrevocable S1PP/ES1PP Acceptance form within 10 calendar days from the date of the Company’s offer in order to be effective, and it may not be revoked after such 10-day period.
1)	If an employee signs the Irrevocable SIPP/ESIPP Acceptance form, he/she will be able to indicate on the form if the acceptance will be valid for (a) the current quarter, or (b) the current quarter and the following quarter. Upon expiration of the acceptance period, the acceptance will be placed in inactive status until such time as an appropriate SIPP/ESIPP opportunity arises. At that time, the employee will be sent a notice offering him/her the opportunity to continue the acceptance for a new period. An inactive acceptance may be canceled by the employee at any time.
2)	If an employee refuses an offer of SIPP/ESIPP, his/her SIPP/ESIPP Expression of Interest form will become invalid for the balance of that quarter
116
8.04Alb-8.04Alg
plus the next quarter. The form will remain on file with an indicator to show it is invalid.
The employee will not be offered SIPP/ESIPP for the invalid period unless a surplus employee has requested a vacancy be created and there are no other valid requests on file for which the surplus employee can qualify.
An employee’s refusal of SIPP/ESIPP will not make their SIPP/ESIPP Expression of Interest form invalid if the reason for refusal is that the employee will become pension eligible or will achieve 30 years of service during the quarter in which the offer is declined and if the displacement will occur prior to the achievement of 30 years’ service or pension eligibility.
Employees with invalid SIPP/ESIPP Expression of Interest forms on file need not resubmit a form. Their form will be reactivated when again valid.
e.	Job titles and locations of employees who have committed to accept ESIPP will be made available to surplus employees. Placement into equal or lower level jobs created through ESIPP will be made in seniority order among interested, qualified surplus employees.
f.	Surplus employees are allowed to submit one request for an equal or lower level job title in their Family of Skills in any exchange/WRA in the Company.
g.	In a surplus situation, SIPP will first be granted in seniority order to any employees with Irrevocable SIPP/ESIPP Acceptance forms on file who are performing essentially the same type work in the surplus exchange/WRA and exchangesZWRA(s) within 35 miles of the surplus exchange/WRA. Employees who continue to be surplus after this step will have the opportunity to take SIPP, even though
117
Article 8
they do not have Irrevocable SIPP/ESIPP Acceptance forms on file in advance.
2.	SIPP/ESIPP payments for employees who leave the service of the Company in accordance with "1" above will begin within one month after such employee has left the service of the Company and continue until payments have been made for 48 months. The employee may elect to receive this payment in one lump sum should he/she so desire or in two equal payments, one paid as the employee leaves the service of the Company and the other paid on February 1 of the year following.
3.	The following SIPP/ESIPP payment table is designed for use with surplus under 7.01 and for permanently medically restricted placement as described in 8.06. Employees who receive either voluntary SIPP or ESIPP will not be entitled to a termination allowance under this article or further processing under Article 7.

No individual employee wilt be held from transfer due to service requirements longer than 9 months. The Company will notify CWA District 3 and the appropriate State Director of the Union or their designees prior to invoking service requirements and will discuss other alternatives the Union might suggest.

rated job, the matter shall be considered and treated as a promotion in accordance with Article 12.
3.	The Company is not required to consider a request for promotion from an employee on leave of absence. However, if an employee on leave of absence is selected for promotion, all other employees who are on leave who have valid requests on file must be considered under the appropriate provisions of 12.01.
4.	Nothing in this Agreement is to be construed as prohibiting the Company from giving consideration in filling job vacancies to employees who do not have requests on file under the provisions of 12.01.
5.	Requestors with deficiencies that may affect their chances for being selected will be informed as to the deficiency. (Deficiencies will include, but are not limited to, failure to satisfactorily complete required tests, failure to meet timein-title, time-in-exchange/WRA, and/or time-in-Company requirements.)
6.	When an employee is notified that he/she has been selected to fill a vacancy, all other requests on file in his/her behalf shall be considered as withdrawn unless the employee notifies the Company within 2 business days after selection that he/she wishes to reject the offered vacancy.
7.	When an employee is selected to fill a job vacancy, the employee will be released from his/her present assignment as soon as practicable but normally no later than the sixth Sunday following the date the employee is notified. If an employee has been declared surplus and is within 4 months of his/her displacement date, a release date no later than the 9th Sunday may be permitted in cases where service requirements do not permit his/her release. In such cases the employee will suffer no loss of higher rated pay due after the sixth Sunday.
152
12.02A3- 12.02C
8.	If an employee rejects a requested move, he/she will not be entitled to replace the rejected request for a period of 12 months from the date of rejection.

Such grievances will be processed in accordance with Article 21.
12.	When anemployee has an active grievance on one or more selections, he/she may continue to grieve on only one of the pending grievances for a job which is higher than one he/she subsequently accepted.
B.	In considering employees for job vacancies within an entity, the Company shall give consideration to seniority, qualifications, and service requirements, and, if the employee is returning from a leave of absence or a layoff, whether he/she has been guilty of misconduct which would have been proper cause for discharge.
C.	In the selection of employees within the bargaining unit for promotions within the bargaining unit, seniority shall govern
153
Article 12
if other necessary qualifications of the individuals are substantially equal.
D.	No employee will be denied promotion, transfer or downgrade solely because he/she has not had the opportunity to complete Company sponsored training classes related to his/her present job or Company sponsored training classes related to the job that is to be filled.
E.	Except as described in ''EV* and "E2" below, the Company may, regardless of other provisions of this section, disqualify an employee from further consideration upon determining that the employee does not meet reasonable threshold requirements for the job to be filled. "Reasonable threshold requirements" shall be construed to be the attainment of recommended minimum test scores on applicable standard BellSouth tests, or their successor tests, or other appropriate tests (e.g., a typing test for a typing job). The Union may challenge through the grievance and arbitration procedure whether the use of a particular test or tests as a threshold requirement for a particular vacancy is reasonable. Such challenges will be filed initially at the Executive Level. The Union may also challenge the Company's decision to disqualify an employee from further consideration (as it relates to threshold requirements) through the grievance procedure, but not through arbitration.
1.	If the attainment of a minimum test score is established by the Company as a prerequisite for receiving Company-sponsored formal training associated with a new job title which is to substantially replace one or more existing titles, the incumbents in the existing titlc(s) in an affected exchange/WRA shall be given priority consideration over all other employees for staffing the new title in that exchange/WRA, such priority consideration to consist of the following:
a, Incumbents who have already qualified on the test involved or who are exempted from taking the test based on their experience and/or previous training will
154
12.02D - 12.02E2
be eligible for immediate transfer to the new title upon its implementation.
b.	Incumbents not meeting the description in "a" above shall as soon as practicable be offered the test, and, if they meet the required minimum score will be considered concurrently with those employees described in "a” above.
c.	Incumbents not qualifying under "a", or "b" above because of not meeting minimum test score requirements will be given an opportunity in seniority order to attend appropriate general skills training under the Training and Retraining Program.
d.	Incumbents described in "a", "b" and those who complete the training in "c" above who are subsequently transferred to the new title will be sent to appropriate job-specific training as soon as practicable in seniority order.
e.	Incumbents not desiring to be considered further for transfer to the new title under these procedures, and those described in "c" above for whom there are no staffing vacancies available due to all of them being previously filled by those described in "a", "b" and "c" above, may be treated as an "operational efficiency" surplus under the appropriate sections of the Agreement.
f.	Vacancies in the new title which develop subsequent to completion of initial staffing will be handled under the other relevant provisions of Article ]2 and/or Article 7.
2. Surplus employees desiring to continue their career (under Article 12 or PARTNERSHIP) in a different title and work discipline for which the Company has established the attainment of a minimum test score as a prerequisite for receiving Company-sponsored formal training shall be considered for filling a vacancy for the title as follows:
155
Article 12
a.	An employee who has already qualified on the test involved or who is exempted from taking the test based on his/her experience and/or previous training will be eligible for transfer to the new title.
b.	An employee not meeting the description in "a" above shall as soon as practicable be offered the test, and, if he/she meets the required minimum score will be eligible for transfer to the title.
c.	An employee not qualifying under "a" or "b" above because of not meeting minimum test score ■ requirements will be given an opportunity to be retested following his/her completion of appropriate general skills training under PARTNERSHIP. Usual Company-enforced time limits on retesting will be waived with respect to this second test. If the employee fails to pass the test on this second effort, he/she will be provided the assessment and counseling provisions of PARTNERSHIP.
F. An employee who is transferred or promoted under Article 12 to a new job and who cannot satisfactorily complete training or who cannot perform satisfactorily on the job during the 6 months following the completion of training will be grouped with those employees (if any) under 7.0IC for existing vacancies only in equal or lower level jobs for which they are qualified, except as described in Fl below. If no vacancy exists or the employee declines an offer of a job offered under 7.01C which requires a change in residence, the employee will receive termination allowance in accordance with 8.05C and will have recall rights under 7.02 as if he/she had been laid off from his/her former job.
1.	If during the first six months following successful completion of training, the employee’s job performance has not reached a satisfactory level, the Company will provide an individualized performance improvement plan of up to 60 days, depending on the nature of the job and
156
I
12.02E2a- 12.04B
the progress of the employee, which identifies specific deficiencies and improvement benchmarks. This plan will be discussed with the employee, and if requested, with a Union representative. The Company will also provide on-the-job assistance as appropriate for the job.
2.	If an employee is having difficulty during initial job specific training, the Company will provide additional assistance for up to 3 days depending on the employee’s progress, the nature of the training and the needs of the business.
12.0	3 Promotional Increase Treatment.
When an employee within the bargaining unit is promoted to a higher-rated job within the bargaining unit, he/she shall receive at the time of promotion the applicable promotional wage treatment as set forth in 2.06.
12.0	4 Transfers at the Instance of the Company.
A.	When the Company decides that a job is to be filled by transfer from one exchange/WRA to another, preference shall be granted in the order of seniority to employees who are willing to accept the transfer provided they meet the . requirements of the job to be filled and provided that their transfer can be accomplished without incurring extraordinary expense.
1.	Notice that a job is to be filled under "A” above shall be adequately posted at the place of reporting within the exchange/WRA of all employees within the department holding the title from which the transfer will be made and shall be limited to requests received within 7 days from such employees who are willing to accept the transfer.
B.	When it is necessary to fill a job by transfer from one exchange/WRA to another and no qualified employee within the Department from which the transfer is to be made is willing to accept the transfer on a voluntary basis, the transfer will be made by transferring in the inverse order of seniority
157
Article 12
the most junior qualified employee in the wage scale within that department from within the exchange/WRA who can meet the requirements of the job to be filled provided there is a qualified replacement available in the title originally posted under * A" above and such transfer will not result in a special hardship to such employee or his/her immediate family.
1.	After the transfer has been made under "B" above, the Company may correct any force imbalance in the exchange/WRA that was caused by the transfer by moving the junior qualified employee in the title designated under "A" above into the vacated position.
2.	In those instances where the Company has designated an employee to involuntarily transfer to another exchange/WRA and a qualified employee in the specified exchange/WRA who otherwise would be acceptable subsequently volunteers to transfer rather than the designated employee, the transfer will be considered as being made under 12.04B.
C.	When the Company decides that a job is to be filled by transfer from one job title to another within the same exchange/WRA and no promotion is involved, the job shall be filled by the senior qualified employee, in the title, in the department from which the transfer is to be made who has requested the transfer under 12.01, service requirements permitting. If no such employee has requested the transfer under 12.01, the selection will be made from the employees in the wage scale in the department from which the transfer is to be made in the inverse order of seniority in the exchange/WRA or district, whichever is smaller, who can meet the requirement of the job.
D.	Use of I2.04B for transferring employees to same or other jobs in other exchanges/WRAs shall be limited to those situations in which a force imbalance exists or as directed by the provisions of Article 7. A force imbalance exists when the number of employees performing the required volume of work
158
12.04B1 -12.05A2a
is proper but is improperly distributed by exchange/WRA. Transfers under force imbalance circumstances shall be confined to exchanges no further than 50 miles from the employee’s present exchange location or 100 miles for a WRA.
E.	When the Company decides that a job would be filled by involuntarily transferring employees from one job to another, within the same exchange/WRA, or outside the exchange/WRA, it will not affect the running of the time-in-title nor the time-in-exchange/WRA referred to in 12.01B4.
12.05 Temporary Transfers. (CPE see Customer Markets Addendum)
A. None of the foregoing provisions of this Article will apply to temporary transfers, which are defined as follows: An employee will be in a temporary transfer status when he/she is assigned to work outside his/her headquarters exchange and is not returned' to such exchange on Company time at the conclusion of the day's work.
1.	When an employee is to be assigned to work outside his/her headquarters exchange, the Company will advise the employee whether he/she will be temporarily transferred or be returned to his/her headquarters exchange at the conclusion of each day of work. In the event the employee is returned to his/her headquarters exchange at the conclusion of the day's work, the assignment will be considered as "all in a day's work".
2.	The Company may terminate a temporary transfer by returning the employee to his/her headquarters exchange on Company time and expense. However, temporary transfers will not be terminated on non-scheduled or nonwork days prior to the completion of the employee's temporary assignment except as follows:
a.	When the employee's services are temporarily needed in his/her headquarters exchange for a full tour or more.
159
Article 12
b.	When the employee is permitted to take his/her scheduled vacation while on a temporary assignment. In this event, the Company is obligated to return the employee to his/her headquarters exchange on Company time and travel expense provided he/she wants to commence his/her vacation from his/her home base. Should the employee elect to commence his/her vacation at his/her temporary location and continue to receive the IRS maximum allowance, he/she may do so, if the IRS maximum allowance cost for the period does not exceed the cost of returning the employee to his/her headquarters exchange on Company time and expense and back to the temporary location.
c.	When the employee requests and is granted an unscheduled vacation day(s), excused time or excused work day(s), etc., and the cost of returning the employee to his/her headquarters exchange and back to the temporary location on Company time and expense would be less than the cost of the IRS maximum allowance.
d.	When the employee becomes ill to the extent that he/she is unable to work, and his/her illness is expected to continue for an extended period. In this event, his/her temporary transfer should be terminated as soon as he/she is able to travel. (An illness that is expected to be of short duration should be handled in accordance with "c" above if the employee is able to return to his/her headquarters exchange.)
3.	When an employee's temporary transfer is terminated under the conditions outlined in 12.05A2b, c and d above, he/she may be placed back on the same temporary assignment provided he/she returns to the temporary location on his/her first scheduled day to work after his/her transfer was terminated. If the employee performs
160
l2.05A2b- 12.05B1
work in his/her headquarters exchange after a temporary transfer has been broken, he/she should not be placed back on temporary transfer except as required or permitted under the selection procedures outlined in 12.05C1 or C2 below.
4,	A temporary transfer may be terminated without the employee having to physically return to his/her home base. He/She can be paid for the equivalent time and travel expense that would have been incurred had he/she actually returned. Such time and expense should be based on the means of transportation designated by the Company at the beginning of his/her temporary transfer.
5.	When an employee on a temporary transfer elects to return home or go elsewhere on non-scheduled days on his/her own time and expense, he/she may do so and still be entitled to the IRS maximum allowance expense and travel conditions specified in 9.02B6.
B. The Company recognizes the undesirability, both from the standpoint of the transferring employees and the resident employees, of temporarily transferring employees to work away from their regular location or of receiving employees from other companies for extended periods and will neither make nor effectuate such transfers except to meet service requirements.
1. When it does become necessary to temporarily transfer an employee(s), such employeefs) will be given as much advance notice as feasible. Where the temporary transfer is beyond reasonable commuting distance and is expected to last in excess of one week, and the employee(s) was not given as much as 5 days of advance notice, he/she should be given a reasonable amount of time off with pay, if needed, to handle his/her personal business prior to being transferred. Such excused time should not exceed one tour for interstate transfers or one session for intrastate transfers.
161
Article 12
C. The following procedures will be followed in the selection of individual employees for temporary transfers. However, in emergency situations the Company may transfer work groups without applying these procedures.
1.	When it becomes necessary to transfer employees temporarily to an assignment expected to be of more than one week duration, the Company will make a determination as to the work unit or units from which it desires to make such transfers. (Work unit for this purpose will be all employees within a given title who have a common place of reporting and who perform the same job duties.) All employees in the unit or units will be notified of the proposed transfer either by personal supervisory contacts or by a notice placed on bulletin boards within the selected unit or units. Those qualified employees volunteering for the temporary assignment will be selected and transferred in order of seniority, service requirements permitting. If the above procedure does not produce a sufficient number of volunteers, all employees holding the same title and who are performing the same job duties within the exchange (in multi-district exchanges, the district) and department from which the transfers are to be made will be notified of the proposed transfers either by personal supervisory contacts or by notices placed on bulletin boards. Qualified employees volunteering for the assignment will be selected and transferred in order of seniority, service requirements permitting. Should additional employees be needed, selection will be made in the inverse order of seniority from among qualified employees, in the same job title and department who are performing the same duties, within the same exchange (in multi-district exchanges, the district) from which the Company elects to make the transfer, service requirements permitting, provided such transfers will not result in a special hardship to such employees or their immediate families.
162
12.05C- 12.05D
2.	When temporary transfers are expected to be of one week duration or less, the Company will make a determination as to the work group in the exchange from which it desires to make such transfers. Where practicable, all employees in the work group will be notified of the proposed transfer either by personal supervisory contact or by a notice placed on the bulletin board within the selected work group. Those qualified employees volunteering for the temporary assignment will be selected and transferred in order of seniority, service requirements permitting.
If the above procedure does not produce a sufficient number of volunteers, volunteers will be sought using the same procedure from among all employees in the work unit in the exchange from which the Company desires to make such transfers. Those qualified employees volunteering for the temporary assignment will be selected and transferred in order of seniority, service requirements permitting.
If the above procedures do not produce a sufficient number of volunteers, the transfer will be made by transferring in the inverse order of seniority the first qualified employee in the work unit from which the Company has elected to make the transfer, service requirements permitting, provided such transfer will not result in a special hardship to such employee or his/her immediate family.
3.	When temporary transferees under 12.05C are transferred to an exchange in another state, resident employees in that exchange performing the same work as that being performed by the temporary transferees will be offered 6 day work opportunity whenever the temporary transferees are offered 6 days.
D.	Basic pay treatment for temporarily transferred employees will continue in accordance with the wage progression scale in effect for their job classification at their home location. Any
163
Article 12
evening or night differential payments applicable will be paid in accordance with the schedule for such differentials in effect in the offices in which they are temporarily working.
E.	Transferred employees will be returned to their headquarters exchange on a seniority basis under the following conditions:
I.	When the need for temporary employees diminishes to a point where some employees may be returned.
2.	When junior employees are available while senior employees from die same exchange (or work unit as appropriate), in the same title, are on temporary duty in other locations, the junior employees will be assigned to relieve the senior employees concurrent with the senior employees' next Company-paid weekend home visit, provided:
a,	The junior employee(s) is qualified to relieve the senior employee(s).
b.	The work being performed by the senior employee(s) can be prudently reassigned.
c.	The senior employee(s) makes a request to return home.
3.	When employees in exchange "A" are selected and temporarily transferred to exchange "B", such employees should not be subsequently moved to another exchange with the following exceptions:
a.	When such employees are to perform work in an exchange within 35 miles of exchange "B", those initially selected may be so utilized.
1)	When it is known in advance that the employees selected are to perform work in another exchange within 35 miles of exchange ’’B”, this information should be made known to the appropriate employees at the time such employees are being canvassed. Also, when the expected duration of
164
12.05E- 12.06
such work is known, the employees will be so advised at the time of canvassing. The Company will endeavor to keep such movement within the cluster at a minimum, service requirements permitting.
b.	When employees in exchange "A" are selected and temporarily transferred to exchange "B" and the need for work develops in an exchange more than 35 miles from exchange "B", the selection process specified in 12.05C should be reinstituted and the appropriate employees in exchange "A11 should be given the opportunity to volunteer for the assignment.
F.	Temporary transfers for the purpose of training will be excluded from the requirements of 12.05C1, C2, and 12.05E.
G.	In a Control Center (CC) environment, the performance of work assignments involving movement of forces in and out of exchanges is not considered a temporary transfer insofar as the application of 12.05A, C and E is concerned provided such exchanges are not beyond 35 miles of the employee’s existing exchange. Such work will, however, be subject to the provisions of 9.02, as appropriate. Exemption from the application of these sections will not apply to such CC forces, however, when they are temporarily transferred away from their home exchange to other CC's or work groups in order to temporarily perform work functions outside of the scope of their home CC’s normal area of control.
H.	The movement in and out of exchanges within a State of employees on State payrolls is not a temporary transfer under 12.05.
12.06 Appeal Rights.
The decision of the Company on any of the factors mentioned in 12.01, 12.02, 12.04 and 13.03 will be subject to the grievance procedure set forth in Article 21.

165
Article 13
the Arbitrator finds that the Company acted arbitrarily or in bad faith, the Company will promptly take the necessary steps to correct such action.

166
13.01 - 13.02B
Switching Control and Toll Center work groups, such as Field Forces, Trunking, Analyzation & Control, etc. are to be considered as different types of equipment.) On any changes occurring in Control Center (CC) groupings, or the introduction of new CC's, the Company will give prior notification to the appropriate State Director of the Union, or his/her designee, of the purpose of the proposed change, the job titles involved and if applicable, the intended CC area of control.

On any changes occurring in Control Center (CC) groupings, or the introduction of new CC's the Company will give prior notification to the appropriate State Director of the Union, or his/her designee, of the purpose of the proposed change, the job titles involved and, if applicable, the intended CC area of control. The Company will consider the Union's input before making the change. The action of the Company in proceeding with the change will not prejudice the Union's rights under Article 15 or any other applicable rights under the Agreement.
3.	Construction forces will be grouped together for the choice of vacations as follows:

168
13.02B1 - 13.O3A1
grouping of employees in this manner will only be applicable in small exchanges (see Appendix "A").
4.	Employees, other than those covered in “2” and “3” above, in the same or different titles having the same or a different place of reporting, who work under the same immediate supervisor may be grouped together for vacation selection purposes provided vacation relief is to be obtained from such employees and such employees possess the skills to relieve each other without training.
5.	Employees, other than those covered in 13.02B2, B3 and B4 above who have a common title, a common place of reporting, a common second level supervisor (or higher level in the absence of a second level), and who perform the same type work shall be grouped together for choice of vacations.

1.	"Formal training" includes the selection of employees from within a work group who are regularly scheduled to work part-time or to relieve in another job in accordance with 4,071, and the principle of 12.02C shall be observed among all the members of the work groups who are
169
Article 13
grouped together for the purpose of overtime equalization and vacation selections at the same place of reporting.
2.	In the case of an unanticipated need for selecting a person from within a work group to fill in temporarily in another job in accordance with 4.071, the principle of 12.02C shall be observed if such assignment extends beyond work on 3 consecutive work days.
B.	Opportunity for training will first be offered to employees within the job title and group normally performing the work prior to offering such training to employees in lower rated titles. Seniority shall govern if other necessary qualifications of the individuals are substantially equal.
Opportunity for formal training will be rotated among the employees within a work group insofar as practicable in keeping with the needs of the business.
C.	If job technology or functions are to be changed within a job title within a work group to the extent that the incumbents will not be able to satisfactorily perform in the job without successfully completing additional company-sponsored jobspecific training, and the company has established the attainment of a minimum test score as a prerequisite to taking the training, the company will notify all of the incumbents in all of the work groups affected within an exchange/WRA.
1.	Such incumbents will then be offered an opportunity to take the prerequisite test as soon as practicable following such notification and, if they meet minimum test score requirements, will be considered as qualifying for taking the job-specific training subject to the provisions of 13.03B.
2.	Those incumbents in "I" above who fail to meet the required minimum test score will be advised of the areas in which they appear to be deficient and will be given the opportunity to receive appropriate general skills training under PARTNERSHIP. If they complete such training
170
13.03A2 - 14.01A4
they will then be considered as qualifying to the same degree as those in “I" above for taking the job-specific training subject to the provisions of 13.03B.
3.	If an incumbent declines to take the prerequisite test at all, or declines the process offered in "2" above, or fails to successfully complete the job-specific company sponsored training, he/she will be assigned to the unchanged functions within the title within the exchange/WRA to the extent such work is available on a full-time basis, so long as such assignment will not adversely affect operations efficiency If such assignment is not made or at such time such assignment cannot be continued, the employee may be treated as an "operational efficiencies" surplus under Article 7.
ARTICLE 14 JURISDICTION OF WORK
(for CPE see Customer Markets Addendum)
14.01 Contract Work.
A.	The Company agrees to use only Company employees on work involving the construction, maintenance, removal and/or repair of the following types of plant:
1.	All aerial outside plant except that on which such work may be performed by unskilled or occasional labor working on the ground rather than aloft.
2.	Underground cable and splicing of buried cable.
3.	Submarine cable except where such work requires the use of boats, barges, water-borne or other special equipment not normally used by the Company.
4.	Local and toll central office, TWX, TLX, private line or station equipment which constitutes any part of a communication circuit except work on such plant done by a connecting company on plant located in its territory.
171
Article 14
Notwithstanding the above, the Company will not contract the maintenance or repair of such telephone plant located in the territory of a connecting company where the Company is now doing such work by employees now stationed or may subsequently be stationed in the territory of the connecting company.
5.	Nothing in 14.01 is to be interpreted as restricting the right of the Company to use contractors' labor to perform any work under "2" and "3" above which can be done by unskilled or occasional employees. Neither is it intended to prevent the Company from contracting out the type of work which was normally performed by the Western Electric Company and The Long Lines Department of American Telephone and Telegraph Company prior to the divestiture of the Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company and South Central Bell Telephone Company from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.
6.	Nothing in 14.01 is to be interpreted as restricting the right of the Company to contract out any work during an emergency or to allow subscribers to remove the instruments from their premises if such removal can be effected without the use of telephone craft skills. Emergency work includes the clearing of trouble and the accompanying repair of any plant located in the territory of a connecting company.
B.	The Company farther agrees that in the carrying out of its program of construction, removal, maintenance and/or repair of telephone plant it will not contract any work which would make it necessary to lay off or part-time any regular or temporary employee of the Company.
14.02 Non-Performance of Craft Work by Supervisors.
The Company agrees that it will not as a general practice work supervisory employees who are classed as "Executive" employees under the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, on work ordinarily performed by non-supervisory employees
172
14.04A5 - 15.0ID
except for purposes of instruction or to meet emergency conditions. The parties recognize, however, that there are proper exceptions to this general practice, made in the interest of the service or economical operation, and in such cases nothing herein is intended to prohibit the Company from working such supervisory employees on non-supervisory work.
ARTICLE 15
JOB DESCRIPTIONS, TITLES AND CLASSIFICATIONS
15.01 Job Titles and Classifications.
Whenever the Company determines it appropriate to create a new job title or job classification in the bargaining unit or to restructure or redefine an existing one, it shall be handled as follows:
A.	The Company shall notify the Union in writing of such job title or classification and shall furnish a job description of the duties and the wage rates and schedules initially determined for such job titles and classifications. Such wage rates and schedules shall be designated as temporary. Following such notice to the Union at the Company bargaining level, the Company may proceed to staff such job title or classification.
B.	The Union shall have the right, within 30 days from receipt of notice from the Company, to initiate negotiations concerning the initial wage rates or schedules established as temporary by the Company.
C.	If negotiations are not so initiated or if agreement is reached between the parties within 60 days following receipt of notice from the Company concerning the wage rates and schedules, the temporary designation shall be removed from the job title or classification.
D.	If negotiations are initiated and the parties are unable to reach agreement within 60 days following receipt of notice from the Company, the Union shall provide the Company in writing a
173
Article 15
statement of their position containing the wage rate they consider appropriate for the new or restructured job. The issue of an appropriate schedule of wage rates shall then be submitted to a neutral third party (NTP), to be selected as set forth below, for determination of the final schedule of wage rates.
E.	It is expected that agreement on a job description be reached during the negotiation. If such agreement is not reached, a joint job description verification study will be undertaken to ensure that the work components assigned to the job by the Company are accurately described. If, following this verification study and any resulting modifications to the job description, agreement still cannot be reached that the work components are accurately described, grievance and arbitration procedures may be initiated. Such grievances must be filed by the Union at the Executive Level within the 60 day period described in "D" above.
F.	Once the parties agree the job has been accurately described or the matter has been resolved by arbitration, the Company and the Union will notify the NTP that he/she has been selected and arrange a meeting within the third or fourth week of the first 30 days at a place mutually agreeable with all parties. The NTP will also be informed that each of the parties will send their written rationale for the proposed wage rate of the disputed job to the NTP within 2 weeks. This will include a job description and other agreed upon information.
G.	The Union and Company will meet within 2 weeks and exchange/WRA their rationale for their proposed rate. This will normally include comparisons of not more than 2 existing bargained-for jobs that each party feels will justify their position. They will jointly mail the required material to the NTP. This material will include; (1) an agreed upon job description of the disputed job, (2) the job descriptions of existing jobs (not more than 2) that each party feels justifies the rate of the disputed job, and the wage schedule that each
174
15.0IE- 15.01K
party believes should apply, and (3) the parties may include information such as competitive market rates if they so desire.
H.	At the meeting, each party may verbally present its position to the NTP, This meeting is for the purpose of providing the NTP with detailed information concerning the duties of the job, the skills required, the training necessary to perform the work and other related information, Similar information for the comparable jobs as detailed in "G" above may be provided so that the NTP can expeditiously render a fair and informed decision determining the wage rate for the disputed job. It is generally expected this informative meeting would be concluded in one day or less and be completed within 30 days of the NTP selection. Each party shall bear the expense of its representatives and witnesses at this meeting.
I.	At the conclusion of this meeting, the NTP must notify the Union and Company if additional information or a job visit is required. The parties will coordinate the provision of additional information or a job visit. If the Union and Company representatives wish to accompany the NTP on the job visit or incumbent interview, they may do so. All of these arrangements must be made so that the decision can be reached within 60 days.
J.	While it is not intended that such third party undertake a full and complete job evaluation study, he/she shall review the job titles and their respective wage schedules as submitted by the Company and the Union for comparison purposes. Also, if necessary, the NTP may make an on>site inspection of the workplace and conduct a reasonable number of interviews of incumbents.
K.	The decision should include a brief rationale for the wage schedule that was selected for the disputed job. The intent is that the NTP will select either the wage schedule submitted by the Company or the Union. In the event the NTP selects the wage schedule submitted by the Union, the new schedule shall be placed in effect retroactively to the date notification was
175
Article 16
given to the NTP as specified in ”F" above up to a maximum of 60 days. If the parties mutually agree to waive the time frames specified in Article 15, the period of retroactivity will be a negotiable item to be addressed in the final evaluation of the issue,
L.	The expense of the NTP will be borne equally by the parties.
M.	The NTP referred to above shall be selected by mutual agreement from a list of 5 individuals compiled by the Company and the Union. Such individuals on the list shall possess acknowledged expertise in the area of job evaluation.
15.	02 Negotiations Covering Wage Rates for New or Restructured Job Titles or Classifications.
The procedures set forth in 15.01 above shall be the exclusive means by which the Union may contest the schedule of wage rates which the Company sets for any new or restructured job title or classification.
15.	03 Negotiations Covering Wage Rates for Exchanges/WRA(s) or Equipment Locations.
A.	The Company shall furnish to the Union, in writing, notice of the acquisition or activation by the Company of additional exchanges/WRA or equipment locations which require the establishment of new jobs or extension of jobs or job titles.
B.	The Union shall have the right within 30 days from receipt of such notice in "A" above to initiate negotiations concerning the appropriate wage zone/wage area applicable to the job titles or job classifications involved.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
(for CPE see Customer Markets Addendum)
21.01 Grievance Levels.
In the processing of any grievance, the Company will furnish the Union all necessary and relevant data concerning the grievance as determined by the National Labor Relations Act. If the grievance is initiated at the local level, this information will be furnished to the Local President or authorized Union representative upon request. The parties agree that in the handling and adjustment of grievances by the Union the following procedures will be followed:
A.	An employee or group of employees will have the right to present to and adjust with management any grievance as provided in Section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended,' provided, however, that no adjustment will be made with the employee or group of employees involved which is inconsistent with the terms of any collective bargaining agreement between the parties then in effect, and provided further that the Union has been given an opportunity to be present at such adjustment.
B.	After an employee or employees have presented a grievance to the Union for settlement and a Union representative has informed the Company that the Union represents that employee(s), the Company will not discuss or adjust such grievance with said employee(s) unless the aggrieved employee(s) initiate a request that the Company discuss and adjust such grievance directly with the involved employee(s), but in no event will an adjustment be made unless a Union representative is afforded an opportunity to be present at such adjustment.
C.	Grievances, other than those involving the true intent and meaning (see 21.01C5) of this or any other agreement between the parties or adversely affecting the rights of other
188
21.01 -21.01C2
employees, will be handled under the procedure set forth below. For each such grievance initiated by the Union under this Paragraph, the steps in the procedure will be those listed below except as provided in 21.06C (Vacancies), and 21.07 (Short Term Disability Plan).
1st Step- The Informal Level (the level where the aggrieved employee is employed)
2nd Step - Panel Process/Formal Level
3rd Step - State Level
4th Step - Executive Level
1.	Informal Level (1 st Step).
Before formal grievances involving matters other than discharges and demotions are filed at the 2nd Step, there must have been an Informal Level meeting or conference with the appropriate Union and Company representatives, normally the local steward and the immediate supervisor. This meeting may be waived by mutual consent where appropriate. When necessary, the Union may request the presence of an involved grievant(s). This meeting is intended to allow both sides to fully explore the incident, develop the facts, state their contentions, clear up any possible misunderstandings and attempt to informally resolve the dispute. No record will be made at this meeting or conference; no papers, forms or written answers are to be filed. (For pay treatment see 21.03 and2L04.)
2.	Panel Process/Formal Level (2nd Step).
Each grievance must be presented as a formal grievance at the 2nd Step within 60 days from the date of the last occurrence on which the grievance is based by filing a written request for a formal grievance meeting. This request must be filed with the Director/designee within 14 days following the Informal Level meeting.
At the 2nd Step meeting, the grievance must be reduced to writing on the Record of Grievance Form and
189
Article 21
presented to the Company by the Union at the conclusion of the meeting(s). (For pay treatment see 21.03 and 21.04.)
Grievance meetings at the 2nd Step will normally be handled as follows:
a.	By a panel composed of 2 CWA and 2 Company representatives designated by the Local President and involved Director, respectively.
1)	Panelists will meet at a mutually agreeable time to hear presentations made by the two parties (normally the steward and supervisor who met at the Informa] Level or Company/CWA designee in some instances) and to ask questions as needed.
2)	Panelists will then excuse the presenters/ grievant(s) and discuss the issue among themselves until they reach resolution or determine that the grievance will be rejected or appealed.
3)	The decision of the panel will then be relayed to the presenters/grievant(s),
4)	If the panel is unable to reach consensus, the Union will provide the Company a Form 3G3A. Within 7 days, the Company will provide the Union its answer on the Form 3G3A. Within 7 days of receipt, the Union will provide its response on the Form 3G3A. (See “c” and “d” below.)
5)	If a grievance heard by the panel is appealed, a joint brief, outlining both CWA and Company viewpoints, will be prepared by panel members and forwarded to the State Level.
b.	As exceptions, grievances involving true intent and meaning of this contract or other agreements between
190
2l.01C2a - 21.01C2b3
the parties (see 2I.01C and C5) and grievances involving discharges will not be heard by the panel.
The parties may mutually agree to use the following Formal Level grievance procedure in lieu of the panel;
At the Formal Level meeting the grievance must be reduced to writing on the Record of Grievance Form adopted by the parties and presented to the Company by the Union at the conclusion of the meeting(s). (For pay treatment see 21.03 and 21.04.)
1)	Within 14 days from the date of the meeting (or the last adjourned meeting) the management representative with whom the grievance was discussed will inform the Union in writing on 4 copies of the Record of Grievance Form of his/her proposed position. If the parties agree on an adjustment, the-adjustment will be stated as the proposed disposition on the Record of Grievance Form and both parties will sign 2 copies of the form and each retain one signed copy.
2)	With respect to “1” above, failure of the management representative to submit a written decision within 14 days as described therein, effects an automatic appeal to the next higher Level.
3)	Within 14 days from the date when the Union is advised on the Record of Grievance Form of the proposed disposition by the management representative, the Union will advise the Company on a copy of the Record of Grievance Form whether the proposed disposition is accepted, rejected or appealed. Such advice should be directed to the management representative with whom the Union discussed the grievance. If the grievance is appealed to the 3rd Step, the Union
191
Article 21
will promptly forward the grievance to the Union’s designated representative who services the area involved. Grievances so appealed may nevertheless be dropped without a meeting and without prejudice to the Union’s contentions regarding the merits of the grievance.
4)	The Union’s rejection of the proposed disposition by the management representative at the 2nd Step will close the grievance without prejudice to the Union's contentions regarding the merits of the grievance.
5)	If the Union does not return a copy of the Record of Grievance Form indicating their decision within the 14 days specified in “3” above, the Company’s proposed disposition will be considered to have been appealed.
(a) Where agreed to by the Company, a Mediation Hearing may be held for grievances other than true intent at the Company’s expense if the parties fail to resolve the gnevance(s). (See 23.03) Refusal of the Company to use mediation will not be subject to escalation or grievance.
c.	Regardless of format chosen, in discipline cases the Company and CWA representatives have the responsibility to meet, discuss the issue(s) and complete the related paperwork within 30 days of the request for a meeting date. On non*discipline grievances, the parties will have 60 days to do so.
d.	Where mutually agreed, the time periods in “c” may be extended, normally not beyond 30 days. It is intended that the time limits specified in 21.01C2a4 above will be included in the time frames outlined in “c” and “d”.
192
21.01C2M - 21.01C3bl
e.	Failure of the parties to cany out their responsibilities within the specified time frames will generate an automatic appeal of the grievance to the State Level. The State Level representatives will determine the action necessary to address the problem and will handle the grievance accordingly.
f.	Grievances involving counseling entries shall not be appealed beyond the 2nd Level of the grievance procedures.
3.	State Level (3rd Step).
On grievances appealed to the 3rd Step, the CWA Staff Representative will request a meeting with the designated Management representative within 30 days of the date of appeal and that meeting will be held within 30 days of such request
a.	If mutually agreed, State Level representatives may extend the time frame, normally not beyond 60 days, to meet and discuss the related grievance.
1)	If either party identifies a problem with meeting on grievances within the specified time frames, such would be referred to the Executive Level for review and remedy of the problem.
b.	If the parties agree on a settlement, such will be stated as the proposed disposition on the Record of Grievance Form and both parties will sign 2 copies of the form and each retain one signed copy.
1)	If the grievance is not disposed of otherwise the parties will indicate in writing their respective positions on the Record of Grievance Form. Such positions will be exchanged in accordance with “a” and “b” below. These positions, will include the issue(s) in question, the position taken by the respective parties, their contentions concerning the
193
Article 21
true facts and offers made at the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Steps, if any, to settle the issue.

(b)	Within 14 days (90 days for discipline related grievances) from the date when the Union is advised on the Record of Grievance Form of the proposed disposition by the Management representative, the Union will advise the Company on a copy of the Form whether the proposed disposition is accepted, rejected or appealed except as otherwise provided for in 21.01 C3bl d. If the grievance is appealed to the 4th Step, the Union will promptly forward the grievance to the Union’s designated representative. Grievances so appealed may nevertheless be dropped without a meeting and without prejudice to the Union’s contentions regarding the merits of the grievance.
(c)	Grievances, except those involving benefit and discipline issues, not satisfactorily adjusted at the 3rd Step may then be appealed to the 4th Step. If the Union does not request a conference on an appeal to the next higher level within 30 days of the date of appeal, the grievance will be closed.
194
21.01C3bla - 21.01C5
(d)	Discipline related grievances not satisfactorily adjusted at the 3rd Step, may then be subject to the arbitration procedures as outlined in Article 23.
4.	Executive Level (4th Step).
Each party will advise the other of the names of its representatives at the 4th Step who are authorized to finally approve settlements made at the 2nd or 3rd Step of the grievance procedure. On grievances appealed to the 4th Step the appropriate Company representative should meet with the Union within 30 days after the Union has requested a conference on such grievance. In the event the appropriate Company representative is unable to meet within that time period, the Company and Union may agree to a 14 day extension for the meeting.
a.	If a meeting is not held by the appropriate Company representative within the greater of 30 days of the Union's request for a conference or the extended time period due to the fault of the Company, the Company will have defaulted on that grievance.

Such exhibits may be assigned such weight as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
6.	When a Union grievance is appealed, the decision of management at the 4th Step will be given to the Union

D. The computation of any period of time prescribed by any Agreement between the parties will begin on the day after the occurrence, presentation, appeal, decision, request or demand and continue on a calendar-day basis through the last day of the period.

CALL SAMPLING
(Except Large Business, CPE and A/l Centers)
Sampling of service, used in the spirit of trust and respect, is a valuable tool to enhance customer service. To assure courteous treatment, accurate information and superior service, customer calls may be monitored to assist in the training, development and evaluation of employees, the identification of customer needs and to evaluate products and service.
Individual Call Sampling
Individual call sampling will not be used to harass an individual or group of employees, nor will it be used to create an atmosphere of pressure in the work environment. In departments where such sampling is conducted, trained Company management observers will perform it. When individual call sampling, defined as sampling which targets or is directed at a specific employee, takes place, employees will be given prior notification the day sampling occurs. Each employee will have the option of side-by-side or remote call sampling. All remote, individual call sampling will be taken from within the general work area, defined as the same building, of the employee being observed and a light turned on when individual, remote call sampling is being conducted.
Feedback of all calls sampled will be provided to the employee by the end of the day in which the calls were observed, unless prevented by employee initiated absence. Such feedback should be constructive, with emphasis on the positive aspects of the employee’s performance. Feedback may be conducted away from the employee’s workstation. Any time the feedback discussion is expected to include information which may require extensive dialog between the observer and the employee, arrangements should be made to conduct the feedback away from the employee’s workstation. In addition, employees may request that feedback be given in a remote location.
291
Appendix C
Part 1
Process Call Sampling
Process call sampling, defined as any sampling other than individual call sampling, may be done from remote locations. Since process call sampling is not employee specific, the notification and remote/side-by-side option associated with individual call sampling will not be provided. Employees will not be evaluated or appraised on process call samplings.
Results of process call samples will normally only be provided at the work unit level except for gross customer abuse, fraud, and violation of secrecy of communications. Employees may request individual feedback, if available, by advising their supervisor. The Company shall remove any details which would allow identification of individual employees from official observing reports.
Employees will not be disciplined as a result of process call sampling on the 1st occurrence. If, within 18 months, subsequent incidents of gross customer abuse, fraud, or violation of secrecy of communications are observed and the employee can be identified, it will be formally documented and action taken if warranted.
The Company will continue to comply with any applicable laws regarding service monitoring or observation.
General
Personal calls made on either telephones provided for personal use of employees or at employees' workstations will not be subject to supervisory observing. This is not to be construed as influencing present or future practices as to the making of such calls from employees’ workstations. Speaker phones will be prohibited. Test calls will be for diagnostic purposes only.
This agreement does not restrict the Union’s right of representation, including the processing of grievances and engaging in arbitration.

SERVICE REQUIREMENTS
Dear Ms. Hicks:
During 2001 bargaining, the CWA expressed concern that some managers continue to use the term "service requirements" in administering various sections of the Working Agreement. The CWA felt that some managers were too restrictive in scheduling and granting time off and were incorrectly using service requirements as the reason. The Company and the CWA also discussed the need to continue to provide our customers with excellent service and are fully aware that good customer service is an important competitive advantage to our Company.
The Company recognizes the need for our managers to exercise "service requirements" in a spirit of good faith. While service to our customers is more important than ever, we must carefully consider the needs of our employees and the economical operation of the business before invoking "service requirements".

TELECOMMUTING
The Company and the Union recognize the challenge that each employee faces as workplace demands, career objectives, family needs and personal goals compete for time and attention. Telecommuting is a possible resource to help meet those challenges as well as addressing environmental concerns. In addition, telecommuting affords the Company the opportunity to demonstrate to its current and potential customers the benefits of adopting new and evolving technologies, including remote worker applications.
Telecommuting is an alternative work arrangement that may provide increased flexibility where work content does not require that a particular job function be done totally at a specific job site. The criteria for telecommuting will be developed by the Company and the Union at the Executive Level prior to implementation.
The selections of employees who volunteer for telecommuting opportunities will be by seniority if all criteria qualifications are equal and the necessary qualifications of the individuals are equal. Employees or the Company may opt out of a telecommuting work arrangement after 30 days or immediately in emergency situations.

EASY TIME
CONSUMER SERVICES
This agreement between the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and BellSouth Telecommunications (BST) outlines the understanding reached by the parties in regard to the implementation of Easy Time (ET).
This agreement allows the ET plan to cover all Service Representatives, Sales Associates, Collection Representatives, Solutions Specialists and Office Assistants in Consumer.
Purpose of Easy Time: Provide employees with greater flexibility and control of time off needed as a result of personal and/or family obligations.
Guidelines:
>	Fifteen-minute increments of time, up to two full vacation days, are available to employees for personal and/or family obligations.
>	An increment may be taken at any time during the vacation schedule period, provided not more than 25% of the work group has already been granted time off. In the event more than 25% of the work group is scheduled off, then the time may be granted consistent with the needs of the business.
>	Employee will advise supervisor or in-charge personnel that ET is needed. No justification is required.
>	Holidays and Mondays are not available for ET use.
>	ET can be used after the fact, but the employee MUST notify the supervisor or in-charge personnel during the first session of the scheduled tour and the 25% rule will still apply.
>	ET is not an option available for use for the employee's personal illness.
>	Employees will be required to identify the scheduled vacation day from which ET will be deducted. Once a whole day is broken
332
Customer Markets Addendum

with ET, that day must be used in its entirety before another day is broken.
> ET cannot be denied (except for the limits of the 25% rule) and no reason has to be given by the employee for ET. Other time off could be denied due to service requirements, while ET was granted. If other time off is unavailable, the request can be changed to ET and may be granted subject to the 25% rule.
OMISSION: The parties have attempted to include all issues associated with the Easy Time (ET) program. To the extent a situation arises that was not contemplated by the parties, it is agreed to initiate discussion at the Executive Level in an effort to resolve such matters.
DURATION: Easy Time will continue for the life of the 2001 Working Agreement.

Contracting of Work in CPE Marketplace
CONTRACTING OF WORK IN THE CPE MARKETPLACE
Dear Mr. Smith:
There was extensive discussion during bargaining regarding the contracting of work. The CWA expressed strong concern that contracting work would result in the diminution, or at best, no growth of the bargaining unit. Moreover, the Union adhered firmly to their position that corporate communication services for BellSouth Telecommunications be performed by bargaining unit employees.
The Company recognizes these concerns; however, due to various reasons such as the changing CPE market, economic conditions, and business consideration, it is not possible to make specific commitments on contracting out work elements of the business. However, we did agree to continue the language that insures the contracting of any work will not result in the lay-off or part-timing of bargaining unit employees. Furthermore, the Company agreed that during the life of the Agreement it will not contract out corporate communication services in BellSouth Telecommunications facilities.
Finally, it is the Company’s objective in making decisions regarding the contracting of work to carefully consider the interests of customers, the concern of employees as to its effect on them, and other considerations essential to the success of BCS.

Dear Mr. Smith:
In today's business environment there is an increasing demand from prospective customers that vendor service employees submit to random drug testing.
During 1998 Bargaining, the Union and the Company had lengthy discussions around this issue. The Union expressed considerable concern as to the impact on the employees that the CWA represents.
Subsequently, it was agreed by the Union and the Company that customer requirements for random drug testing would be followed if the requirements were a condition for all vendors. Additionally, the Company agreed to obtain exception to these customer drug testing requirements whenever possible.

Dear Mr. Smith:
There was considerable discussion during bargaining regarding the subject of achieving our growth aspirations through a close partnership with the CWA. One of the more critical areas of that partnership is the training and retention of highly skilled data technicians. In today's data-centric marketplace, demand for advanced skills is intense. As BellSouth and CWA partner in our quest to become the industry's foremost data provider, we must be aggressive in our efforts to realize a return on our training in vestment.
Therefore, to maximize our investment for our Customers, Employees and Shareholders, we have agreed to the following retention provisions:
•	The Company has a modernized data-training curriculum that, upon successful completion, will provide our employees with the certifications and other training required to master the rapidly escalating technology challenges.
•	We will continue a 24-month non-promotional transfer restriction for employees who complete the curriculum. This provision will restrict movement to other Departments and entities for lateral or down ward movement only.
•	We will continue an investment-recovery provision that gives the Company the right to recover the data curriculum training expenses, or appropriate prorated portions of the expenses, in the event an employee voluntarily leaves BellSouth within 24 months following successful completion of the curriculum. Such recovery is the sole responsibility of the Company.
The Company and the Union committed to work together on the implementation of the program. Together we can make this critical initiative a success.

The Company will attempt to contact them prior to contacting a stand-by technician or another member of their work group.
2.	The allocation of non-scheduled, non-connecting overtime for: Communications Technician, Repair Service Attendant, Service Representative, Systems Specialist Technician and Systems Technician will be on the following basis:
a. The overtime equalization report for work groups/units will be posted at the same location as the employee’s vacation schedule.

The report will run for twelve (12) week periods and then begin anew.
(1)	The overtime report will show for each employee, his/her name and the cumulative total of overtime hours worked during the elapsed portion of a twelve (12) week period.

(c)	Employees who do not desire overtime must notify their supervisors in writing.
