PREAMBLE
THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into between Albertson's Inc., Ralphs Grocery Company, and Vons, A Safeway Company, referred to hereinafter as the "Employer" and UFCW Locals 135, 324, 770, 1167, 1428, 1442 and 8-GS chartered by the UNITED FOOD & COMMERCIAL WORKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION, CLC, referred to hereinafter as the "Union."
ARTICLE 1	- RECOGNITION OF THE UNION
A.	BARGAINING UNIT.
1.	The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole collective bargaining agent with respect to work, rates of pay, hours and terms and conditions of employment for the appropriate bargaining unit composed of all employees, including employees of lessees, licensees and concessionaires (sometimes herein referred to as "leased departments"), except as limited below, who perform work within food markets, discount stores, drug stores and shoe stores presently operated and hereafter established, owned oroperated by the Employer within the jurisdiction of the Local Union. The jurisdiction of the Local Union as referred to in this Agreement is defined as set forth in Appendix G. Food markets are defined as those types of establishments covered by the collective bargaining Agreement identified as Retail Food, Bakery, Candy and General Merchandise Agreement, July 31, 1978 to July 26, 1981.
2.	All work or services not specifically excluded by this Agreement is hereby recognized as bargaining unit work. Such bargaining unit work shall not be subcontracted, except as provided herein. Employees of lessees, licensees and concessionaires (hereinafter referred to as leased departments) shall be covered by this Agreement, and the Employer will at all times exercise and retain full control of the terms and conditions of employment within its stores of all employees of such leased departments. The employees of such leased departments shall be and remain members of a single overall unit encompassing all employees at the stores. This Agreement shall apply to all bargaining unit employees of such leased departments, except that if such leased department engages in a line of business which has not been historically and generally been of the type and kind engaged in by the Employer through its grocery, produce, drug, delicatessen, general merchandise, bakery or liquor departments, then in such event, the Union and the operator of the leased department shall meet and negotiate appropriate wages for employees performing such work. If the Union and the operator of the leased department are unable to agree upon such appropriate wages, an arbitrator shall be selected to hear and determine the dispute with respect to such matter, in accordance with Article 12 of this Agreement, notwithstanding in this situation any provisions to the contrary contained therein. The seniority of employees of leased departments shall be separate from the seniority of employees of the Employer and the employees of other leased departments. The obligation of the Employer under this Agreement with respect to any leased department shall be limited to the foregoing, and the Employer shall not be liable for any breach of contract or failure of a leased department to abide by any provision of this Agreement; provided that the Employer shall furnish to the Union written evidence of its agreement with the operator of the leased department that the operator of the leased department has assumed the obligations of this Agreement. With respect to leased departments which are in existence as of the effective date of this Agreement, this Paragraph 2 shall have no application to such leased departments and no claim of violation of this Agreement or any predecessor agreement shall be made or maintained with respect to any such leased departments in existence as of the effective date of this Agreement.
3.	It is recognized by the Employer and the Union that Paragraph 2 of this Section A is a single integral understanding and agreement, and further agreed that if and when a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or a decision of the National Labor Relations Board, if such decision becomes final without review in the courts, adjudges the said Paragraph 2, or any part thereof, to be in conflict with or in violation of any law, Paragraph 2 in its entirety shall be of no further force and effect and the parties
1
shall, at the request of any party, meet for the purpose of renegotiation and agreement on the said Paragraph 2. This Agreement with respect to said Paragraph 2 only, supersedes the provisions of Article 19.
4.	In the event that the Employer establishes a new department or creates new work in any of the stores or establishments operated by the Employer which are covered by this Agreement, for which wages are not specifically provided in this Agreement, it is agreed that, should the parties be unable to reach agreement upon wages for such work, the parties shall then submit the matter to arbitration in accordance with Article 12 of this Agreement, notwithstanding in this situation any provisions to the contrary contained therein and shall be bound by the terms of the arbitration award.
5.	In the event the signatory Employer should operate discount stores, drug stores or shoe stores within the geographical jurisdiction of the Local Union, the appropriate terms and conditions of employment, as in existence with the other employers operating alike retail establishments, shall be immediately applied by the signatory Employer. Upon failure of the parties to agree on the wage rates, the rates shall be established by arbitration, again notwithstanding in this situation any provisions to the contrary contained therein.
6.	It is recognized by the Employer and the Union that the bargaining unit as defined hereinabove is composed of several segments consisting of food markets, discount stores, drug stores and shoe stores. With reference to such segments, it is agreed that negotiations shall be conducted in each segment, separate and apart from any other segment and that any economic action undertaken by the Union or Employer shall not extend to or include or in any way involve any other segment. It is further agreed that with reference to any segment the Employer may join with any other employers in any collective bargaining negotiations covering such segment and may participate fully therein, including participation in any economic action, which may occur, subject to the limitations hereinabove set forth regarding noninvolvement of other segments.
7.	No restrictions or prohibitions shall be placed on the sale of any prepackaged or pretreated merchandise purchased from any source not directly related through ownership or management control to the Employer. It is understood, however, that the work involved in the sale of such merchandise will be performed in accordance with this Agreement.
B.	FOOD MARKET EXCLUSIONS. Excluded from the segment for food markets are:
1.	Persons engaged exclusively in janitorial and/or maintenance work.
2.	Persons presently under a collective bargaining agreement with the Culinary Workers Union, or persons employed in a complete restaurant.
3.	Persons who confine their work solely to demonstration, offering of samples, assisting customers in the selection of merchandise being demonstrated, and activities of an advertising nature.
4.	Persons who build promotional displays as long as such displays do not include merchandise for selection or pick-up by customers.
5.	During any three (3) consecutive days preceding the reopening of an old food market, discount store, drug store or shoe store of the Employer, which has been closed for remodeling for a period of thirty (30) days or less, upon prior notice to the Union, persons not in the bargaining unit may perform any work in such store.
6.	Except as provided for in Article 14, the taking of inventories may be done by employees or persons who are not members of the bargaining unit and who are engaged exclusively in such work,
2
provided that any such employees will become a part of the bargaining unit upon the signatory Union giving proof (cross-check) of its majority representation of such employees.
7.	Notwithstanding any language to the contrary contained in this Agreement between the parties, it is agreed that this Agreement shall have no application whatsoever to any new food market, discount store, drug store or shoe store until fifteen (15) days following the opening to the public of any such new establishment. Neither shall this Agreement have any application whatsoever to any food market, discount store, drug store or shoe store which is reopened after it has been closed for a period of more than thirty (30) days until the fifteenth (15th) day following the date of such reopening to the public.
The Employer shall staff such new or reopened food market with a combination of both current employees and new hires, in accordance with current industry practices of staffing such stores with a cadre of current employees possessing the necessary skills, ability and experience, plus sufficient new hires to meet staffing requirements. Employees, who are thus transferred, upon whom contributions are made to the various trust funds shall continue to have contributions to the several trust funds made on their behalf in the same manner and in the same amount per hour as such contributions were made prior to their transfer.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is agreed that when the remodeling of an existing location occurs without such store being closed, the Employer shall only be obliged to give the members of the bargaining unit employed by him in such store an opportunity to perform the work required for such remodeling at the applicable contract rate except that such opportunity to perform such work shall not include any overtime hours. When members of the bargaining unit within such store are not available for such work, such work may be performed by persons not in the bargaining unit.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement between the parties, it is agreed and understood that the probationary period for any new hires in such new or reopened store(s) referred to above shall not begin until the fifteenth (15th) day following such opening or reopening of such store(s) to the public.
8.	Persons engaged in the inspection of merchandise displayed for sale as to its condition or status of inventory for the purpose of recommending changes to be made or services to be performed by the employees within the bargaining unit.
9.	Store office employees whose work is not directly connected to checkstand operation or procedures.
10.	Employees of suppliers engaged in the handling of the following categories of merchandise:
(a)	Bread and cakes when delivered by bakery drivers.
(b)	Potato chips, corn chips and similar snack items, but no other delicatessen products.
(c)	Bulk and cello-wrapped candy when delivered by sales drivers.
(d)	Items requiring immediate refrigeration may be placed under refrigeration but not displayed.
11.	No bargaining unit work may be performed within the Employer's retail establishments by persons known as book salesmen or advance salesmen; except that, book salesmen and advance salesmen may check the condition of merchandise and may build initial promotional displays (at specifically designated locations, not to include normal shelf displays), which displays may include 3
merchandise for selection or pick-up by customers; provided, however, that if such displays require replenishment of merchandise because of customer pick-up, such replenishment of merchandise shall be performed by members of the bargaining unit. The foregoing prohibition shall not be construed to apply to work on categories of merchandise, which have heretofore been handled by employees of suppliers other than book salesmen and advance salesmen.
When book or advance salesmen or merchandisers employed by suppliers have performed bargaining unit work in a store, other than that permissible under this Agreement, the Union shall notify the Employer in writing. If within six (6) months after the receipt of such notification the Employer permits a further violation of this Agreement in this respect in the store, the Employer shall become liable for the payment of damages. Damages for each such willful violation shall be an amount equal to four (4) hours' pay at the contract rate for an experienced clerk to the Southern California United Food and Commercial Workers Unions and Food Employers Supplementary Unemployment and Supplementary Disability Benefit Fund. The written notices furnished the Employer after violations as described hereinabove shall be effective with respect to the damage provisions set forth above for a period of six (6) months from the date of receipt by the Employer of such notice. Thereafter, additional six-month periods within which said damage formula provisions shall be operative shall begin with a violation of this Paragraph, followed by a written notice of same from the Union. The damage formula shall begin anew for the six-month period with such violation followed by such notice. The foregoing damage formula has been agreed upon because the damages that may be sustained as a result of each such violation are not readily ascertainable and the sum provided for is intended as compensation for the damages suffered.
12.	Any new work created by the Employer covered by the Retail Food, Bakery, Candy and General Merchandise Agreement within his stores involving categories of merchandise not presently offered for sale is recognized and shall be deemed clerk's work and performed by members of the bargaining unit; except that, for a temporary period of tryout and familiarization, not to exceed six (6) months in each store following the introduction of such new category of merchandise, the Employer may contract for the performance of all or part of such work by nonbargaining unit persons; however, after the six-month period has expired, such work shall be and remain in any such store bargaining unit work exclusively subject to the terms of the collective bargaining Agreement. The rate of pay for such new work shall be as provided in the several classifications of the collective bargaining Agreement or as established pursuant to Article 1, Section A-4.
13.	The Employer may maintain or adopt the vendor/supplier assistance practices or policies in effect at any employer covered by the October 4, 1999 through October 5, 2003 Retail Food, Meat, Bakery, Candy and General Merchandise Agreement, as well as said practices or policies in effect between October 4, 1999 and October 2003 at Food 4 Less, Gelsons, Max Foods, Pak 'N Save, Super A and Super Saver.
Each Employer agrees to provide the Union with a listing of its practices or policies within ninety (90) days of March 1, 2004. Any dispute regarding the validity of said practices or policies shall be resolved pursuant to the adjustment and arbitration provisions of Article 12.
All prior Letters of Agreement or Understanding that are inconsistent with the two preceding paragraphs addressing utilization of vender/supplier assistance are nullified.
14.	Overall Store Manager and Assistant Manager. Two (2) persons commonly known as the overall store manager and as the assistant manager in each of the retail stores or store of the Employer are exempt from the present Agreement. A third (3rd) supervisor and/or managerial exemption, as designated by the Employer, will be allowed in each store that has a total interior square footage of 50,000 square feet or more. No bargaining unit employee shall be involuntarily reclassified as a direct result of this provision during the term of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way be
4
construed to interfere with any work, which the overall store manager, assistant manager and/or third (3rd) exclusion may perform.
15.	Owner. There shall not be more than two (2) Employers in any store or group of stores having common ownership. In partnerships, "Employer" as used in this Paragraph means only bona fide partners who own an interest in the assets, and in the profits of, the partnership. In corporations, "Employer" as used in this Paragraph means only two (2) officers of the corporation who own capital stock of the corporation. No more than two (2) shareholders of a corporation, or more than two (2) bona fide partners, shall be deemed or classified as an Employer within the meaning of this Agreement. Employers as thus defined may do such work as is necessary in the conduct of the business.
C.	DISCOUNT STORES EXCLUSIONS. Exclusions from the bargaining unit with respect to employees employed in discount stores are as set forth in the appropriate agreement.
D.	DRUG STORES (OR DEPARTMENTS) EXCLUSIONS. Exclusions from the bargaining unit with respect to employees employed in drug stores (or departments) are as set forth in the appropriate agreement.
E.	SHOE STORES (OR DEPARTMENTS) EXCLUSIONS. Exclusions from the bargaining unit with respect to employees employed in shoe stores (or departments) are as set forth in the appropriate agreement.
F.	CATEGORIES OF EMPLOYEES - FOOD MARKET. The parties hereto declare that in providing for the following allocation of work, involving the handling of categories of merchandise calling for the Food Clerk rate of pay and General Merchandise Clerk rate of pay in this Agreement, they have taken into account the allocation of such work as provided for in the most recently expired contract and, have encompassed as binding herein the various decisions of arbitrators on the subject, and written settlements reached between Union parties and Employer parties, during the term of the predecessor Agreement. In addition, the allocation reflects an agreement to reassign certain items, which have been in dispute in the liquor departments, to reassign nuts and peanuts, and also frozen bakery items.
A liquor department is a section of the store stocked with various alcoholic beverages and items associated with the consumption of alcoholic beverages, including non-alcoholic mixes and beverages, ice, packaged nuts, packaged peanuts, beef jerky, cups, napkins and plates, barware, cocktail party products and special holiday packs. It is not the intent that when the unrefrigerated soft drink table or aisle is located in the liquor department that the handling of the unrefrigerated soda pop on that table or aisle be performed at the general merchandise rate of pay.
The Union and Employer parties further declare that they have no intention to attempt to otherwise enlarge or diminish the merchandise assigned to each such classification rate of pay during the term of this Agreement.
Therefore, this Agreement shall recognize an industry-wide intent of the parties hereto with regard to this subject, recognizing, however, that some disputes will inevitably arise, and that no party intends to abandon legitimately held positions in such disagreements.

There shall be established by this Agreement four (4) categories of employees to be identified as follows:
1.	Food Clerk. Subject to the exclusions from the bargaining unit described above, a Food Clerk is an employee who handles all foodstuffs, excluding alcoholic beverages and products located in the liquor department including drink mixes and related items, bakery items, bulk foods, candy, nuts and peanuts in the liquor department and candy sections, tobacco, disposable diapers, special purpose party plates, special purpose party cups and special purpose party napkins, snack bar items, take-out food items, service delicatessen items, health products, nutritional supplements, beauty aids and household hardware, drug clerk functions, nursery and florist merchandise, insecticides, general merchandise, luncheon meats, hot dogs, lunchables in the wall deli and refunds for food products at the customer service booth. Store office employees whose work is directly connected to checkstand procedures or operations are also included in this category.
Employees presently classified as Food Clerk who may be affected by this modification will be given the opportunity to be reassigned to food work or voluntarily continue in their current assignment at the appropriate rate. No Food Clerk will be laid off or reduced as a result of luncheon meats, hot dogs, lunchables in the wall deli and refunds for food products at the customer service booth becoming General Merchandise Clerk work.
Items which have been determined to be Food Clerk work in accordance with either a joint settlement or arbitration award are set forth in Appendix B, which is attached hereto, and is expressly made a part of this Agreement.
2.	General Merchandise Clerk. Subject to the exclusions from the bargaining unit described above, a General Merchandise Clerk is one who handles any merchandise including, but not limited to all household paper goods, household cleaning and laundry products, alcoholic beverages and products located in the liquor department including drink mixes and related items, bakery items, bulk foods, candy, nuts and peanuts in the liquor department and candy sections, tobacco, disposable diapers, special purpose party plates, special purpose party cups and special purpose party napkins, service delicatessen items, health products, nutritional supplements, beauty aids and household hardware, drug clerk functions, nursery and florist merchandise, insecticides, luncheon meats, hot dogs, lunchables in the wall deli and refunds for food products at the customer service booth or performs any function other than that included in the definition of Food Clerk.

Traveling clerks of concessionaires who service health products, nutritional supplements, beauty aids and houseware items or similar lines of merchandise shall be classified as General Merchandise Clerks.
Items which have been determined to be General Merchandise Clerk work in accordance with either a joint settlement or arbitration award are set forth in Appendix C, which is attached hereto, and is expressly made a part of this Agreement.
A Meat Clerk may perform work within the GM classification and vice versa. All hours worked will be credited in both classifications.

Clerk's Helpers may perform cleanup work anywhere in the store, except that they shall not perform floor stripping, waxing, or the scrubbing of floors as distinguished from daily cleanup work, or the washing of windows which constitute exterior walls, which work shall be reserved for classifications other than that of Clerk's Helper. If a Clerk’s Helper is assigned to periodically clean shelves, he shall only be permitted to remove the product necessary to clean the shelf and replace only 6
those products in the same location on the shelf. Clerk's Helpers may keep the checkstands stocked with supplies, such supplies not to include merchandise offered for sale. Clerk's Helpers may handle merchandise after it has become the property of the customer and may also assist the checker or cashier in removing merchandise from the baskets or pushcarts and may return carry-backs to the shelves.

4.	Snack Bar and Take-Out Food Department Employees. Snack Bar and Take-Out Food Department employees are employees whose duties include solely the work set forth in Article 6, Section P-1 and 5.
5.	Past practice shall not be a guide in the interpretation or application of the provisions of this Section F.
6.	At the Employer's option, work in a lower category may be performed by employees in a higher category provided the Employer pays the employee at the higher rate.
It is further understood and agreed that nothing contained herein shall preclude an Employer from assigning work from a higher-rated classification of employment to a lower-rated classification at any time regardless of the Employer's practice provided that such an assignment is not violative of the express terms of this Agreement.
7.	Cash Registers. Where the Employer has placed cash registers in the various departments throughout the store it is understood that the employees of such departments may record sales of a limited number of items along with a purchase in that department. No WIC, alcohol or tobacco sales may be recorded on these registers except it is understood that alcohol and tobacco can be rung at registers established in the departments where such products are handled. In no case will these registers be used as express checkout lanes.
G.	DEFINITION OF DRUG DEPARTMENT.
1.	Definition. A drug department is defined as an operation which sells products, other than food products and related items that are customarily handled in a drug store and where a pharmacy is operated. In a free standing drug operation, all employees of such departments shall be covered by the terms of this Agreement, except as provided in the Retail Pharmacist Agreement covering drug stores or drug departments and the signatory Employer shall become a party to such Retail Pharmacist Agreement.
H.	DEFINITION OF A UNIFORM DEPARTMENT.

7
3.	The provisions of this Section and Appendix F are deemed to be separable to the extent that, if and when a court of last resort adjudges any provision of this clause in its application between the Union and the Employer to be in conflict with any law, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this provision, but such remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect, provided further, that in the event any provision or provisions are so declared to be in conflict with a law, both parties shall meet immediately for the purpose of renegotiation and agreement on provisions so invalidated.

Such deductions as referenced above, shall include political contributions and, by mutual agreement, weekly deductions for deposits or payments to a local credit union.

ARTICLE 3-DISCHARGE
A.	DISCHARGE FOR CAUSE.
1.	Employees may be discharged for good cause.
2.	Employees who are discharged for failure to perform work as required, or excessive absenteeism, shall first have had a prior warning, in writing, of related or similar offense, with a copy sent to the Union. The employee so notified shall be required to initial such notice, but such initialing shall in no way constitute agreement with the contents of such notice. Except for failure to call prices, a warning notice shall not be required in the case of a discharge for cash register irregularities, but such alleged irregularities must constitute good cause for the purpose of sustaining said discharge. When a condition arises necessitating a bunching of sales, it shall be mandatory that the checker or cashier involved call the person in charge to supervise the ringing of the accumulated cash.
3.	Any employee who is discharged shall be informed at the time of discharge of the immediate cause of discharge. Such information shall be confirmed in writing promptly upon request.
4.	The Employer shall provide the employee with a copy of all written warning notices when issued.
5.	If more than one year (excluding absences for injury, illness or leave) has elapsed since the receipt of a written warning, that written warning will not be the sole basis for the next step of progressive discipline.
B.	TERMINATION FOR INCOMPETENCY AND LAYOFF. It is understood that discharge for incompetency shall occur only at the end of the employee's current workweek. Discharges for reasons other than incompetency may occur at any time without reference to the work schedule. A layoff shall occur only at the end of an employee's posted schedule.
C.	NOTICE OF INTENTION TO QUIT. An employee who intends to quit his job shall, to the extent possible, give two (2) weeks' notice of his intention to quit. An employee who gives any notice of his intention to quit his job shall not be terminated, except for good cause or seniority layoff, or otherwise discriminated against during the current workweek and the workweek following the date on which he gives such notice, but in no event can he insist upon working later than his designated quit date.
D.	TERMINATION PAYMENT. An employee who quits or is terminated for any reason shall be paid promptly all monies due.
E.	TERMINATION PROCEDURE.
1.	Upon the termination of an employee for any reason, the Employer shall within seven (7) days thereafter notify the Union in writing of such termination, stating the reason therefor.
2.	A discharged grocery employee has seven (7) days from the date of discharge within which to file written protest with the Union. Following receipt of such written notice to the Union by the employee, the Union has fourteen (14) days in which to file a protest in writing to the Employer. If such protest by the Union is not filed with the Employer within the time limits specified herein, all rights possessed by said employee or by the Union to protest the discharge are waived.
3.	Where the Employer fails to give said seven (7) days' notice to the Union, the Union may request a hearing not later than thirty (30) days from the date of termination.
11
4.	Initiation of any claim by Meat Department employees shall be made within ten (10) calendar days of the discharge. Failure to initiate claims within the time limit set forth shall render any complaint null and void.
F.	PROBATIONARY PERIOD.
1.	The first forty-five (45) calendar days of employment shall be considered a trial period, during which time an employee may be terminated for any reason and he shall have no recourse to the grievance procedure set forth in this Agreement concerning such termination, provided, however, that such forty-five (45) day period may be extended for an additional fourteen (14) days at the option of the Employer so long as prior notification in writing is given to the Union and the employee.
2.	Insofar as part-time employees are concerned, the probationary period shall be 261 hours of work, but in no event to exceed sixty (60) calendar days. This provision shall also apply to General Merchandise Clerks, Wrappers/Meat Clerks and/or Clerk's Helpers promoted to an apprentice Food, General Merchandise, Meat Apprentice or Meat Clerk classification to the extent that such an employee shall be returned to his former status during this period without recourse to the grievance procedure.
ARTICLE 4 - SENIORITY, TRANSFER & LAYOFFS
A.	SENIORITY LISTS.
1.	Within the separate classifications as set forth in the wage section of this Agreement, there shall be created two (2) separate and distinct seniority lists identified as "available" and "self-restricted."
2.	The "available" seniority list within the separate classifications set forth hereinafter is defined as a list composed of those employees who have declared that they are available for a forty (40) hour week to be worked in any five (5) days.
3.	The "self-restricted" seniority list, within the separate classifications set forth herein, shall consist of all employees who have declared their unavailability to work forty (40) hours per week in any five (5) days.
4.	(a) Employees of the individual companies shall notify the Employer in writing, with a copy
to the Union, of their individual selection as described in Paragraphs 2 and 3 above. Such selection by the employee shall be a permanent selection, except that two (2) times per year thereafter during the last seven (7) days of the months of January and July, the Employer shall notify all employees, in writing, that the employee may elect to change the option of original or subsequent selection of seniority lists. The selection made by the employee shall become effective on the first (1st) Monday in February and August of each year.
(b)	The Employer will supply the Union with a list of "available and self-restricted" clerks by Company district. The list will be automatically submitted to each union in March and September of each year for each district which includes any store in that local union's jurisdiction. Each list shall include the employee’s name, social security number, store, hire date, seniority date, job classification and full-time and part-time status. To the extent a company does not currently have the program capacity to furnish all the information, they will work toward that goal.
(c)	In the event an employee fails to complete the form indicating his preference as to being on either the "available" or "self-restricted" list he shall have no seniority rights until he so declares and will be subject to disciplinary action, provided that he shall first have been given notice in writing, with a
12
copy sent to the Union, warning him of that fact, after which the Union shall have fourteen (14) days to respond before any such disciplinary action may be taken.
(d)	If a "self-restricted" employee is laid off, he cannot change his designation to "available" during the period of layoff, but must wait until recalled from the layoff and then can exercise his right during the next selection period.
5.	(a) Within the classifications described above, seniority shall date from the day of assignment
to that classification, regardless of hours worked. Such seniority within classifications shall be applied separately to the "self-restricted" and "available" seniority lists in the areas of layoff, transfers resulting from layoff, and additional hours, as specifically described below.
(b) When an employee is promoted, he starts a new seniority date for that classification. For layoff purposes, he can bump back to his former classification carrying with him his total seniority. Company seniority is retained for vacation purposes. Thus, the seniority date of each employee commences with the date of hire with the Company; however, when that employee moves to a new classification his seniority will date, for seniority purposes within that classification, as the first date of his appointment to such new classification.
6.	When an employee is assigned from one classification of work to another, the seniority acquired within the store and the Company shall be retained, and new seniority in the new classification shall commence as of the time of such assignment. Such assignment shall not be made for the purpose of displacing another employee. Should layoff or reduction in hours occur where the newly assigned employee is to be replaced or reduced in hours, such employee shall be permitted to reclaim the position formerly vacated, or whatever equivalent position entitled to by the combined seniority in the old and new classifications.
7.	Seniority can only be broken by the following:
(a)	Quit.
(b)	Discharge.
(c)	Layoff for a period of time equivalent to the employee's seniority but in no event to exceed twelve (12) months.
(d)	Failure to return in accordance with the terms of a leave of absence or when recalled after a layoff.
B.	LAYOFFS, TRANSFERS RESULTING FROM LAYOFF AND REINSTATEMENT.
1.	Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is recognized that business conditions may require reduction of hours and/or layoffs of employees. In such an event, the following shall apply to employees excluding Clerk's Helpers and Snack Bar/Take-Out Food employees:
(a)	In laying off an employee, other than during the probationary period, the Employer agrees to abide by the seniority rule as defined above in the following precedence: Seniority in the store, seniority in the Company district if the Company has established and notified the Union of such bona fide Company district. The Company will advise the Union of its Company districts and any realignments thereof. If the Company does not have districts, seniority shall be on a Company-wide basis.
In the event of the closure of all stores within an existing district, seniority for layoff purposes as provided in this Agreement may be applied to the remaining stores of the Company within 13
the geographical jurisdiction of the Union Local in which the affected employees are employed at the time of such closure. It is not the intention of this clause to continue to retain a single store in the district for the purpose of making this Paragraph not operative.
The Employer will give the Union advance notice of a permanent store closing.
(b)	The least senior full-time employee(s) being reduced in hours in the store, within classifications, may bump the least senior full-time employee working in the same classification within twenty-five (25) miles of his place of residence within the Company district in which he is employed. If such employee does not have sufficient seniority to displace the least senior full-time employee within the twenty-five (25) miles within such district, he may bump the least senior full-time employee in his classification within such Company district in which he is employed. Union jurisdictional lines shall no longer be applicable.
(c)	The affected full-time employee may elect not to bump the least senior full-time employee in his classification in the Company district in which he is employed and may take a reduction to part-time within his own store based on seniority and the hours available for which he is qualified and available to work.
(d)	The least senior full-time employee within the affected classification who is being displaced by the procedure in Paragraph (b) above, may bump the least senior full-time employee in his classification within the Company district in which he is employed. If the affected full-time employee is the least senior within the Company district, he shall be reduced to part-time within his own store or laid off based on seniority and qualifications.
(e)	The least senior part-time employee within an affected classification who is being laid off from work in his store, may displace the least senior part-time employee in the same classification within the Company district in the same manner as set forth in Paragraphs (b) and (d) above. If the affected part-time employee is the least senior within the Company district, he shall be laid off and shall have no bumping rights.
(f)	When an employee works within a district which includes both conventional stores and a majority of stores covered by a different collective bargaining agreement (combined district), and when no initial seniority bump is available in the combined district within twenty-five (25) miles of the employee’s home, the employee may bump into the geographically closest conventional store district.
(g)	The above is subject to qualified employees being available to perform the required work. It is recognized that the affected employees must possess the necessary ability and qualifications to perform the available work when they assert their seniority rights under these provisions.
2.	Insofar as layoffs are concerned for employees on the "self-restricted" list, the application of the seniority rule shall be confined to other "self-restricted" employees only.
3.	Insofar as layoffs are concerned for Clerk’s Helpers and Snack Bar/Take-Out Food employees, the application of the seniority rule shall be confined to the store in which they work. If such employees are laid off, they do not have any recall rights in any store other than the one from which they were laid off.
4.	Seniority in Layoffs. Except as specified herein, in terminating the employment of an employee, other than for good cause, the Employer agrees to abide by the seniority rule, which means the length of employment, and that the employment of the last employee employed by the Employer shall be the first to be terminated. Age, sex, or color shall not be grounds for the termination of an otherwise
14
qualified employee, as long as those factors do not nullify Section A of Article 3, nor any of the other provisions of this Article.
5.	Reinstatement.
(a)	The last employee(s) laid off, by reason of slackening of business, shall be given the first opportunity to reinstatement in the former position, if said employee presents himself for work within ninety-six (96) hours, excluding Saturday and Sunday, from the postmarked date of a certified or registered letter to the employee's last known address, and such letter shall state that failure of such employee to present himself within the ninety-six (96) hour period shall cancel his seniority. Failure of such employee to present himself within ninety-six (96) hours shall cancel his seniority.
(b)	A full-time employee, who has been reduced to part-time employment because of slackening of business or for medical reasons, must be offered the first (1st) full-time job that opens in the Company district in which he is currently employed, provided that his ability and skill equip him to fill that job. The parties expressly agree that the one-for-one remedy provided for under Paragraph 3-(d) of Section D of this Article shall not be applicable to any full-time job opening that is filled by an Employer pursuant to this provision and that the Employer shall not have any monetary liability of whatsoever nature under this provision until the second (2nd) weekly work schedule posted following its receipt of a written grievance alleging a specific violation of such provision.
(c)	Twenty-one (21) days after the store opens to the public, employees who are laid off or reduced from full-time to part-time or reduced in classification in the district shall be recalled by seniority and classification before any new employees who have been hired in the store during this period are retained.
C.	OPERATIONAL TRANSFER.
1.	It is recognized that to meet the necessities of the business or to advance the Employer's equal employment opportunity program, transfer of employees either within the geographical jurisdiction of a Union party to this Agreement or from the jurisdiction of one such Local Union to another such Local Union may be required. In such cases where such transfer is effected by the Employer, the transferred employee will carry to such employee's new assignment all seniority, as defined above, acquired in the employ of the Employer. This transfer rule shall have application to both the "available" and "self-restricted" seniority lists. Transfers referred to in this Section shall not require an employee to travel one way more than twenty-five (25) miles between the employee's residence and the new location. Reasonable tolerance of these limits shall be allowed for temporary transfers such as vacation relief and store openings.
2.	In cases involving operational transfers, the Employer must show either (a) business necessity or (b) the transfer's necessity to advance the Employer's equal employment opportunity program.
3.	A senior employee may refuse an operational transfer only if it is over twenty-five (25) miles from his place of residence; provided, however, that the employee is protected inasmuch as the operational transfer provisions shall not be applied in an arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory manner, or for disciplinary purposes, and shall not be utilized as a device for creating hardship to the employee in order to force or provoke resignation.
4.	If an employee, on either list, is transferred to another store for any reason, he carries his seniority with him, provided that no employee on the "available" seniority list is displaced or reduced in hours as a direct result of a transfer from the geographical jurisdiction of one Local Union party to this Agreement to the geographical jurisdiction of another Local Union party to this Agreement.
15
5.	The Employer shall have the right to transfer employees from one Company district to another Company district without regard to Local Union jurisdiction and without penalty. Such transferred employees shall retain all their seniority rights.
D.	ADDITIONAL HOURS.
1.	(a) Seniority in regard to claiming a schedule with more hours shall apply to Clerk's Helpers,
Snack Bar employees and Combination Take-Out Bar employees within their respective classifications and within the store in which they work, insofar as is practical and feasible. Such employees shall have no seniority over apprentices or experienced clerks, nor shall their seniority apply toward experienced clerk's status.
(b) An employee on the "available" list may exercise his seniority over other employees in accordance with the provisions of this Section regardless of whether such other employees are on either the "available" or "self-restricted" list. It is understood, however, that no part-timer can claim the hours from employees who are full-time employees scheduled for forty (40) or more hours. It is also understood that no employee may claim a shift or shifts.
2.	(a) An employee on the "available" list may, within classification, claim a schedule with more
hours, except as limited by Section D-3 of this Article, when one becomes available in the store in which said employee is employed, based on seniority rights. Except that, when such employee is employed by a Company not having a fixed retail place of business, seniority shall be Company-wide within the jurisdiction of the Local Union. When no employee on the "available" list claims a schedule with more hours as set forth above, an employee on the "self-restricted" list may claim such schedule for more hours when one becomes available in the store in which said employee is employed, based on seniority rights.
(b) An employee on the "self-restricted" list may exercise his seniority only over other "self-restricted" employees to claim an available schedule with more hours, but may not claim shifts as such and this claim for schedules can only be made after all the employees on the "available" list have exercised their seniority rights to claim such schedules.
3.	(a) Within classifications, when a permanent schedule calling for a forty (40) hour
workweek on any assignment or shift becomes available in a given store, such work schedule shall be offered on the basis of seniority and qualifications to an experienced clerk, working less than forty (40) hours, from the "available" seniority list in that store. If the offer is rejected for any reason, the employee, by such rejection, is automatically placed on the "self-restricted" seniority list and may not opt for the "available" seniority list until the second (2nd) selection period following the rejection. Employees can claim a schedule only in a store in which they work.
(b)	For the purposes of Article 1 (B)(11), Article 4 (D)(1 )(a), Article 4 (D)(3)(a), Article 6(B)(3, 4 and 6), Article 6 (D)(2 and 4) and Appendix E - G(1) only, Experienced Clerk shall mean a clerk entitled to the thereafter rate of pay for his classification; provided that, it is further understood that within classifications, if all experienced clerks as so defined, on the "available" seniority list, are working at least forty (40) hours per week, then the forty (40) hour work schedule shall be offered on the basis of seniority to an apprentice on the "available" seniority list who is qualified to do the work and who is working less than forty (40) hours per week.
(c)	Skills and ability are recognized for the Employer's assignment of Department Heads, third (3rd) person's, and P.I.C.'s (person-in-charge), who shall be designated on the schedule. Such employees are excused from the application of seniority. The P.I.C.'s must be in charge for sixty-four (64) hours or more per calendar month [eighty (80) in a five-week month].
16
(d)	In the event an employee attains sixteen (16) consecutive full-time weeks of employment in the store in which he is employed or is hired full-time, the one-for-one remedy shall apply, provided a more senior available employee in the store who has the skill and ability to perform the work involved successfully grieves. The Employer's obligation to promote the most senior "available" part-time clerk commences upon the Union's written notification to the Employer of the fact.
E.	SENIORITY GRIEVANCES. Grievances pertaining to the application of seniority shall be filed in writing with the Employer within forty-eight (48) hours of the posting of the schedule. Grievances not filed within this time limit shall be deemed null and void for the week that was scheduled or any prior week. Said time limitation shall not apply to grievances relating to the filling of permanent full-time vacancies, except as to claims on behalf of the employees employed in the store in which the vacancy occurs. In such cases where the said time limitation does not apply, when the Employer fills a permanent full-time vacancy, written notice to the Local Union shall be mailed within seven (7) days from that date advising of the name of the individual selected to fill such vacancy. The Local Union may file a protest or claim within seven (7) days of the receipt of such notice, provided that any such protests or claims filed after the expiration of such seven (7) day period shall be deemed null and void. Such claims shall not have retroactive application before the date that such claim is filed by the Local Union unless the Employer fails to give the seven (7) day notice described above and, in the event of such failure, retroactivity of any claim may begin as of the date of the challenged assignment to the permanent full-time vacancy. In the event that the notice of the filling of such permanent full-time vacancy is sent to the Local Union after the expiration of the seven (7) day period, the Local Union shall still have seven (7) days after the receipt of such tardy notice to file its protest or claim. As above, protests or claims not filed by the Local Union within such seven (7) day period shall be deemed null and void.
F.	SENIORITY AND QUALIFICATIONS. When seniority is invoked by an employee, qualifications for performing the work claimed shall be one of the determining factors in establishing such rights.
Should an issue arise regarding the application of seniority where employees are hired on the same day, the last four digits of the employee's social security number (on record with the Employer) shall be used as the impartial tie breaker with the highest number designating the senior employee.
G.	It is not the intent of this Article to allow selection by the employee of job assignments or specific hours of duty. The employee declaration of the "available" or "self-restricted" list does not allow selection of job assignment or specific hours. Neither shall part-time jobs be created for the purpose of destroying the eight-hour day or the forty-hour week principle.
H.	PROMOTION. In the event an employee is transferred, within the Company, out of the bargaining unit for any reason and is later transferred back, he shall be returned to employment as an experienced clerk in a department in which he formerly qualified without loss of seniority from his last date of hire.
I.	DEMOTION. No person shall be denied his seniority because of demotion.
J.	TRANSFER TO HIGHER CATEGORY.
1.	With respect to General Merchandise Clerks/Meat Clerks (including prior Bakery, Health and Beauty Aids and Household Hardware Clerks), when a permanent job is available for work to be performed in Food, any General Merchandise/Meat Clerk employees in the store shall be considered candidates. If a General Merchandise Clerk/Meat Clerk is selected for the Food position, such employee shall be paid the rate of pay according to said employee's experience.
All employees, including those hired prior to October 6, 2003, who are promoted to a higher rated classification of employment shall be subject to the wage progression schedule set forth in Appendix A and receive the next immediate higher rate of pay for that classification as set forth in Appendix A until 17
such time as the employee has accumulated sufficient total credited hours of experience equal to two (2X) times the hours required for that step of the new classification rate before proceeding to the next rate in the progression schedule.
2.	Where an employee is transferred from one category of work to another, the seniority acquired with the store and the Company shall be retained, and the new seniority in the new category shall commence as of the time of transfer. Transfers shall not be made for the purpose of displacing another employee. Should layoff or reduction in hours occur where the transferred employee is to be replaced or reduced in hours, he shall be permitted to reclaim the position he formerly vacated, or whatever equivalent position he is entitled to by his combined seniority in his old and new categories.
3.	Clerk's Helpers, as well as employees employed in classifications other than Food Clerks, who accumulate one (1) year of service with the Employer under this Agreement, shall upon making application to the Employer, be considered candidates in the store for promotion to apprentice clerks, in the case of Clerk's Helpers, or to Food Clerks, in the case of the General Merchandise Clerk, based upon his ability and qualifications and his employment record.
4.	Should such Clerk's Helpers and/or General Merchandise Clerks, as a result of the application of the above, be assigned a permanent forty (40) hour per week schedule, such assignment shall be excluded from the "one-for-one" formula referred to in the seniority letter dated July 22, 1981. However, no Clerk's Helper or General Merchandise candidate shall be assigned to a permanent forty (40) hour per week schedule pursuant to this Paragraph unless his seniority qualifies him for that position.
K.	CLARIFICATION. Nothing in this Article shall in any way hinder or prevent the application of Section A of Article 3.
L.	HIRING PROCEDURES. Nothing contained in this Article 4 shall impair any of the rights of the Employer to hire new or additional employees to meet the employment needs of the Employer, in accordance with the terms and provisions of this collective bargaining Agreement or to meet the obligations of the Employer under Article 2, Section H of this Agreement or to take affirmative steps to comply with any requirements under any applicable Federal or State law prohibiting discrimination in employment.
ARTICLE 5 - WORKING HOURS AND OVERTIME .
A.	FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE.
1.	A full-time employee is defined as one who is hired to work at least forty (40) straight-time hours per week [five (5) eight (8) hour days] or who works at least forty (40) straight-time hours a week [five (5) eight (8) hour days] in sixteen (16) consecutive weeks. With the exception of meat cutters, the accumulation of sixteen (16) consecutive weeks, as defined above, must be worked in a single store unless it is with the prior knowledge of the employee’s home store manager or district manager. For purposes of this Section, a Sunday or a holiday worked will be considered to be straight-time hours in cases in which the Sunday or holiday is one (1) of the five (5) eight (8) hour days worked by the employee during the workweek in question. Holidays not worked but paid for and vacations taken in full week increments shall not interrupt the sixteen (16) consecutive week requirement set forth in this Section. A specific individual's assignments to temporary vacancies caused by vacations, illness, injury, or leave of absence shall neither count toward nor interrupt the aforesaid accumulation of the sixteen (16) consecutive weeks. Such full-time employee is guaranteed a minimum of five (5) eight (8) hour days' work, when said employee works as scheduled or required. When a question arises as to whether or not an employee has worked the sixteen (16) consecutive week requirement set forth in this section, prior work periods shall be reviewed. Such review shall only consider weeks worked during the ten (10)
18
months preceding the grievance. At the request of an employee, he may work less than the contractual minimum hours in any week if mutually agreeable in writing between the employee and the Employer. In the event the exception exceeds four (4) consecutive weeks then the employee, employer and union must mutually agree in writing with the understanding the union will not unreasonably withhold approval. The Employer will immediately provide the Union with a copy of all employer/employee signed agreements which shall specify the period for which the minimum hours are waived. All of the foregoing agreements may be revoked in writing by the employee at least one week before the schedule is posted.
2.	Within thirty (30) days following August 15, 1990, the Employer shall determine the specific number of permanent full-time jobs in the "Food Clerk" and "General Merchandise Clerk" classifications of employment in each store covered by this Agreement as of July 30, 1990, and forward such information to the concerned Union having jurisdiction.
The total number of permanent full-time Food and General Merchandise Clerk jobs in a store as of July 30, 1990, shall be maintained over the term of the parties' 2011-2014 Agreement except in cases in which the Employer finds it necessary to reduce the total number of permanent full-time jobs in the Food Clerk classification or General Merchandise Clerk classification below the level that existed in a store as of July 30, 1990, in accordance with Article 4-B-1. This Paragraph shall apply to new stores after a period of six (6) months. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary, the number of permanent full-time General Merchandise Clerk jobs in a store as of July 30, 1990, may be decreased provided there is a corresponding increase in permanent full-time Food Clerk jobs.
In the event that any of the minimum guaranteed full-time jobs established in accordance with the above procedures is permanently vacated, it will be filled in accordance with the provisions of Article 4; provided, however, the one-for-one penalty shall not be applicable.
Any full-time positions established over and above these minimum standards shall not be included in the minimum number of guaranteed full-time jobs described immediately above but shall be governed by the remaining terms of the collective bargaining Agreement, including Article 4.
3.	Recovery of sales volume shall be the determinative factor in restoring bedrock numbers.
The formula for restoring full-time Food Clerk and General Merchandise Clerk jobs in those stores below bedrock shall be as follows:
Difference between average weekly sales volume for the period ending July 30, 1995 and average weekly sales volume for the period ending July 30, 1990 shall be the numerator. The denominator shall be the total of the reduced number of full-time jobs in both Food Clerk classification and the General Merchandise classification from July 30, 1995 to July 30, 1990. This sales volume number shall determine the sales volume which must be restored for each full-time job to be restored. The first full-time job to be restored will be in the Food Clerk classification and alternated thereafter.
For example, in a store where average weekly sales volume was $500,000 for the period ending July 30, 1990 and average weekly sales volume was $350,000 for the period ending July 30, 1995 and full-time jobs are three (3) below bedrock shall apply the following calculation: $500,000 -$350,000 = $150,000/3 = $50,000. For each $50,000 per week that sales are restored over the $350,000 level, one (1) full-time job shall be restored.
In the event average weekly sales for the period ending July 30, 1995 = or is greater than average weekly sales for the period ending July 30, 1990, bedrock shall be restored in full by February 1, 1996. If sales volume continues to decline and bedrock continues to be reduced then the formula shall be recalculated keeping the July 30, 1990 sales volume and bedrock figures constant.
19
For purposes of determining average weekly sales volume, the Employer will meet with the Union every six (6) months, January 1996 and each six (6) months thereafter. The sales volume utilized shall be the average of the prior six (6) months.
The Employer may argue that market conditions other than sales volume affect the restoration. For example, a significant change in the mix of general merchandise to food products in a store. In these cases, the burden of proof is on the Employer and any dispute which cannot be resolved shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.
4.	The Employer may at its discretion reallocate each store’s Bedrock numbers so that at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the full-time positions are assigned to the Food Clerk classification. Any partial positions will be rounded up to the Food Clerk position. In other words, if a store is required under Bedrock to have fifteen (15) total full-time positions, at least twelve (12) of the full-time positions would be Food Clerk positions.
5.	In good faith and on a one-time basis, each Employer may at its discretion reallocate the total number of full-time positions within the jurisdiction of each of the seven (7) Union locals and advise each Union local of the new allocation of such full-time positions. These reallocated Bedrock numbers will remain in place for the term of the new Agreement unless modified by the parties.
6.	The Employer agrees that no current full-time employee will be reduced to part-time status or involuntarily transferred as a result of the changes in #4 and #5 above.
B.	PART-TIME EMPLOYEE.
1.	A part-time employee is defined as one who is hired to work less than forty (40) hours per week, and is guaranteed at least four (4) hours work per day when said employee works as scheduled or required. Part-time students and/or Clerk's Helpers, Snack Bar employees and Combination Take-Out Bar employees as described in Article 6, Section P-1 and 5 shall be guaranteed at least two (2) hours’ work per day when said employee works as scheduled or required.
2.	Except for Meat Cutters, Grandfathered Wrappers, Clerk's Helpers and Snack Bar employees and Combination Take-Out Bar employees, each part-time employee shall be scheduled for at least twenty-four (24) hours’ work in each week. In the case of Clerk's Helpers, each part-time employee shall be scheduled for at least sixteen (16) hours' work in each week provided that the employee is available, willing and able to work as scheduled during such workweek.
3.	The aforementioned weekly guarantees shall not apply if one or more of the following conditions exist:
(a)	The store is normally open for business six (6) days or less in the workweek;
(b)	Employees scheduled to work are absent;
(c)	Work is not available as set forth in Section W of this Article;
(d)	The part-time employee, the Employer and the Union agree that the employee may work less than twenty-four (24) hours per week, except in the case of Clerk's Helpers, who may work less than sixteen (16) hours per week in any week without the Union's agreement in accordance with this Section B. At the request of an employee, he may work less than the contractual minimum hours in any week if mutually agreeable in writing between the employee and the Employer. In the event the exception exceeds four (4) consecutive weeks then the employee, employer and union must mutually agree in writing with the understanding the union will not unreasonably withhold approval. The Employer will
20
immediately provide the Union with a copy of all employer/employee signed agreements which shall specify the period for which the minimum hours are waived. All of the foregoing agreements may be revoked in writing by the employee at least one week before the schedule is posted;
(e)	An unanticipated, significant business fluctuation;
(f)	During the week an employee is hired, recalled from layoff or returns from leave of absence.
4.	For employees eligible for holiday pay, pay for holiday not worked shall count towards the weekly guarantee and towards the scheduled hours for the purpose of claiming schedules under Article 4(D).
5.	The Employer agrees that it will not flat schedule part-time employees in any store.
6.	Part-time Meat Cutter. A part-time employee is one who is employed for less than forty (40) hours per week on a regular basis. Part-time employees shall receive all the benefits as specified in this Agreement. The Employer shall have the right to hire part-time employees to meet the needs of the business, but part-time employees shall not be hired to replace or to avoid hiring full-time employees.
7.	Not more than two (2) times per year, an employee may be scheduled for a two (2)-hour minimum shift to attend a store meeting or training session.
C.	EXTRA MEAT CUTTER. An Extra Meat Cutter is an employee who is hired on a daily and/or temporary basis to fill vacancies caused by such events as vacations, illness, injury, leaves of absence, jury duty, funeral leave, other personal leaves, personal days off, store openings or seasonal fluctuations in store sales volume, and emergency situations. Such employees shall not acquire seniority, unless and until they are reclassified as a full-time employee or part-time employee as defined in this Article. All Extra Meat Cutter employees shall be engaged and paid for full eight (8) hour shift.
D.	MEAT DEPARTMENT EIGHT-HOUR GUARANTEE. Except as provided below, no Meat Department employee shall be hired for less than eight (8) hours per day. Employees shall not be reclassified or extra employees hired to defeat the purpose of the guaranteed workweek, but nothing herein shall restrict the Employer's right to effect reductions in the work force as specified in Article 4 of the Meat Appendix.
Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement to the contrary, any Wrappers hired by the Employer on or after November 4, 1985 may be scheduled for less than eight (8) hours per day but shall be guaranteed at least four (4) hours' work per day when such employees work as scheduled or required.
E.	WORKWEEK. The workweek shall be Monday through Sunday. For full-time employees, eight (8) hours shall constitute a day's work and forty (40) hours, consisting of any five (5) eight (8) hour days out of seven (7), shall constitute a regular week's work.
F.	OVERTIME. All work performed in excess of eight (8) hours in any one (1) day, or in excess of forty (40) hours in any one (1) workweek, shall be deemed overtime and paid for at the overtime rate of time and one-half (11Z ) the employee's regular rate of pay.
Within the Meat Department there shall be no regularly scheduled daily overtime in excess of one (1) hour without agreement with the Union. Scheduled overtime over one (1) hour shall be on a voluntary basis. Non-scheduled overtime shall not exceed three (3) hours in any one (1) day.
21
G.	SIXTH DAY/GROCERY. A full-time grocery employee may be scheduled to work six (6) days in any workweek. In that event, and in addition to the guarantee of five (5) eight (8) hour days, he shall be guaranteed a minimum four (4) hours' work for such sixth (6th) day, as long as such sixth (6th) day is not Sunday. The four (4) hour day need not be the actual sixth (6th) day of work, but may be, at the Employer's discretion, any one of the six (6) days in the weekly work schedule, other than Sunday. Time and one-half (154) shall be paid on such day if the employee is scheduled to work less than eight (8) hours, and contingent upon the employee's completion of his schedule, provided that all time over eight (8) hours in any one (1) day, or forty (40) hours in any one (1) week, shall be paid at the overtime rate.
H.	SIXTH OR SEVENTH DAY/GROCERY. No grocery employee shall be required to work seven (7) days in any workweek except in an emergency. It shall not be a violation of this contract, nor shall it constitute cause for discharge, if said employee declines to work on the sixth (6th) or seventh (7th) day of the workweek unless scheduled to work on such days.
I.	SIXTH OR SEVENTH DAY/MEAT. All work performed on the sixth (6th) day in the workweek by Meat Department employees shall be paid for at the rate of time and one-half (154 ) the regular rate of pay of the employee involved, or the applicable rate for Sundays and holidays as specified in this Article. No Meat Department employee shall be required to work seven (7) consecutive days in the workweek; however, in case of emergency work performed on the seventh (7th) day in the workweek, or work performed on the sixth (6th) day in a holiday workweek, exclusive of the holiday, triple pay or three (3) times the employee's regular rate shall be paid.
J.	REGULAR WORKDAY.
1.	The regular day's work for all employees shall be worked within nine (9) consecutive hours, and all employees shall receive one (1) hour off for lunch at approximately the middle of the working shift. No eight (8) hour employee shall be scheduled for more than five (5) hours or less than three (3) hours before a meal break. Where night stocking crews are required to work behind closed doors, a one-half (1/2) hour lunch period may be instituted. Notwithstanding the above, in a given store, deviations in lunch schedules may be made upon mutual agreement between an employee and the Employer with the approval of the Union.
2.	There shall be no split shift except as provided in Article 6, Section P. Where the operation does not permit more than one (1) employee in any single shift, a one-half (1/2) hour lunch period may be allowed in order to permit continuous coverage of the store and permit the employee to work a full eight (8) hour day. Relief for lunch periods shall be handled in the same manner as the relief for rest periods.
K.	READY FOR WORK. All employees shall report for and be ready for work at their scheduled starting time. The term "ready for work" shall include appropriate or required dress.
L.	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
1.	Employees shall be paid as time worked under the terms of this Agreement for time spent at appearances in legal proceedings at the request of the Employer.
2.	In addition, employees shall be paid as time worked under this contract for time spent at appearances in legal proceedings under subpoena issued at the request of any public authority and enforceable by a court when the event, or events, giving rise to the issuance of the subpoena occurred while the employee was on duty working for the Employer, and so long as the Employer is not a party defendant or respondent in such proceeding, and no relief of any kind is sought against the Employer nor the imposition of any penalty or punishment upon him.
22
3.	Employees who at the time of the legal appearance are no longer employed by the Employer, shall be paid by such Employer at the rate of straight-time for the time spent at the legal appearance, with a minimum guarantee of four (4) hours per day.
M.	WORK SCHEDULE.
1.	The Employer shall post a work schedule in ink for all employees, specifying start and finish of shifts and including surname and first initial, not later than 12:00 noon on Friday preceding the first day of the following workweek. If the work schedule within any day is changed after Friday without reasonable cause, the matter may be subject to the grievance procedure. An employee shall be guaranteed pay for the specific days in a workweek upon which he is scheduled to work, except as set forth in Article 3, Section B. It shall be the responsibility of each employee to check his work schedule. In the event a new schedule is not posted, the previous week's schedule shall apply.
2.	In formulating the work schedule of any employee, a minimum of ten (10) hours shall have elapsed between the two (2) consecutive work shifts provided however, that this provision shall not apply to an employee predesignated on the work schedule by the store manager to act in his absence, nor shall it apply in the event of emergencies. Work performed prior to the ten (10) hours' elapsed time shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half (172). In no event will an employee be scheduled or required to work with less than eight (8) hours between shifts, except in the case of an emergency.
N.	FALSIFICATION OF TIME RECORDS. The Employer and the employee shall be jointly required to maintain daily records of time worked on time cards or other forms furnished by the Employer and the employee shall be required to verify such report weekly. Such daily record shall be available for inspection at all times by the employee's supervisor, or upon request by the Union official entitled to such information.
1.	No Employer Knowledge. In the event of proven falsification of such time records by an employee, where it is established that the Employer or his representative had no knowledge of such falsification, the employee may be summarily dismissed, and he shall be entitled only to pay for the time reported.
2.	Collusion In the event of falsification of time records where it is established that both the employee and the Employer or his representative had knowledge of such falsification, the employee may be disciplined, and he shall be paid for all time worked by check mailed to the Union. In such cases, where an employee receives pay for work that was not recorded on the time report, a sum equal to that amount shall be paid by the Employer to the Health and Welfare Fund. All claims under this Section shall be limited to the ninety (90) day period immediately prior to the date the claim is presented to the Employer.
3.	Coercion. Where it is found that time worked without pay is the result of coercion on the part of the Employer or his representative, and provided that the employee has reported such coercion to the Union by the next following payroll period, payments to the Health and Welfare Fund shall be made as hereinabove set forth and the employee shall not be subject to discipline, and shall receive pay for all time due.
O.	CONSECUTIVE DAYS WORKED. Where a five (5) day, full-time employee is scheduled to work more than seven (7) consecutive days in any combination of workweeks, said employee shall receive time and one-half (1%) (or such higher premium as may apply) for all time worked after the seventh (7th) consecutive day, until such time as his consecutive days of work have been interrupted by a prescheduled day off. The above shall not apply to regularly scheduled six (6) day employees, provided that overtime and/or premium rates are paid where applicable.
23
P.	PREDESIGNATED DAY OFF GUARANTEE. Whenever any full-time employee, including full-time Clerk's Helpers, is called in for work on his predesignated day off, said employee shall be guaranteed a full day's work at the overtime rate of time and one-half (1%), or the premium rate, whichever is applicable. Hours worked on such predesignated days off shall not be counted for the purpose of computing weekly overtime. Such predesignated days off, worked or not worked, shall interrupt the continuity of consecutive days worked.
Q.	SUNDAY GUARANTEE.
1.	Except as provided below and exclusive of part-time Clerk's Helpers, when any employee is required to work on Sunday, he shall be guaranteed eight (8) hours work at the Sunday premium rate. All Clerk's Helpers who are required to perform work on Saturday or Sunday shall be guaranteed four (4) hours work on those days, as long as they are able and available to work those hours. Part-time Food Clerks may be scheduled for a four (4) hour minimum guaranteed shift on Sunday in a ratio of one (1) such shift to every one (1) eight (8) hour Food Clerk Sunday shift or fraction thereof.
2.	Employees classified as General Merchandise Clerks (including prior Bakery, Health and Beauty Aids and Household Hardware Clerks) shall be guaranteed four (4) hours of work at the Sunday premium rate of pay when required to perform work on Sunday.
3.	In those stores open for less than nine (9) hours on Sundays, full-time clerks who have been scheduled for five (5) eight (8) hour days will be permitted to work less than eight (8) hours on Sunday, but will be guaranteed the number of hours the store is open, less a lunch hour if the shift exceeds six (6) hours. Such clerks shall receive no less than five (5) hours' pay at the Sunday premium rate. If said employees perform work before the store opening and/or after the store closing, the eight (8) hour guarantee at the Sunday premium rate of pay shall apply and all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours shall be compensated at the Sunday premium rate of pay or overtime, whichever is higher. This exemption from the Sunday guarantee shall apply to full-time clerks only unless no full-time clerks are available.
4.	This clause shall be deemed to have been complied with if less than an eight (8) hour shift is worked on Sunday, but said hours are part of an eight (8) hour shift which includes hours on either Saturday or Monday.
5.	In the event the Employer is not able to obtain enough qualified voluntary employees in the needed classifications, qualified employees in the needed classifications shall be selected to work on Easter Sunday by order of inverse seniority. Sunday ratios of full-time to part-time employees, as provided for in this Agreement, shall not apply on Easter Sunday.
6.	All five (5) day Meat Department employees required to perform a shift including Sunday shall receive two (2) consecutive days off in the workweek. Five (5) day Meat Department employees not working on Sunday shall receive Sunday and one (1) other day off. All work performed on Sundays by full-time, part-time and/or extra Meat Department employees shall be paid in accordance with the wage schedule in Article 6(B)(2)(b) for each covered classification.
R.	WORKDAY DEFINED. For the purpose of this Agreement, a working day is the period from midnight to midnight. Where shifts overlap into two (2) working days, payment shall be made for the hours worked on each working day in accordance with the rates established for such days.
S.	ON CALL. If the Employer requires an employee to remain at home "on call" on a Sunday or holiday, the Employer shall guarantee the employee four (4) hours pay at the appropriate premium rate for such day. This Section shall not become operative prior to the Union giving the Employer a prior warning notice in writing of a specific violation.
24
T.	PART-TIME EMPLOYEES - SIXTH DAY. Exclusive of part-time Clerk's Helpers, Snack Bar employees and Combination Take-Out Bar employees as described in Article 6, Section P-1 and 5, part-time employees shall be paid time and one-half (114), or such premium rate as may apply, for all work performed on the sixth (6th) day of work as such, in any regular workweek, or on the fifth (5th) day of work in any week in which a holiday falls, excluding the holiday, as provided in this Agreement.

At such time as the clerk may be promoted to the Food Clerk classification of employment, he shall be compensated and progressed in accordance with the provisions of Article 4-J-1.

2.	In the temporary absence of a scheduled Food Clerk, a General Merchandise Clerk (including prior Bakery, Health and Beauty Aids and Household Hardware Clerks) may be assigned to work as a Food Clerk for the full shift, or the remainder thereof, at the applicable rate provided herein.

3.	Any portion of an hour that is worked in a higher category shall require payment for the full hour -- on the hour. (For example, a General Merchandise Clerk assigned to work as a Food Clerk at 10:15 A.M. shall be paid the applicable food rate starting at 10:00 A.M.)
4.	Food Clerks will not be intentionally or knowingly underscheduled to facilitate the use of this Article.

1.	Definition. A Department Head is an employee who, in addition to the duties of a regular clerk, is assigned by his superiors to the direction of a particular department and the employees therein in the store in which he is employed. To be classified as a Department Head, an employee must be vested with sufficient authority by his superiors to direct the operation of the department and to exercise supervision over the other employees in the department to the extent that he has effective influence over hiring and/or discharge and/or transfer and/or discipline of those employees. In addition to the above, the exercise of independent judgment in the operation of the department shall be a primary criterion in establishing Department Head status. Department Heads shall not be mandatory, but any employee having the authority and duties as described herein shall be paid as a Department Head. No more than one (1) Department Head shall be required for any one (1) department. The provisions of this Paragraph shall not nullify Paragraph 2 of this Section.

When an employee is assigned by his superiors to the work and/or duties of a Department Head, as defined in Paragraph 1 of this Section, provided that the assignment is for more than fifty percent (50%) of the employee's total week's work, the Department Head rate shall be paid for the entire week. It shall not be the intent of this Section to require or create two (2) Department Heads in any one (1) department.
3.	Intent.

J.	CLERK'S HELPERS WORKING AT APPRENTICE RATE.
1.	Clerk's Helpers may work a portion of their work period as apprentice clerks, provided they are paid as apprentice clerks for those hours in which they perform work falling into that category, and as long as said Clerk's Helpers shall receive credit for such hours worked toward the higher classification.
2.	The maximum number of hours in any one (1) week, in any one (1) store, that Clerk's Helpers may work in a higher classification shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of hours scheduled in the Clerk's Helper classification for that week. In the event of a violation, the most senior part-time employee in the classification(s) in which the majority of that work was performed, shall receive pay for the number of additional hours that were worked over the fifteen percent (15%) up to forty (40) hours. If any balance of hours remains then that balance shall be paid to the next senior part-time employee(s) in that classification until such balance is exhausted.
3.	Three (3) violations of this provision in any one store within any ninety (90) day period shall result in that store being prohibited from using Clerk's Helpers in a higher classification for a period of ninety (90) days. The ninety (90) day penalty period shall be extended by thirty (30) days if there is a further violation during the ninety (90) day penalty period.
4.	Grievances over this Section must be filed within fourteen (14) calendar days of the week in which the violation occurs. Claimed violations must be separately grieved to the Labor Relations department to be considered as one of the three violations.
5.	During the first nine (9) months following March 1, 2004, this program shall not be used in a store when clerks are reduced in classification, reduced from full-time status or laid off within said store.
K.	PAY DAY. Employees shall receive their pay each week. Upon request, extra Meat Department employees shall be paid in full when their work is completed. Failure to pay such extra Meat Department employees upon completion of work shall require the Employer to pay the employee eight (8) hours pay for each twenty-four (24) hour period until payment in full has been made. In the case of termination of employment of any employee, the final paycheck shall be given to the employee not later than seventy-two (72) hours after the completion of his last shift.
L.	NEW CONTRACT. When a first contract is signed the period of employment for vacation and sick leave eligibility shall be measured from the last date of hire with the Employer, except as provided in Article 17, Section D hereof.
M.	INJURY ON THE JOB. When an employee is injured on the job, there shall be no deduction from the employee's pay for the day in which the employee was injured and reported for medical care. When such employee returns to work following the injury, and is certified as ready and able to perform all regular duties, but requires medical treatment as a result of the same injury, the Employer shall adjust the work schedules without penalty to the Employer, to provide both the time for medical care and the number of hours of work for which the employee is regularly scheduled.
N.	BONUS PAYMENTS. Bonus or lump sum payments to employees, other than regular wage payments, shall not be used to defeat the wage provisions of this Agreement.
O.	TRAVELING CLERKS. The rate of pay for the servicing of health products, nutritional supplements, beauty aids and houseware items or similar lines of merchandise having been established at the General 30
Merchandise Clerk rate by this collective bargaining Agreement, that rate shall apply to all other concessionaires servicing the same or similar line or lines of merchandise with traveling clerks.

ARTICLE 7-HOLIDAYS
Sections A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H of this Article apply to employees hired prior to March 1, 2004.
A.	PAID HOLIDAYS.
1.	The Employer agrees that the following days shall be considered holidays and granted without reduction in pay:
New Year's Day Memorial Day Independence Day Labor Day
Thanksgiving Day
Christmas Day
Three (3) Personal Holidays
Personal Holidays. Effective January 1st of each year employees, who have one (1) or more years of service with the Employer as of that date, shall be eligible for three (3) personal holidays that shall be observed by the employee during the calendar year-in-question. Each employee shall give the Employer no less than two (2) weeks advance written notice of the date(s) on which he wishes to observe his personal holidays. Personal holidays may not be celebrated in the same week as any of the other contractual holidays except by mutual agreement between the employee and the Employer.
The weekly hours guarantees set forth in Article 5-A and 5-B and the benefit eligibility language of Article 15-A-4 shall continue to apply to any week during which an employee takes a personal holiday.
An employee, who does not have one (1) or more years of service with the Employer as of January 1st of any year, shall be eligible for personal holidays during the ensuing calendar year in accordance with the following procedures:
(a)	An employee, who completes thirty (30) calendar days of employment during the first (1st) four (4) months (January, February, March and April of a calendar year), shall be eligible for a personal holiday that shall be observed during the involved time period;
(b)	An employee, who completes thirty (30) calendar days of employment during the second (2nd) four (4) months (May, June, July and August of a calendar year), shall be eligible for a personal holiday that shall be observed during the involved time period;
(c)	An employee, who completes thirty (30) calendar days of employment during the third (3rd) four (4) months (September, October, November and December of a calendar year), shall be eligible for a personal holiday that shall be observed during the involved time period.
32
(d)	Employees with less than one (1) year of service will continue to earn personal holiday entitlement as above, until they reach the first January 1 that occurs after they have one (1) year of service.
As to the matter of scheduling personal holidays, the parties agree that there must be a mutual accommodation between the right of an employee to take these holidays when desired and the right of the Company to preserve an orderly operation through required staffing levels. Therefore, this matter will be left to the stores to work out with the reminder that the negotiating parties agreed to administer this provision in good faith and to make every reasonable effort to accommodate the employee.
The provisions of Sections D and E of this Article shall not be applicable in the computation of a part-time employee's holiday pay entitlement with each eligible part-time employee being entitled to four (4) hours of holiday pay for each of the personal holidays established herein.
An employee, who fails to receive a personal holiday(s) that he is contractually entitled to during a calendar year, shall be paid for such a personal holiday(s) immediately following the end of the calendar year-in-question. Hours of holiday pay that are paid in accordance with these provisions in lieu of a day off shall not be considered to be a day and/or hours worked for the purposes of computing weekly overtime under this Agreement.
Unused personal holiday entitlement will be liquidated for employees who are laid off or who break continuous service (except those discharged for proven or admitted dishonesty). This liquidated payoff will be prorated on the basis of one (1) holiday entitlement per each four (4) month calendar trimester. For example: employees who are laid off or break continuous service in the first calendar trimester (January, February, March, April) will receive one (1) holiday; in the second trimester (May, June, July, August) two (2) holidays; and in the third trimester (September, October, November December) three (3) holidays.
2.	All contractual holidays shall be observed on the holiday itself.
3.	Any employee hired within thirty (30) days of any holiday shall not be entitled to pay for time not worked on the holiday.
B.	HOLIDAY PREMIUM. Work can be performed on any of the hereinabove mentioned holidays with the exception of Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. However, work as such shall be compensated for at three (3) times the straight-time hourly rate of pay for all hours worked. Extra Meat Department employees working on a holiday shall be paid for their full eight (8) hour shift at the rate of triple (3) times the regular rate of pay for the employee involved. Said triple-time shall include any premium pay or overtime that may be applicable, and includes pay for the holiday itself. It is expressly understood that no employees coming under the terms of this Agreement will be required to work on Thanksgiving and Christmas calendar days; and that the Employer will remind its store management of these special provisions prior to the involved holidays.
C.	HOLIDAY WEEK. A regular holiday workweek shall consist of the holiday itself and four (4) other eight (8) hour days. A full-time employee, not working on a holiday, shall receive eight (8) hours pay for the holiday in addition to the pay specified in this Agreement for the other four (4) days referred to above. All time worked over the forty (40) hours, exclusive of the holiday, shall be paid for at the rate of time and one-half (V/2) the employee's regular rate of pay, except when Sunday is worked, and in that event, the higher rate shall apply.
D.	PART-TIME EMPLOYEES. Regular part-time employees shall be entitled to pay in accordance with this Article only if said holiday falls on their scheduled workday or if such employee is scheduled for forty (40) hours' work during the holiday week. Holiday pay for any such regular part-time employee shall
33
be computed by averaging the number of hours worked by the employee on the day of the week on which the holiday falls for the four-week period immediately prior to the holiday week. Work schedules shall not be changed for the purpose of avoiding holiday payments. The determining factor shall be the employee's prior work schedules. A part-time employee, as used in this Section, is defined to include an employee regularly scheduled for thirty-six (36) hours per week or less.
E.	REQUIREMENTS. No employee shall receive pay for any holidays not worked unless such employee has reported for work on his regular working day next preceding and next following said holiday. Employees shall be deemed to have reported for work if absence on said day before and the said day after said holiday is due to express permission from or action of the Employer, and also in case of certified illness, provided the employee has worked during the holiday week.
F.	VOLUNTARY CLOSING. When the Employer voluntarily closes his store to the public on any holiday other than those set forth in Section A above, it is agreed that the employees shall suffer no reduction in straight-time weekly earnings on account of such closing. Neither shall the employees suffer a reduction in straight-time weekly earnings in the event the Employer chooses to close his store in memory of or in tribute to any individual or event.
G.	HOLIDAY GUARANTEE.
1.	Full-time employees scheduled to work on a holiday shall be guaranteed eight (8) hours work on such holiday. A part-time grocery employee may be scheduled to work on a holiday for a number of hours not less than those usually worked by him on the day on which the holiday falls. For Meat Department employees the holiday guarantee for part-time employees shall be as defined in Article 5-B-1 of this Agreement. All Clerk's Helpers who are required to perform work on any of the holidays enumerated in Article 7 shall be guaranteed four (4) hours work on those days as long as they are able and available to work those hours.
2.	The eight (8) hour guarantee shall be deemed to have been complied with if less than an eight (8) hour shift is worked on the holiday, but said hours are part of an eight (8) hour shift which includes hours on either the day before or the day after the holiday. Hours worked during the twenty-four (24) hour period of the holiday shall be compensated at the triple-time rate of pay and each hour so compensated shall apply toward the eight (8) hour holiday guarantee.
3.	In those stores open for less than nine (9) hours on holidays, full-time clerks who have been scheduled for four (4) eight (8) hour days will be permitted to work less than eight (8) hours on the holiday, but will be guaranteed the number of hours the store is open, less a lunch hour if the shift exceeds six (6) hours. Such clerks shall receive no less than five (5) hours pay at the holiday premium rate. If said employees perform work before the store opening and/or after the store closing, the eight (8) hour guarantee at the holiday premium rate of pay shall apply and all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours shall be compensated at the holiday premium rate of pay. This exemption from the holiday guarantee shall apply to full-time clerks only, unless no full-time clerks are available.
H.	EASTER SUNDAY/GROCERY. In the event the Employer is not able to obtain enough qualified voluntary employees in the needed classifications, qualified employees in the needed classifications shall be selected to work on Easter Sunday by order of inverse seniority.

ARTICLE 12	- ADJUSTMENT AND ARBITRATION
A.	CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR DISAGREEMENT.

Such meeting may be accomplished by telephone at the option of either party.
3.	After a grievance is settled with the Union under Paragraph 2 above involving adjustment in compensation, the Union shall be notified in writing of the settlement, including the amount thereof.
C.	ARBITRATION.
1.	(a) Any matter not satisfactorily settled or resolved in Section B hereinabove shall be
submitted to arbitration for final determination upon written demand of either party.

Failure to comply with the time limits set forth in this Section and in Section B-2 above, shall render such grievance null and void.
Nothing contained herein shall prevent an individual Employer and an individual Local Union from mutually agreeing to submit a timely grievance involving a discharge or suspension only to a mediator/arbitrator that has been mutually selected by the parties for a final and binding decision. A 41
mediator/arbitrator, who has been selected to hear a discharge or suspension grievance, shall attempt to mediate a mutually agreeable resolution of the involved grievance. If the mediator/arbitrator is unable to achieve a mediated resolution of such grievance, he is expressly authorized to render a final and binding arbitral decision on the grievance-in-question and is hereby empowered and directed to do so.
A mediated resolution of a grievance and/or arbitrator's decision under this mediation/arbitration process shall be final and binding on all of the parties to such grievance, including the grievant(s), and shall be of no precedential or evidentiary value of whatsoever nature in any other grievance arising under the terms of this Agreement.

In the event that more than one (1) grievance is submitted to a mediator/arbitrator for resolution on any one (1) day, the fee of the mediator/arbitrator shall be prorated and charged equally between the involved grievances for which a decision is rendered. The mediator/arbitrator's fees shall be borne by the loser in a grievance in which he is required to render a final and binding arbitral decision. Should a dispute arise as to who, in fact, is the losing party in any arbitration held pursuant to these provisions and the mediator/arbitrator is called upon to make a determination as to who, in fact, is the losing party, his additional fees, if any, for making such a final determination shall be paid by the losing party. Further, the mediator/arbitrator may order a splitting of the fees in cases where he cannot make a decision as to whom, in fact, is the losing party.
(b)	Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement to the contrary, by mutual agreement between the Employer and the Union, any timely grievances involving discharges or suspensions only, may be submitted to an expedited arbitration process if any dispute involving a discharge or suspension is not resolved under Section B of this Article.
The parties may submit the issue to expedited arbitration within fourteen (14) calendar days. Except as set forth below, the arbitrator shall render his decision in writing to the parties within seven (7) days following the close of the hearing. However, either party may require a transcript of the proceedings and may require written briefs within a thirty (30) day period following the close of arbitration hearing. In the event that a transcript and/or briefs are required by either party, the arbitrator's decision shall be rendered in writing to the parties no later than fifteen (15) days following receipt by the arbitrator of both documents.
The parties will jointly select an arbitrator. In the event the parties cannot agree either party may request a regional panel of nine (9) arbitrators from the Federal, Mediation and Conciliation Service. The parties will split the cost of any panel which is jointly requested. The parties shall then choose the arbitrator by alternatively striking a name from the list until one (1) name remains as the arbitrator chosen by the parties and empowered to arbitrate the dispute. The parties shall draw lots to determine who should make the first deletion from the list.
(c)	Any of the time limits set forth in this Article 12 may be extended by mutual agreement.
2.	The arbitrator shall be empowered to hear and determine the matter in question and the determination shall be final and binding upon the parties, subject only to their rights under law. The arbitrator shall have the power to decide the date or dates upon which the arbitration is to be held if agreement cannot be reached by the parties.

Except as may be provided otherwise in this Agreement, wage claims shall be limited to a maximum of a six-month period.

ARTICLE 15 - TRUST FUNDS
A. BENEFIT FUND.
1.	The Employer and Unions agree to continue the existing United Food and Commercial Workers Unions and Food Employers Benefit Fund (the “Benefit Fund”). The Benefit Fund will continue to provide health and welfare benefits that are consistent with the terms and limitations of this Agreement.
2.	If any Employer ceases all or part of its operations covered by this Agreement, files a petition in bankruptcy or otherwise becomes subject to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, or sells all or part of its operations covered by this Agreement (and the buyer does not assume the obligations under this Article), then such Employer shall pay a lump sum to the Benefit Fund as of the date of the cessation of operations, the filing of the bankruptcy petition, or the closing date of sale. Said sum shall be owing without regard to whether any other Employer's successor collective bargaining agreement contains the maintenance of benefits contribution obligation set forth in Article 15 (A)(2) of the expired 1999-2003 Agreement. The lump sum payment shall be the amount determined in the second paragraph of Article 15 (A)(2) of the expired 1999-2003 Agreement, except that the total obligation of all Employers shall be deemed to be ninety million dollars ($90,000,000) and the total hours reported by both the Employer and by all Employers shall be measured from the beginning of this Agreement to the last day of the month preceding the month in which the cessation or sale occurs or the petition is filed. If an Employer ceases or sells less than all of its covered operations, only those hours attributable to operations ceased or sold shall be used. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Paragraph shall apply only where the cessation or sale involves three hundred (300) or more of the Employer's eligible employees, or more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Employer's eligible employees, whichever is greater. A series of transactions occurring over any consecutive twenty-four (24) month period shall be considered a single transaction for the purposes of this Paragraph.
3.	Resolution of Differences. Differences between the Employer and the Union as to the interpretation or application of the provisions of the Trust Agreement relating to employee benefits shall not be subject to the grievance or arbitration procedure established in any collective bargaining agreement. All such differences shall be resolved in the manner specified in the Trust Agreement.
4.	Benefits and Eligibility. The Trustees are authorized and directed to implement the following changes to the Benefit Fund:
(a)	Benefits for Employees Hired Prior to March 1,2004. All employees hired prior to March 1, 2004 ("Current Employees") shall continue to participate in Plan A, as modified herein. A Current Employee whose employment is terminated or who is laid-off and who is rehired by another Employer in the Industry following an absence of less than four months shall maintain his status as a Current Employee (subject to the applicable contribution/premium rates for Current Employees).
47
(1)	Effective April 1, 2012, and continuing thereafter, Current Employees will be required to pay premiums, deducted from their paychecks as a condition of participation in Plan A as follows: employee only - seven dollars ($7.00) per week, employee plus children - ten dollars and fifty cents ($10.50) per week, employee plus spouse with or without children - fifteen dollars ($15.00). Such premiums shall be deducted from the paychecks of Current Employees without further authorization.
(2)	The Trustees are authorized and directed to modify Plan A in accordance with Section 4 Paragraph (c) below.
(b)	Benefits for Employees Hired On or After March 1, 2004 (“New Hire”). The Trustees are authorized and directed to modify the New Hire Plan as described in Section 4 Paragraph (c) below.
(1)	New Hire employees shall be required to pay weekly premiums, deducted from their paychecks as a condition of participation in the plan as follows: employee only - seven dollars ($7.00) per week; employee plus children - ten dollars and fifty cents ($10.50) per week; and employee plus spouse and/or children - fifteen dollars ($15.00) per week. The employee premiums shall be collected in advance by the Employer and paid to the Benefit Fund coincident with the Employers' contribution obligation for hours worked in the month preceding the month in which the Benefit Fund provides coverage.
(c)	The bargaining parties agree to the contribution rates in Section 5 below accompanied by this joint direction from the bargaining parties to require the Board of Trustees to design a plan of benefits consistent with the "Future Plan Design Commitments and Triggers" outlined here. It is understood and agreed that the Union Trustees shall bear the primary responsibility for designing the benefit structure which will then be presented to the full Board of Trustees for consideration. Provided the newly proposed benefit structure does not violate any fiduciary responsibility or duty of the Trustees and complies with the directives contained in this Agreement, it shall be approved by the Board of Trustees.
Additionally, the Union agrees that absent Employer Trustee approval, the newly proposed benefit structure will not (1) improve the current eligibility timetable or structure, (2) improve or expand the existing retiree plan of benefits or (3) add any plan design options or benefit improvements beyond the following:
(1)	Continuation of coverage during disability for up to three (3) months upon graduation to the Gold Level; and
(2)	Increase all dental annual maximums by two hundred dollars ($200.00).
Future Plan Design Commitments and Triggers
The bargaining parties direct the Trustees to implement the following components/modifications to the Fund structure:
a.	Develop a Board of Trustees approved comprehensive, ongoing communication and outreach effort, sponsored through the Fund Office, Unions and Employers. The goal is to ensure member awareness of program changes and their role and responsibility for using their benefits effectively.
The key is to ensure ongoing and comprehensive communication from all stakeholders (Trust Fund, Unions and Employers).
The Stakeholders agree to assist with distribution of Trust Fund created communication and outreach which will occur through multiple channels some of which will be: enrollment packets, postcards, fliers regarding HRQ reminders, open enrollment reminders, HRA information or other trust fund health plan or wellness initiative information.
48
The Trustees will approve the production of a Health Plan and Wellness Orientation video that will be provided to new hires by the Trust office with the enrollment packet.
The Employers will post trust approved posters in appropriate locations and for appropriate times in all stores. The Employers also agree to show trust fund produced videos on their in-store video loops.
49
Although not intended to be all inclusive, other forms of outreach by the Fund Office will be e-mail/text, web (e.g. Fund websites and Union websites), and telephonic outreach. Member access to a web-based platform that includes relevant cost planning and comparison tools, and comprehensive customer service support (Benefits Ombudsman) is critical. Within sixty (60) days following ratification of this Agreement, the Trustees will agree on the initial, comprehensive communication/outreach effort. This will include timeline/effective date(s), methods of communication and specific parties to be involved in this initial effort.
Should a grievance under this section (a) be filed under the CBA and fail to be resolved, such grievance shall be arbitrated on an expedited basis. Any deadlock on the Trust Fund under this section (a) shall be submitted to expedited arbitration.
b.	On an initial and on-going basis for both active and retiree plan(s), examine each current benefit structure (i.e., PRO and HMO) and vendor (e.g., Anthem, Kaiser, UHC, HMC, etc) along with the current and projected associated expenses to ensure plan assets are being utilized in the most efficient manner possible. Where necessary, the Trustees shall make modifications to ensure the appropriate funding of the Plan.
c.	Implement on or about January 1, 2012, a reference based pricing (or formulary management) prescription drug program that will aim to reduce current prescription drug costs by at least twelve percent (12%). The Parties jointly agree that an approach similar to Destination RX/RxTE seems to be the most participant friendly way to encourage cost effective utilization of medications.
d.	No later than July 2012, implement a reference based pricing design for certain medical procedures. The first phase of this design will target knee surgeries and hip replacement surgeries. The focus of this initial phase will be on procedures that either require precertification or would be expected to generate member (or provider) inquiries regarding benefit coverage. No later than July 2013, implement a reference based pricing design for additional medical procedures (e.g., diagnostic lab and imaging, colonoscopies, etc). The Trustees agree to implement and expand this program unless it is clear that a robust, comprehensive, on-going communication/outreach process is not working to properly inform the members about this plan design (and its requirements prior to service being rendered). In addition, the Trustees will make available the Castlight or a similar web-site for participants to voluntarily shop and compare prices for medical services.
e.	Over the term of this agreement, phase in a HRA/HRQ process that re-assigns the Plan's funded HRA dollars to improve awareness of the individual's health status and/or engagement in healthy behaviors. By January 1,2013, 75% of all HRA dollars (or the modified value in plan design) must be earned by completing programs, activities and the like as determined by the Trustees. Examples of the types of additional programs and activities currently being considered, but which will evolve over time are: (1) attendance at Fund Health Fairs and New Benefit overview, (2) basic biometric screening, (3) PCP and member contact information, (4) Health and lifestyle improvement/education, (5) Eligible health coaching, (6) Smoking Cessation, (7) Eligible weight loss program, and (8) Preventive care activities such as colonoscopies, flu shots, mammograms, pap smear, PSA, etc.
f.	Not later than January 1,2012, redesign the current HMO benefit structures for both active and retiree Plan(s) to reduce overall projected expenses by $0.07 cents per hour.
Allow employees hired after March 2004 and eligible to participate in Platinum level coverage the option to elect an HMO Plan subject to the following criteria:
Platinum HMO Equivalency Rates. The Trustees shall be directed to adopt the following rule and such shall apply beginning with the first open enrollment period following ratification of this Agreement in which the new Platinum HMO plan is offered:
"The maximum premium rates that any current HMO (or any successor HMO) shall be allowed to charge for the first year of the new plan and for each year thereafter shall be determined as follows:
50
Platinum HMO Premium Rate - the Platinum HMO premium rate for participants in the Platinum level of benefits shall not exceed the projected per employee per month cost (the "Cost") for participants in the Platinum PPO level of coverage in the self-funded program of benefits. The Cost for the purpose of this provision shall be equal to the total of the following: PPO medical costs, PPO fees, UR fees and the jointly agreed cost directly attributable to the administration of PPO claims."
g.	Implement the other jointly agreed plan design changes that have been discussed and agreed to. Specifically:
•	Implement the Anthem Blue Cross JAA.
•	Establish a dependent audit procedure that will be performed every three years, or more frequently at the Trustees' direction, by an outside third party. Additionally, modify the annual enrollment procedures to provide for a more thorough annual check of dependent eligibility.
•	Allow employees to Opt-in to use HRA funds for Rx co-pays.
•	Allow employees who are reduced in classification to Clerk's Helpers in lieu of
layoff to keep the benefit level and family eligibility earned in the previous classification.
•	Modify the procedure used by the Fund to resolve errors when employee contributions are authorized by the employee but not timely deducted from the employee's check and forwarded to the Trust Fund. If the error is caused by the Employer or the Trust Fund, eligibility shall be triggered by timely submission of completed payroll deduction and election of coverage forms to the Fund Office.
•	Review and set up procedures so that employees do not lose eligibility if vacation hours are incorrectly reported/recognized when employees take vacation (details still to be discussed and worked out).
•	Allow covered immunizations or any other legally permitted medical benefits/procedures offered through the Trust to be obtained at in-store, network pharmacies.
h.	Effective on the same date as the HMO for Platinum participants referenced in paragraph (f) becomes effective, increase the eligibility for retiree health and welfare from 10 years of service to 15 years of service with the understanding that any participant who has satisfied the prior 10 years of service requirement on or before the effective date of this change shall be grandfathered at the 10 years of service requirement.
i.	Establish a targeted reserve of 3.4 months expenses (based on the last twelve months of historical expenses.)
(d)	Except for those changes described in, required by, or necessary to implement this Article 15 A and C, and subject to the right of the Trustees to amend, modify or eliminate any Plan benefit or feature at any time as provided herein, the existing Plan coverages and all resolutions and letters of understanding shall initially be a part of the new Plan design. This provision shall not be interpreted, applied or construed to: (a) create any express or implied obligation to maintain or preserve any benefit or Plan feature for any period of time; (b) create any vested entitlement to any benefit or feature under the Plan; or (c) limit or restrict, directly or indirectly, the right of the Trustees to make changes in those benefits or features when they deem it necessary or appropriate under the Plan and/or as a matter of fiduciary duty.
5.	Employer Contributions. The Employer agrees to contribute $4.42 effective with hours worked in March 2013 to the Benefit Fund for Plan A and the New Hire Plan.
51
52
6.	Plan B. The Trustees are directed to modify Plan B in a similar manner and with similar effect as in Plan A. In addition, the existing provisions governing the operation of Plan B shall continue as follows:
(a)	The benefits of Plan B shall be based on the joint recommendation of the consultants based on a contribution rate of seventy-five percent (75%) of the cost of Plan A. Neither the contribution rate nor the benefits of Plan B shall be affected by the actual experience of Plan B.
(b)	Any new Employer with more than three hundred (300) employees shall be reviewed by the consultants to ensure that their admission would not have a significant adverse actuarial impact. Employers with three hundred (300) or less employees, who otherwise meet the definition of eligible Employer, shall be admitted without any review.
(c)	If an Employer moves from Plan B to Plan A, the employees of that Employer who are still employed on the date the Employer moves to Plan A shall be treated under all Plans (the pension plan, vacation plan, supplementary plan, ancillary plan, health and welfare plan, but not the individual account plan) as if the Employer had always been under Plan A. The Trustees shall adopt reasonable rules based upon recommendations of the consultants to govern the situation of an employee who moves from Plan B to Plan A as the result of moving from one Employer to another.
B.	PENSION FUND.
1.	Contributions. The Employers agree to contribute to the Pension Fund for the term of this Agreement based on the following contribution amounts:
(a)	The Employer agrees to contribute to the Pension Fund for the term of this Agreement one dollar and twenty cents ($1.20) per straight-time hour worked for all Employees covered by this Agreement (including Employees covered by Appendix F), regardless of date of hire.
(b)	The contribution credited for a given Plan Year shall continue to be based on hours worked in the twelve (12) month period beginning November and ending October of the following year (which has been referred to as the “7 month shift”).
2.	Amended Trust Agreement and Pension Plan. The Agreement and Declaration of Trust providing for the Pension Trust Fund and the Pension Plan shall be amended, as may be required, to conform to the provisions of this Section B.
3.	Other Pension Plans. The Employer retains the exclusive right to alter, amend, cancel or terminate any presently existing company-sponsored pension plan or employee retirement plan that existed prior to the establishment of this Pension Fund.
4.	Laws and Regulations. The Trust and the benefits to be provided from the Pension Trust Fund and all acts pursuant to this Agreement and pursuant to such Trust Agreement and Pension Plan shall conform in all respects to the requirements of the Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service, California Franchise Tax Board and to any other applicable state or federal laws and regulations.
5.	Pension Protection Act. The Fund actuaries have: (a) certified under the Pension Protection Act (the “PPA”) that the Pension Fund was in critical status for each of the Plan Years beginning 4/1/2008 to 4/1/2013, and that they expect the Fund will again be in critical status for the Plan Year beginning 4/1/2014; (b) agreed that, to the extent permitted under the PPA and at the direction of the Board of Trustees, they will apply the requirements for relief granted to the Fund by the IRS under IRC § 412(e) to determine if the Fund will emerge from critical status under the Pension Fund’s Rehabilitation Plan; and (c) determined that the 2011 Schedule (as that term is defined in the previous collective bargaining
53
agreement) is no longer sufficient to permit the Fund to emerge from critical status during the required time frame, even if the Fund takes full advantage of the funding relief available under the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 (the “Pension Relief Act”). Therefore, the parties hereby agree as follows:
Because the 2011 Schedule and the Rehabilitation Plan adopted June 11, 2011 is no longer sufficient to permit the Fund to emerge from critical status by March 31,2024, the Trustees are authorized and directed to adopt a new 2014 Preferred Schedule which provides for increases in the employer contribution rates consistent with this Article (the “2014 Preferred Schedule”). The Trustees are further authorized to update the Rehabilitation Plan adopted June 11, 2011 as required by the PPA and to be consistent with the 2014 Preferred Schedule. Upon adoption of the 2014 Preferred Schedule, it is hereby deemed approved by the bargaining parties and automatically incorporated into this Agreement. The following provisions shall apply to the implementation and operation of the Preferred Schedule:
i.	The bargaining parties agree and understand that the Employer’s obligation to make pension contributions in addition to the base contribution rate specified in Article 15, Section B(1) (a) of this Agreement shall be limited to the following contribution rates provided herein:
Effective with hours worked in January 2012, payable in February 2012, and ending with hours worked through June 2012, a supplemental contribution of eight and 3/10 cents ($0,083) per contribution-eligible hour;
Immediately in the event the Fund is unsuccessful in prospectively terminating its 412(e) relief, but no later than hours worked in July 2012, payable in August 2012, the foregoing supplemental contribution shall automatically be reduced to seven and 7/10 cents ($0,077) per contribution-eligible hour;
Effective with hours worked in October 2012, payable in November 2012, an additional supplemental contribution of seven and 7/10 cents ($0,077) per contribution-eligible hour; and
Effective with hours worked in October 2013, payable in November 2013, an additional supplemental contribution of seven and 7/10 cents ($0,077) per contribution-eligible hour.
Effective with hours worked in October 2014, payable in November 2014, an additional supplemental contribution of seventeen and 6/10 cents ($0,176) per contribution-eligible hour.
Effective with hours worked in October 2015, payable in November 2015, an additional supplemental contribution of seventeen and 6/10 cents ($0,176) per contribution-eligible hour.
The supplemental contributions described above shall be subject to the following:
The supplemental contributions shall be adjusted proportionally for other Trustee-approved base contribution rates.
The supplemental contribution increases shall be subject to the following automatic reduction in the event the Pension Fund is successful in prospectively terminating its 412(e) relief: effective for hours worked in the month in which 412(e) relief is terminated, the supplemental contributions rates shall automatically be reduced by the maximum amount permitted that would still allow the Fund to exit the red zone 54
consistent with the 2014 Preferred Schedule. Such reduction shall first apply with respect to hours worked on and after the first day of the month in which the 412(e) relief is terminated.
These supplemental contribution increases, in the aggregate, shall not exceed a cumulative total of thirty-five and 2/10 cents ($0,352) per contribution-eligible hour during the term of this Agreement. Any and all future supplemental contribution increases commencing with hours worked in October 2016, shall be subject to bargaining in subsequent collective bargaining agreements.
These supplemental contributions shall be dedicated solely to improving the funding of the Pension Fund, and shall not be used to increase or improve benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the October 2014 and October 2015 supplemental contributions provided herein will be reduced or discontinued before restoring benefits as provided in subsection (v). Any such reduction of supplemental contributions shall be implemented by the Pension Fund’s Trustees, based on projections provided by the Fund’s actuaries, showing that such supplemental contributions are no longer needed to support the level of benefits provided for under the Pension Fund, or to enable the Fund to emerge from critical status in the required time frame.
ii.	The 2014 Preferred Schedule shall first be effective with hours worked on and after October 1, 2014, as to the supplemental Employer contributions required in this subsection. The supplemental Employer contributions shall only be increased as provided above for the years during the term of this Agreement. The parties’ expressly agree that future increases, in any, which may be required in the 2014 Preferred Schedule, commencing with hours worked in October 2016, shall be subject to bargaining in subsequent collective bargaining agreements. For any employer who negotiates a new or extended collective bargaining agreement with ratification date or execution date on or after March 2, 2014, that employer shall enter the 2014 Preferred Schedule and shall begin payment of contributions under this Schedule at the contribution rate then applicable for the year in which the Schedule first applies to that employer.
iii.	The Trustees are authorized and directed to adopt and take into account to the extent legally permitted the relief granted to the Fund under IRC Section 412(e) in determining when the Fund emerges from critical status. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Trustees are authorized and directed to seek the immediate termination of such relief on a prospective basis, but only in the event they determine it can be done legally, and without triggering the imposition of any excise taxes or other penalties or assessments. The savings associated with the elimination of the Fund’s 412(e) relief will be used to reduce the amount of each of the supplemental Employer contribution increases in the manner and the amount set forth in subsection (i); provided that in no event shall the employer supplemental contribution be reduced below zero.
iv.	In no event shall any further contribution increases be required from the Employer during the term of this Agreement as a result of any required annual updates or other changes to the 2014 Preferred Schedule or, if applicable, to any Default Schedule. Nor will there be any benefit reductions during the term of this Agreement.
v.	In the event the Trustees determine, based on projections provided by the actuaries of the Pension Fund that, during the term of this Agreement, a Schedule with lesser contribution rates and/or lesser benefit reductions would be sufficient to reasonably enable the Plan to emerge from critical status by the end of the Rehabilitation Period, or would otherwise be legally permissible
55
and still support the Pension Fund benefits, the Trustees shall amend the Schedule in a manner that, to the extent possible, would (a) restore or otherwise improve benefits impacted in 2011 and/or 2012 based on input from the Fund's actuaries and taking into account the limitations of PPA Section 432(f),and (b) reduce the Employer’s pre-October 2014 supplemental contributions, in an equal manner and amount, based on actuarial equivalence, provided that such modifications to the Schedule would still allow the Plan to emerge from critical status by the end of the Rehabilitation Period, taking into account to the extent legally permitted relief granted under IRC Section 412(e) (subject to section (iii) above), as well as any other legally available funding relief under the Pension Relief Act or otherwise. In the event the Trustees amend the Schedule as provided in subsection (i) or in this subsection (v), then the amended 2014 Preferred Schedule shall be deemed adopted by the bargaining parties, and the supplemental contribution rates and benefits will be adjusted as provided in the amended Schedule.
vi.	The Board of Trustees is authorized and directed to take all reasonable measures to cooperate and assist in achieving these objectives, provided that the adoption of such measures is otherwise consistent with their fiduciary obligations.
vii.	If, during the term of this Agreement, there are legislative, regulatory, judicial or other changes or interpretations of the PPA or other state or federal law which would impact the contribution increases set forth in the 2014 Preferred Schedule, the Trustees are authorized and directed to mitigate such contribution increases.
C.	RETIREE HEALTH AND WELFARE.
1.	The Employer and the Union agree that the benefits provided to retirees hereunder are not vested, and that the Employer's sole obligation with respect to such benefits is the contribution stated above. The Employer shall not be obligated to fund or otherwise pay for any benefit beyond the term of this Agreement, except as may be subsequently and expressly agreed to by the Employer. The Trustees are directed to clarify the Plan document and descriptive material accordingly.
2.	The Trustees shall be obligated to provide benefits under this Section only to the extent that assets are available.
3.	Amend the Plan to suspend benefits to retirees that are working within the industry for other than a contributing employer. Subject to acceptance by the Trustees, effective January 1, 2000, benefits will be suspended for retirees working more than forty (40) hours per month (fifty (50) hours in a five (5) week month) for an Employer. Implement an enforcement plan to cover all benefit plans that will require retirees to provide social security records, IRS records and other documentation deemed necessary by the Trustees to demonstrate retiree status.
4.	When disability retirements under the Pension Plan have a retroactive effective date, retiree health & welfare will be prospective only, except to the extent retroactive coverage is allowed under the rules in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this Agreement.
5.	The Trustees are authorized and directed to require retirees to pay initial monthly premiums as a condition of participation in the Retiree Plan as follows:
(a) Non-Medicare: Single - ninety dollars ($90.00)
Family - one hundred eighty dollars ($180.00)
56
(b) Medicare:
Single - forty dollars ($40.00)
Family - eighty dollars ($80.00)
(c) One on Medicare and one on non-Medicare will pay two single rates of one hundred thirty dollars ($130.00).
Effective April 1, 2012 and annually thereafter, the pre-65 retiree co-premium shall be equal to ($125.00) per person per month and the post -65 retiree co-premium shall be equal to fifty dollars ($50.00) per person per month. Thereafter, the retiree co-premium shall be adjusted by the same annual percentage increase of the Medicare Part B rates.
6.	New Hire employees shall not be eligible for Retiree Health and Welfare Benefits.
D.	ADMINISTRATION.
1.	The Trustees shall continue a central administration office for the administration of the Trust, including but not limited to bookkeeping, tabulating, collection of contributions, record keeping and payment of claims and shall acquire appropriate office equipment and hire necessary personnel.
2.	In addition to the central administration office, the Trustees are authorized and directed to continue the agreement and understanding entered into between the parties as outlined in the July 14, 1981 letter of agreement directing the Trustees to adopt a specific agreed-upon proposal concerning trust fund administration along with the supplemental agreement concerning trust administration dated February 10, 1982.
3.	The Companies agree to change the Employer of the employees in the satellite offices from the Trust Fund to the respective Union (with a reimbursement from the Trust Fund in a manner consistent with applicable law as determined by the Trust Fund Attorneys).
E.	PAYMENT OF CONTRIBUTIONS. Payment of contributions by the Employer required to be made to one or more of the Trusts established under this Article 15 shall be made on or before the twentieth (20th) day of each month based upon hours worked exclusive of overtime hours during the preceding calendar month by each employee covered by this collective bargaining Agreement.
Such payments shall be accompanied by a list of the names of the employees for whom such contribution is made, showing the number of hours worked, exclusive of overtime hours, by each such employee during the preceding calendar month. Time during vacation periods, sick leave, jury duty and holiday absences which is paid for as provided under this collective bargaining Agreement herein referred to and all work performed on Sundays and holidays, exclusive of daily or weekly overtime, shall be considered as time worked to which the provisions of this Article shall apply. The Trustees have the authority to adopt and maintain reasonable rules regarding the acceptance of contributions in connection with the resolution of grievances.
It is understood that the contributions required on behalf of any employee shall not exceed forty (40) straight-time hours per week or two thousand eighty (2,080) straight-time hours per year. Contributions shall not be made for payments made on the basis of industry experience as set forth in Article 8-D and unused sick leave paid in accordance with Article 10-E. The Employer, by payment of the amounts provided for in this Article, shall be relieved of any further liability and shall not be required to make any further contributions to the cost of benefits, either in connection with the administration of the plans or otherwise.
57
The parties recognize and acknowledge that regular and prompt filing of accurate Employer reports and the regular and prompt payment of correct Employer contributions to the Trusts is essential to the proper management of the Funds, and that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to fix the actual expense and damage to the Trusts which would result from the failure of an individual Employer to make accurate reports and to pay such accurate monthly contributions in full within the time specified above. Therefore, the amount of damage to the Trusts resulting from failure to file accurate reports or pay accurate contributions within the time specified shall be presumed to be the sum of fifteen dollars ($15.00) or ten percent (10%) of the amount of the contribution or contributions due, whichever is greater, for each inaccurate or delinquent report or contribution. These amounts shall become due and payable to the Trusts as liquidated damages and not as a penalty upon the day immediately following the date on which the report or the contribution or contributions become delinquent. Liquidated damages shall be paid for each delinquent or inaccurate report or contribution and shall be paid in addition to any contributions due. In the event the Trustees shall incur any cost for the collection of said delinquency, the delinquent Employer hereby agrees to pay said additional cost including reasonable attorney's fees. The imposition of the liquidated damages described above shall require affirmative action of the Trustees following examination of periodic delinquency reports from the Administrator.
F BUSINESS EXPENSES. It is understood that the provisions of this Article are being entered into upon the condition that the payments made by the Employer under this Article 15 shall be deductible under the Internal Revenue Code as it presently exists or as it may be amended subsequent to the date of this Agreement and under any similar applicable state revenue or tax laws.
G.	TRUSTEES.
1.	Local Union Nos. 135, 324, 770, 1167, 1428, and 1442 on the one hand, and Albertsons, Inc., Ralphs Grocery Company, Stater Bros. Markets and Vons, A Safeway Company on the other hand, shall each appoint one trustee to the Board of Trustees of the Benefit Fund, Joint Pension Trust Fund, Individual Account Trust Fund, and Ancillary Benefit Fund. In any vote upon any matter, voting power shall at all times be divided equally between the Union Trustees and the Employer Trustees of each of the Board of Trustees. The Employer Trustees shall collectively cast a single unit vote and the Union Trustees shall collectively cast a single unit vote.
2.	The Declarations of Trust shall provide for voting by proxy, and for alternate Trustees, and shall further provide that the tenure of Trustees, method of removal, and successor Trustees shall be designated by the parties empowered to appoint such Trustees. The Trustees shall amend the existing Agreements and Declaration of Trust as may be required to accomplish the purposes of this Article 15, and all parties to this collective bargaining Agreement agree to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof.
H.	PRESERVATION OF TRUST FUNDS. The Employer and the Union hereby agree that each and all of the existing Trust Funds provided for in this Agreement shall be continued for the life of this Agreement, with the exception of the Ancillary Fund, which is being merged. In order to preserve and maintain the existence of these Trust Funds, the parties hereto expressly agree that neither the Employer nor the Union shall enter into any agreement or understanding nor undertake to dissolve, sever, partition or divide any of these Trust Funds. It is also agreed and understood between the parties hereto that during the term of this Agreement each and all of these Trust Funds shall continue to be administered at a central neutral location.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Individual Account Plan is being terminated in accordance with the time frame and procedures set forth in this Agreement.
I.	ACCEPTANCE OF TRUSTS.
58
1.	The Employer and the Union hereby accept the terms of the existing Benefit Fund, and Joint Pension Trust Fund. By this acceptance the Employer agrees to and shall become a party to each of said Trusts with the same force and effect as though the Employer had executed the original Declarations.
2.	Any amendments that from time to time may be made thereto, including the creation of supplementary trusts to handle any of the funds referred to in this Agreement, shall be binding upon the Employer.
3.	The Employer and the Union hereby agree to amend the Trust Agreements of the various Funds referred to in Paragraph 1 above in order to comply with the terms of this Article 15.
4.	The Employer hereby accepts and designates the existing Employer Trustees and any additional or successor Trustees under these Trust Agreements as may be appointed under these Trust Agreements in accordance with the procedures set forth in such Trust Agreements.
ARTICLE 16-NEW LOCATIONS
When an Employer establishes a new location within the geographical jurisdiction of Locals 135, 324, 770, 1167, 1428, 1442, 8-GS and recruits part of the crew from one of his places of business already under Agreement with any of the above-named Unions, all rights as to seniority and as to other provisions of this Agreement shall apply to such employees.
ARTICLE 17-SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS
A.	PARTNERSHIP DISSOLUTION. In cases of dissolution of a partnership, the remaining partner shall be expressly obligated to carry out the terms of this Agreement, regardless of whether or not he was signatory to the original Agreement.
B.	NEW OWNER. In the event of bona fide sale or transfer of any store covered by this Agreement during the period hereof, the new owner or such transferee shall be notified of the existence of this Agreement. The former owner shall be required to meet any and all monetary benefits that employees have accumulated under this Agreement, but, except as provided in this Section, shall have no further or other obligations whatsoever, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this Agreement.
C.	ACCRUED VACATION. It is further agreed by the parties hereto that, upon sale or transfer of ownership of any store or upon dissolution of business, vacation pay for all months worked for which no vacation pay has been given shall be immediately paid to all employees coming under this Agreement, regardless of length of time said employee has been with the Employer.
D.	SALE OR TRANSFER.
1.	In the event of a sale or transfer of a store or stores, an employee shall be allowed a seven (7) day period from the date of announcement to the employees of the sale or transfer during which time he may determine whether he wishes to stay with the seller or whether he wishes to make application for employment with the new owner or transferee. In the event the employee chooses to remain with the seller, such choice shall not be construed as any guarantee of employment over and beyond the terms of this Agreement.
2.	In the event of a sale or transfer of a store or stores, the new owner or transferee shall make every effort to fill his employment needs in such store or stores from those employees of the seller or transferor who were employed in the stores sold or transferred.
59
3.	Such new owner or transferee, however, shall not be required to retain in his employ any of the employees of the seller or transferor. Any employee of the seller or transferor, who is employed within the thirty (30) day period referred to immediately below by the new owner or transferee, shall be employed on a probationary basis for a period of thirty (30) days from the date the new owner or transferee assumes responsibility for the management and operation of the store or stores, subject to termination within such thirty (30) days with or without cause and without reference to seniority. Any termination within such thirty (30) day period shall not be reviewable through the grievance or arbitration procedures except for a violation of Section D-2 of this Article 17.
4.	Any employee of the seller or transferor who is employed by the new owner or transferee within such thirty (30) day period and who is retained on the payroll of the new owner or transferee for a period in excess of such thirty (30) day period, shall be credited with and retain all seniority acquired while in the employ of the seller or transferor since his most recent date of hire by such seller or transferor, for the purpose of determining benefits to which he is entitled under this collective bargaining Agreement with the new owner or transferee by virtue of such seniority, as if his employment were continuous, including retention of anniversary date of employment and vacation and sick leave benefits, provided that the employees of the seller or transferor shall for the purposes of termination be credited with no more seniority than that of the most senior employee employed by the new owner or transferee covered by an agreement with a United Food & Commercial Workers Union Local on the date of assumption of responsibility, and provided further that the new owner or transferee shall not be liable for any benefits or payments owed to the employee because of employment with the seller or transferor. "Seller or transferor" is defined to include prior owners of the same store since January 1, 1956.
5.	Notwithstanding Section D-4 above, with respect to (and only with respect to) any sale or transfer occurring on or before July 29, 1990, vacation benefits accruing by reason of seniority with the seller or transferor shall be the responsibility of the Benefit Fund under the Industry Vacation Plan of benefits; provided, however, that the Benefit Fund shall not be responsible for any such vacation benefits accruing on or after July 29, 1991, regardless of when the sale or transfer occurred. Such sale or transfer industry vacation benefits due on and after July 29, 1991, shall be the responsibility of the buyer or transferee regardless of when the sale or transfer of a store or stores occurred. The amount of benefits shall be determined by the buyer or transferee by using the same formulas and procedures used by the Benefit Fund as of June 1990 for sale or transfer industry vacation benefits.
In any sale or transfer of a store or stores occurring on and after July 30, 1990, sale or transfer industry vacation benefits resulting from such a sale or transfer shall be the responsibility of the buyer or transferee. The Benefit Fund shall have no liability for any such benefits.
ARTICLE 18-OPERATIONAL CHANGES
The parties recognize and agree that it is in the mutual best interests of the parties to this Agreement and the bargaining unit employees covered thereunder that the Employer be able to effectively compete in the highly competitive Southern California Area Marketplace in that both its continued successful operations and employment of bargaining unit employees is directly dependent upon its being able to do so. The parties also recognize the Employer's need to continually seek new or improved methods of operations, systems and equipment that will enable it to achieve the necessary efficiencies and increased productivity that will enable it to continue to effectively compete in the Marketplace and agree that nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Employer from instituting any such new methods, systems or equipment.
The parties agree that in cases in which the Employer intends to institute any operational change, new method of operation, system or equipment that will have a material impact on the employment of its then employed bargaining unit employees covered by this Agreement, the Employer shall give the affected Union or Unions at least sixty (60) days advance written notice, by certified or registered mail, of its 60
intention to implement the involved operational change, new method, system or equipment, whichever the case may be, with such notice to set forth the nature of the intended change(s) and/or new method(s) of operations.
The Union upon its receipt of the advance written notice provided for in the preceding Paragraph may request, in writing, negotiations with respect to the following subjects and such negotiations shall be promptly held by the parties: rates of pay for any new job(s) which may be created; efforts to avoid displacement of bargaining unit employees whose job may be modified as a direct result of the Employer's institution of such operational change(s), new method(s), system(s) or equipment. The Employer agrees that it will retrain those employees displaced as a direct result of technological change of the nature contemplated herein.
In the event that the parties do not reach agreement within the sixty (60) days period provided herein, all unresolved issues as set forth above shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration. It is not the intent of the parties that such negotiations or arbitration will in any way jeopardize the efficiencies and increased productivity to be gained by the installation of such operational change(s), new method(s), system(s) or equipment. The arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of this Agreement.
The parties further agree that the arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding, and that there will be no strikes, work stoppages, lockout, or economic action of any sort or form employed by either party in connection with or arising out of any dispute concerning or related in any way to the operation of this Article.
It is agreed and expected that the parties will exert every effort to accomplish the foregoing within the sixty (60) day allotted time period, but failing to do so shall not prohibit or in any way impede the Employer from installing or effectuating any such operational change(s), new method(s), system(s) or equipment upon the expiration of such time period, unless such period is extended by mutual written agreement of the parties. The decision of the arbitrator or the parties shall be effective on or retroactive to the date such operational change(s), new method(s), system(s) or equipment is installed. The cost of the impartial arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties. In the event of any conflict between any of the provisions of this Article and the provisions of Article 12 of this Agreement, the provision(s) of this Article shall be deemed to be controlling.
ARTICLE 19-SEPARABILITY CLAUSE
The provisions of this Agreement are deemed to be separable to the extent that, if and when a court of last resort adjudges any provisions of this Agreement in its application between the Union and the undersigned Employer to be in conflict with any law, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, but such remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect, provided further, that in the event any provision or provisions are so declared to be in conflict with a law, both parties shall meet immediately for the purpose of renegotiation and agreement on provision or provisions so invalidated.
61
ARTICLE 20-EXPIRATION AND RENEWAL
This Agreement shall be in effect from March 3, 2014 to and including March 6, 2016, and shall continue from year to year thereafter unless either party shall give written notice to the other at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration date of March 6, 2016, or at least sixty (60) days prior to any subsequent March 6 of any succeeding year of its desire to alter, amend or terminate this Agreement.

All of the terms and conditions of the Retail Food, Meat, Bakery, Candy and General Merchandise Agreement shall apply to Meat Department employees except as specifically set forth below.
ARTICLE 1-RECOGNITION OF THE UNION
1)	REPLACE WITH THE FOLLOWING:
A.	BARGAINING UNIT. In order to assure the securing of benefits intended to be derived by the Employer and the employees under these Articles of Agreement, the Employer agrees that this Agreement will apply to all employees performing work under the jurisdiction of Local in all meat
markets or departments that are now, or may be in the future, operated by said Employer in the jurisdictional area of Local.
B.	WORK PERFORMED.
1.	None other than employees covered by this Agreement shall be permitted to serve the trade in the cutting and sales of meat in Meat Departments or meat markets, except during the lunch period in markets where only one (1) journeyman is on duty, said lunch period not to exceed one (1) hour in length. This clause shall not apply to the owners of the meat markets. No one shall be considered a partner or working owner unless he has a substantial proprietary interest in the market.
2.	The Union shall have jurisdiction over all meats that are not cut or prepared for immediate human consumption, including package items of fresh, frozen and smoked meats, fresh or frozen fish, poultry and rabbits.
3.	Except as set forth below, it is agreed that all fresh unfrozen meat shall be cut, prepared, fabricated and wrapped on the premises. With regard to beef, veal, lamb, and/or pork in carcass form, it is agreed that an exception will be made and the same may be broken down into primal cuts such as rounds, ribs, chucks, plates and loins and subprimal cuts off the premises, but said primal cuts and subprimal cuts shall be reduced to retail cuts on the premises. It is further agreed that:
(a)	Lamb, offal, beef rib bones, short ribs, neck bones, shanks, and stew beef need not be cut on the premises.

68

D.	FAILURE TO REACH AGREEMENT ON NEW METHODS. If agreement is not reached in such negotiations on the subjects set forth in the preceding Section within the first thirty (30) day period of the one hundred and twenty (120) day period described above, the parties shall submit all those unresolved issues to a fact-finding panel during a second thirty (30) day period. The fact-finding panel shall consist as hereafter provided: Each party shall, within five (5) days, designate one person to serve as its representative and those two people shall select a third, who will act as chairman. Failing to agree upon a third, the two members shall, within five (5) days, notify the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, who will, within five (5) days from such notification, furnish a panel of fifteen (15) names from which the chairman will be selected by alternately striking until but one name remains.

Upon receipt of the confidential report of the fact finders, the parties shall resume negotiations for a period not to exceed a third thirty (30) days.
In the event the parties do not reach agreement within such third thirty (30) day period, then all unresolved issues in regard to job classifications, wages, working conditions and/or the disposition of displaced employees shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration.
The Arbitrator shall, within ten (10) days, be selected in accordance with the same procedure as is provided above for the selection of the chairman of the fact-finding panel.
The parties further agree that the arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding, and that there will be no strikes, work stoppages, lockout, or economic action of any sort or form employed by either party in connection with or arising out of any dispute concerning or related in any way to the operation of this Section.
It is agreed and expected that the parties will exert every effort to accomplish the foregoing within the one hundred and twenty (120) day allotted period, but failing to do so, shall not prohibit or in any way impede the Employer from installing or effectuating any such new methods, systems, or equipment upon the expiration of the allotted one hundred and twenty (120) day time period, unless such period is extended by mutual written agreement. The decision of the arbitrator shall be effective on or retroactive to the date such new method is installed.

Production work for the purposes of this Paragraph is defined as the work commencing with the initial reduction of the primal and/or subprimal beef, pork or veal (whether by use of the saw, knife or other tool(s) of the trade) through and including the trimming, boning and leaning out of such product as may be necessary to reduce the beef, pork or veal product to a retail cut. Production work does not include the functions of scrap-ing/boating, dusting, traying, etc. A Meat Cutter may also perform any work in the Meat Department and shall perform such work as assigned.
2.	Apprentice Meat Cutters.
(a)	Ratio. One (1) apprentice shall be allowed to the first three (3) Journeymen or a fraction thereof, and one (1) additional Apprentice allowed for every three (3) additional Journeymen or fraction thereof.
(b)	Length of Apprenticeship. Apprentice Meat Cutters shall be employed only in accordance with the Shelley-Maloney Act and be paid the rates provided for Apprentices herein. The Apprentice program shall consist of a two (2) year training period.
Apprentices may work without supervision fifty percent (50%) of their work schedule during the first half of the program and may work alone during the second half of the program.

4.	Response to Customer Requests. Notwithstanding anything hereinabove, any employee covered by this Agreement shall be permitted to perform any functions on any product in satisfying a customer's request.
ARTICLE 4 - SENIORITY, TRANSFER & LAYOFFS
2)	REPLACE WITH THE FOLLOWING:
A.	SENIORITY.
1.	Seniority shall be recognized on a Company-wide basis within the jurisdictional area of the Union covering all employees from the date of employment and shall prevail in reference to vacations, transfers, layoffs, rehiring and promotions as set forth below.
70
2.	Seniority shall be used covering these issues and shall apply in each instance separately as to the Meat Wrapper classification (includes Meat Clerks) and the Meat Cutter classification (Journeyman Meat Cutters and Apprentice Meat Cutters).
Wrappers/Meat Clerks desirous of promotion to Apprentice Meat Cutter status shall make their desires known to the Employer, in writing, and such employee shall be given first consideration for such vacancies. Selection to fill the vacancies shall be made on the basis of Company seniority within the geographical jurisdiction of the Local Union, ability and qualifications being relatively equal.
A Wrapper/Meat Clerk commencing the Apprenticeship Program shall have a thirty (30) day trial period. Said trial period shall not jeopardize the employee's former classification or seniority.
There shall be no reduction in pay to any Wrapper/Meat Clerk as a result of entering the Apprenticeship Program, i.e., the Wrapper/Meat Clerk rate of pay shall apply until such time as the Apprentice rate exceeds the Wrapper/Meat Clerk rate, at which time the Apprentice rate shall apply.
On and after the effective date of this agreement, when an employee is promoted or reclassified, he starts a new seniority date for that classification. For layoff purposes, he can bump back to his former classification carrying with him his total seniority. Company seniority is retained for vacation purposes. Thus, the seniority date of each employee commences with the date of hire with the Company; however, when that employee moves to a new classification his seniority will date, for seniority purposes within that classification, as the first date of his appointment to such new classification.
On and after the effective date of this agreement, when an employee is assigned from one classification of work to another, the seniority acquired within the current classification shall be retained, and new seniority in the new classification shall commence as of the time of such assignment. Such assignment shall not be made for the purpose of displacing another employee. Should layoff or reduction in hours occur where the newly assigned employee is to be replaced or reduced in hours, such employee shall be permitted to reclaim the position formerly vacated, or whatever equivalent position entitled to by the combined seniority in the old and new classification.
3.	Seniority shall be recognized and employees covered by this Agreement promoted, provided they meet qualifications fitting them for such promotion. The Employer hereby agrees that when promotions are in order or a higher-rated job becomes open, those already employed by said Employer shall be given preference and a trial period of thirty (30) working days shall be given without jeopardizing the employee's former rating.
4.	In order not to impair the normal operation of any Employer's business, it shall be permissible on vacations only, to apply seniority preference on a store-by-store basis.
B.	PART-TIME SENIORITY. Part-time employees shall have no seniority overfull-time employees.
C.	LOSS OF SENIORITY. Break in continuity of service and cancellation of seniority will result from any of the following:
1.	Quit.
2.	Discharge.
3.	Layoff for a period of time equivalent to the employee's seniority but in no event to exceed twelve (12) months.
71
4.	Failure to return in accordance with the terms of a leave of absence or when recalled after layoff.
D.	LAYOFF. In the event reduction of the work force is necessary in a particular store, the employee with the least seniority in that store, limited to the classifications as described in Section A-2 above, shall have the right to displace: (1) the least senior employee in the same classification currently employed by the Company within twenty five (25) miles of his home; or (2) the least senior employee in the Company within the jurisdiction of the Local Union, within the same classification. Any employee displaced as the result of No. (1) above, shall have the right to displace the least senior employee in the Company within the same classification. Should any employee who is involved in the application of seniority set forth in this Section refuse such transfer or should such employee lack the ability and qualifications to fill the job created by the seniority system set forth in this Section the Employer's obligation shall cease, except as specified in Section E below, and the layoff shall be effected in the store where the reduction in work force is necessary. No regular employee shall be laid off until the end of his 40-hour weekly shift.
Nothing set forth in the preceding Paragraph shall prevent the Employer and the Union from developing a mutually satisfactory and agreeable system pertaining to the same subject.
Before a full-time meat cutter is subject to a layoff or an hours reduction, the meat cutter will be offered sufficient hours to retain full-time status by first reducing hours of any extra meat cutter(s) or any part-time meat cutter(s) within twenty-five (25) miles from his home within the Company’s district in which he is employed.
Second, by reducing hours of any extra meat cutter(s) or any part-time meat cutter(s) within the entire district, and third by reducing the hours of any extra meat cutter(s) or any part-time meat cutter(s) within the Union’s jurisdiction. If there are no extra meat cutters or part-time meat cutters within the jurisdiction, working the hours necessary to retain full-time status, then the affected full-time meat cutter shall have the right to displace the least senior full-time meat cutter within the Union’s jurisdiction. This displaced least senior full-time meat cutter shall have the same hours retaining rights as set forth above.
E.	RECALL. The Employer agrees that full-time or part-time employees laid off and not terminated for cause shall be eligible for recall prior to the hiring of any new employees for a period of time equivalent to the employee's seniority but in no event to exceed twelve (12) months from the date of layoff. Employees recalled pursuant to this provision shall be credited with seniority, and other benefits accumulated up to the time of layoff. Employees shall have the right to refuse recall without loss of seniority if the position available would require them to travel one way more than twenty-five (25) miles.
F.	SPECIAL JOB SECURITY PROVISION.
1.	Wrappers active on the payroll of their current Employer as of November 3, 1985, and who remain continuously employed with their current Employer, shall be guaranteed a minimum of eight (8) hours work per day when such employees work as scheduled or required.
Wrappers active on the payroll of their current Employer as of November 3, 1985, may claim, with no reduction in their grandfather rate of pay, for a workday when they are not otherwise scheduled, on a seniority basis, the hours of a Meat Clerk hired after November 3, 1985, subject to the following conditions:

(d)	By claiming hours in the store, an employee may not claim hours which result in his working more than eight (8) hours in a day or more than forty (40) hours in a week. Overtime hours may not be claimed.
(e)	If a day with fewer than eight (8) scheduled hours is claimed, the aforementioned eight (8) hour guarantee is thereby automatically waived forthat day.
(f)	An employee claiming hours must possess the necessary skills and requisite ability to perform the work required.
G.	INTER-UNION TRANSFER. It is recognized that to meet the needs of the business, transfer of employees, either within or between Company districts or between the geographical jurisdiction of a Union party to this Agreement may be required. In such cases where such transfer is effected by the Employer, the transferred employee will carry to such employee's new assignment all seniority, as defined above, acquired in the employ of the Company.
H.	TRAVEL DISTANCE. An employee covered by this Agreement shall have the right to refuse a transfer to another location if the distance to travel one way between his place of residence and the new location is more than twenty-five (25) miles or the distance between his place of residence and his current store, whichever is greater. A refusal of a transfer by an employee covered by this Agreement under any of these circumstances shall not constitute a reason for discrimination, layoff or discharge, except as set forth in Section D above.
I.	ADDITIONAL HOURS. A part-time employee may claim a scheduled weekly work schedule of another part-time employee within the same store and classification of employment calling for more weekly hours based upon the employee's seniority over other part-time employees provided:
1.	The claim is made within the same store, classification of employment and department.
2.	No part-time employee can claim the weekly work schedule of full-time employees or the weekly work schedule of another part-time employee with the same amount or lesser amount of hours. It is also understood that no employee may claim a shift or shifts.
3.	The part-time employee claims the entire weekly work schedule and makes his claim in writing to the store management within twenty-four (24) hours after the posting of the store's weekly work schedule. The part-time employee whose weekly work schedule has been successfully claimed then assumes the weekly work schedule of the claiming employees.
4.	No claim can be made unless the claiming employee possesses the necessary skill and ability to perform the type of work being done.
5.	Grievances pertaining to the application of weekly work schedule claims shall be filed in writing with store management within forty-eight (48) hours of the posting of the involved weekly work schedule. Grievances not filed within this time limit shall be deemed null and void for the week that was scheduled or any prior week.
6.	Part-time employees shall be given the first opportunity at full-time employment when permanent, full-time vacancies occur in any store within the jurisdiction of the Local Union. Selection of the part-time employee to fill the full-time vacancy shall be based on seniority, qualifications, skill and ability. Total hours worked for the Employer shall be given consideration in making such selection.
