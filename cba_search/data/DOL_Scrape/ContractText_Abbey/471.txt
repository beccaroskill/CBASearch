step-one answers, step-two requests, step-two answers, and requests for arbitration.

C.	Once the training on overtime administration has been completed and once the parties have endeavored to resolve all pending grievances on overtime disputes, the parties agree that they will zero out all charged overtime hours on 1-1-05, as a one-time action.

6
G MU-7-1-04
2004 General Memorandum of Understanding
party, which include the suggestion of a possible basis for the parties settling their dispute and, in the absence of a settlement, will generally include an advisory opinion.
5.	No more than one (1) day of mediation shall be scheduled in any five (5) days for a single team of advocates. The number of cases to be heard on any given day will be established by mutual agreement of the parties. The parties, however, will reasonably endeavor to schedule like grievances to facilitate resolution of disputes. Cases may not be scheduled with less than ten (10) working days notice. Either party may postpone any case if the party deems it necessary or propose substitution of another cases, provided time constraints described above can be met.
6.	The parties will be responsible for costs associated with mediation as described below:
a.	The costs of the mediator or any third party consultant brought in to assist both parties in the mediation process shall be equally shared by the Company and the Union.

7
GMU- 7-1-04
2004 General Memorandum of Understanding
mediation should complete this formal training program, absent consent of the opposing side.
9.	Each party shall be allowed to submit a written statement to the mediator for each case to be presented at the hearing, briefly outlining its case and arguments. Except where the parties have mutually agreed otherwise, the statements must be limited to four (4) pages (double spaced, typed, on 8 by 11 paper).
10.	During hearings, the parties will not be bound by formal rules of evidence and neither advocates nor witnesses shall be sworn.
I
।	11. The mediator will have the authority to meet separately with each side;
however, the party's advocate must be present for any such meetings between the mediator and any participant of the advocate’s team*
12.	Absent a settlement,.the mediator will be requested to give a written statement as to.his/her opinion in each case, including a brief statement of the grounds for that opinion, on the form made Attachment P to the General Memorandum of Understanding. Such written opinions are to be completed by the mediator at the hearing.and given to both parties arthat time. All opinions given by the mediator are advisory only and in no way diminish either party’s right to utilize the arbitration process under the provisions of Article 18 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Except as provided in-Paragraph 13below, the mediator's opinion may not be used in any other forum. Further, no position, statement or evidence provided during the mediation process may be.used in .any other forum against the party who.gave.it; however, this will not preclude either party from citing the same information acquired through some other method (such as grievance meetings. Article 16 meetings, unemployment hearings,-etc.) in another forum. However, this Agreement does not restrict the Company's staff that handles labor relations matters or Local 1900 Business Representatives from discussing, between these parties only, that an issue or case was previously heard in an alternative dispute resolution proceeding and the outcome of that case(s). The mediator may retain one copy of his/her opinion to be used solely for purposes of statistical analysis.
13.	In the event that the Company or the Union receives an adverse opinion from the mediator and subsequently proceeds to arbitrations under the provisions of Article 18 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the party moving the case to arbitration will be responsible for the entire cost of the arbitrator, if the arbitrator's opinion reaches substantially the same conclusions as the mediator. In the event that there is a dispute as to whether the conclusions of the mediator and the arbitrator deciding the
8
GMU- 7-1-04
2004 General Memorandum of Understanding
xv.
i
case under the provisions of Article 18 are "substantially the same,” that question will be referred back to the appropriate mediator, along with a copy of the award, for determination of that issue only. Both parties agree to be bound by this determination.
14.	Any settlements reached or opinions rendered or adopted as a result of the mediation process are reached on a “without precedent” basis, unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing. However, in the event that a grievant wishes to accept a settlement resulting from this process, he/she will be required, in writing, to waive or terminate all rights to any pending or future litigation collateral to the grievance as described in Attachment Q of the General Memorandum of Understanding.
15.	No decision or action taken as a result of this process can be the subject of a grievance.
16.	The Grievance Mediation Process outlined above supersedes Attachment D to the General Memorandum of Understanding of the 1993 Collective Bargaining Agreement and will continue in effect for the duration of the 2004 Collective Bargaining Agreement, and any agreed-upon extension to that Agreement which incorporates this Memorandum by specific reference; however, either party reserves the right to terminate this process with sixty (60) days notice to the other party. Further, the parties may, upon mutual agreement, modify or amend this Memorandum without terminating the rest of the memorandum at any time. It is understood that this process is agreed to on a “without precedent” basis and nothing in this process dilutes or concedes either party's rights or position in the future in any forum.
Mutual Assistance
A.	Mutual Assistance Definition
Mutual Assistance is defined as a situation/occurrence when the Company's management promises to assist other utilities for the purpose of restoring their electrical power during major emergencies - by providing manpower, materials and other logistical assistance. This definition includes all personnel within Overhead Lines Rockville and Forestville, Stores. Fleet and other areas of the Company as well as supporting contractor resources.
B.	Management Decisions
During Mutual assistance situations, management will decide the following:
9
GMU- 7-1-04
2004 General Memorandum of Understanding
1.	The level of support to be offered, including the type of assistance (Company personnel, supporting contractors or both), the manpower assistance to be provided (the number Of personnel in each major classification for each major operating organization), and other ancillary support activities (vehicles, materials, and other support personnel such as Fleet).
2.	The Company’s management will generally define the length of the mutual assistance. It is subject to change once the mutual assistance crew(s) reaches the destination and on-going management determination is made on the amount to the work and assistance required.
In a situation when some of the crews have to be released early (from a foreign utility’s work site or one of its service centers), it will be done on a volunteer basis, as far as practical and consistent with the remaining work requirements and logistics. If there are insufficient volunteers, the release of the required number of personnel will be done in accordance with the ' latest applicable Overtime Roster available on the site. ’In other words, the Company will release employees in the affected job classifications who have the highest amounts of charged overtime hours as reflected in the
. _	.latest.applicable Overtime Roster.
3.	Management will make assignments of specific locations should there be ■ more than one Company/Service Center request for mutual assistance. In a situation when some of the crews have to be released early from one Company or Service Center, but not the other, then releasing will be .confined to employees working at theaffected. Company/Service Center.
4.	Consistent with the business needs of Pepco and the type of assistance requested, a reasonable attempt will be made by the management to distribute the manpower assignments between Rockville and Forestville Service Centers. Management’s judgment will be predominantly guided by the availability of personnel, work loads and system needs/risks at each of the Service Center.
5.	Management will provide reasonable preparation time (consistent with the urgency of the requested assistance) to employees who are assigned for mutual assistance so that they can obtain clothing and other items and prepare to travel outside the Company’s service territory.
C.	Method of Selection for Mutual Assistance Assignment
1.	All qualified personnel within the area that is offering mutual assistance will be eligible to be considered for the mutual assistance assignment. The polling for mutual assistance assignment and final selection will be
io
GMO- 7-1-04
2004 General Memorandum of Understanding
done in accordance with Section 7.17 (a) of the Labor Agreement for each of the job classifications affected. Once a sufficient number of employees have volunteered, polling will cease. There will not be any "‘bumping’' allowed once assignments are made to the qualified and available employees.
For example, assume 5 employees in a job classification are needed for a mutual assistance assignment and no employees are presently at work. Assume that management calls employees at their homes in accordance with Section 7.17 (a). Assume further that management is unable to reach the employee with the lowest amount of charged overtime hours (“Employee A” in this example) but leaves a voicemail on his/her answering machine. Meanwhile, the next 5 employees on the Overtime Roster accept the assignment. Thus, management has a sufficient number of volunteers designated. Thereafter, Employee A returns management's call. Employee A is too late in his/her response and will not be allowed to bump another employee off the assignment.
2.	If personnel pre-assigned to trouble crews or non-regular shifts opt for mutual assistance, it is likely that the Company will have to fill-in the vacant spots on those crews and shifts with the remaining personnel from those classifications who will not be providing mutual assistance. If so. management will seek volunteers to fill the trouble crews and/or nonregular shift duties.
3.	If the required number of slots cannot be filled on volunteer basis, then the Company will assign available qualified employees to trouble crews and/or other non-regular shifts in accordance with Article 6.
4.	Persons working overtime for mutual assistance will be charged for the overtime worked for the purpose of Company’s Overtime Distribution Roster in accordance with the Labor Agreement.
D.	No grievances can be filed if the Company follows the procedures set forth above.
E.	The Company agrees to pay the 17 affected employees in grievance numbers 00-36 and 00-37 thirty-two (32) hours at straight time pay at their current rates as full settlement of the these grievances. The settlement is without precedent.
XVI. Provisions Affecting New Employees
A.	The provisions set forth below apply to any employee hired on or after January 1, 2005.
11
GMU- 7-1-04
2004 General Memorandum of Understanding
B.	Pension Plan for New Employees
Effective January 1,2005, any employee hired on or after that date shall participate in a new defined benefit pension plan. Any employees hired before that date shall participate in the Pepco General Retirement Plan. The key plan provisions of the new defined benefit plan are as follows:
1.	Pensionable Earnings
Pension Benefits shall be based on an employee's “base rate of pay’* using an employee's average earnings for the employee's highest 60 consecutive months of Benefit Service, which shall be referred to as “Final Average Earnings." Base rate of pay is the amount of an employee’s regular basic ' compensation from the Company excluding overtime and other forms of extra compensation such as shift differentials, temporary upgrades, incentive pay, .etc.
2.	Benefit Formula
■ When an employee eligible for a pension benefit.under the Plan retires, terminates or dies, the Company will use the following formula to determine his/her age 65 monthly benefit payment:
1.3% (.013) times Final Average Earnings times years of Benefit Service (up to 30).
3.	Service
a.	Vesting Service determines when an employee has a non-forfeitable right to a retirement benefit. An employee begins to accrue Vesting Service on the first of the month following their date of employment or the first of the month following their 18th birthday, whichever occurs later. Once an employee has five (5) years of Vesting Service, he/she has a right to a benefit from this Plan—even if the employee leaves the Company before retiring. If an employee retires early, Vesting Service also will be used to determine whether the individual is entitled to unreduced benefits.
b.	Benefit Service is used to determine the amount of benefit to which an employee may be entitled. An employee begins to accrue Benefit Service on the first of the month following their date of employment or the first of the month following their 21st birthday, whichever occurs later. An employee may earn up to a maximum of 30 years of Benefit Service.
12
GMU- 7-1-04
2004 General Memorandum of Understanding
4.	Normal Retirement
An employee’s Normal Retirement Date is the first day of the month that follows his/her 65th birthday or the fifth anniversary of the day he/she became a Plan member, whichever is later.
5.	Early Retirement
Employees may retire as early as age 55 and receive a benefit from the Plan providing they have completed at least 10 years of Benefit Service. Employees whoretire early will receive a reduction of 3% per year unless the employee is at least age 62 with 20 or more years of Vesting Service. If an employee has 20 or more years of Vesting Service, there will be a 3% reduction per year for every year the employee is under age 62 (pro rata reduction for partial years). If an employee has less than 20 years of Vesting Service, there will be a 3% reduction per year for every year the employee is under age 65 (pro rata reduction for partial years).
For example, if an employee with less than 20 years of Vesting Service retires at his/her first opportunity after turning age 55, he/she will receive 70% of his/her age 65 benefit. If an employee with 20 or more years of Vesting Service retires at his/her first opportunity after turning age 55, he/she will receive 79% of his/her age 65 benefit.

XVII. Administration of Section 13.16 of Labor Agreement
15
GMU- 7-1-04
2004 General Memorandum of Understanding
A.	The parties have agreed in Section 13.16 of the Labor Agreement to institute a 2-year pilot during which time employees absent due to sickness will not be disciplined for excessive absenteeism for using the first two Annual Allowance Days in any given year.
B.	The parties also agreed in Section 13.16 that in early 2007, the Company and Union shall review the total number of2006 sick days (paid or unpaid), including Family & Medical Leave (FMLA) absences, but excluding Sickness Disability Cases (on a per employee basis). Subsection (a) shall continue for the duration of the 2004 Labor Agreement providing the total number of2006 sick days (paid or unpaid), including FMLA absences, but excluding Sickness Disability Cases (on a per employee basis) is reduced by at least 20% compared with the total number of 2003 sick days, including FMLA absences, excluding Sickness Disability Cases (on a per employee.basis); otherwise, subsection (a) will become null and void effective 1-1-07.
. C. The parties wilLuse the following methodology to calculate the total number of sick days (on a per employee basis) excluding Sickness Disability Cases for 2003 and 2006. First, the parties will agree on what Company records to use both for obtaining the number of employees.and the.number of.sick.days.used for 2006. Second, using Company records, the Company will obtain the number of employees on January 1 and December 31 of each year, add the two numbers together and divide by two. For example, there were 1370
- bargaining-unit employees on 1-1-03 and 1270 on 12-31-03. The total of 2640 divided by 2 yields an average number of 1320, Third, the Company will obtain from Company records the number of hours in sick occurrences for absences of 6 or fewer .days. The total number of such hours in 2003 was 32,-700.25.'That number (32,700.25) shall be divided by 8 to convert the hours into days (4087.53). That resulting number (4087.53) divided by the average number of employees for the year (1320) produces .the average number of days on a per employee basis for the year (3.1 days in 2003). Accordingly, to continue the pilot program for the duration of the Labor Agreement, the average number of days in 2006 has to be 20% less than it was in 2003, which computes to 2.48 days on a per employee basis (3.1 x 80% = 2.48). In other words, if the number of days in sick occurrences for absences of 6 or fewer days, on a per employee basis, is 2.48 days or fewer in 2006. Section 13.16 (a) will continue for the duration of the Labor Agreement.
D. The parties agree to follow the method described in III. above in early 2005 to determine the average number of days on a per employee basis for 2004 as a test run to ensure the parties will be able to properly calculate the numbers for 2006.
XVIII.	Storm Settlements - Time Coding
16
GMU-7-1-04
2004 General Memorandum of Understanding
The parties agree to resolve time coding issues arising out of Hurricane Isabel and the storm in August 2003 as follows:
A.	The Company agrees that it will not seek restitution for any overpayments arising out of those storms absent a discovery of a major calculation error that results in an extreme overpayment. It will not seek restitution where management assumed a premium should be paid when in retrospect, it was inappropriate.
B.	The Union agrees it will not pursue cases where employees allege they should have been paid a change of schedule premium for more than 8 hours in a day.
C.	The Union agrees it will not pursue cases where employees allege that they did not receive a change of schedule notice in writing and therefore they should receive an additional premium. The Company agrees that employees should receive changes of schedule in writing and will endeavor to improve compliance with this section of the Labor Agreement.
D.	Since the storms and their aftermath constituted emergencies under Article 7, the Union will not pursue grievances alleging improper distribution of overtime.
E.	The Union will not pursue cases where employees allege they should have been paid the same as other employees. For example, some employees allege they should have received Code 85 D time like other employees did. Such cases will not be pursued.
F.	The Union will not pursue cases where employees allege they should have worked a different shift or schedule than they were assigned.
G.	With respect to meal allowances, the parties agree that no employee is entitled to a meal allowance if the Company provided an adequate meal. The Union may bring forward any case where an employee had a meal allowance removed from his/her time sheet providing the employee provides a statement that there was no food available at the time he/she tried to eat. Such cases must be brought forward within 90 days of ratification of the 2004 Labor Agreement. The fact that an employee may not like the type of food available is not an adequate reason to justify payment of a meal allowance. Any employee who was provided a meal at a restaurant at Company expense shall not receive a meal allowance in such an instance.
H.	The Union will not pursue cases where employees allege they were placed on call when staying al a hotel paid for by the Company.
