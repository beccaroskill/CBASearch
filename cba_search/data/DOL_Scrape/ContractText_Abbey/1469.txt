HIRING HALL PROCEDURE
1.	The Union shall establish and maintain an open employment list for the employment of workmen. Such list shall be established and maintained on a non-discriminatory basis, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and shall not be based on, or in any way affected by union membership, by-laws, rules, regulations, constitutional provisions, or any other aspect or obligation or union membership, policies or requirements.
2.	Whenever desiring to employ workmen, the Employer shall call upon the Union for any workmen as the Employer may, from time to time need, and the Union shall refer such workmen from the open employment list. The Employer shall give the Union twenty-four (24) hours notice when requiring the services of a workman covered hereunder, said notice time to be exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and Holidays.
a)	In notifying the Union of its need for workers, the Employer shall specify to the Union: (1) the number of workers required, (2) the location of the project, (3) the nature and type of construction involved, (4) the work to be performed, and (5) such other information as may be necessary to enable the Union to make proper referral of applicants.
b)	When an Employer states requirements for special skills or abilities in his request for Employees, the Union shall refer the first applicant on the register possessing such skills and abilities.
3.	The employer shall retain the absolute and unconditional right to reject any workman referred by the Union not possessing the requisite work qualifications, or special skills and abilities, since the Union is not to be deemed to guarantee same. However, in no case shall a referred workman be rejected without just cause. Any workman who is rejected by the Employer with just cause, shall be restored to his place on the list.
4.	All members and registrants on hiring hall lists must personally register and be properly identified and photographed.
5.	Recognizing that many older workers are restricted in the operation of heavy construction equipment by reason of technical advances and/or physical handicaps which do not, however, prevent them performing usefully and well, certain functions of the operating engineers’ craft, and with a view towards maintaining a source of employment for persons falling in this category, the hiring hall will maintain a “Limited Preferred Status List,” from which dispatch will be made for maintenance and operation of welding machines, compressors, elevators, house cars, generators, pumps, temporary heating equipment, conveyors and tuggers.
In order to qualify for referral from this list, the following criteria must be met:
2
ARTICLE II (continued)
(a)	The member or registrant must voluntarily submit his name for inclusion on the list for a minimum period of six (6) months and during this time will not be eligible for referrals except as to equipment under the “Limited Preferred Status List.”
(b)	The member or registrant on the “Limited Preferred Status List” must be at least fifty-five (55) years of age and have had twenty years of experience in the industry as evidenced by his continuing availability on the Hiring Hall List, or in lieu thereof:
(c)A person on the “Limited Preferred Status List” must have a bonafide physical handicap with proof thereof being submitted to the satisfaction of the Executive Board of Local Union 825, which handicap would unduly restrict his capacity to operate equipment other than that on the “Limited Preferred Status List.”
(d)	In view of the restriction on employment of those on the “Limited Preferred Status List” to the equipment specified herein, contractors may not request an Employee by name on this list.
(e)	In the event that the “Limited Preferred Status List” is exhausted and no one is available therefrom for employment, a registrant or member from the general hiring hall list may be referred to a job normally filled by a person from the “Limited Preferred Status List.”
6.	When a man is referred from the hiring hall for employment, he shall continue to retain his position at the top of the hiring hall list, until he has completed one hundred and twenty (120) hours of employment, after which time his name shall be re-registered in proper position as of the date of notification to the hiring hall of his availability-
7.	In order that the hiring hall list may correctly reflect the availability of registrants, each member and registrant must present himself in person at least once a year to the hiring hall dispatcher for review of his registration card.
8.	Registration cards will contain information as to the equipment that the registrant can operate and his experience in such operation. If a registrant has been discharged by two or more Contractors because of alleged inability to operate the equipment, the equipment in question will be removed from his hiring hall card, and he will not be dispatched on that equipment. If the registrant wishes to appeal the removal of the equipment from his card, he may request an opportunity to demonstrate his ability to the Local Union Examining Committee, at the Ttaining Site.
9.	The dispatcher in making referrals from the hiring hall, based in part on an Employer’s request to reemploy a man who is available and who has had “recent employment,” shall not consider employment as “recent,” unless it was within the preceding one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of request, exclusive of winter layoffs.
10.	Unless otherwise provided by the Collective Bargaining Agreement with the Local Union, no person dispatched
from the hiring hall will operate any machine or equipment other than those to which he was originally assigned to on referral, without approval of the hiring hall.
11.	When the machine or equipment to which a man was referred is moved to a different job or shut down, the operator must notify the hiring hall.
12.	No person selected for referral from the hiring hall will be allowed to refuse a job without just cause. Two such refusals without just cause will result in his displacement to the bottom of the hiring hall list.
13.	It shall be the privilege of members and registrants to place their names on any one, or all, of the hiring hall lists maintained at the various Union offices throughout the jurisdiction of Local 825.
14.	Upon request of a member or registrant, the hiring hall dispatcher shall inform him of his present position on the hiring hall referral list. If the member or registrant believes that his placement on the list is improper and discriminates against him with reference to a possible job referral, he shall have the right to review his position on the list. If the member or registrant continues to believe his placement on the list was improper or discriminatory he may file a claim pursuant to Section 15, of these rules.
15.	Any member or registrant on the employment list who makes written claim that he has been discriminated against in violation of his rights under the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended by exclusion from a job referral, shall have the right to an immediate appeal to a Joint Board consisting of two (2) members of the Union and two (2) representatives of the Employer, who shall be respectively designated upon the signing of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Voting by members of the Joint Board shall be on a unit basis. In case the Joint Board fails to reach a unanimous decision, the claim shall be submitted expeditiously to an impartial umpire, to be agreed upon by the Joint Board herein created, whose decision shall be binding and conclusive.
The Claim of any member or registrant who feels that he has been discriminated against must be filed in writing with the Union ten (10) days from the date of the alleged discriminatory practice, in order to entitle him to the benefits of the appeal procedure hereinbefore set forth.
16.	The cost and expense of establishing and maintaining the open list and of referrals therefrom, shall be borne by all of the registrants thereon. In the case of registrants, who are not members of the Union, their share of such costs and expenses shall not exceed a sum equal to the pro-rata share of the cost and expenses of operating the employment list and the referrals therefrom, which is being borne by members of the Union from the payment of union dues. After seven (7) days from the date of this Agreement or of the date of registry on the list, whichever is later, registrants shall incur the obligation of making quarterly payments of their share of such cost and expenses. Failure of a registrant to make pay
3
ARTICLE II (continued)
ment of such cost and expenses shall constitute grounds for removal from such list and shall nullify any prior referral therefrom.
17.	A registrant must have maintained his permanent residence in the geographical area of the entire State of New Jersey and the five Southern Counties of New York (Delaware, Ulster, Orange, Sullivan and Rockland) for a period of one (1) year, or, who having had a permanent home in the area, has temporarily left with the intention of returning to this area as his permanent home.
All references in the foregoing Hiring Hall Rules, to the masculine gender, shall be deemed to include the feminine gender.
