The Puget Sound Metal Trades Council and Todd Pacific Shipyards shall meet monthly on a continuing basis to investigate all avenues to retain the employees of the shipyard and eliminate as much subcontracting as possible.
ARTICLE 3.	NON-DISCRIMINATION, RECOGNITION, UNION SECURITY, HIRING, SENIORITY
3.1	Nondiscrimination: The Employer and Unions agree that there will be no discrimination in employment because of race, creed, color, national origin, age, sex, or handicap, as defined by Federal and State Laws. Nor shall there be any discrimination of disabled veterans or veterans of the Vietnam era. In referring to employees in this Agreement, the masculine gender is used for convenience only and shall refer both to males and females. Compliance with State and/or Federal laws shall not be considered discrimination under this sub-section.
3.2	Recognition: The Employer recognizes the Unions as set forth in the Preamble and signatory hereto as the sole collective Bargaining Agents for all of its employees covered by this Agreement, in all of the classifications contained in Schedule "A" of this Agreement and employed on work covered by the "Scope of this Agreement."
3.3	Union Security:
(a)	Employees included in the Bargaining Unit covered by this Agreement who are members of the respective Union as of the effective date of this Agreement shall, as a condition of employment, maintain their membership in the Union.
(b)	Employees included in the Bargaining Unit covered by this Agreement who are not members of the respective Union as of the effective date of this Agreement, shall apply for membership in said Union on the thirty-first (31 st) day after such effective date; and all employees who are accepted into membership into the Union shall maintain their membership in the Union as a condition of their employment.
(c)	Employees hired after the effective date of this Agreement shall apply for membership in the respective Union on the thirty-first (31st) day following the beginning of such employment, and all employees who are accepted
.	into membership in the Union shall maintain their membership in the Union as a condition of their
employment.

I understand that such deductions are to be made on the first regularly scheduled payday of the month following the month in which this authorization is received by the Personnel Office of the Employer. This authorization and assignment shall remain in effect until canceled by written notice of the Union or the Employee. The dues deducted are to be sent no later than the end of the calendar month in which the deduction was made to:

:	list of names of those employees for whom such deduction has been made, and the amount deducted for each
such employee.
Each Union agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Employer from any and all claims, actions, and/or 7': *	proceedings arising out of said political fund.
r 3.4 Hiring:
(a) The Employer agrees that when additional employees are required the appropriate Local Union will be given h-	as much advance notice as possible, but not less than twenty-four (24) hours so that the Union may have a
reasonable opportunity to refer applicants for employment. The period of notice will commence when the appropriate Union receives such notice by telephone from the Employer.

representatives of the Employer. The Unions agree that they will, upon request of the Employer, refer experienced men, when available, to the Employer for the classifications covered by this Agreement. If less than twenty-four hour notice is given, the Unions agree that upon receipt from the Employer of a request for ■ y,	additional manpower, they will make every reasonable effort to provide the manpower as soon as possible.

|	regardless of whether all seniority employees have been recalled or not.

by-laws, rules, regulations, constitutional provisions or any other aspect or obligation of Union membership, policies or requirements.

(h)	All employees referred to the Employer by the Unions under this Article shall submit to the making of such records as are or may be required by the Employer for the purpose of identification.
(i)	The Unions and Employer agree to hold each of the other Parties signatory hereto harmless from any money damages and penalties assessed against them by any Government Agency or Court of Law because of any charge of unfair labor practice or act where such practice or act was proximately or solely caused by any one of the individual Unions or Employer.

1.	Length of continuous seniority with the Employer in the classification or agreed classification.
2.	Demonstrated skill and ability to perform the work within the classification or agreed classification. Where factor two (2) is equal as between employees to be laid off and recalled, then factor one (1) shall prevail.
(h)	Employees who are laid off in accordance with Subsection (g) shall be recalled to work in inverse order of layoff, provided the employee is qualified to perform the work within the classification or agreed classification.
(i)	Employees promoted to any higher classification or to Leading men paid on an hourly basis shall continue to accrue seniority in the classification from which they are promoted during the time they serve in such capacity. Employees promoted to jobs outside the bargaining unit shall retain such seniority as they had in the classification from which they were promoted as of the day of the promotion. There will be no retroactive adjustments, but prospectively these employees shall not continue to accrue seniority while out of the bargaining unit.
(j)	The Employer will furnish a cunent Seniority List on a monthly basis to each appropriate Union, designating foreman or the immediate classification above Leading man.
