MLA 07-01-2009 to 06-30-2010_176/2010_11:01:48 AM

Work list within two (2) working days of the layoff and (2) the Union files a complaint with the Joint Conference Board within ten (10) days of the layoff.

Employers shall provide employees with a termination slip stating the reason they were terminated. The termination slip shall be presented to the employee at the time of termination and signed by a supervisor. Termination slips shall be provided to the Employer by the local union.
15.	Apprentice Ratio: The qualified Contractor may employ one (1) apprentice when it has at least one (1) journeyman regularly employed, and one (1) additional apprentice for each three (3) additional journeymen. When three (3) journeymen are steadily employed on new construction, the next hired must be an apprentice, if available. Job site ratio may be one (1) apprentice per each journeyman.
16.	No journeyman who holds an active Contractor's License will be eligible to sign the Out-of-Work List or to be dispatched for work covered by this Agreement unless he/she submits evidence that he/she has made his/her Contractor's License inactive through the procedure specified by the California Contractor's State License Board.
17.	The Contractor shall have the right to reject any applicant for employment referred by the Joint Hiring Hall, but in the exercise of such right shall in no way discriminate against any worker by reason of membership or non-membership in any Union. Any applicant for employment reporting for work shall be entitled to four (4) hours show-up pay at the wage and fringe rate shown on the dispatch, if rejected, unless said applicant is not qualified for the job. If the applicant is rejected because he/she is not qualified for the job, he/she shall not be entitled to any show-up pay. Once an applicant is rejected and paid the four (4) hours show-up pay, he/she shall not be entitled to show-up pay from the same employer if rejected during the six months period following the payment of show-up pay by the same employer.
18.	A Contractor may discharge any employee for just cause, but the Contractor must prove just cause before the Joint Conference Board whenever the Local Union believes the Contractor did not have just cause to discharge the employee. If the Contractor is found not to have just cause, the Contractor shall be compelled to pay lost wages and fringe benefits for time lost by the employee, as stated below. Once the employee accepts employment from 393’s joint hiring hall, the liability shall not continue. If the employee is not available for work or does not accept work that the Joint Hiring Hall has offered, the Contractor shall have no liability from that date forward.
If the Local Union or the employee is not able to meet within two working (2) days from the date of the discharge, the Contractor’s liability shall be limited to two (2) days. If the Contractor Association or the Contractor is not able to meet within four (4) days from the
MLA_07-01-2009 to 06-30-2010_1/6/2010_11:01:48 AM
15
date of the discharge, and the Contractor is found not having just cause for discharge, the employee shall be entitled to a maximum of four (4) days wages and fringe benefits. If the employee has not returned to work for another Contractor, the Joint Conference Board may require the Contractor to re-employ the employee who was discharged.
19.	In the event the Joint Hiring Hall does not dispatch any workers within two (2) full working days following the day that the Contractor's request for workers is received if the request is in writing, the Contractor may employ any worker, but shall arrange for a dispatch to be issued for such worker from the Joint Hiring Hall prior to the commencement of such employment, and such dispatch shall upon request be issued by the Joint Hiring Hall to the employee.
20.	NAME HIRE, RECALL, AND CALL FOR CERTIFIED WELDER:
A.	NAME HIRE. A Contractor may name hire one employee, regardless of that employee's place on the Class A List, by name from the Class A List only. If the Contractor does name hire, the next two journeymen dispatched to that Contractor must be list hires. The hiring of applicants by name to act as Foreman or General Foreman shall count as a name hire. A name hire request must be in writing, signed by the Contractor or senior representative thereof, and presented to the Joint Hiring Hall. There will be no banking of name hire privileges that would result in a Contractor being able to hire two (2) employees consecutively by name. A Contractor shall not abuse or manipulate the short call hiring procedure for the purpose of qualifying for a name hire.
In the event the name hired Class A employee is not registered on the Out-ofWork list with the Joint Hiring Hall, or not available for work, or not willing to accept the dispatch, the Joint Hiring Hall shall notify the Contractor as soon as possible; and the two (2) working days' period specified in paragraph 19 shall not commence to run until receipt by the Joint Hiring Hall of an additional request for an employee from the Contractor.
B.	RECALL FROM CLASS “A” LIST:
“A” LIST RECALL: Upon receipt of a valid recall request, the Joint Hiring Hall shall dispatch the person registered on the “A” Out of Work List who has worked for said contractor within the past twelve (12) months, except as provided below:
Whenever an “A” List person has been on the Out of Work List and available for work for sixty (60) calendar days without being offered a referral for employment, recall shall be limited to persons registered on the “A” Out of Work List who have worked for said contractor within the past six (6) months. Once the six (6) month recall period has been implemented, it shall remain in effect for a minimum of thirty (30) days. The twelve (12) month recall provision will not be reinstated until there are no “A” List persons on the Out of Work List more than thirty (30) calendar days without a job offer.
MLA.07-01 -2009 to 06-30-2010_1 /6/2010_11:01:48 AM
16
C.	CALL FOR CERTIFIED WELDER. Effective July 1, 2006, a contractor may request the dispatch of a welder who holds a current certification approved by the U.A. Local 393 Training Center in one of the following three (3) procedures: Shielded Metal Arc Welding (ARC), Gas Metallic Arc Welding (MIG), or Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (TIG). When a contractor requests the dispatch of a welder with a current U.A. Local 393 Training Center certification or equivalent in ARC, MIG, or TIG, the Joint Hiring Hall will dispatch certified welders in order of registration from the Class “A” Lists, then those from the Class “B” Lists, then those from the Class “C” Welder List, then those from the Class “D1,JWelder List, then those from the Class “E” Welder List. When a welder is hired by certification dispatch under this procedure, the welder will continue on the contractor’s payroll when required to re-test to maintain any of the three (3) certifications stated above.
21.	Return To Immediate Previous Employer: Class A-List journeymen and indentured Apprentices may return to work with their immediate previous employer, and must have a dispatch from the Joint Hiring Hall issued to them within two days of returning to work, provided that the journeyman or indentured Apprentice has not worked more than seven (7) days for another employer. Short jobs (i.e., seven (7) days or less) shall not disqualify a Class A-List journeyman or indentured Apprentice from returning to work for his/her immediate previous employer for whom he/she worked eight (8) or more days.
22.	Out of Area Contractor - Company Representative: Regardless of anything herein to the contrary, Contractors from outside the area covered by this Agreement coming into said area to perform work covered by this Agreement may bring in one (1) plumber for plumbing work, one (1) steamfitter for steamfitting work, one (1) sprinkler fitter for fire protection work and one (1) leadburner for lead line work for each job inside the area covered by this Agreement. The Contractor must, however, before commencement of the job, notify the Joint Hiring Hall in writing of the names of such workers. In the event the Contractor brings in one (1) worker, as above set forth, it shall be a condition of employing said worker within the jurisdiction of U.A. Local 393 for the Contractor to hire at least one (1) additional journeyman on the sixth (6th) working day.
23.	EMPLOYERS WITHIN THE BAY AREA (UA Local 342 & 467) - FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF MEN

ARTICLE XXV - Payments to the Trust Funds
173.	All payments provided in ARTICLES XIX, XX, XXI, XXIII, XXIV and the Employee Savings, dues check-off and supplemental unemployment contributions provided in Article XIII (herein collectively referred to as "contributions") shall be due and payable monthly on or before the fifteenth (15) day, and must be paid not later than the fifteenth (15th) day of each calendar month for all work performed in the preceding month. Administrators of the Trust Funds shall in each case provide each Contractor with a form of report to be filled out and mailed by the Contractor with its contributions to the place designated by the Administrators; such reports and contributions must be in the hands of the Administrators not later than the fifteenth (15th) of the month or else the Contractor shall be deemed and held to be delinquent in the monthly payments required by said ARTICLES. Reports and contributions deposited in the mail must be postmarked not later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the month or they shall be deemed and held to be delinquent. The Boards of Trustees of the Trust Funds may provide for one report form and one monthly payment for all contributions. Monies collected, net of expenses and fees of collection, shall be allocated to the appropriate Trusts, organizations and individuals.

Therefore, it is agreed that the amount of damages to each said Fund and to the parties hereto resulting from any such failure shall be by way of liquidated damages and not assessment of penalty, the sum of $250.00 per month for each such failure to pay in full within the time limits provided, which said amount shall become due and payable to the Funds at their respective principal offices, upon the day immediately following the date on which the Contractor became delinquent. Liquidated damages shall be added to and become a part of said amount due and unpaid and the whole thereof shall bear interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum until paid. The liquidated damages shall be increased to twenty percent (20%) of the principal amount MLA_07-01 -2009 to 06-30-2010_1 /6/2010_11:01:48 AM	a7
due and owing in the event a principal amount is due and owing on the day a lawsuit for collection is filed, or becomes owing after a lawsuit for collections is filed in a State or Federal court or an unfair labor practice charge is filed with the National Labor Relations Board. If any Individual Contractor defaults in the payment of any payments due the Fund, in addition to the amount due and the liquidated damages provided for, there shall be added to the obligation of the Individual Contractor who is in default all reasonable expenses incurred by the Fund in the collection of the same including but not limited to reasonable attorney's and accountant fees, cost of any bond or lien and court costs.
175.	In addition to the foregoing, each Individual Contractor shall post with the agency so designated by the Board of Trustees of the Welfare Plan a bond to be issued by a qualified surety company doing business in the State of California, said bond to be based on the average number of bargaining unit workers employed for the past calendar year, (or to deposit an equivalent amount of cash in an escrow account in a bank to be designated by the Board of Trustees of the Welfare Plan) to secure the payment of the amounts required by this Agreement to be paid to the Trust Fund provided in ARTICLES XIX, XX, XXI, XXII, XXIII and XXIV thereof. New Contractors shall meet with the Plumbers and Steam Fitters Business Office in regard to all work to be performed in regards to bonding.

176.	The Union shall remove employees covered by this Agreement from employment with a delinquent Contractor, or from employment with a contractor who failed to maintain a fringe benefit bond in the required amount, provided that advance notice of not less than twenty-four (24) hours is given of such action to the delinquent Contractor.

Such removal of employees and cessation of work by employees for such delinquent Contractor shall continue until the Administrator of the Fund involved verifies that there is no money owing to the Fund by such Contractor.
177.	When employees are removed from a Contractor's shop or job because of delinquency in payment of fringe benefits or wages, the Contractor shall pay to all such removed employees sixteen (16) hours in addition to time worked on the date of removal, if any, at their regular rate of pay plus fringe contributions, in the same manner

48
as if they were employed on the job. When the delinquent wages and/or fringe contributions are paid and the account is cleared in full, and the employees notified to return to work prior to said sixteen (16) hours, then the Contractor shall be liable only for those hours the employees were actually off the job because of such violation of contract, and provided further, that if they are not available to return to work within two (2) hours of such notice, they shall receive pay for only two (2) hours after receipt of such notice by the Union.
178.	Employees removed from the job may accept a work order to a different Contractor and still be eligible to be transferred back to the Contractor from which they were removed providing delinquencies were corrected and the transfer effected within sixteen (16) hours of the removal time and provided such employees shall not be reimbursed under this paragraph for the time they were paid while working for another Contractor.

WHEREAS, CONTRACTOR is presently engaged in or is bidding to engage in building and construction work at the above-referenced Project.
WHEREAS, UNION has in its membership throughout the area members competent and qualified to perform the work of CONTRACTOR at this Project.
WHEREAS, CONTRACTOR has employed and now employs members of the UNION and CONTRACTOR has a commitment and/or contract from the owner or General Contractor of the Project for certain of the work to be performed at the Project job site.
WHEREAS, members of UNION who are employees of CONTRACTOR have the right, as an individual act of conscience, to refuse to work alongside Non-Union craftsmen of any trade or craft, and should they choose to exercise this right they will thereby lose employment, wages, fringes and other benefits of the Labor Contract between CONTRACTOR and UNION.
WHEREAS, should members of UNION choose to exercise this right to refuse to work with Non-Union craftsmen, CONTRACTOR may suffer loss of the construction contract for the Project, thereby causing injury to members of UNION and to CONTRACTOR.
WHEREAS, CONTRACTOR and UNION desire to mutually preserve the work of members of the UNION at the above-referenced Project and to avoid the job site friction and interruptions of work that may arise when members of UNION work continuously alongside Non Union craftsmen on the same construction site.
IT IS, THEREFORE, agreed by the undersigned CONTRACTOR and UNION in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein that this Special Project Agreement be made as follows:
ARTICLE I - Intents and Purposes
MLA_07-01-2009 to 06-30-2010_1/6/2010 - 11:01:48 AM

1.	This Special Project Agreement is for the joint use and benefit of the contracting parties, and the provisions herein defined and set forth shall be construed as binding upon and effective in determining the relations between the parties signing hereto and to set forth herein and by reference the basic Agreement covering the rates of pay, hours of work, and conditions of employment to be observed by the parties at the above-referenced Project.
2.	It is mutually understood that the following terms and conditions relating to the employment of members of UNION have been decided upon by means of collective bargaining and that the following provisions will be binding upon the CONTRACTOR and the UNION for the duration of the Project, except as specified in ARTICLE II herein below.
ARTICLE II - Terms and Conditions of Employment
3.	Right to Refuse to Work with Non-Union Craftsmen: CONTRACTOR shall not require any employee covered by the current and extended Collective Bargaining Agreements to work at the same job site at the same time or times as the employee or employees of any other Contractor whose wages, hours and conditions of employment are less favorable than the wages, hours and conditions of employees generally in the same craft in the area covered by this Agreement. Furthermore, recognizing the "special problems" in the Construction Industry based upon the close relationship between Contractors and Subcontractors at the job site of the construction, alteration, painting, or repair of a building, structure, or other such work and the friction that is created when Union and Non-Union employees work side-by-side, it shall not be a violation of this Agreement and it shall not be a cause for discharge or disciplinary action in the event an employee of CONTRACTOR refuses to enter upon any such construction site where Non-Union employees are employed and which would require the employee to work "shoulder-to-shoulder" or alongside the Non-Union employee or employees, or refuses to remain on such a job site when Non-Union employees are engaged in such construction on the job site. This clause shall apply only to job sites where the UNION'S members are working, whether it be on a construction site of CONTRACTOR or any site within the jurisdiction of the UNION.
ARTICLE III - Status of This Special Project Agreement
4.	It is mutually agreed that this Special Project Agreement is the type of Agreement
referred to in ARTICLE XVII, paragraph 146, of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement and therefore is excepted from application of this "Favored Nation" clause.
5.	In exchange for the Collective Bargaining Agreement and modifications set forth above, and in order to obtain and preserve stable, continued employment for members of UNION on the Project identified above, UNION agrees that the Pension Augmentation Fund fringe benefit contribution of three dollars and fifty cents ($3.50) shall not be payable for work performed by members of UNION on this Project provided the following condition occurs:
Only AFL-CIO Building Trades Union workers perform work at the Project job site during the period commencing when the first work is performed by a member of UNION and ending when all

vii
construction at the Project job site within the work jurisdiction of UNION ends and the CONTRACTOR'S warranty period begins.
6.	CONTRACTOR shall be obligated to pay into the Pension Augmentation Fund for each of its employees, whether a journeyman or apprentice, the sum of three dollars and fifty cents ($3.50) for each hour of straight time and overtime worked by them on the Project described above unless the condition set forth above occurs.
ARTICLE IV - Savings Clause
7.	It is not the intent of either party hereto to violate any laws, rulings, or regulations of any government authority or agency having jurisdiction of the subject matter of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that in the event any provisions of this Agreement are finally held or determined to be illegal or void as being in contravention of any such laws, rulings or regulations, nevertheless, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties agree that if and when any provision of this Agreement is finally held or determined to be illegal or void they will then promptly enter into lawful negotiations concerning the substance thereof.
8.	IT IS HEREBY AGREED AND UNDERSTOOD by the parties that, the collection of any pension augmentation funds due by virtue of the violation of Special Project Agreements or failure to file for a waiver under a Special Project Agreement, shall not include any self-help on the part of the Local Union such as the removal of employees from the job for the purpose of enforcing the contribution. All enforcement will be under the grievance procedures of the collective bargaining agreement.
