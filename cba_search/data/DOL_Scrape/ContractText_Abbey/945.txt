POLICY STATEMENT
This policy applies to all employees of the employer, both bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit, including sales, clerical, management, owners, part-time employees, as well as applicants for employment.
PREFACE
Alcohol/substance abuse is recognized as a treatable illness. The desired result and preferred procedure is rehabilitation resulting through referral to locally operated industry Employee Assistance Program (EAP). The EAP should provide the employee and the supervisor educational programming, individual and family counseling, as well as treatment referral services.
CONDITIONS AND DEFINITIONS:
1.	Workplace problems arising out of an employee’s relationship with substance abuse may warrant a variety of management responses, including referral for treatment, testing, disciplinary action, or termination of employment.
2.	The parties to this Policy regard urine testing as problematic and do not advocate total reliance on such procedures to identify individuals with an al-cohol/chemical dependency. However, certain circumstances support substance testing as a warranted vehicle for determining possible impairment and/or a propensity for substance abuse. These include:
A.	Pre-employment testing;
B.	Probable cause testing, (i.e. post accident and/or injury)
C.	Work opportunities mandated testing.1
3.	The use of alcohol or illegal drugs during working
'Work opportunities mandated testing refers to situations which require the successful contractor to comply with a substance abuse testing procedure required by the owner or owner agent. (See Item 15 below)
— 65 —
hours, or on a job site or on the employer's piem-ises is absolutely forbidden. Any employee who violates this policy may be required to undergo rehabilitation and/or may be subject to disciplinary action, including termination.
4.	The term USE means consuming, possessing, selling, concealing, distributing or arranging to buy or sell,/being under the influence or reporting for duty under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs.'
5.	EMPLOYER’S PREMISES includes all property, facilities, land, buildings, structures, automobiles, trucks, and other vehicles owned, leased, or used by the Company, and construction sites where the Company is providing services and employment.
6.	The term ALCOHOL or ILLEGAL DRUGS means any form of alcohol and/or other intoxicating substance, narcotic plant or similar narcotic substance, illegal chemical substances or drugs (including legal drugs obtained or used illegally or without proper medical supervision or authorization).
7.	An EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (EAP) means a program designed to assist employees with alcohol and/or substance abuse, or other problems by means of counseling, treatment, or referral to more specific centers. The emphasis of the program is centered on the recovery of the individual and to provide services designed to assist in recovery.
8.	The term EMPLOYEE includes all employees of the employer, both bargaining unit and non-bar-gaining unit, including sales, clerical, management, owners, part-time employees, as well as applicants for employment.
9.	The term WORKING HOURS means all of the
— 66 —
time in which an employee is engaged in work duties or duties complementary to work, including rest periods, lunch periods, travel time or time subject to employer control.
10.	An employee’s private property may be inspected only for probable cause. (See Item 14 below).
11.	UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL means a blood alcohol content of .05% or greater.
12.	UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE OR DRUG means a urine content determined to equal or exceed the levels approved by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).
13.	PRE-EMPLOYMENT SCREENING-the screening of prospective employees may be implemented to ascertain whether an applicant is capable of safely performing the duties of and meeting the prerequisites for the employment offered. Preemployment testing will not apply to an employee who returns to active employment with an employer following an absence of less than six (6) consecutive months.
14.	PROBABLE CAUSE-those circumstances, based upon objective evidence about an employee’s conduct in the workplace, that would cause a reasonable person to believe that the employee is demonstrating signs of impairment due to alcohol or chemical substances. (See Item 4 above “USE”). Depending upon the circumstances existing at the time, probable cause may automatically apply to employee work behavior which results in injury to or endangerment of the health and safety of others in the workplace.2
15.	WORK OPPORTUNITY MANDATED TEST-ING-In all situations where an employer is
2This refers to any event resulting in injury to an individual or property to which an employee contributed as a direct or indirect cause.
— 67 —
required to agree to a testing program over which he/she has no control or direct input in order to qualify as a provider of services and/or products, testing shall be approved; however, the employer shall exert maximum pressure to insure that the testing is performed in accordance with the standards enumerated in this Policy and applied uniformly to all personnel having access to the affected workplace or specific work order. There shall be no discrimination against any employee who refuses a job assignment to a job or project that is subject to testing. An employee who refuses a job assignment to a job or project for which the employer is required to agree to a random testing program may be laid off if there is no alternate work available for which said employee is qualified.
16.	An employee who is convicted of violations of laws involving illegal chemical substances or drugs while on work status will be considered to be in violation of this Policy and subject to action noted herein.
17.	An employee who suspects he/she has developed an addiction to, dependency on, or otherwise has a problem with alcohol or chemical substances or drugs, is expected to seek assistance through the EAP or other competent resource. Any person who voluntarily seeks assistance or rehabilitation for alcohol and/or chemical substance or drug related problems shall be granted amnesty and disciplinary remedies waived so long as the person continues to participate satisfactorily in the rehabilitation or counseling program. An employee cannot voluntarily seek assistance or rehabilitation and thereby gain amnesty following the occurrence of circumstances which gave rise to probable cause for testing.
18.	The failure of an employee to promptly participate
— 68 —
in testing or a search under probable cause at management’s request, or should an employee’s test results be positive and the employee refuse to seek rehabilitation or fail to complete a rehabilitation program, such employee shall be subject to disciplinary action including termination.
19.	Any employee who has tested positive for alcohol and/or chemical substance or drugs shall be required to enroll through the local EAP in a state approved counseling or rehabilitation program. Upon submission of a work release from the program, said employee may return to work if a job is available, or be referred from the out-of-work list.
20.	The employer with the approval of the local union shall select at least one, no more than two, DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVES to handle all confidential matters regarding this Policy. Only the Designated Representative(s) will be informed of test results. The name(s) of the employer Designated Representative(s) will be communicated to the EAP in writing.

22.	Discipline of bargaining unit members shall be in accordance with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement and/or the rules of the Joint Apprenticeship & Training Committee as appropriate. Union members subject to this policy continue to have access to the usual protections provided as a part of their union membership. Union members may request that a union representative be available or present prior to any action taken by an employer at any stage of the policy and its administration. If an individual is aggrieved by any action taken under this Drug /Alcohol Policy and his complaint cannot be resolved, it may, if the individual or Union requests, be referred as a griev
— 69 —
ance under the grievance and arbitration provisions of the individual’s collective bargaining agreement. In the event the matter is referred to arbitration, the Arbitrator shall be bound substantively by the provisions of the Drug/Alcohol Policy-
23.	An employee who tests positive and is granted an opportunity for rehabilitation as an alternative to discipline will, prior to returning to work and upon proper release by an authorized representative of the treatment agency or program, sign a “Last Chance Agreement", a copy of which is attached to this Policy as Addendum “A”.
24.	PRESCRIPTION DRUGS-any substance prescribed for an individual by a licensed medical practitioner. Prescription drugs may be brought upon Company Premises only by the person for whom they are prescribed, and shall only be used in the manner, combination and quantity prescribed. Employees using a prescription drug which may impair mental or motor function shall inform their supervisor of such use. For the safety of all employees, the employer may place persons using such drugs in a less hazardous job assignment or place them on temporary unpaid leave until released as fit for duty by the prescribing physician. The employer reserves the right to have its physician determine if a prescription drug produces hazardous effects or to restrict the quantity the employee is allowed to bring to the workplace. (No employee shall be discriminated against for the use of a prescribed drug).
This policy shall be distributed to all employees at the time it becomes effective. All employees shall sign a document acknowledging receipt of the policy and consenting to alcohol and drug testing conducted in accordance with the policy.

shall make certain that the notification is given in confidence. Neither the test results nor the notification shall be communicated to any other person who does not have a bona fide need to know. An employee subject to probable cause testing may, for reasons of safety, be suspended from active work until the test results are available. If the employee is suspended and the test result is negative the employee will be reinstated with back pay for time the employee otherwise could have worked.
9.	The employee must present the employer with a copy of the receipt from the laboratory given at the time of the urinalysis.
