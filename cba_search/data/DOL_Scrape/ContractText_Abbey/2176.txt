February 14, 2018
any hours required to be worked beyond normal working hours. Any outside activities or employment, including preparation for outside activities or employment, will be done on the employee’s own time.

ANA will provide within the probationary period, orientation for all new employees to familiarize them with the mission, goals and operations of ANA and the duties, goals, and responsibilities of their jobs, the work of their departments and the relationship of their job and department to the mission and goals of ANA. Orientation, generally, will be given within the first forty-five (45) days and will include familiarizing the employee on the equipment and software that he or she is assigned to use. Human Resources will develop a comprehensive orientation program with input from the Labor Management Committee within a reasonable period of time to meet the needs of the employee, including a 60-minute
February 15, 2015
20
February 14, 2018
orientation by WBNG. In addition, there will be an orientation to the assigned departments.
ARTICLE 22.	PROBATIONARY PERIOD
22.1	Each newly-hired exempt or non-exempt employee will serve a probationary period of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days. The probationary period will be extended automatically by the number of days of scheduled or unscheduled leave taken by the employee during that period. The probationary period may be extended by agreement between ANA and WBNG. Unless WBNG agrees otherwise, the probationary period will only be extended if written evaluations are done in a timely manner, and the employee had opportunity to correct unsatisfactory work.
22.2	Early in the probationary period, each probationary employee and his or her supervisor will discuss and agree upon goals for the employee for the probationary period in accordance with current ANA procedure. These goals will be used, along with other evaluation criteria, in evaluating the employee’s performance. Each probationary employee will be given a written evaluation of the employee’s performance at approximately forty-five (45) day intervals following the employee’s starting date. The evaluation will emphasize the need for ongoing communication between the supervisor and employee as part of the process to help ensure the successful completion of the probationary period. If a probationary employee does not receive an evaluation within the time periods specified in this Section, the employee may file a grievance to compel an evaluation.
22.3	Probationary employees may not utilize the grievance and arbitration procedures set forth in this Agreement and may be disciplined, up to and including discharge, at the sole discretion of ANA. Written discipline generally will be given in a meeting with the employee, an ANA representative, and a WBNG representative, if requested by the employee. In the event that ANA chooses to terminate a probationary employee, the employee will have the option to respond to the termination in a meeting including the employee, Human Resources Director and WBNG representative, if requested by the employee.

ARTICLE 23.	WORK SCHEDULES
23.1	ANA has the right to determine ANA’s hours of operation and to establish the “basic work schedule”. Except as provided below, all employees will be scheduled to work the basic work schedule. Any other schedule will be considered an “alternative work schedule”.
23.2	ANA and WBNG recognize that in some circumstances, alternative work schedules may serve the interests of both ANA and employees. ANA and WBNG realize to accomplish the mission a cooperative, collaborative work environment and employee satisfactions are highly important to ensuring effective, quality performance.
February 15, 2015	21	February 14, 2018
23.3	a. It is ANA’s intention to allow employees who currently work alternative schedules to continue to work those schedules, provided however, that ANA retains the right to change an employee’s schedule based on operational considerations.
b.	ANA will consider the request of any other employee to work an alternative work schedule. Such request will be reviewed at the department level by the employee and his or her supervisor. ANA will review the proposed schedule and provide an answer within fifteen (15) working days. If ANA does not respond within the fifteen (15) working days, the employee may file a grievance to compel a response. If the request is denied, the employee can propose additional alternative work schedules.
c.	Compressed Work Week
It is not the intention of a compressed work week schedule to impede the operational and organizational functions of ANA. Rather it is hoped that a compressed work week schedule will give employees some additional control of their schedule and life. For a compressed work week program to work it will require the cooperation of employees within a department to ensure proper coverage. Management agrees to seriously consider all requests and evaluate them based on the work needs of the department. ANA shall respond to such requests within ten (10) business days. Requests shall not be unreasonably or arbitrarily denied.
1.	Employees can request the option of working an extended work day for five (5) days one week and four (4) days the other week of a pay period. Non-exempt employees will not be regularly scheduled for more than 36.25 hours per week to avoid overtime charges.
If the employee fails to work the agreed upon hours the compressed work schedule may be terminated by manager.
2.	Some departments may be unable to offer compressed work weeks for some positions and/or during certain times of the year.
3.	A fixed schedule must be selected for a period of time at least four (4) weeks in duration. It is understood that, to ensure proper coverage not all employees will be permitted to have a three (3) day weekend. It is up to the department staff and manager requesting a compressed workweek to determine who will take which days off and guarantee coverage. In the event too many staff want the same day off and are unable to reach agreement, seniority will determine who gets the desired day off. After the four (4) week duration the next most senior staff member may rotate into the desired schedule, and so on. All schedules must take the operational needs of the association into consideration.
4.	Employees, in cooperation with their managers, will be responsible for attempting to resolve any problem that a compressed work week may create in terms of workload and days off within the department.
5.	Staff members in their probationary period of a new job may not participate in
February 15, 2015	22	February 14, 2018
compressed work weeks to assure appropriate training and interaction with others in the association.
6.	An employee must not have been disciplined for twelve (12) months prior to implementation of compressed work week. Exceptions may be granted if management feels an alternative work schedule would resolve reason for discipline.
7.	Managers must ensure that appropriate meal and rest periods are observed.
8.	Compressed work schedules will be built around critical organization/ operational procedures and needs.
9.	Trading days off is permitted, with at least two (2) days’ advance notice to and approval of the supervisor, when issues arise that keep the employee from being off on his or her regularly scheduled day. Any ANA request that an employee change a day off will be made at least two (2) days in advance, except in cases of emergency.
10.	If a holiday falls on an employee’s scheduled day off during a compressed work week the employee may discuss with the supervisor in advance when an alternative day may be taken within the same pay period. If operational needs will not allow an alternate day to be taken, the compressed work week schedule will be suspended for that individual during that pay period.
11.	Sick and/or vacation leave taken during a compressed work week schedule will be taken in accordance with Article 35 (Authorized Leave), Sections 35.2 and 35.3 of this Agreement. However, leave will be deducted from their respective leave banks for the number of hours that the employee was scheduled to work that day.
12.	Compressed work week schedules are granted on a department or individual basis. Employees transferring jobs/departments are not guaranteed a compressed work week in their new position.
13.	Managers may suspend or terminate all or some compressed work week schedules within the department if necessary for valid business/operational needs. Compressed work weeks will not be suspended or terminated unreasonably or arbitrarily. Employees working under a compressed work schedule may terminate the schedule at their option and return to a standard work schedule.
23.4 Telecommuting
ANA considers telecommuting to be a viable alternative work arrangement in cases where an individual, job and/or project are best suited to such arrangements. Telecommuting is defined as a flexible work arrangement that allows an employee to work at home or in a satellite location instead of traveling to ANA for part of their regular workweek. It is not an entitlement or a company-wide benefit and in no way changes the terms and conditions of employment at ANA. ANA will designate positions as either “eligible” or “not eligible” for telecommuting, according to established criteria. In accordance with this:
a.	Employees who are best suited for telecommuting are those who meet the following criteria:
(1)	the position held is eligible and the work in progress is conducive to telecommuting;
February 15, 2015	23	February 14, 2018
(2)	is a full time employee or works at least 30 hours per week;
(3)	is performing at a satisfactory or better level;
(4)	has been employed with the Enterprise for 90 days or more and is not in a probationary period.
b.	Either the staff member or a manager can suggest telecommuting as a possible work arrangement.
(1)	The manager and the employee discuss the employee’s suitability and proposed telecommuting schedule - taking into account departmental needs and other employees’ telecommuting schedules and work requirements:
a.	The employee and manager agree on a tentative telecommuting schedule
b.	The manager will specify the number of days of telecommuting allowed each week, the work schedule the staff member will customarily maintain, and the manner and frequency of communication. The employee agrees to be accessible by phone, text, email or messaging system during the agreed schedule
(2)	Employees wishing to participate in the telecommuting program must sign the Telecommuting Form (see Appendix C)
(3)	The manager and the employee will meet regularly to discuss the continued suitability and workability of the telecommuting schedule.
c.	Although a position may be designated as eligible for telecommuting, some departments may be unable to offer telecommuting during certain times of the year or as determined by the supervisor based on his/her assessment of business needs.
d.	Generally, an employee will not be scheduled to regularly telecommute more than one day per week, unless otherwise directed by ANA to meet a business need.
e.	Telecommuting can be informal, such as working from home for a short-term project. All informal arrangements are made on a case by case basis focusing first on the business needs of ANA.
f.	Telecommuters are expected to attend on-site meetings and enterprise-wide meetings in person, as required by management. When onsite presence is not required, management will enable remote access to meetings, e.g. conference call, virtual meeting platform.
g.	Technology needed to perform the job off site must be available and consistently reliable to enable productivity. When technology or systems are not functioning or are unavailable, telecommuters will be expected to work in the office, as deliverables and /or productivity will not be compromised because of an off-site technology or systems failure.
h.	Telecommuting days are considered the same as work days. All telecommuters are expected to be at their approved telecommuting work sites and performing work tasks during their regular scheduled work hours, just as if they were working onsite at ANA. Telecommuters are required to check their voice mail and e-mail at least every two (2) hour intervals and to respond to messages in a timely fashion. Telecommuters will be available by e-mail and by phone to supervisors, other staff, and customers during their workday without interruption to service. ANA will reimburse for any reasonable phone charges incurred by the employee on behalf of ANA. Telecommuting employees are encouraged to use the ANA 800 numbers or
February 15, 2015
24
February 14, 2018
ANA supplied electronic communication such as Jabber or the equivalent to avoid additional costs.
i.	Failure to accomplish work assignments or assigned tasks may result in denial of future telecommuting requests and/or termination of telecommuting privileges and may also result in other disciplinary action or performance based action appropriate to the situation consistent with ANA’s policies and procedures.
j.	Telecommuters will be subject to all the rules and regulations of ANA policies and procedures regarding security and confidentiality for the computer, data and information, and any other information handled in the course of work.
k.	Telecommuting will be built around critical organization/operational procedures and needs.
l.	Telecommuting employees agree not to hold ANA liable for any hazards caused by working from home, including the establishment of a safe work area and the use of ergonomically appropriate furniture and equipment. The agreement between ANA and the employee will impose a duty on the employee to act with reasonable care while working from home and the employee will be liable to all third parties for any injury that may occur in the employee’s home. In the event the employee is injured while working at home or other approved telecommuting location, he/she will promptly inform the Human Resources Department of the injury.
m.	Non-exempt telecommuting employees will punch in using ANA’s electronic timekeeping system at the beginning of their workday and will punch out at the end of their workday. Overtime will be governed by Article 37 (Compensation), Section 37.2.
n.	Participation in a telecommuting program is offered only with the understanding that it is the
responsibility of the employee to ensure a proper work environment is maintained. ANA and the employee need to determine the limits of the job site within the home. This site would be where the employee’s office equipment and work supplies are located. This site will be documented between the employee and ANA. ANA is neither responsible nor liable for providing or maintaining a home office site.
o.	Telecommuting is not a substitute for lack of paid time off, dependent care, and telecommuters must make regular dependent care arrangements.
p.	Telecommuters’ primary focus during the workday will be ANA work.
q.	Administrative leave generally will not be granted to telecommuters due to natural and other emergencies, including inclement weather unless the natural or other emergency compromises the telecommuter’s infrastructure. Telecommuters will be expected to perform their normal functions on days when the office is closed due to natural and other emergencies. If a telecommuter must take the day off because of dependent care or other reasons, the telecommuter will use his/her paid leave and will make a request to do so to his/her supervisor according to standard procedures. If not scheduled to telecommute on a day when the office is closed, the telecommuter will follow the telework guidance in Article 35.10 (Office Closures: Administrative Leave).
r.	Employees telecommuting will use only ANA issued computers.
February 15, 2015
25
February 14, 2018
s.	Managers may suspend or terminate all or some telecommuting within the department if necessary for valid business/operational needs. If possible, ANA will provide notice if telecommuting is cancelled but there may be times when no notice is possible.
t.	Telecommuters must acknowledge that they are responsible for applying for whatever permits or licenses necessary in their state, county or local jurisdiction.
u.	Employees who become telecommuters for more than one day a week may be required to relinquish use of a personal office or workstation in favor of a shared arrangement to meet organizational needs.
23.	5 ANA will consider any employee request for a temporary alternative work schedule. ANA will have the discretion to grant any such request.
23.	6 When operational needs warrant, ANA can require an employee to work an alternative work schedule.
23.	7 ANA will notify WBNG of any change in the basic work schedule.
23.	8 For non-exempt employees, all shifts will allow a fifteen (15) minute break per three and one-half (3 ^) hours of work and an unpaid lunch period of forty-five (45) minutes. At the employee’s option, one of the breaks may be taken immediately before or immediately after the lunch period, so that the employee has, in effect, a one (1) hour lunch period. Neither break may be taken at the very beginning or the very end of the workday.
ARTICLE 24.	WORKLOAD
24.1	ANA and WBNG agree that workloads will be reasonable and appropriate but may vary according to circumstances. Increased workloads shall be limited to 30 consecutive calendar days and limited to no more than four (4) increased workload periods total in one calendar year.

ANA reserves the right to institute a reasonable time-keeping system. Prior to implementing such a system, ANA will discuss the method of time-keeping with WBNG at a Labor-Management Committee meeting.
ARTICLE 26.	SENIORITY
26.1	Seniority will be computed in daily increments, from the most recent date of employment with ANA, and, except as provided in Section 27.6, below, represents the employee’s length of continuous service within the bargaining unit.
February 15, 2015
26
February 14, 2018
26.2	Seniority will accrue during periods of paid vacation and sick leave and other leaves with pay. Seniority will not accrue during periods of layoff. However, for those employees who were employed prior to 1992, seniority will be calculated based on the original date of hire, regardless of breaks of service for the period to January 1, 1992.
26.3	Seniority accrual will cease and all accrued seniority will be forfeited when:
a.	an employee resigns from ANA;
b.	an employee is discharged for just cause;
c.	an employee on layoff fails to respond to a recall notice within the time periods or in the manner specified in Article 33 (Layoff and Recall);
d.	the recall rights of an employee on layoff expire;
e.	an employee is absent from work for three (3) consecutive work days without notifying
ANA unless the employee has a valid reason justifying the failure to notify ANA;
f.	an employee who is discharged and then reinstated by an arbitrator fails to report to work within five (5) work days after the employee’s receipt of a notice of reinstatement or within fifteen (15) work days after ANA sends a notice of reinstatement to the last address furnished to ANA by the employee, whichever is sooner; or
g.	an employee, without authorization, fails to return on the next work day following disciplinary suspension.
26.4	An employee whose seniority has been forfeited will be credited for purposes of vacation accrual rate with the seniority he or she had prior to forfeiture and will be re-credited with up to ten (10) days of forfeited accrued sick leave when:
a.	the employee is re-employed by ANA within twelve (12) months after forfeiture of seniority; or
b.	the employee is re-employed after resigning from ANA to accept employment with a C/SNA or M SD without any break in employment.
26.5	An employee who returns to or becomes a p art o f th e bargaining unit from a nonbargaining unit position without any break in ANA employment will be credited for all purposes with the seniority the employee had prior to leaving and/or joining the bargaining unit. In addition, the employee will be given seniority credit for all purposes for the time worked in the non- bargaining unit position, and will retain any accrued leave.
26.6	An employee with no prior ANA employment who is hired by ANA directly from a C/SNA or Multi-State Division (MSD) will be credited for purposes of vacation accrual rate with the number of years of continuous service with the_C/SNA or MSD.
26.7	Part-time employees will receive seniority pro-rata.
February 15, 2015
27
February 14, 2018
26.8	An employee who has forfeited seniority will not be re-accredited with that seniority for competitive purposes or for any other purpose other than vacation accrual rate, in accordance with Sections 26.4 -26.6, above.
ARTICLE 27.	JOB VACANCIES AND TRANSFERS
ANA and WBNG recognize the importance of seniority and the desirability of filling vacancies by promotion or transfer. ANA and WBNG further agree that it is in the interests of ANA to assist employees with career growth at ANA and to provide those employees who are not selected for promotions or transfers, knowledge of those areas in which further growth and development are needed.
27.1	The term ‘vacancy’ includes an opening in an existing position under this Agreement or an opening resulting from the creation of a new position under this Agreement. “Job” means a position within the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement.
27.2	ANA will meet with WBNG on request to discuss ANA’s intention as to the filling, leaving vacant, abolishing, or reclassifying a vacant position.
27.3	When ANA decides to fill a vacancy it will inform the WBNG in a timely manner.
27.4	ANA will post on the HR Board in the employee lounge and the ANA intranet once it is established and the HR section has been launched a notice of each vacancy it decides to fill. ANA will notify field staff by first-class mail, facsimile and/or E-mail bulletin board. Such notice will remain posted for a period of ten (10) working days. Applications for the posted position will be made in writing to the Human Resources office within that ten (10) day posting period. Other recruitment activities, including advertising on the outside, may occur concurrently with the ten day posting.
27.5	All new positions, including non-bargaining unit positions, created will be sent to WBNG with the HR department defined unit determination and, if a bargaining unit position, salary grade. If WBNG disagrees with the unit determination or salary grade, WBNG may refer the matter to the Position Review Committee (See Article 38 Salary Administration Policies) for review.
27.6	Job postings will specify the minimum qualifications for the job (e.g., experience, education, certification and skills).
27.7	Internal Candidates
a.	Qualified internal candidates will be interviewed by HR and considered for the vacancy before external candidates are interviewed.
b.	Only the ANA Human Resources Department (HR) shall be responsible for notifying all internal candidates of their selection or non-selection for ANA positions and whether an internal or external candidate was selected. HR shall offer employees the option of being told of the decision on their application either by telephone or by a face-to-face meeting with the appropriate HR staff person.
c.	An internal candidate who has not been selected shall have an opportunity for a meeting
February 15, 2015	28	February 14, 2018
with HR for further information as to why the candidate was not selected and/or to receive counseling on areas needing further development and growth. Furthermore, HR shall inform the internal candidate of this option.
d.	Any employee shall have the opportunity to meet with HR to discuss training and development opportunities available to the employee.
27.8	Employees will remain in a position for six (6) months before transferring to a new position. This provision may be waived by ANA at its discretion. .
27.9	When a job has changed as a result of different and/or additional duties and is releveled to a higher level, the incumbent may be promoted without need to post the newly leveled position, even if the job description is modified to reflect not only the different and/or additional duties but also a different title. If there are multiple incumbents of a job, and only one person’s position is affected by a releveling due to different and/or additional duties, the other incumbents do not receive a promotion. However, if multiple incumbents of a job all experience different and/or additional duties that call for releveling at a higher level, all incumbents may be promoted without need to post the newly leveled job or positions. The Human Resources Department will inform WBNG of the changes that will be made prior to implementation, and the WBNG may refer any unresolved issues to the Position Review Committee.
27.10	In filling vacancies, ANA will give due weight to the applicants’ general experience, related job experience, past performance at ANA, if any, ANA training, education, skills, accomplishments, length of service with ANA, if any, and other relevant factors. ANA recognizes the desirability, where appropriate, of promoting or transferring from ANA staff. ANA and WBNG will make efforts to increase the number of bargaining unit employees who apply for and are awarded posted positions. The joint Labor-Management Committee will provide oversight of the progress made toward this goal.
a.	Where the qualifications of an internal and an external candidate are substantially equal, the internal candidate will be awarded the position.
b.	Where the qualifications of two or more bargaining unit employees are substantially equal, the employee with the greatest seniority will be awarded the position.
c.	Where the qualifications of a bargaining unit employee and a non-bargaining unit employee are substantially equal, the employee with the greatest length of service at ANA will be awarded the position.
27.11	The fact that an employee has received cross-training for a particular job does not necessarily imply that the employee is qualified for that job or would receive the job should there be a vacancy that ANA chooses to fill, but the successful completion of training shall be considered as a factor in filling a vacancy.
27.12	Once a position is awarded, except in extraordinary circumstances, the employee will be moved to that position within two weeks. If ANA does not move the employee within the two (2) week period, the employee will be paid at the pay rate of the new position, if higher than his or her current pay rate, beginning at the conclusion of the two (2) week period.
27.13	If the employee is involuntarily transferred to a lower-grade position, the employee will retain the
February 15, 2015	29	February 14, 2018
pay rate for the position previously held. The employee’s pay rate will be maintained until the maximum pay rate for the new position exceeds the employee’s current pay rate. This subsection does not apply to disciplinary demotions. ANA may deny a request for a voluntary transfer to a lower-graded position because of the pay rate to which the employee would be entitled to under this subsection.
27.14	An employee who is involuntarily transferred to another position may bid on any posted vacancy.
27.15	Employees will serve a probationary period of two months when they move into a vacancy under his Article. If, during that period, the employee, in the opinion of ANA, fails to perform satisfactorily the duties of the new position, the employee will be removed from that position and will: a) be permitted to return to his or her prior position if that position is vacant, b) be permitted to apply for any posted position or permitted to move to a posted or vacant position by agreement between ANA and WBNG, c) if his or her prior position has been filled, be returned to that position so long as there is a comparable position available for the incumbent, provided the incumbent is qualified for the comparable position, or d) unless ANA and WBNG agree on a mutually agreeable alternative, be laid off. These options shall be implemented sequentially. ANA and the employee will discuss the employee’s performance after the first month of the probationary period.
27.16	ANA will consider any request by an employee within the first month of the probationary period to return to the position from which promoted or transferred. In the event ANA agrees to the return, the employee will receive the salary that he or she would have received had the employee not been promoted or transferred.
27.17	Recruitment and Retention
ANA will provide to WBNG on an annual basis the following information regarding recruiting and retention of bargaining unit members: Vacancies, posted positions, positions on hold, promotions from within the bargaining unit, turnover rate, and summary of HR exit interviews.
27.18	Temporary Assignments
a.	If an employee is temporarily assigned for more than one (1) week to a higher-grade vacant position or to a higher-grade position of another employee who is on extended leave, the employee will be paid at the rate of the temporary position. If the assignment is to a lower-grade position, the employee will be paid at his or her current rate.
b.	If an employee is temporarily assigned for more than one (1) week to a vacant nonbargaining unit position or to a position of a non-bargaining unit staff member who is on extended leave, the employee’s pay rate will not be reduced.
c.	If a vacancy or workload realignment within a department results in a workload increase in excess of 20% of employee (s) job description for more than one month, the employee shall be paid a premium of 10% of the annual base salary or hourly wage effective as of the date the increased work began.
February 15, 2015

February 14, 2018
ARTICLE 28.	JOB SHARE
28.1	ANA will consider any requests by employees for job sharing. Job sharing will be defined as two (2) or more employees sharing the responsibilities of one (1) full-time position.
28.2	ANA will have the discretion to approve job share requests based on operational needs. Job sharing arrangements will be in writing and the terms will be negotiated with WBNG to the extent different from the provisions of this Article.
28.3	Employees who job share and work at least half of the normal workweek (36.25 hours) will receive the following benefits on a pro rata basis as if they were working twenty (20) hours per week:
a.	seniority (vacation);
b.	pension benefits to the extent allowed by the Plan Documents governing ANA’s pension plans; and
c.	insurance benefits to the extent inclusion of the employees in the benefit plans will not result in additional cost to ANA.
28.4	All other benefits will be provided in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement governing such benefits.
ARTICLE 29.	SUBCONTRACTING
29.1	In the event ANA is considering contracting out bargaining unit work, managers will first consider and discuss with department staff, assigning the work to current staff. Factors to be considered include whether there are workload considerations that preclude assigning the work to current staff or whether the employee’s current workload may be temporarily adjusted or reprioritized to accommodate the assignment.
29.2	ANA and WBNG agree that layoffs are to be avoided if at all possible and only to be used as a last resort. Layoffs under this article will be considered only because of financial or operational necessity. Before making any final subcontracting decision that will result in a layoff of an employee, ANA will discuss the matter with WBNG and will afford WBNG the opportunity to suggest any alternative action. ANA will give consideration to any such suggestions before making a final decision.
29.3	As provided in Article 37 (Compensation) of this Agreement, ANA retains the right to require non-exempt employees to work overtime. In addition, in the event ANA is considering subcontract to meet a temporary increase in workload or deadlines that cannot be accommodated by other employees as part of their workload, ANA will first consider requests by any nonexempt employee interested in performing and qualified to perform the work as overtime. ANA retains the discretion to determine whether the overtime request will be granted. Subcontractors shall not be used to deny overtime to non-exempt employees.
29.4	Before subcontracting any work of two (2) weeks or more, ANA will offer that work to February 15, 2015	31	February 14, 2018
employees on layoff who are qualified to perform the work.
29.5	Except as limited by this Article, ANA retains the right to subcontract work, out source and/or procure outsiders to render services (collectively “subcontract”) when, in ANA’s business judgment, such subcontracting is in ANA’s best interest.
29.6	Any disputes regarding the enforcement of this Agreement will be settled in accordance with the provisions of the negotiated grievance and arbitration procedures.
ARTICLE 30.	PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS
30.1	It is the intent of ANA and WBNG to have an ongoing employee performance evaluation process.
30.2	Probationary employees will receive evaluations as provided in Article 22 (Probationary Period).
30.3	All employees who have completed their probationary period will receive a written evaluation at least once a year. As part of the yearly evaluation process, each employee and his or her supervisor will discuss and agree upon goals for the employee for the following year in accordance with current ANA procedure. These goals will be used, along with other evaluation criteria, in evaluating the employee’s performance.
30.4	Evaluation criteria will be set forth in a written form that has been discussed in the LaborManagement Committee. Through the Labor-Management Committee, WBNG will have input into the content of the evaluation form, but the final decision as to its content will rest with ANA, and will not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure. Written evaluations will be discussed with each employee and each employee will receive a copy of the evaluation and will sign the evaluation to indicate that he/she has read it. In addition, each employee will have the opportunity to make a written response. Both the evaluation and response shall be placed in each employee’s personnel file in the Human Resources Office.
30.5	Evaluations will not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure. Unsatisfactory areas of an employee’s evaluation shall be discussed by the supervisor and employee, and the supervisor may develop an improvement plan in consultation with the employee, and, as appropriate, develop training strategies. The improvement plan shall specify time lines, feedback and re-evaluation. If ANA imposes discipline upon the employee based on conduct or p erformanc e described in the evaluation, such discipline will be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.
30.6	Training in performance development and evaluation will be developed by the Labor-Management Committee to include goal setting, how to write objectives, and performance measurement.
30.7	Upon written request to Human Resources by an employee a Human Resources representative will be present during the evaluation review process.
ARTICLE 31.	DISCIPLINE
31.1	ANA has the right to discharge, suspend, or otherwise discipline any employee for just cause. Just
February 15, 2015	32	February 14, 2018
cause shall include the failure to perform at the level of competency and application needed to do a good job in the position held.
31.2	All disciplines shall be in writing. A copy of all disciplines shall be provided to WBNG and the Director of Human Resources.
31.3	No discipline shall be administered unless the employee has been offered the opportunity to have a WBNG representative present.
31.4	Generally, counseling between supervisors and employees will occur before written discipline and will include verbal and written communication. Discipline will be progressive and corrective rather than punitive. Counseling sessions shall include discussion related to how the employee can improve his or her conduct and/or performance. Disciplinary sessions may include formulation of an improvement plan. Where appropriate, training will be offered or required. The parties recognize that there is misconduct or a failure of acceptable performance that is sufficiently serious to warrant immediate discharge without prior warning or prior discipline.
31.5	Discipline shall be administered as soon as practicable after discovery of the incident or situation for which the employee is being disciplined.
31.6	Written discipline generally will be given in a meeting with the employee, up to two (2) ANA representatives, and up to two (2) WBNG representatives, if requested by the employee.
31.7	All notices of discipline imposed on an employee will be included in the employee’s personnel file in Human Resources, but, upon the request of the employee, written reprimands will be removed from the file twelve (12) months after the date of the discipline and more severe discipline will be removed after eighteen (18) months after the date of the discipline so long as no further disciplinary action has been taken against the employee during that time period. Upon request of the employee, Human Resources will confirm that discipline has been removed.
ARTICLE 32.	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
32.1	Grievance Defined
a.	A ‘grievance’ is an allegation by ANA, WBNG or one or more employees that there has been a violation of a provision of this Agreement, or that ANA has arbitrarily or capriciously failed to comply with its own work rules or policies.
b.	All grievances shall identify the specific issues being grieved, and, when applicable, the Article or Articles of this Agreement involved and set forth in detail the specific nature of the alleged violation and the remedy requested. No grievance shall be denied merely because WBNG, through typographical error, failed to state the correct Article or Articles of this Agreement involved.
c.	For purposes of this Article, when ANA is the grievant, ‘ANA’ will be deemed to be substituted for the ‘employee’ or ‘WBNG’, and the ‘the Unit Chair of WBNG’ or ‘WBNG’ will be substituted for ‘supervisor’, ‘manager’, ‘ANA representative’, ‘Human Resources Officer’, and ‘Executive Director’ as appropriate.
February 15, 2015
33
February 14, 2018
32.2	Policy
ANA and WBNG agree that it is in the interest of both parties for grievances to be raised promptly and to be resolved informally whenever possible.

32.3	Procedure
a.	Any grievance must be filed by an employee or the union in writing with HR within (30) calendar days after the date the employee knew or reasonably should have known of the fact(s) or event(s) upon which the grievance is based.

j.	Step 2
If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, WBNG or the employee may submit the grievance to Step 2 by sending written notice to the Director of Human Resources within fifteen (15) calendar days of the Step 1 response. Within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the notice, the Human Resources Officer, and, if ANA chooses, an additional ANA representative will meet with the employee and up to two (2) WBNG representatives in an attempt to resolve the grievance. Within fifteen (15) calendar days of that meeting, the Human Resources Officer will provide the employee, steward and WBNG with a written response.
k.	Step 3
If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2, and Article 32.3.f applies, WBNG may submit the grievance to Step 3 by sending written notice to HR within fifteen (15) calendar days of the Step 2 response. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice by HR, the CEO or his/her designee, provided that the designee is a Chief Executive who has not been involved in the previous steps and, if the CEO chooses, another ANA representative, will meet with the employee and up to two (2) WBNG representatives in an attempt to resolve the grievance. Within fifteen (15) calendar days of that meeting, the executive will provide the employee, steward and WBNG with a written response.
l.	Arbitration
(1)	If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2 or Step 3 as explained above, WBNG will have the right to submit the grievance to arbitration. Notice of intent to arbitrate will be given by the party seeking arbitration within thirty (30) calendar days following the denial of the grievance at Step 2 or Step 3.
(2)	ANA and WBNG will build a list of mutually agreeable arbitrators from the Washington, D.C. area from which to choose. If, however, the list has not been compiled or no arbitrator is agreeable to both parties, the parties will request a list of D.C. area arbitrators from the American Arbitration Association. From this list the arbitrator will be selected through and in accordance with the procedures of the American Arbitration Association. The cost of obtaining the panel will be shared equally by ANA and WBNG.
(3)	The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
(4)	All fees and expenses of the arbitrator will be shared equally between ANA and WBNG.
February 15, 2015
35
February 14, 2018
(5)	The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on ANA, the grievant(s), and WBNG.
(6)	The Arbitrator will not have the power to add to, subtract from, or change any terms or provisions of the Agreement.

c.	Generally, no post-hearing briefs will be filed. However, in a case which either WBNG or ANA considers to be particularly significant or precedent-setting, WBNG and/or ANA may file a letter/brief within twenty-one (21) days of the close of the hearing.
d.	The arbitrator will issue a decision within fifteen (15) calendar days following the date of the hearing or the filing of briefs, if any. Such decision will include a brief opinion setting forth the factual and/or legal basis for the decision.
(8)	Once a grievance has been filed for arbitration, all meetings with ANA and the grievant will include the grievant’s WBNG representative.
m.	If a grievance is not appealed to the next higher step in the manner and within the time limit specified herein, the grievance will be considered resolved at the previous step. n. If ANA or, where appropriate, WBNG, fails to respond to a grievance in the manner and within the time limits specified herein, the grievance may be pursued to the next step, as if the grievance had been denied on the last day of the applicable response period.
32.4	Any time limit set forth in this Article may be extended by mutual agreement of ANA and WBNG.
32.5	Grievance and arbitration hearings will be handled during regular work hours with no loss of pay to the WBNG representatives and grievant.

32.6	All outside WBNG grievance-related investigations will be governed and conducted by the WBNG grievance representative and the WBNG unit chair or vice chairs.
ARTICLE 33.	LAYOFF AND RECALL
Preamble ANA and WBNG agree that layoffs are to be avoided if at all possible and only to be used as a
February 15, 2015	36	February 14, 2018
last resort. Retraining of employees to be laid off is desirable in order to retain them.
In the event of financial or operational necessity, the following procedures for lay-off and recall will apply.
33.1	ANA will provide annually to WBNG a list of budgeted bargaining unit positions (FTE’s) by department and name of incumbent. This list will include vacancies and posted positions (jobs in recruitment).
33.2	Layoff
a.	In the event ANA determines that a reduction in the workforce, elimination of jobs and/or downsizing is necessary, ANA will determine, by seniority, based on its operational needs, which jobs and/or positions are to be affected.
b.	ANA will give WBNG and the affected employees sixty (60) calendar days written notice of any planned reduction in workforce, elimination of positions, and/or downsizing, specifying the number of employees and the names and titles of such employees. Upon request, WBNG will have the opportunity to suggest alternative actions.
c.	ANA, at its option, may reduce or eliminate the notice period for the affected employees and, in lieu of notice, pay the employee his or her regular salary for the period by which the notice is reduced.
d.	To the extent ANA gives an employee pay in lieu of notice, that amount will be paid in a lump sum, and the employee will cease to be an active employee as of the end of the last day actually worked. If the employee chooses to continue health care coverage under the Comprehensive Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ("COBRA"), for the period of time corresponding to the period of pay in lieu of notice, ANA will pay the amount of the employer’s share of the premium, to be applied to the COBRA payment.
33.3	Bumping
a.	An employee who receives a notice of layoff will have the right to bump any less senior person
in the same or lower grade, provided that the bumping employee has the qualifications and specialty expertise, if any, required for the job or can become qualified with training appropriate to the job and ANA’s operational needs for that job.
b.	The employee who is bumped in a. above will have the right to bump any less senior person for the same or lower grade in a job for which the bumping employee has the qualifications and specialty expertise, if any, required for the job or can become qualified with training appropriate to the job and ANA’s operational needs for that job.
c.	Notice of intent to exercise the right to bump must be given to ANA not later than seven (7) days after the employee received the notice of layoff. ANA will immediately notify the bumped employee and WBNG.
d.	The employee who is bumped in b. above will have no bumping rights.
33.4	Reduction in Hours
February 15, 2015
37
February 14, 2018
When ANA determines, as a result of business or operational need, that a reduction in hours is necessary, the following procedures will apply.
a.	ANA will make a reasonable and ongoing effort to find additional work for the employee affected to complete a full time equivalent (FTE). The replacement work will occur with a continuation of the employee’s grade and full salary.
b.	If the replacement work is not acceptable to the employee, the employee will have the option of choosing to terminate employment at ANA with full severance pay as per Article 34 (Severance and Out Placement Counseling) or the employee may choose to continue at the reduced hours.
c.	The use of this clause will be solely for legitimate business or operational need.
33.5	Recall
a.	Employees will be on layoff status for up to one (1) year from the effective date of the layoff, which will be the date the employee is separated from active employment with ANA. Employees will have recall rights for the period of time the employee is on layoff status. Employees on layoff are responsible for ensuring that ANA has their current address.
b.	In the event ANA decides to refill a position, it will offer the position to the most senior employee still on layoff status in the same classification who, in ANA’s judgment, has the ability and qualifications to fulfill the duties of the position.

ARTICLE 38.	SALARY ADMINISTRATION POLICIES
OVERVIEW
It is the intent of the American Nurses Association (ANA) and the Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild-Association Staff Union (WBNG) to establish and maintain a set of policies that will result in paying employees fairly and competitively in accordance with the skills and the degrees of responsibility required in their jobs. These policies are determined and implemented through the collective bargaining process and publicized through established salary grades with salary ranges for both exempt and non-exempt employees, as well as other defined processes and procedures. The salary grades provide for different rates of pay for jobs requiring different degrees of responsibility, experience, skills and knowledge.
February 15, 2015
54
February 14, 2018
OBJECTIVES
1.	To establish an impartial and systematic basis for relating pay to job responsibilities and requirements.
2.	To develop competitive pay practices that will attract, retain and motivate collective bargaining unit employees.
3.	To institute and maintain salary administration policies which are consistent with the collective bargaining agreement and applicable laws and encourage internal equity and consistency.
4.	To provide career growth and advancement opportunities.
5.	To administer a compensation program that is competitive with ANA’s labor market and industry.
DEFINITIONS
Salary Grade - a salary level assigned to a job which reflects the value of the job relative to the value of other jobs in the organization. The salary grade for a particular job is determined by the job evaluation process.
Salary Range - the span in dollars from minimum to maximum assigned to each salary grade,
Salary Structure - an array of salary grades showing the salary ranges of the grades and the jobs assigned to the grades.
Exempt Employees - bargaining unit employees who are exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Non-exempt Employees - bargaining unit employees who are subject to the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Promotion - occurs when a bargaining unit employee assumes a different job at a higher salary grade.
Lateral Transfer - occurs when a bargaining unit employee voluntarily moves to or is involuntarily assigned to a job carrying the same salary grade as his or her current job.
RESPONSIBILITY
The American Nurses Association and the Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild-Association Staff Union have overall responsibility for the implementation of these policies via their mutual collective bargaining agreement. ANA is responsible for setting the compensation system exclusive of commission-based positions and assigning jobs to grades. ANA and WBNG will collectively resolve any disagreements with the job assignments through the Position Review Committee.
February 15, 2015
55
February 14, 2018
GRIEVANCE
The compensation system exclusive of commission-based positions and the jobs assigned to each grade by the HR Department are not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure. However, disagreements regarding job assignments will be reviewed by the Position Review Committee and if issues remain unresolved, the Position Review Committee may meet with the CEO to help reach consensus.
NEW HIRE SALARY POLICY
The starting salary for a job will be determined and communicated to the applicant by the ANA Human Resources department. Starting salaries for new hires will be determined by the grade and compensation levels of the job being filled, and the individual’s qualifications for the job, and the salary relationship to other employees in that salary grade. Starting salaries for individual(s) with the required minimum qualifications should be between the minimum and the midpoint of the range. Starting salaries for individuals with directly related qualifications over and above the minimum qualifications may be over the midpoint with written notification submitted to WBNG within ten (10) days of hiring the new employee. Internal equity in relation to the salary(s) of a current employee(s) in the same job with similar expertise and experience and whose performance is satisfactory, will be analyzed and reviewed by the ANA Human Resources Department, which will inform the Position Review Committee.
EVALUATION OF EXISTING OR NEW JOBS POLICY
It is the responsibility of ANA to assign and determine the job content and the methods by which work is to be performed for any job. However, to encourage a cooperative working environment, the employees and their supervisors should discuss the content of the employee’s job at least once a year and assure that the job description is current and accurate. In those occasions when significant changes have occurred to the bargaining unit employee’s job, the manager in consultation with the employee will submit a jointly signed revised job description to ANA Human Resources for evaluation by a compensation specialist. Any change in pay will be communicated to the supervisor and WBNG in a timely manner.
If WBNG disagrees with either the unit determination or salary grade of a new or re-leveled unit position, WBNG may refer the position to the Position Review Committee for evaluation. The Position Review Committee will hold a special evaluation meeting as soon as is practical, however recruitment for open positions will not be delayed.
The Position Review Committee will attempt to resolve all issues by consensus. In the event an issue is unresolved within ten (10) working days, the Committee will inform the Chief Executive Officer who will be the final arbiter of any unresolved issues exclusive of commissionbased positions.
SALARY STRUCTURE POLICY
The salary structure includes a salary scale, a salary range for each grade, and the jobs assigned to each grade. The salary scale includes a midpoint, minimum, maximum, and the first and third
February 15, 2015
56
February 14, 2018
quartiles for each grade. The salary range for each grade represents the difference between the minimum and the maximum points of each grade. Compensation for commission-based positions shall be bargained with WBNG. The parties shall use the following criteria: a market assessment for the job; a base pay and a commission plan that, when combined, provide total compensation that is reasonable for the position and within the range of the appropriate grade and pay level; a commission plan that is fair and attainable, provides an incentive for additional sales, and is designed to attract and retain experienced employees. Specifically, the commission-based structure / plan negotiations shall include:
•	A goal compensation rate for commissioned employees that reflects negotiated wage rates plus monthly commissions paid upon reaching 100% of the sales goal;
•	Negotiated commission rate for those employees who sell over goal;
•	Partial commission payment for employees who sell near goal but who do not fully achieve their sales goal in the event of mitigating circumstances, such as extended sick leave or cancellation of a seminar for which the commission-paid employee was making sales;
•	Negotiated wage rates above base rates for non-work time e.g. authorized leave;
•	Post-separation commission payment for departing employees based on sales prior to departure;
•	A negotiated process for goal-setting that includes advanced input from the impacted sales employee, enumerated standards of reasonableness, including an expressed ban on using revenue goals as a method to encourage an employee to leave the company: and an appeal procedure for challenging unreasonably set goals, including a right of arbitration;
•	A commitment to train sales staff in noted areas, to expand sales support (kit, sales flyer, rates) and to improve internal procedures to minimize non-sales work, as appropriate;
A comprehensive sales program for each job category, which codifies the entire compensation structure for base salary, commissions, jurisdiction (e.g., if more than one incumbent of the job does sales, which employee sells what product or in what geographic area), goals, and metrics.
PROMOTION POLICY
A promotion occurs when a bargaining unit employee assumes a different job at a higher salary grade. The ANA Human Resources department will follow the “New Hire Salary” policy in determining an employee’s promotional increase into a higher grade. If it is a one (1) grade promotion, the minimum salary increase is 7.5%. If it is a two (2) grade promotion, the minimal increase is 10%. If it is a three (3) or more grade increase, the minimal increase is 12.5%.
TRANSFER POLICY
Transfer to Lateral Job
A lateral transfer occurs when a bargaining unit employee voluntarily moves to or is involuntarily assigned to a different job carrying the same salary grade as his or her current job. Employees who transfer laterally will retain the pay rate for the job previously held.
Transfer to a Lower Grade Job
A transfer to a lower job occurs when an employee moves from his or her current job to a job in a lower grade. If the transfer to a lower grade job is voluntary or involuntary, the employee will retain the pay rate for the job previously held. The employee’s pay rate will be maintained until February 15, 2015	57	February 14, 2018

ARTICLE 44.	EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

Information as to the individual employee will not be made available to managers, supervisors, or directors without the consent of the employee except as necessary to monitor compliance with any treatment program.
ARTICLE 45.	EDUCATION
ANA and WBNG share the goal of maximizing the contribution of all employees to fulfill the mission and plans of ANA and its subsidiaries, affiliates, and members. Thus, growth and development is expected of all employees and should come through various means, both formal and informal. To facilitate the accomplishment of this goal:
February 15, 2015
68
February 14, 2018
45.1	Orientation will be provided as detailed in Article 21 (Orientation) of this Agreement.
45.2	In-service Training
In-service training is voluntary and/or mandatory training provided by ANA primarily to address the needs of the organization, and will be provided and paid for by ANA as ANA deems necessary. ANA, in its discretion, has the right to determine the participants for any in-service training, provided, however, that inclusion in mandatory "All Staff" training of staff based in the field at ANA’s direction will be governed by paragraph 19 of the Field Staff Agreement. Given the nature of or importance to ANA of some training, ANA may require attendance by some or all employees for particular in-service training.
45.3	Cross-Training
a.	Cross-training is training that an employee receives in tasks other than those to which he or she is normally assigned. Employees will be expected to understand and be capable of accomplishing a variety of tasks not usually assigned to them. Therefore, cross-training will be encouraged where time allows and where it does not create a conflict for either the person receiving or giving the cross-training. Consistent with the foregoing, ANA may assign cross-training, and opportunities for cross-training will not be unreasonably denied to an employee seeking cross-training.
b.	A cross-training plan will be developed jointly by the supervisors and the employees involved.
45.4	Career Development
a.	Career development is training designed to enhance an individual employee’s professional development related to the work of ANA.
b.	ANA will provide five (5) days of paid educational leave for each employee’s attendance at and participation in outside career development activities of the employee’s choice. Non-exempt employees must use the leave in no less than one-half day increments.
(1)	Approval for such leave rests with the employee’s immediate supervisor.
(2)	Unused career development leave may not be carried over from year to year.
c.	Each employee is entitled to financial assistance for the cost of the training, including materials, or to supplement tuition assistance up to four hundred ($400) per year. An employee may also use this fund to join or maintain membership in the professional association of the employee’s choice provided that the professional association is job related or consistent with professional goals that will benefit ANA in the future as deemed so by the employee’s supervisor and HR. An employee’s unused funds under this section may be carried over for one (1) year with notification to HR by the end of the third quarter of the fiscal year. An employee may exercise this carryover option once during the life of this Agreement. By September 15th of each contract year unused funds up to $15,000 will be set aside for bargaining unit staff to use for additional, job related training. Staff requesting to use additional funds after September 15th of each year must have supervisor written approval and such requests will be generally granted on a first-come, first-serve basis with Human Resources making the final determination, in five (5)
February 15, 2015
69
February 14, 2018
business days, of fair distribution of these additional funds. Decisions about distribution of these additional funds are not subject to the grievance procedure.
d.	Such career development will only be provided for a non-probationary employee who has been at ANA for at least one year. It is understood that all career development activities will be scheduled at times that are mutually agreed upon by the employee and his or her supervisor. ANA may also provide for additional time off and/or financial assistance based on ANA’s needs.
e.	No employee is entitled to compensatory time for career development. However, an employee may substitute compensatory time for his or her five (5) days of paid educational leave for career development on non-work days.
45.5	Tuition Assistance
a.	Tuition assistance will be provided for any accredited undergraduate degree program, any accredited vocational or technical program, any undergraduate course from an accredited institution, and/or any graduate or post-graduate degree programs or courses from accredited institutions that relate to the work of ANA, subject to the limitations set forth below.
b.	An employee who wishes to enroll in course work outside of an accredited institution or accredited vocational/technical school may apply to the CEO or his/her designee, provided that the designee is a Chief Executive who is not the employee’s direct supervisor for approval of reimbursement. Such application will be made in writing, include a completed tuition assistance request form and must be made substantially in advance of any enrollment deadlines.
c.	Regular full-time employees will be reimbursed for one hundred percent (100%) of tuition and textbooks consistent with definitions used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax-qualified benefits, up to five thousand dollars ($5000) per employee per year, with a yearly maximum for all employees of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). If the full five thousand dollars and/or the full fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) is not used in a given year, the balance(s) will not be carried over to the following year.
d.	Such study will be undertaken by the employee outside the regular work hours, unless at the discretion of ANA, the study is of such significance that a reasonable degree of release time is justified.
e.	To be eligible for tuition assistance an employee must:
(1)	Be a non-probationary employee who has completed at least one (1) year of employment with ANA and whose last performance evaluation indicated that the employee meets or exceeds requirements for his or her job.
(2)	Enroll in the course after employment with ANA;
(3)	Provide written application, including name of course(s), amount of tuition, fees and books, and the name of the institution/school prior to enrollment;
February 15, 2015
70
February 14, 2018
(4)	Provide evidence of a “C” or better grade for undergraduate course work, or a “B” or better grade for graduate course work, or “Pass” for pass/fail course work; and
(5)	Provide a receipt documenting payment of tuition, fees and/or payment for books.
f.	ANA reserves the right to limit the number of courses for which an employee may seek tuition assistance if, in the judgment of ANA, the employee’s educational study interferes with the employee’s ability to render satisfactory performance. This does not preclude ANA from dealing with any performance problems through other means contractually available.
g.	As a condition of receiving tuition assistance, employees with fewer than five (5) years of service will agree in writing that if they voluntarily leave ANA’s employ, they will repay ANA for any tuition assistance received within the past year, and authorize ANA to deduct any such repayment from the employee’s final check(s). This repayment obligation does not apply to employees who voluntarily accept a layoff or who resign in lieu of termination of employment. Employees with five (5) years or more of service will not have to repay ANA for any tuition assistance received within the past year.
h.	At any time, the union may raise concerns about either the individual or overall limits for tuition reimbursement and management will consider raising those limits for subsequent budget years.
ARTICLE 46.	INTERNAL AFFAIRS
WBNG will endeavor to not interfere with or inject itself into the internal affairs of ANA, its subsidiaries and/or any C/SNA or MSD.
ARTICLE 47.	ALTERATION/WAIVER OF AGREEMENT
47.1	No employee or group of employees shall have the right to alter or waive any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may be altered or waived only by the mutual consent of WBNG and ANA, and then, only in writing dated and signed by the parties hereto. The Executive Director of WBNG and/or his or her designee have the authority to act on behalf of WBNG. The CEO of ANA and/or his or her designee have the authority to act on behalf of ANA.
47.2	In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally held or determined to be illegal or void as being in contravention of any law, or of any ruling or regulation of any governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction over the subject matter of this Agreement, the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
ARTICLE 48.	SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS
48.1	Subject to appropriate confidentiality agreements, before any sale, spin-off, merger, assignment, or any other change in name or ownership, ANA shall advise WBNG in writing, with as much advance notice as possible, of the contemplated sale, spin-off, transfer, merger, assignment, or other change in name or ownership.
