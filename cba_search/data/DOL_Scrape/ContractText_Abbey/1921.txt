AGREEMENT BETWEEN
THE DORMITORY AUTHORITY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK And
THE INTERNATIONAL UNION AND ITS LOCAL 2110, UNITED AUTO WORKERS
This Agreement is made by and between the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York, hereinafter referred to as the "Authority," and THE INTERNATIONAL UNION AND ITS LOCAL 2110, UNITED AUTO WORKERS, hereinafter referred to as "Local 2110," representing Employees of the Authority covered by the terms of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 1
RECOGNITION
1.1	The Authority, pursuant to Article 14 of the New York State Civil Service Law, also known as the Public Employees’ Fair Employment Act, has recognized and hereby continues to recognize Local 2110 as the sole and exclusive representative for collective negotiations with respect to salaries, wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment for those employees employed in the titles and the Operational Units listed in Appendix A to this Agreement and any other positions that are placed into such bargaining unit in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 entitled “Representation Status of Future Positions”. The terms “Employee” and “Employees” when referred to in this Agreement shall refer to only those employees of the Authority included in the Local 21 lObargaining unit pursuant to Article I of this Agreement.
1.2	Appendix A sets forth, as of the date of Appendix A, (i) the titles comprising the bargaining unit represented by Local 2110; (ii) the Operational Units in the Authority to which each title is assigned, (iii) the total number of positions in that title in the Operational Unit, and (iv) the total number of such positions in the Operational Units that are in the bargaining unit. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that there are titles identical to those listed in Appendix A in the same Operational Unit or other Operational Units of the Authority that are represented by CSEA Local 698 (as set forth in Appendix B to this Agreement) or that are not represented, including those that are employed in positions designated Managerial or Confidential.
1.3	The titles of Janitorial Services Assistant, Security Guard, Student Intern and Receptionist are excluded from the Bargaining Unit and Local 2110 agrees that it will not seek to represent such titles for the duration of this Agreement.
1.4	No less than full-time employee not set forth in Appendix A shall be eligible to be considered part of Local 2110 until: (i) they have been continuously employed in their position with the Authority for a period of thirty-nine weeks; (ii) they have
H:\UAW\2007-ll Collective Bargaining Agreement\UAW\FINALUAW Contract2007-2011.doc
I
successfully completed the probationary period, and (iii) the representational status of the position has been determined pursuant to Article 3 of this Agreement. In no event shall the thirty-nine week period of time served by an employee include time the employee is filling the position of an employee on statutory, contractual or administrative leave that entitles that employee to return to his or her position.
1.5	Local 2110 agrees that the Authority may establish and fill one or more positions to be classified as “exempt” in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.5. Any such positions shall be paid from a specific budgetary line item that may be funded in an amount not to exceed $25,000 for each fiscal year. The Authority agrees to provide Local 2110 with a monthly statement detailing the exempt positions created; the names of the employees hired into exempt positions; the period of time each employee has been working in an exempt position for the fiscal year and the dollars expended year to date from this line item. These exempt positions shall be excluded from the Bargaining Unit and Local 2110 agrees that it will not seek to represent such positions.
1.6	The Authority shall not assign work ordinarily performed by Employees to persons not represented by Local 2110. This paragraph, however, shall not apply to work performed by employees designated Managerial or Confidential, employees represented by CSEA Local 698, and employees holding positions referred to in Sections 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 of this Article, or work performed pursuant to a contract, other than a collective bargaining agreement, to which the Authority is a party.
1.7	The Authority and Local 2110 agree, pursuant to section 208 of Article 14 of the New York State Civil Service Law, that Local 2110 shall have unchallenged representation status for the maximum period permitted by law on the date of execution of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 2 STATEMENT OF POLICY AND PURPOSE
2.1	It is the policy of the Authority to continue harmonious and cooperative relationships with its Employees and to insure the orderly and uninterrupted operations of the Authority. This policy is effectuated by the provisions of the Public Employees' Fair Employment Act granting public employees the rights of organization and collective representation concerning the determination of the terms and conditions of their employment.
2.2	The Authority and Local 2110 now desire to enter into an Agreement reached through collective negotiations that will have for its purposes, among others, the following:

(b)	For the purposes of this Appendix, net pay shall mean gross pay minus federal, state, city (where applicable) withholding tax and FICA.

compensation award for the period covered by §5(d) and the notice requirements of §3.
6 (a) Where an employee’s workers’ compensation is controverted by the insurance carrier upon the ground that the disability did not arise out of or in the course of employment, the employee may utilize leave credits (including sick leave at half pay) pending a determination by the Workers’ Compensation Board.
