Court in 1979. The Board and the MTEA make this commitment because they wish to avoid racial isolation of school faculties, and they believe that having racially and ethnically diverse faculty and staff at each school is educationally beneficial for all students.
The parties agree to utilize all legally permissible measures to implement these goals.
The Board agrees to indemnify and to hold the MTEA harmless for damages, including legal fees, in any suit, action, claim or other federal, state, or local government proceeding which is brought against the MTEA to challenge this clause or its application. The application of this indemnification provision is contingent upon the cooperation of the MTEA in the investigation and defense of any such suit, action, claim, or other proceeding.
I.	ETHICS CODE
Notwithstanding the existence of a 1990-92 collective bargaining agreement between the Board and MTEA, the Board shall bargain with MTEA, in accordance with the terms of this paragraph, concerning all mandatory subjects of bargaining and aspects of any ethics code adopted by the Board. Nothing in this paragraph waives MTEA's right to assert that the adoption of such a code itself is a mandatory subject of bargaining or waives the Board's right to assert that the adoption of such a code itself is not a mandatory subject of bargaining. If the Board and MTEA do not reach a voluntary agreement on any subject about which they are legally required to bargain, either party may invoke interest arbitration under Section 111.70(4)(cm), Wisconsin Statutes.

k.	UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT. The following utilization management provisions shall apply to administration of the comprehensive indemnity/PPO plan. Only those utilization management procedures described in this contract shall apply to administration of the plan.

All non-emergency inpatient* - -admissions (in-network and out-of-network) to a hospital, skilled nursing facility, or other treatment facility and services for home health care, hospice care, and private duty nursing care must be precertified and are subject to concurrent review by the third party administrator. The provider (usually the admitting/attending physician) is responsible for initiating precertification when the employee/dependent uses network providers. If the employee/dependent uses out-of-network providers, the employee/ dependent must telephone the third party administrator (phone number on the identification card) in advance of the admission and provide the name and address of the treating physician and the name of the facility of admission.
In the event of an emergency admission, an in-network provider/facility is responsible for initiating concurrent review. However, when using an out-ofnetwork provider/facility, the employee/dependent must contact the third party administrator within forty-eight (48) hours of an emergency admission (extended to seventy-two [72] hours if confinement begins on a Friday or Saturday) to initiate concurrent review. If the employee/dependent using an out-of-network provider/facility fails to comply with these requirements, a penalty of three hundred dollars ($300) per occurrence shall apply.
Employees/dependents who are enrolled in Medicare are not required to initiate precertification and are not subject to a penalty.
2)	Any and all utilization management procedures used by the third party administrator with network providers under standard administration of its comprehensive PPO plans (in effect March 1, 2001), may be utilized to administer the comprehensive indemnity/PPO plan.

H. LEAVES OF ABSENCE
1	FOR INJURY, COMPENSABLE DISEASE, OR OTHER CASUALTIES
a.	Any teacher who in the course of employment sustains a compensable injury or contracts a compensable disease under the Wisconsin Worker's Compensation Law shall have a worker's compensation form filled out upon notifying the administration. The administration will assume the responsibility of getting the needed statements and filing the forms, a copy of which shall be sent to the MTEA.
Teachers absent after filing the worker's compensation form, where such absence is related to the industrial accident, will have "Industrial Accident" written on the time sheet where the injury or disease is not related to an assault. If assault related, the injury or disease shall be noted on the time sheet as "Industrial Accident Due to Assault."
If the claim is immediately or subsequently denied by the city attorney's office, a deduction will be made from sick leave for days missed and the teacher and MTEA shall be so notified in writing. Time limits for filing grievances shall commence on the date of notification of denial of the employee's final appeal.
Any teacher who in the course of his/her employment sustains a compensable injury or contracts a compensable disease under the Wisconsin Worker's Compensation Law shall be given the option to accept sick leave benefits as provided in Part III, Section G, above. This option, which shall be in writing, may be terminated without prejudice to temporary total or temporary partial disability benefits under the Worker's Compensation Act thereafter, but in no case shall sick leave and disability be allowed for the same period.
b.	Any teacher who is absent because of an injury or disease compensable under the Wisconsin Worker's Compensation Law and who selected either worker's compensation or sick leave benefits shall be entitled to receive full salary for the first eighty (80) school days of temporary total disability in lieu of compensation under the Worker's Compensation Law or sick leave benefits for said period. Such days of absence, not to exceed eighty (80) days for any individual in any school

c.	Leaves of absence granted to certificated personnel as a result of injury or disease compensable under the Wisconsin Worker's Compensation Law shall involve no change in increment date.
d.	Effective on the first day of the month following the date the MTEA notifies its members that the PPA is an acceptable option, an employee absent as a result of injury or disease compensable under the Wisconsin Worker's Compensation Law shall be reimbursed by the Board for any health insurance premiums paid by the employee up to the annuity effective date if the employee is subsequently approved for disability pension by WRS and the primary reason for the disability pension is a direct result of the injury or disease as determined under the Wisconsin Worker's Compensation Law. As of the annuity effective date, the eligibility for continuation of health insurance will be in accordance with Part III, Section B( 17) and (18). The MTEA agrees to study the Board's worker's compensation Preferred Provider Arrangement (PPA). If the MTEA finds the PPA to be an unacceptable option, the MTEA will work with the Board to resolve the MTEA's concerns. As soon as the PPA is found to be acceptable to the MTEA, the MTEA shall inform its members of that acceptability.
e.	In the event any teacher is prevented from performing his/her duties by reason of an epidemic, fire, civil commotion within the city of Milwaukee preventing the teacher from reaching his/her assigned school, acts of the elements and other casualty beyond his/her control which results in the closing of the school to which he/she is assigned, he/she shall be entitled to receive his/her full salary, provided that during any such period, he/she shall perform such teaching and other professional duties as the superintendent may assign to him/her.

9 OTHER LEAVES
a. EXTENDED LEAVES. Any tenured teacher may, upon recommendation of the superintendent, obtain a leave of absence by showing good cause therefore. After the superintendent has received written notice of the teacher's readiness to return, the superintendent shall reassign the teacher in accordance with the contract provisions. The teacher's salary shall begin with the first day of service under reassignment. Pending the receipt of the required health certificate, the teacher may serve on a day-to-day basis at his/her regular salary.
b PERSONAL ABSENCE WITHOUT PAY
1)	Any teacher who so requests may be granted personal absence of a reasonable nature by the superintendent without pay providing that adequate provisions have been made to assure the continuity of the instructional program.

2)	Permission will generally be given for absences to attend work related activities or programs, conferences related to teachers' duties, or educational travel related to the subject taught which cannot be accomplished during the regular school year provided these activities are deemed to have probable value to the system. The types of absences granted with pay under Part III, Section H(5) (Convention Leave), will continue to be granted.
3)	In addition, personal absences of not more than seven (7) consecutive days in any three (3)-year period not contiguous to regular school break, may be granted for personal reasons provided the employee in the year prior to the request had taken eight (8) or fewer sick days.

d PRETENURE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION - LEAVE Where a doctor discovers an adverse medical condition in the initial employment examination which is not sufficiently serious to deny employment but which may need correction or medical control prior to receiving tenure, the doctor shall set forth the problem and recommend solutions on the certificate and the teacher shall initial the card. If the condition is correctable or medically controllable prior to the end of the fifth semester, the employee may schedule a second medical examination prior to the end of that semester. These employees will require an examination as early as possible during their fifth semester of employment. Other employees shall not be required to take a pretenure physical examination. No employee shall be denied a health certificate unless the medical problem or physical disability is such that there is a medical probability that it will adversely affect the employee in the current or future performance of his/her duties. Where a doctor denied the health certificate, he/she shall state the reason therefore in writing. If the personal doctor of the employee disagrees with the findings of the Milwaukee Health Department, a statement from the personal doctor may be submitted; and, after a consultation with the doctor at the expense of the teacher, the Milwaukee Health Department's decision shall prevail. Should the Health Department deny a health certificate after reviewing the findings of the teacher's personal doctor, the teacher shall be granted a medical leave of absence without pay for not more than one (1) year to correct or medically control the problem. When the problem has been corrected or medically controlled and upon receipt of a satisfactory health certificate from the Milwaukee Health Department, the teacher shall be reinstated in accordance with this agreement. It is understood that the teacher would begin the probationary period over again as a first semester teacher. Teachers may be required to take a tuberculosis examination every three (3) years at Board expense in accordance with the regulations of the Milwaukee Health Department. Satisfactory evidence of such periodic examination shall constitute compliance with this section.
e LEAVES OF ABSENCE FOR ASSOCIATION EMPLOYEES

Each year prior to the expiration of the leave, the employee shall express his/her desire to remain on leave. Upon return from leave, the employee shall receive salary adjustments based upon his/her salary division and creditable service exclusive of service increments. During the leave, the employee shall be allowed to continue his/her health insurance and life insurance benefits by remitting payments to the Board upon notice of the amount due.

L.	EARLY RETIREMENT FUND
1.	Effective July 1, 1982, the Board will provide employees with an early retirement supplement and special retirement benefit supplement to the Wisconsin Retirement System plan. Retirement benefits will be payable effective July 1, 1982.
2.	Employees of the Board who are in the teacher bargaining unit represented by the MTEA and who are participating as active unit employees in the Wisconsin Retirement System-Department of Employe Trust Funds on or after July 1, 1982, shall be eligible for the early retirement benefits.
3.	The administration of the early retirement fund will be determined by the Board.
4.	Considered compensation, average annual compensation, and creditable service shall be determined in accordance with the mles of the Wisconsin Retirement System-Department of Employe Trust Funds, effective July 1, 1982.
5.	Regular retirement benefits for those age sixty-five (65) and older shall be those specified in the Wisconsin Retirement System Plan effective January 1, 1982.
6.	Upon attainment of age sixty-two (62), eligible employees may elect an early retirement option. Monthly pension payments payable for life will be computed in the same manner as the regular retirement benefits under the Wisconsin Retirement System effective January 1, 1982. The difference between the employees retirement benefit obtained from the Wisconsin Retirement Fund and that which the employee would receive if retirement were at age sixty-five (65) will be paid as a retirement benefit by the Board.
7.	The basis for early retirement supplemental fund will be governed by the actuarial report provided by A.S. Hansen Company, dated April 1, 1982. Provisions and assumptions of proposed plan 1, exhibit 4, including exhibit 5, assumption 4, are being utilized in computing the early retirement supplement fund.
8.	A special supplemental benefit computed at one-twelfth (1/12) of two percent (2%) of the "average annual compensation" as defined by the Wisconsin Retirement System, effective January 1, 1982, times the number of years, including fractional years between the ages of sixty-two (62) and sixty-five (65), shall be established. Eighty-five percent (85%) of the average annual compensation mix shall be the maximum amount applicable to this benefit. This benefit is paid between the ages of sixty-two (62) and

sixty-five (65) and terminates at age sixty-five (65). If the employee retires before age sixty-two (62), and after age fifty-five (55), the benefit will be prorated and paid between the time of retirement and age sixty-five (65). Employees choosing to retire prior to age sixty-two (62) would have benefits computed by reducing benefits by five-tenths percent (.5%) per month (six percent [6%] per year) for each month the participant's age is under sixty-two (62), but at least sixty (60), and four-tenths percent (.4%) per month (four and eight-tenths [4.8%] per year) for each month between age fifty-five (55) and age sixty (60). The difference between the normal retirement benefit and the optional early retirement will be paid to the participant on a monthly basis for life by the Board.
9.	A participant may elect optional forms of benefit payments in order to protect survivors in accordance with the optional plans and procedures specified by the Wisconsin Retirement System-Department of Employe Trust Funds. The option selected with the bust fund will be the option implemented in the early retirement supplement.

The examination shall include the written codification of the current early retirement plan and, if necessary, the modification of the existing documents so that the plan meets all applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue Service Code.

paragraphs a, b, and c. The administration shall notify the teachers of the dates of inservice and the expected duration of the inservice or faculty meeting at least one (1) calendar week prior to the inservice or faculty meeting date if it is to last longer than one (1) hour.
4.	DEDUCTIONS. All deductions for partial absences will be made on the basis of the eight (8)-hour day and forty (40)-hour week. However, it is recognized that the teacher normally spends more than this minimum amount of time in the performance of his/her duties. The daily rate, for purposes of calculating deductions, would be the number of days in the employee's regular scheduled work year divided into the employee's annual salary.
5	ADDITIONAL PAID ASSIGNMENTS
a.	Certificated staff members, who are assigned to extracurricular income-producing activities, such as plays, concerts, and evening dances, conducted by the school, other than those included under Appendices B and C, shall be compensated for such services at the prevailing hourly rate as adopted for part-time certificated assignment.
b.	Teachers who are asked to teach all or a part of a class, when the regular teacher is absent, shall be paid on the basis of the established part-time certificated rate properly prorated. Such compensation shall also be paid to teachers who substitute for the following: department chairpersons when they are absent for necessary attendance at central services meetings, teachers taking required physical examinations, teachers attending required central services meetings, and teachers absent for the music festival. Teachers in middle and high schools shall be authorized the part-time certificated rate when taking classes for others who are on field trips. This payment is authorized for assuming classes during the preparation period in addition to the teacher's normal class load. This provision shall be limited to a total of two thousand five hundred (2,500) secondary field trips each year.
c.	In the event a teacher is absent in a middle or high school and a substitute does not arrive in time or no substitute is available, or no substitute is being assigned, a teacher may be asked to cover the absent teacher's class from a list of volunteers which is kept in the office. In the event that the volunteer list is exhausted, teachers will be asked to cover classes on a rotating basis within subject area or on a general rotating basis if no teacher is available in a subject area.

d.	In the event a teacher is absent in an elementary school and a substitute does not arrive on time or no substitute is available or no substitute is being assigned, a regular classroom teacher may be assigned to be responsible for all or part of the absent teacher's class or a specialty teacher may be assigned, and he/she shall be compensated in accordance with paragraph b above.
e.	The Board will review all possibilities of scheduling and making an effort to assure that the elementary school buses arrive and leave before the end of the teacher workday.
f.	If it becomes necessary to schedule elementary school bus departures after the end of the teacher workday, the Board agrees to meet with the MTEA to explain what efforts have been made in an attempt to correct the scheduling problem and the circumstances for the late buses and identify the particular schools involved.
g.	If it becomes necessary to schedule elementary regular non-activity buses to leave after the close of the teacher workday, student supervision shall be handled as follows:
1)	If teachers are utilized, volunteers shall be solicited from among staff assigned to the school.
2)	If there is an insufficient number of volunteers, principals will assign educational assistants in accordance with the educational assistant labor agreement.
3)	If an insufficient number of staff are available after following items 1 and 2 above, principals will assign teachers in the same manner as assignment is made for student lunch supervision.
4)	Teachers will be paid at the part-time certificated rate of pay for such supervision with a minimum of fifteen (15) minutes' pay for each day.
h.	In elementary schools where bus supervision is necessary after the normal workday for a reason other than a scheduled departure after the end of the teacher workday and educational assistants are not available, teachers who accept the duties on a voluntary basis or are assigned on a rotational basis when there are no volunteers shall be paid at the part-time certificated rate for the time worked.

6	LUNCH PERIOD
a.	Teachers shall be entitled to a duty-free lunch period equal in length to a normal class period in high school, no less than fifty (50) minutes in the middle school, and no less than one (1) hour in the elementary school. When an elementary teacher moves from one (1) school to another, he/she shall receive travel time in addition to the lunch period. Where travel time is restricted between a morning and afternoon assignment, teachers shall be released fifteen (15) minutes prior to dismissal time. Kindergarten teachers, in lieu of being released fifteen (15) minutes prior to dismissal time, shall be paid one-half (.5) of an hour at the part-time certificated hourly rate for each day traveled. When hazardous conditions exist, kindergarten teachers who must travel to reach their afternoon school shall be released up to fifteen (15) minutes. One (1) teacher per lunchroom, supported by educational assistants within the limitations of the allocation, shall be used to supervise elementary school lunchrooms. However, if the principal, after consultation with the teaching staff, determines that the safety of the children requires additional supervision, he/she may assign an additional teacher per lunchroom for supervision. In the elementary school, where voluntary noon paid supervision is not in effect, assignment to noon supervision shall be made on a rotating basis with regular payment for such noon supervision prorated, with the provision that in no case shall such assignment be made for more than one-half (.5) of the lunch period.
b.	The school social workers, human relations community coordinators, human relations curriculum developers, and personnel assigned case management responsibilities shall have a duty-free lunch period of one (1) hour.
c.	If the lunch period as detailed above is changed as part of a modification of the student lunch period, the number of minutes reduced from the lunch period shall be commensurately reduced from the teacher day. The elementary school teacher lunch period shall not be reduced below forty-five (45) minutes.
7.	DEPARTMENT CHAIRPERSON. When a department has fifty (50) sections of classes or a major portion thereof, the chairperson of that department will be given a released period. If a department does not qualify, it will be combined with one (1) or more others to qualify for released time. Where small departments are combined to qualify for released time, every effort will be made to provide released time during the semester for these chairpersons. A released period for small departments may be shared

If the chairperson prefers, he/she may, in lieu of payment, request release in succeeding semesters, if it is possible to program in this manner.
8.	ROTATION OF DUTIES. Study halls, hall duty, lunchroom duty, and attendance service shall be assigned so that individual teachers do not have to perform these duties year after year without being relieved when specially requested.
9.	SECONDARY CLASSROOMS. Principals shall attempt, where possible, to limit the number of classroom assignments, exclusive of homeroom, to three (3). However, it is recognized that with certain subject areas and programs, the attainment of this may not be possible.

The estimate shall be provided to the receiving school by March 15 of the school year preceding the change in school assignment.
2.	Special education students shall be moved from elementary to middle schools or from middle schools to high schools previous to the end of the third grading period unless, through unusual circumstances, such a move could not be made or anticipated by that time and a later move would be deemed necessary and in the best interest of the student and/or classes involved.

physical threat to the teacher's safety and the administrator processing the referral does not concur, the administrator shall communicate with the teacher in writing why he/she did not follow the recommendation.
3.	Students who are or have been suspended from school for posing a threat to the physical safety of a teacher(s) shall be excluded from the building and prohibited from attending all classes and all other activities held at school. The student(s) shall remain under immediate administrative supervision until the parent is contacted and the student can be sent home or until the end of the school day (whichever comes first). In all suspension cases, the suspended student(s) shall be escorted out of the building. If the student(s) refuses to leave the school and/or grounds, and administrative means exclusive of the use of teacher(s), or assistant(s) proves inadequate to remove the student(s), other appropriate assistance shall be utilized. Prior to the reinstatement of the student(s), the teacher and the administrators handling the matter shall confer with regard thereto.
4.	Where necessary, appropriate personnel shall be available to escort students referred for disciplinary action to the office when the student's conduct poses a threat to the teacher's physical safety.
5.	The administrator shall exclude from a particular class, any pupil whose threatening conduct has proven to be a constant discipline problem and has not been corrected through previous referrals until a conference can be conducted with the pupil, teacher, principal, and/or other administrator under his/her direction and any other specialist dealing with the problem student.
6.	If the problem is not resolved by the previous steps, the matter shall be referred to the director, Division of Student Services, for appropriate disposition.
7.	Any reasonable and appropriate means including the use of physical force may be used by school personnel to prevent a threatened breach of discipline or to stop a continuing breach of discipline. It is expected that physical force will be used only when other means for preventing a breach of discipline or stopping its continuance have been ineffective. Any reasonable and appropriate means, but not including the use of physical force (corporal punishment) may be used in relation to any breach of discipline which has been completed. Corporal punishment may not be used; however, reasonable physical force may be used in self-defense. Self-defense is permissible where a teacher finds it necessary to defend himself/herself or a third person, where the teacher reasonably believes that such action is necessary for the safety of himself/herself or a

8.	DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR MEASURES
a.	Students, who interfere with the educational process by repeated refusal to follow school rules, shall promptly be subject to one (1) or more available measures for changing unacceptable behavior; such as, but not limited to, counseling, demerit systems, detentions, withdrawal of privileges, student contracts, parent contacts (whether in writing, by phone, or in person), buddy systems, peer counseling, behavior classes, timeout room, modified curricula concentrating on reading and verbal skills, or in-school suspension. Alternative measures such as these should be utilized prior to out-of-school suspension, except in instances where there has been a serious breach of discipline.
b.	Students whose serious or continuous breaches of discipline presents a danger to the safety of one (1) or more teachers, or who bring weapons to school, shall be disciplined in accordance with the Parent/Student Handbook on Rights, Responsibilities, and Discipline (August, 1989, edition).
c.	If alternative measures as in paragraph a above and out-of-school suspensions are unsuccessful in improving the behavior of a chronically disruptive student, more intensive corrective measures shall be taken including the use of support personnel for special counseling, and, if space is available, remedial and/or behavior modification classes either at the student's school or at an appropriate alternative site. Additional funding for alternative elementary and secondary sites may be sought in accordance with Part I, Section C(2)(b).
d.	All alleged violations of Part IV, Section F(8), may be grieved through the third step of the grievance procedure.
e.	MTEA may, in its sole discretion, inform the Board on or after July 1, 1991, in writing of its decision to delete paragraph d. If MTEA chooses to make such deletion, the following shall occur:
1)	The sole issue for an arbitrator deciding a grievance under this section shall be whether the administrator acted reasonably in deciding how to act or not to act in a particular situation.

5.	Where a teacher presents proof to the Division of Staffing Services, Compensation and Records, P.O. Box 2181, Milwaukee, WI 53201-2181, of additional teaching experience and/or college or inservice credits which would warrant his/her being upgraded to a higher pay schedule, such increased pay shall be retroactively granted to the beginning of the semester in which the teacher filed the credits with the Division of Staffing Services, Compensation and Records, P.O. Box 2181, Milwaukee, WI 532012181.
Upon satisfactory completion of credits that will make a teacher eligible for reclassification, required documentation must be submitted to the Division of Staffing Services, Compensation and Records, P.O.

The documentation required for a college course is an official transcript from the school at which the course was taken. However, if the completion of a course will result in a reclassification, the teacher may temporarily use an official grade report. When a grade report is used, an official transcript must be submitted before the end of the semester following the semester in which the course was taken. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in retroactive withdrawal of reclassification.
Reclassification will be granted in accordance with Part IV, Section H(5), even if the applicable deadline is not met if the teacher submits a receipt or other similar documentation, proving that a transcript from the applicable educational institution was ordered to be sent to the Board at least thirty (30) days prior to such deadline. Teachers who file a transcript at the Board office and desire verification of receipt may submit an additional copy of the transcript for contemporaneous time stamping.
6.	Present basic provisions for evaluation of professional training shall be retained.
7.	Postgraduate work performed by teachers to obtain primary and/or junior level Montessori certification shall be granted college credits for advancement on the salary schedule.

8.	Occupational and physical therapists shall be allowed college credits toward advancement on the salary schedule for each of the following courses: Nemo-Muscular Developmental Training and the Aryes Sensory Integration Dysfunction Certification Workshop and other courses approved by the Division of Special Services.

The involvement of teachers in the decision-making process is vital to the continued improvement of the educational program. This involvement must provide meaningful opportunities for input of ideas, needs, and goals of all groups affected, rather than a vote on the issue. The decision is the responsibility of the administrators held accountable. This section shall be subject to arbitration, but the arbitrator shall make no retroactive award.
M.	TEACHER AND SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKER EVALUATIONS

3.	After permanent tenure status has been reached, evaluation shall be made as follows:
a.	Annually for the first two (2) years under such status.
b.	At three (3)-year intervals thereafter.

This evaluation should be based upon and should include all of the following:
a.	A sufficient number of classroom visitations, observations, and personal conferences.
b.	An analysis of points of strength and weakness, with specific examples.

c.	Definite suggestions for ways in which improvement may be made, if such be necessary.
Written feedback to the teacher must follow a formal observation.

Upon the request of a teacher, a post-observation conference must be held after every formal observation which occurs.
5.	The teacher shall be informed of his/her status and the meaning of any evaluation report by the evaluator(s) before it is submitted to central services. He/she shall be permitted to copy the evaluation report and be allowed forty-eight (48) horns to study the evaluator(s) comments and respond in writing to them, if the teacher so desires. Any written response by the teacher shall be made a part of the original evaluation report and shall remain in the teacher's evaluation file in central services. Teachers will be requested to sign the evaluation report. The teacher's signature does not indicate approval, but merely that it has been reviewed as set forth above. The evaluator(s) may file and the teacher may request a special evaluation at a time other than the specified times for evaluations.
6.	In the event a teacher receives a satisfactory evaluation with an attachment where the evaluator(s) recommends a transfer should be taken under advisement, the teacher shall specify in writing on the attachment whether he/she concurs in the recommendation for transfer. Where the teacher does not concur and upon request of the evaluator(s) or teacher, the MTEA and the director, Department of Administrative Services, or administrative specialist shall confer in the building with all parties to resolve the problem. If, as a result of the conference, the director, Department of Administrative Services, or administrative specialist concurs in the recommendation of the evaluator(s) and before any action is taken in the matter, they shall:
a.	Notify the teacher and the MTEA within ten (10) workdays in advance that a conference has been scheduled with the superintendent or his/her designee involving the teacher, MTEA, the evaluator(s), and the director, Department of Administrative Services, or administrative specialist. The notice will include a statement of the problem. The purpose of the conference shall be to explore possible areas of assistance necessary to overcome the difficulties which have been referred to in the evaluation report.

If the MTEA and/or the teacher are not in agreement with the decision, the MTEA may proceed through the final step of the grievance procedure, starting at the third step.
7.	In the event the “Professional Growth Plan” is checked on the evaluation form, the teacher and the evaluator will meet to develop a joint professional growth plan. However, if the evaluator(s) and the teacher are unable to agree on a joint plan or the teacher is not willing to participate in its development, the evaluator(s) will develop a professional growth plan for the teacher. The professional growth plan should include areas of concern, suggestions for remediation, assistance, resources, and goals. It is expected that the evaluator(s) and the teacher will meet periodically during the ensuing school year to review the teacher’s progress with respect to this plan.
8.	In the event a teacher receives an unsatisfactory evaluation and the teacher does not concur, upon request of the evaluator(s) or teacher, the MTEA and the director, Department of Administrative Services, or administrative specialist shall confer in the building with all parties to attempt to resolve the problem. If, as a result of the conference, the director, Department of Administrative Services, or administrative specialist concurs in the recommendation of the evaluator(s) then before any action is taken in the matter, the director, Department of Administrative Services, or administrative specialist shall inform the teacher by letter that the unsatisfactory evaluation constitutes a recommendation for non-renewal, if a non-tenured teacher, or termination, if a tenured teacher, in the Milwaukee Public Schools. The letter shall also state the fact that the teacher has ten (10) workdays to request a hearing before the superintendent or his/her designee on the matter. The MTEA shall receive a copy of this letter. If the teacher requests a hearing, he/she shall be sent a notice of the date set for the hearing and the charges involved. The MTEA shall be sent a copy of this notice at least three (3) workdays prior to the hearing.
a.	The hearing shall be held within ten (10) workdays to hear the charges and the responses before the superintendent or his/her designee, at which time the teacher may be represented by the MTEA, legal counsel, or any other person of his/her choosing. Within five (5) workdays of the hearing, the teacher and MTEA shall be notified of the decision relative to the charges in writing and reasons substantiating such decision. Such decision shall be signed by the superintendent. Where the MTEA requests a delay in conferences beyond the

A teacher who elects to proceed to arbitration shall be considered to have waived the right to pursue this matter in the courts, except as provided in Chapter 298, Wisconsin Statutes.
9.	Where the evaluator(s) evaluates a teacher on an unsatisfactory evaluation and the charges are substantiated, the superintendent or his/her designee may recommend reassignment of the teacher or retention of the teacher in the same assignment. The superintendent or his/her designee shall state the disposition of the recommendation in all records accompanying the unsatisfactory evaluation. Where the charges are not substantiated, the appropriate evaluation shall be made and filed as a replacement.
10.	In the event the superintendent decides to recommend that the teacher's contract not be renewed if non-tenured or terminated if tenured for the subsequent school year, he/she shall, by April 1, notify the Board with a copy to the teacher of the recommendation, together with the specific reasons upon which he/she relied. He/she shall notify the teacher that he/she may, within five (5) workdays request a full and fair hearing before the Personnel Committee if non-tenured and before the full Board if tenured. Any hearing so requested shall be held prior to April 30. The decision of the Committee shall be in writing and shall contain the specific reasons for the decision. It shall be served upon the teacher and his/her representative as soon as possible, but in no case later than May 15.
11.	a. Should there be any dispute between the MTEA and the administration concerning just cause for their action, it shall be subject to final and binding arbitration, in accordance with the final step of the grievance procedure. The parties to this contract shall make all reasonable efforts to conclude the arbitration hearing prior to June 15. The arbitrator shall be requested to issue his/her decision prior to July 15.

counsel, or any other person of his/her choice. This notice shall be followed by a scheduled personal conference during which the teacher will be informed of the nature of the charges of alleged misconduct in an effort to resolve the matter. Resolution of "day-to-day" problems which do not have a reasonable expectation of becoming serious will not necessitate a written memo.
b.	If the matter cannot be resolved under subsection a, the principal or supervisor, within five (5) workdays of the conclusion of such conference, shall specify the charges in writing and provide them to the teacher and the MTEA, with a copy to the director, Department of Administrative Services, or administrative specialist. The director, Department of Administrative Services, or administrative specialist shall hold a conference on a date which is both agreeable to the MTEA or the alternative primary representative of the teacher and within ten (10) workdays after the receipt of the principal's or supervisor's letter by the MTEA. The teacher may be represented at the conference by the MTEA, legal counsel, or any other person of his/her choice.
c.	If the matter is not resolved in this manner, a hearing shall be held within ten (10) workdays to hear the charges and the response before the director of the MPS Department of Human Resources or his/her designee, at which time the teacher may be represented by the MTEA, legal counsel, or any other person of his/her choosing. Within five (5) workdays of the hearing, the teacher and the MTEA shall be notified of the decision relative to the charges in writing and the reasons substantiating such decision.
d.	The superintendent shall, within five (5) workdays, review the decision of the director of the MPS Department of Human Resources or his/her designee and issue his/her decision thereon. The MTEA may, within ten (10) workdays, invoke arbitration, as set forth in the final step of the grievance procedure in cases not involving a recommendation for dismissal or suspension. A teacher who elects to proceed to arbitration shall be considered to have waived the right to pursue the matter in the courts, except as provided in Chapter 788, Wisconsin Statutes.
e.	1) NON-TENURED. Where the superintendent, after review of the MPS Department of Human Resources' director's recommendation, recommends dismissal of a non-tenured teacher or suspension of a teacher, the teacher may, within ten (10) workdays of receipt of the decision of the superintendent, request a hearing before the Personnel Committee which

shall be held within forty-five (45) workdays of the request. The Committee, after a full and fair hearing which shall be public or private, at the teacher's request, shall make a written decision specifying its reasons and the action and recommendations, prior to the next full meeting of the Board.
2)	TENURED TEACHER. In any case where the superintendent, after review of the MPS Department of Human Resources' director's recommendation, recommends dismissal of a tenured teacher, the matter shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of this section, except that the full Board, rather than the Personnel Committee, shall conduct the hearing.
f.	The MTEA may, within ten (10) workdays, invoke arbitration, as set forth in the final step of the grievance procedure. A teacher who elects to proceed to arbitration shall be considered to have waived the right to pursue the matter in the courts, except as provided in Chapter 788, Wisconsin Statutes.
g.	To accommodate scheduling conflicts, the time limits of the misconduct procedure may be modified, on a case-by-case basis, by the mutual consent of the parties responsible for scheduling at the particular step of the procedure where the scheduling conflict arises.
2.	EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. When an allegation of serious misconduct which is related to his/her employment is made, the administration may conduct an administrative inquiry which would include ordering the teacher to central services or authorizing him/her to go home for a period not to exceed three (3) days. Authority to order an employee to absent himself/herself from work shall be vested in the superintendent or his/her designee. The administration shall notify the MTEA as to the identification of its designees. In no case can the designee be a member of the bargaining unit. The MTEA shall be notified previous to the decision. No teacher shall be temporarily suspended prior to the administrative inquiry, nor without the opportunity to respond to the charges and have representation of his/her choice as set forth above. No teacher may be suspended unless a delay beyond the period of the administrative inquiry is necessary for one (1) of the following reasons:
a.	The delay is requested by the teacher.
b.	The delay is necessitated by criminal proceedings involving the teacher.

c.	Where, after the administrative inquiry, probable cause is found to believe that the teacher may have engaged in serious misconduct.
In the event the teacher suspended is cleared of the charges, he/she shall be compensated in full for all salary lost during the period of suspension, minus any interim earnings. At the conclusion of the administration's inquiry, hearings of the resultant charges, if any, shall be conducted in accordance with Part IV, Section N(l)(b).
O.	PARENT CONFERENCE DAYS
The parent/teacher conference schedule of two (2) days per year, if scheduled, shall be conducted during regular school hours on the days established by the negotiated calendar or if modifications are desired as follows:
1.	The principal will meet with the building representative(s) and discuss parent/teacher conference day options to be developed jointly by the principal, building representative, and parent representatives. After the options are developed, the building representative(s) will conduct a ballot of teachers. Parent representatives will provide meaningful parental input.
2.	The principal and building representatives will meet to review the parent and teacher responses to the options. If a modified parent/teacher conference day schedule is established, the modification will provide a total number of horns for the parent/teacher conference day which are equal to the number of horns in the teacher day (exclusive of the lunch period) at each level (i.e., elementary, middle, and high).
3.	Principals are to send their written requests for the modified conference days to the Division of Labor Relations. Building representatives are to send a letter with the dates and horns for the conference(s) reflecting the will of the teachers to the MTEA.
4.	If the MTEA and administration cannot agree on a parent/teacher conference modification, then the school will adhere to the negotiated day. On such days, conferences, if scheduled, shall be conducted during regular school hours or on consecutive hours equal to the normal school day not to exceed 9:30 p.m.

D.	PREFERENCE OF ASSIGNMENT
Teachers each year may express in writing to their principal their preferences of grade assignment, subject areas, and extracurricular assignment, if any. Their requests shall be given consideration as vacancies occur within the school. Seniority and academic preparation will be major considerations, but not controlling in such assignment.

Seniority shall mean the number of years of service commencing the first day of the semester in which the employee begins working after the first day of the semester. Service rendered beyond the normal work year of the employee shall not be counted toward seniority. For purpose of reduction in enrollment, layoff and transfers, seniority shall further be determined among those of equal semester seniority by next considering the date the employee actually began working, if this date precedes the first date of the semester. If this date also coincides, the date on which the employee was offered employment shall be considered. Leaves of absence for whatever reason shall not be considered a break for seniority purposes whether or not increments are granted for such leave.
Resignation causes a break in seniority. If the teacher is rehired within one (1) year following the resignation, accumulated sick leave benefits are restored. If the resignation exceeds one (1) year and the teacher is rehired, he/she has the same benefits as a new teacher with no seniority, except as to the experience credit on the salary scale. A former teacher is allowed credit for all Milwaukee experience regardless of the period of time between the resignation and date of re-employment. Teachers who have tenure prior to resigning are employed with tenure. Teachers who do not have tenure prior to resigning receive no credit for their previous Milwaukee service toward the six (6) semesters required for tenure. Administrators returning to the teacher bargaining unit shall receive up to three (3) years of seniority for service as an administrator or supervisor.
G.	REASSIGNMENT
Once assigned to a building, teachers will not be involuntarily reassigned, except in cases of reduction in enrollment, voluntary transfers, assignment of relatives, conduct, or evaluation as defined below:
1.	REDUCTION IN ENROLLMENT. When a reduction in the number of teachers is necessary, qualified volunteers shall be first reassigned. If more than one (1) teacher volunteers to be excessed, excessing shall be done in order by seniority. Then reassignment shall be made on the basis of years of service in the Milwaukee system with those teachers most recently appointed to the school system being reassigned first, except where departmental, necessary extracurricular, kindergarten, primary, intermediate, or upper grade level needs prevail. The Board may deviate from the above to maintain a gender balance in physical education positions.
2.	VOLUNTARY TRANSFERS. Request for reassignment from teachers seeking transfers shall be listed in terms of majors and minors or in terms of grades taught. In

the interest of expediting assignments, the initial round of reassignments are to be processed on the basis of applications on file by June 1 of each year in vacancies known up until July 1 of each year. For teachers who do not receive a reassignment in the initial round, the second round of reassignments are to be processed on the basis of applications on file by June 1 for vacancies which become known from July 2 through and including July 31. MPS staffing specialists and MTEA staff members shall jointly process the second round of reassignments. Where schools are restaffed at midyear, reassignments will be processed on the basis of requests on file by December 15 of each year to vacancies known up until December 15.
Wherever two (2) or more teachers who have requested transfers are qualified to fill the open position, preference shall be given to the teacher or teachers with the greatest system-wide seniority, except as provided below. Once a transfer has been granted, the person may not exercise this seniority provision for three (3) years.
Exceptions to the above will be made in the following cases:
a.	Transfers will be allowed from an individual school's staff provided that no more than twenty-five percent (25%) of an individual school's staff need be allowed to leave the school in any one (1) year through transfer.
b.	Schools which have or are beginning special modes of instruction shall be listed and advertised separately. Applicants will be selected from among those interested and qualified for such assignment in order of seniority except for ten percent (10%) of the positions. Applications for special programs do not preclude a teacher from also filing a regular transfer request. This provision shall not apply to program improvement programs.
c.	When opening a new school, department chairpersons and counselors will be identified from among those requesting transfer a semester in advance of the opening of the school. Department chairpersons will be identified from among teachers who had requested a transfer and who should have had sufficient seniority to transfer into the building if the entire school would have been opened a semester in advance.
d.	The Board may deviate from the above to maintain a gender balance in physical education positions in individual schools.
3.	ASSIGNMENT OF RELATIVES. Where staff members marry, it is desirable to

4.	PERSONNEL PROCEDURES. Personnel procedures shall be handled as set forth in the contract.
5.	EVALUATION. Evaluation shall be handled as set forth in the contract.
H.	LIST OF VACANCIES
If schools are restaffed at midyear, the list of existing vacancies will be posted on school bulletin boards on December 1.
I.	REASSIGNMENT REQUESTS
Requests for reassignment shall be made not later than June 1 if they are to be considered for the following school year. Requests for reassignment shall be made not later than December 15 if they are to be considered for the second semester of a school year. Reassignment requests filed not later than June 1 or December 15 will be kept active until February 15 of each school year. On February 15 of each school year, all said requests will be stored for a period of three (3) years before the forms are destroyed. Teachers desiring a voluntary transfer for the subsequent school year must file a new request for reassignment not later than June 1 for the following school year or not later than December 15 for the second semester.
J.	ASSIGNMENT TO A PARTICULAR SCHOOL
1.	Teachers shall be assigned to a particular building where a vacancy exists, as long as the teachers are qualified within their teaching certificates issued by the Department of Public Instruction (DPI), possess special skills and training needed1, and possess any additional qualifications as established by the Board. In the event the Board decides to impose additional qualifications beyond those established by the DPI, the Board shall notify the MTEA of such additional qualifications and meet with the MTEA to discuss whether such qualifications are reasonably job-performance related. The Board shall grant tuition reimbursement to those teachers presently in assignments who must obtain additional credits as a result of the imposition of qualifications beyond DPI certification. Established tuition reimbursement procedures shall apply. For each three (3) credits or other non-credit additional qualifications beyond DPI certification, teachers shall be

a.	Teachers displaced from a particular building due to a reduction in enrollment in accordance with PartV, Section G(l), teachers requesting reassignment in accordance with PartV, SectionG(3), teachers requesting reassignment in accordance with Part V, Section G(2), teachers returning from a leave of absence, and teachers being reassigned in connection with the section on evaluation. Exceptions to this section may be made to provide meaningful assignments to those teachers being transferred as a result of evaluation.
b.	Unassigned teachers as a result of premature curtailment of leave and unassigned teachers as a result of overhiring.
c.	New teachers in the system who have not as yet taught in the Milwaukee Public Schools.
2.	Whenever there are two (2) or more qualified teachers to fill a vacancy in any one (1) of the above categories, preference shall be given to the teacher or teachers with the greatest system-wide seniority. The MTEA recognizes that there may be an occasion where departmental, extracurricular, kindergarten, primary, intermediate, upper grade level, or counseling needs cannot be met in a specific instance through the provisions of this section. In such instance, the administration will give the teacher, upon request, reasons for the departure from these provisions. If the teacher requests, such reasons shall be reduced to writing.

If the principal perceives that a teacher is incompatible with a particular mode of instruction, the principal shall observe and evaluate in accordance with Part IV, Section M. If after the result of either of these actions, the teachers and the principal concur in the recommendation to transfer, the transfer will be initiated without reflecting upon the permanent evaluation file of the teacher. If the principal initiates the action and the teacher does not concur, the procedures incorporated in Part IV, Section M, shall be followed. In either case, the provisions of Part V, Section J(l)(a), which provide meaningful assignments for those transferred as a result of evaluation shall apply.
Nothing in this paragraph should be interpreted as preventing the principal from filing a regular evaluation.

On or before the last day of this approximate ten (lO)-workday cycle, the school/program shall forward the applications of the selected teachers to the MPS Certificated Staffing office (faxes are permissible).
g.	Within five (5) workdays, MPS Certificated Staffing will send reassignment notices to the affected teachers and to the selected school/program. If multiple schools/programs have selected the same teacher, Certificated Staffing will contact the teacher to choose the school he/she wants.
h.	After the completion of cycle one, MPS shall again post the vacancies known at that point in time to begin cycle two of the process.
i.	Cycle two of the interview process shall include current employed certified teachers, student teachers, and interns who have been offered a contract for the next school year and new hires to MPS who have been offered individual contracts by MPS Certificated Staffing.

The MBSD shall defend and hold harmless such teachers for actions within the scope of their employment as defined by Wis. Stats. Sections 895.35 and 895.46. The Board agrees to indemnify and to hold the MTEA harmless for damages, including legal fees, in any suit, action, claim, or other federal, state, or local government proceeding which is brought against the MTEA to challenge this clause or its application. The application of this indemnification provision is contingent upon the cooperation of the MTEA in the investigation and defense of any such suit, action, claim, or other proceeding.
m.	The school interview team shall review the application forms and determine which applicants to interview.
n. Team members may attempt to reach consensus in selecting an applicant to fill a vacancy. If consensus is not reached, a majority must agree to select an applicant.

(The inclusion of full-time social worker and elementary guidance positions in the interview process shall not change any of the grievance decisions, arbitration awards, memoranda of understanding, and the past practices for these categories of employees.)
5.	Teachers selected by interviews shall be considered reassigned for the following school year and may not exercise their rights to a voluntary transfer under the seniority or interview transfer provisions of the contract for three (3) years.
6.	For schools that do not have an on-site administrator, an interview team shall consist of one (1) parent of a student attending the school and two (2) teachers assigned to the school, elected in accordance with paragraph 2 above.
7.	If a teacher assigned to a school believes that he/she is incompatible with the school, that teacher shall confer with his/her evaluator(s). An incompatibility evaluation form shall be written and the teacher shall, at the earliest opportunity, be reassigned to another MPS school or be placed on day-to-day assignment. Teachers who have received an unsatisfactory evaluation form may not be reassigned under this provision. When the transfer is made, the evaluation form shall be destroyed and there shall be no documentation of the reassignment in the permanent file of the teacher.
8.	Any school which has participated in the interview process for at least two (2) staffing cycles may revoke that authority based upon an affirmative vote of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the teaching staff assigned to the school.
Q.	SCHOOL RECONSTITUTION PROCESS
Prior to January 31 of each school year, the superintendent may notify any MPS school that it has been identified for reconstitution. Prior to December 15 of each school year, the staff members at any MPS school may request that the superintendent identify their school for reconstitution when at least two-thirds of the teaching staff assigned to the school supports the request in a vote conducted by the MTEA building representative.

The following process shall be implemented at schools identified for reconstitution:
1.	The school shall develop a comprehensive educational plan to improve student achievement.
The plan shall be developed through a democratic, consensus-building process in which staff members, parents, and other school community members shall have an opportunity to be actively involved in the development of the overall vision and specific plan for the school.
2.	Commencing in February, following identification of a school for reconstitution, staff members at the school shall begin the process of inservice/planning required to develop a comprehensive educational plan for the school. Time for the staff to engage in the planning process may be provided by any combination of the following:
a.	Teachers may be required to attend inservice activities without additional compensation in accordance with Part IV, Section B(3)(d), of the contract.
b.	Up to one-half of each banking day may be used for planning activities related to reconstitution. If the teaching staff concurs by at least a two-thirds vote, additional time up to a full day of each banking day may be used for planning related to reconstitution.
c.	Each week teachers may be required to attend a one (l)-hour, after-school plan development/inservice meeting for the entire teaching staff related to reconstitution. The maximum amount of time teachers shall be required to attend these meetings shall not exceed four (4) hours per month (inclusive of the two and a half (2.5)-hour requirement contained in Part IV, Section B(3)(d), of the contract). With agreement of the teaching staff (two-thirds vote), the four (4) hours per month may be scheduled as two (2), two (2)-hour blocks of time per month, or in any other manner not to exceed four (4) hours per month during the school year. Teachers shall attend inservices without additional compensation in accordance with Part IV, Section B(3)(d), of the contract. Teachers shall be paid at the part-time certificated rate of pay for attending inservices beyond the two and a half (2.5)-hour limit in Part IV, Section B(3)(d), and at the individual hourly rate for participating in plan development sessions.

d.	At the discretion of the superintendent, students at a school identified for reconstitution may be released for half days or full days for the purpose of providing time for staff inservice and/or planning activities.
3.	An educational plan shall be considered completed by the school after it is supported by a two-thirds vote of the teaching staff and supported by the principal following discussion with the school council. Teaching staff shall include all certificated, MTEA-represented employees assigned to the school.
4.	The educational plan shall then be submitted to a broadly-based MPS Districtwide Reconstitution Committee comprised of no more than seven (7) members appointed by the superintendent. The committee shall contain MPS administrators and community members and at least one (1) member recommended for appointment by the MTEA. The educational plan shall be submitted to the committee after it is complete, but no later than November 1 of the school year following identification of a school for reconstitution.
The MPS Districtwide Reconstitution Committee may send the plan back to the school for further development or recommend the plan to the superintendent.
The superintendent may send the plan back to the school for further development or approve the plan no later than February 1 of the school year following identification of a school for reconstitution.
5.	The educational plan shall be implemented at the start of the school year following approval of the plan by the superintendent.
6.	In order to provide assurances that staff members are committed to the new educational plan at reconstituted schools, the following processes are established:
a.	All teacher-unit staff members assigned to a school identified for reconstitution shall have the opportunity to participate in the process of developing the educational plan.
The MPS administration shall notify teachers, who may be newly assigned to a school undergoing reconstitution, that they are expected to be involved in developing an educational plan. Teachers who choose not to commit to the planning process shall not be permanently assigned.

Those permanently assigned staff members who are not interested in participating in the development of a plan shall be excessed in June of the school year in which the school is identified for reconstitution.
Those staff members who remain at the school, but who fail to participate in the planning process, shall be designated as excessed by the principal in June following approval of the new educational plan by the superintendent and reassigned in accordance with the contract. Participation, as used in this section, means attending ninety percent (90%) of the plan development/ inservice sessions, unless unable to attend for a reason recognized under Part III, Sections G and H, of the contract, or unless excused by the principal.
b.	After the new plan has been approved by the superintendent, each teacherunit staff member shall have the opportunity to determine if he/she is incompatible with the new educational plan. If so, the staff member shall be treated as excessed and reassigned in accordance with the provisions of Part V of the contract prior to implementation of the new educational plan.
c.	If, after the new educational plan has been implemented, a teacher determines that he/she is incompatible with the program at a reconstituted school, that teacher shall confer with the principal at the earliest opportunity. An incompatibility evaluation shall be written by the principal. In an instance where a teacher has received written notice from the principal that he/she is being considered for an unsatisfactory evaluation, the principal may, but is not required to, write an incompatibility evaluation for the teacher. When the transfer is made, the evaluation shall be destroyed and there shall be no documentation of the reassignment in the permanent evaluation fde of the teacher. The provisions of Part V, Section J(l)(a), which provide meaningful assignments for those transferred as a result of evaluation shall apply. The process may also be initiated by the principal subject to the provisions of Part IV, Section M, and Part V, Section K(4), of the contract.
7.	The parties understand that the provisions of PartV, Section Q, (School Reconstitution Process), are experimental in nature and shall expire upon one (1) year notice by either party to the other of its intent to sunset the provisions. Such notice shall not be given before June, 2000.

SUMMER SCHOOL
A.	ASSIGNMENT
No available position in the Milwaukee summer schools shall be filled by a teacher not employed by the Board during the regular school term, if there is a qualified applicant for such position who is employed by the Board.
B.	LENGTH OF ASSIGNMENT
When the applications from qualified teachers employed by the Board for summer school teaching positions exceed the job positions available, all applicants not assigned to the summer school staff in any year shall be considered first for assignment during the following summer school program if they apply. To assure some continuity, teachers assigned to the summer school staff shall be eligible to serve for two (2) successive summer school terms, provided summer school subjects or programs for which they qualify are being offered the second year. Teachers will not be eligible for assignment the third successive summer term, except where a lack of eligible applicants necessitates such assignment. In interpreting the above language, the following priority shall be used when filling summer school teaching assignments:
1.	Any teacher who has completed the first year of a two (2)-year term must be given first priority if the teacher applies for the second year.
2.	Any teachers who applied for the previous year and were not assigned and who have again applied are given second priority.
3.	Any other teacher applicants who qualified and who were not assigned the previous year shall be given third priority. These may be experienced teachers who have not applied for a year or two (2) or who had applied the previous year but refused the assignment after May 1 if offered prior to that date.
4.	Teacher applicants who have completed two (2) successive years or more of summer employment shall be given fourth priority.
5.	Administrative applicants for teaching assignments shall be given fifth priority.
6.	Late applicants shall be given sixth priority.

Each teacher assigned to a summer school staff shall notify the superintendent of his/her desire to accept such assignment no later than May 1 of the year in which said teacher has been assigned a position.
Hiring of teachers within each of the above priorities shall be based on hiring those teachers who have taught the least number of summer schools within the last five (5) years first, and if that is equal, the teachers shall be hired in order of seniority, from the most senior to least senior.
A person who works as a substitute replacing a teacher hired from the priority list shall not have that employment count as a summer school taught for determining his/her priority for the following summer. A substitute for purposes of this paragraph shall not mean a teacher hired to replace another from the priority list within the first three (3) days of summer school.
A teacher who is absent sixteen (16) or more days due to verified personal or immediate family illness will not have that employment count as a summer school taught. The person will retain for the following summer the priority he/she had when selected the previous summer.
It shall be the responsibility of the teacher to indicate this fact on the subsequent summer school application.
A teacher employed from the priorities who is employed for fifteen (f5) or more days and who must drop the assignment for personal or immediate family illness or other reasons shall have that employment count for determining his/her priority for the following summer.

B. DEFINITIONS
1.	A grievance is defined to be an issue concerning the interpretation or application of provisions of this contract or compliance therewith provided, however, that it shall not be deemed to apply to any order, action, or directive of the superintendent or anyone acting on his/her behalf, or to any action of the Board which relates or pertains to their respective duties or obligations under the provisions of the state statutes which have not been set forth in this contract.
2.	A complaint is any matter of dissatisfaction of a teacher with any aspect of his/her employment which relates primarily to wages, horns, and working conditions and which does not involve a grievance as defined above. It may be processed through the application of the third step of the grievance procedure.
3.	A continuing grievance or complaint is a situation where the time limits have been exceeded, but the condition continues to exist. Each day may constitute a new grievance or complaint. However, there shall be no retroactivity prior to the date of the filing of the written grievance or complaint, except that in the case of errors having a monetary impact not occurring as a result of teacher negligence, corrected payment shall be made retroactive for a period not to exceed one (1) year.
C.	RESOLUTION OF GRIEVANCE OR COMPLAINT
If the grievance or complaint is not processed by the MTEA or the grievant within the time limits at any step of the grievance or complaint procedure, it shall be considered to have been resolved by previous disposition. Failure by the administration or the Board to communicate their disposition in writing within the specified time limit shall permit the MTEA to appeal the grievance or complaint to the next step of the grievance procedure or arbitration. Any time limits in the procedure may be extended or shortened by mutual consent.
D.	STEPS OF GRIEVANCE OR COMPLAINT PROCEDURE
Grievances or complaints shall be processed as follows:
FIRST STEP. Where a complaint is involved, a teacher shall, within five (5) workdays after he/she knew or should have known of the incident, submit the same to the principal orally.

1.	JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORITY. Jurisdictional authority is limited to consideration of grievances as herein above defined.
The impartial referee procedure shall be subject to the following:
a.	The certifying party shall notify the other party in writing of the certification of a grievance.
b.	The certifying party shall forward to the impartial referee a copy of the grievance and the other party's answer and send a copy of such communication to the other party.
c.	Upon receipt of such documents, the impartial referee shall fix the time and place for a formal hearing of the issues raised in the grievance not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of such documents unless a longer time is agreed to by the parties.
d.	Upon the fixing of a referee hearing date, the parties may arrange mutually agreeable terms for a prehearing conference to consider means of expediting the hearing by, for example, reducing the issues to writing, stipulating fact, outlining intended offers of proof, and authenticating proposed exhibits.
e.	In those cases where either party deems it necessary, it may be arranged that a transcript of the hearing be made by a qualified court reporter. The party making such arrangements shall bear the full cost thereof. The other party may purchase a copy. If the impartial referee requests that he/she be furnished with a copy, the expense of the original copy and the reporter's attendance charge shall be borne equally by the parties.
f.	The goal of the arbitration procedure is to provide prompt but judicious consideration of grievances. In most grievances, the time span between hearing and decision should not exceed eight (8) weeks. If briefs are to be filed, a period of up to three (3) weeks should be allowed for the filing of briefs after receipt of transcripts. Thereafter, the arbitrator may extend the filing date for an additional two (2) weeks, upon request for extenuating circumstances. If, after the initial three (3) weeks for filing briefs, either party fails to request a two (2)-week extension, or if after requesting a two (2)-week extension the party fails to file their brief, it shall be considered a waiver of the right to brief the case and the arbitrator shall proceed to prepare and issue the award.

a.	The certifying party shall request the WERC to submit to the parties a list of names of five (5) persons suitable for selection as impartial referee.
b.	If the parties cannot agree upon one (1) of the persons named on the list, the parties shall strike a name alternately, beginning with the MTEA, until one (1) name remains. Such remaining person shall act as impartial referee. In subsequent selections, the parties shall alternate the first choice to strike a name.

The MTEA and all its bargaining unit employees agree that they shall not recriminate in any way against the Board and those active on its behalf or against other teachers or any Board employees as a result of their participation or non-participation in said strike or prestrike activities.

2.	The Board will provide the necessary funds for an actuarial report for a supplemental early retirement plan. The target date for completing the actuarial report will be April 1, 1982.
B.	LAYOFF PROCEDURE
All layoffs shall be based on inverse order of seniority within qualifications as set forth in the following procedures provided that the racial balance of schools is not disturbed.
1	SOLICIT QUALIFIED VOLUNTEERS FOR LAYOFF At least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to a layoff, the administration shall use the Staff Bulletin to solicit volunteers who wish to be considered for layoff. A qualified volunteer is an employee who is employed in a position identified for reduction and/or whose position can be filled by an employee who might otherwise be laid off. All employees who volunteer for layoff and who are qualified for volunteers shall be laid off first. An employee who volunteers for layoff shall volunteer for one (1) school year, after which the volunteer is subject to all recall procedures. If the layoff is not for the duration of the entire school year and if all employees other than volunteers are recalled within the volunteer's area of certification/licensure, the volunteers are then subject to the recall procedures. If there are more qualified volunteers than the number of positions to be reduced, volunteering for layoff shall be in order of the volunteer's system-wide seniority. No employee shall be involuntarily laid off if enough qualified volunteers are available.
2	CERTIFICATION/LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO EXERCISE SENIORITY. An employee must hold a full certification/license on May 15 in order for an employee to exercise seniority rights within that area of certification/licensure. An employee holding a temporary certification/license or

If it is not possible for an employee to verify (a), (b), or (c) no later than the organization day of the following school year, the employee shall not have seniority rights in the area of temporary certification/licensure, the area of a certification/license which has expired, or the area he/she sought additional certification/licensure. If an employee verified (a), (b), or (c) and fails to be eligible for (a), (b), or (c) by organization day of the following school year, he/she shall be replaced with the most senior employee on layoff having certification/licensure in the area in which the employee held temporary certification/licensure, held an expired license, or sought additional certification/licensure.
3	. EMPLOYEES IDENTIFIED FOR LAYOFF. The administration shall determine the number of employees system-wide to be laid off by subject areas, grade levels, certification/licensure areas, and/or other areas of assignment not included in the foregoing, and establish a list of qualified volunteers and other certified bargaining unit employees, by name, who have the least amount of system-wide seniority by their certification/licensure area(s) and/or other areas of assignment not included in the foregoing that is equal to the number identified above.
Bargaining unit members who have additional certification/licensure may use this certification to displace less senior employees in those areas of licensure.
C.	NOTIFICATION OF LAYOFF
1.	PRIOR NOTICE IN WRITING. Bargaining unit employees who have been identified under Part XII, Section B(3), for layoff, shall be notified in writing of the layoff by the Board at least thirty (30) days prior to said layoff. If an unforeseen reduction occurs in a state or federally funded program with less than thirty (30) days notice, and the district decides a layoff shall result therefrom, a layoff notice will be sent at least fifteen (15) days prior to layoff.
2.	NOTIFICATION TO MTEA. The MTEA will be given a list of those employees who have been tentatively identified for layoff at least five (5) days prior to the notice to the employee as specified in Part XII, Section C( 1).

b.	Vacancies not able to be filled by the procedures in Part XII, D(l)(a), above shall be filled by employees on layoff status in accordance with Part XII, Section F, of the contract.
2.	CURTAILMENT OF LEAVES DURING LAYOFF. Any employee who is curtailing a leave during a period of layoff shall be placed in a vacant position for which he/she is qualified, if the employee has greater seniority than other employees similarly qualified on layoff status. If the employee curtailing his/her leave does not have greater seniority as stated, then he/she shall not be allowed to curtail said leave.
3.	RETURNING FROM LEAVE DURING LAYOFF. An employee returning from leave during a period of layoff shall be placed in a vacant position for which he/she is qualified if the employee has greater seniority than other employees similarly qualified on layoff status.

8.	OTHER EMPLOYMENT. An employee on layoff shall not be prevented from securing other employment during the period he/she is laid off. The Board agrees that any laid-off employee who accepts other employment retains recall rights. If the employee is notified of a recall while employed with a different school district, the employee shall be allowed to conclude the school year with the other district provided there are employees on layoff in the employee's area of certification/licensure that can be recalled. If not, then the employee would be subject to the recall procedure.
9.	ACCUMULATED VACATION. An employee being laid off shall use his/her accumulated vacation prior to the effective date of the layoff. The employee may, at his/her option, retain accumulated vacation for use upon recall.
10.	SUMMER SCHOOL. Teachers on layoff status may be hired for summer school if they have applied and are hired according to the priorities for summer school employment set forth in Part VI, Section B, of the MBSD/MTEA teacher contract.

6	FAILURE TO RESPOND OR REFUSAL OF RECALL If an employee on layoff does not respond to the offer to be recalled within the ten (10) days or he/she refuses to be recalled, the employee then waives any further rights as set forth in Part XII, Section E, except those benefits which are prepaid prior to layoff. In the event that an employee is unable to report within the prescribed time limits by reason of illness, injury, or other personal emergency, he/she shall not forfeit his/her recall rights provided notice of such circumstances is given to the employer in writing within the time period that the employee is required to respond to the recall notice and provided he/she notified the employer when he/she is able to be recalled. Volunteers for layoff and employees on layoff who have accepted other employment with a different school district are subject to the recall procedures as modified by Sections B(l) and E(8).
7	NO NEW EMPLOYEES OR SUBSTITUTES IN VACANT POSITIONS No vacant position shall be filled by a substitute or a newly hired employee while there are employees on layoff who are qualified to fill the vacant position. The previous sentence is to be considered a waiver of Part V, Section M, of the contract while employees in the bargaining unit are on layoff in the certification/licensure area of the vacant position to be filled.
G. GENERAL PROVISIONS
1	SENIORITY OF ADMINISTRATORS/SUPERVISORS Computation of seniority for layoff shall include all years of service in the teacher bargaining unit plus up to three (3) years of service in an administrative/supervisory capacity.

APPLICATION OF APPENDIX A
1.	Teachers on the 1989-90 teacher and recreation specialist salary schedules will be placed on the 1990-91 adjusted teacher salary schedule after having their 1989-90 salary increased by five percent (5%). Placement on the appropriate lane and on the dollar amount in that lane of the 1990-91 salary schedule will not result in any loss of salary greater than twenty dollars ($20) after the five percent (5%) raise. The 1990-91 salary schedule reflects the 1989-90 adjusted salary schedule increased by five percent (5%). Employees whose salary exceeds any salary amount in their lane on the adjusted salary schedule will be "Red Circled." Red circled employees will receive the same percentage increase that is applied to the base of the salary schedule each year, but not to exceed the maximum differential shown on the following schedule:
BA	BA +16	School Year
$2,687.50	$1,887 $2,725.00	$1,925	1990-91 1991-92
The above reflects the maximum amount by which the red circled employee may exceed the top step of the lane for the noted school year.
Employees new to the bargaining unit will be placed on the 1990-91 salary schedule in the appropriate lane to reflect their degree, credits, and years of service. The BA base salary will no longer apply in determining the dollar amount value for prior experience. Prior experience as defined by the contract will involve placement on the salary schedule at the appropriate number of years and in the appropriate lane.
Effective with the 1990-91 school year, prior teaching experience of less than a full year will be recognized for placement on the salary schedule. The following two (2) examples illustrate the application:
a.	If an employee has full-time teaching experience (i.e., any work for which payment is made based on the teacher salary schedule) from another district of a semester in length, he/she shall be given his/her increment after one (1) semester of employment with the Board.
b.	If an employee has a year of half-time teaching experience with another district, he/she shall be given his/her increment after one (1) semester of employment with the Board.

In addition, the maximum amount of prior teaching experience will be increased from five (5) years based on the following schedule:
School Year	Years of Prior Experience	Years Granted on Salary Schedule
1990-91	6	6
1991-92	7	7
Effective July 1, 2002, and thereafter, newly employed teachers working with only a permit issued by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction shall be placed on the BA lane at step 0 of the teacher salary schedule (Appendix A).
After the completion of the initial year of employment, a permit teacher shall be advanced to step 1 of the BA lane of the teacher salary schedule. The teacher shall remain at this step and lane until he/she obtains a regular license from the DPI.
Upon successful completion of an approved certification program and the issuance of a regular license, the teacher shall be placed in the appropriate lane of the salary schedule consistent with the credits the teacher has earned and filed with the Department of Human Resources and moved to step 2 of the salary schedule.
Teachers employed prior to July 1, 2002, having only a permit issued by DPI shall be considered grandfathered to move up one step on the salary schedule during the 2002-03 school year. Such teachers shall not be granted additional step or lane advancement on the salary schedule until he/she is issued a regular license by the DPI. Upon successful completion of an approved certification program and the issuance of a regular license, the teacher shall be placed in the appropriate lane of the salary schedule consistent with the credits the teacher has earned and filed with the Department of Human Resources and moved to the next step of the salary schedule.
2 SALARY SCHEDULE
Effective July 1, 2001, all cells on the 2001-02 salary schedule will be increased by 1.25 percent.

Effective February 3, 2003, all cells on the 2002-03 salary schedule will be increased by 1.12 percent.
Effective July 1, 1999, and July 1, 2000, the increases for red-circled employees shall be equal to the dollar increase of step 13 of their respective divisions.
Effective July 1, 1992, an increment step shall be added to the maximums of the MA, MA+16, and MA+32 divisions having the following ratios to the BA base.
Division
Index Ratio
MA
MA+16
MA+32
1.9330
1.9867
2.07115
The July 1, 1992, and January 22, 1993, increases for red circled employees shall be equal to the dollar increase of step 12 of their respective divisions.
A teacher at the maximum of the MA, MA+16, or MA+32 division for one (1) year or more as of the beginning of the first semester of the 1992-93 school year shall move to the new maximum of his/her respective division effective at the beginning of the first semester of the f992-93 school year. A teacher at the maximum of the MA, MA+16, or MA+32 division for less than one (1) year as of the beginning of the first semester of the 1992-93 school year shall move to the new maximum of his/her respective division on his/her next increment date.
3.	The present policies for the evaluation of credits and the advancement between lanes shall continue for employees who were placed on the adjusted 1990-91 salary schedule with the exception that a lane move will result in a lateral movement on the salary schedule. For example, an employee moving from the BA lane, step 2, to the BA+16 lane would go to the BA+16 lane at step 2. The MA lane will continue to reflect an earned MA or equivalent of thirty-two (32) credits beyond the BA except for new employees beginning with the 1990-91 school year and subject to the rules stated in paragraphs. The credits necessary for movement between the various lanes will comprise a majority of college credits.

4.	Employees new to the bargaining unit beginning with the 1990-91 school year will need an earned MA degree to advance beyond the BA+16 lane. Employees who were members of the bargaining unit prior to June 30, 1990, may move beyond the BA+16 lane without an earned MA by June 30, 2000.
If an employee fails to move prior to July 1, 2000, he/she will remain in his/her lane until he/she earns an MA.
5.	If an employee is re-employed, the employee's salary at the time he/she left the district will be updated to reflect general increases and any increments to which the employee is entitled. The employee will then be placed on the adjusted salary schedule on the dollar amount in his/her lane that will not result in any loss of salary for the individual employee greater than twenty dollars ($20) or on the salary step applicable for newly hired teachers, whichever is greater.
6	INCREMENT DATES
a.	As of the 1991-92 school year, an employee who is hired or who has an increment date between August and January will have an increment date as of the beginning of the school year each year until the employee reaches the maximum of his/her salary lane, unless an adjustment to the increment date is necessary as set forth in paragraph 6(c) below. Employees hired for the second semester are considered to have a February increment date.
b.	As of the 1991-92 school year, an employee who is hired or who has an increment date between February and June will have an increment date as of the beginning of the second semester of the school year each year until the employee reaches the maximum of his/her salary lane, unless an adjustment to the increment date is necessary as set forth in paragraph (6)(c) below.
c.	Adjustments to increment dates will only be made if an employee is absent without pay for the semester. If this occurs, the employee's increment date would be moved forward to the beginning of the next semester. The present practice of granting increments for teachers on sabbatical leaves or study leaves shall continue. An employee who takes a study leave or sabbatical leave shall not receive an increment if the employee fails to earn the credits necessary for completion of the leave and curtails the leave before the end of the semester.

APPENDIX Q
SCHOOL INTERVIEWS/STAFFING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
INTERVIEWS
The following information is included in the contract to provide schools/programs with answers to questions commonly asked about the school interview process found in Part V, Section P:
1.	Are all schools eligible to use Part V, Section P, Reassignments Through School Interviews?
Yes. Any school/program which has at least one (1) full-time vacancy for the following school year known by May 1 may use this contract provision.
2.	What elements are necessary for a school/program to use the interview process under
Part V, Section P?
The school/program must have at least one (1) full-time teacher vacancy for the following school year known by May 1, the school/program must submit a request to interview, and the school/program must have a school interview team (or teams) as prescribed by contract.
3.	Who decides whether or not a school/program submits a request to interview ?
The threshold decision as to whether or not a school/program will do interviews ideally should be made jointly by the principal and teachers at each school/program. For many schools/programs, a consensus decision can be reached without the need for a formal vote.
In any school/program at which there is not a clear consensus in support of doing interviews, a written, secret ballot must be conducted by the building representative (BR). To do interviews under Part V, Section P, fifty-one percent (51%) of the certified teachers on the staff at the school/program must vote in favor of interviews.
"Teachers" include all members of the teacher bargaining unit assigned to the school/ program full-time, including counselors, speech pathologists, social workers, etc. Teachers assigned half-time to two (2) different schools have voting rights at both schools. Teachers assigned to a school for less than half-time do not have voting rights at that school.

4.	Does the decision to conduct interviews under Part V, Section P, automatically carry over to each new school year?
In February, any school which has participated in the interview process for at least two (2) staffing cycles may revoke that authority based upon an affirmative vote of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the certified teaching staff assigned to the school/program.
5.	Can a principal/program administrator require teachers to elect teacher members to establish an interview team?
No. Service on an interview team is strictly voluntary.
6.	May a principal/program administrator unilaterally submit a request to do interviews?
No.
7.	May the principal make the decision that the school governance council members will be in charge of conducting interviews for staff vacancies?
No. The interview team is responsible for conducting the interview process and making all decisions as to its operation, within the contract and applicable laws.
MEANING OF "VACANCIES KNOWN"
8.	What does the phrase "vacancies known for the following school year" mean?
"Vacancy" is a term of art that has been defined by past practice and grievance arbitration decisions. Vacancies are "known for the following school year" when the MPS Department of Human Resources receives a formal written notice of retirement or resignation, or a formal written request for a leave of absence, signed by a teacher.
In addition, all positions filled by teachers with DPI permits or interns in alternative certification programs are vacancies known for the following school year.
A school's/program’s plans to expand teacher positions for the next school year could meet the definition of vacancies known.
9.	How are positions vacant during the current school year treated?

The district continues to be obligated to fill any positions vacant where suitable candidates become available at anytime during the school year consistent with Part V, Section M.
However, positions that are vacant during the school year which are not filled by March 15 shall be considered vacancies known for the following school year and subject to the school team interview process. If a selection is made during the interview process, the district is no longer obligated to fill the position during the current school year.
10.	Which teacher vacancies may be filled by interviews?
Under the contract, the term "teacher" means all positions within the teacher bargaining unit.
For filling teacher vacancies through interviews, the contract provisions cover full-time teacher positions including classroom teachers, social workers, librarians, guidance counselors (both elementary and secondary), and specialists (art, music, physical education, etc.).
However, the interview provisions does not apply to speech pathologist, diagnostic teacher, and ESL teacher positions.
11.	If, for example, a third grade teacher submits a written notice to MPS before May 1 of his/her intent to retire at the end of the school year, must the principal list the vacancy as a third grade position?
No. As in the past, teachers have the right to make their preferences of assignment within a school known to principals, and principals have the "power of assignment" - the right to make teaching assignments within certification from among the existing faculty.
In this example, the principal could decide to move one (1) of the present fourth grade teachers to the third grade position that will become vacant next fall (based on the retirement). The principal's power of assignment could be exercised in response to a fourth grade teacher's request for a third grade assignment. In this example, the vacancy known by May 1 could properly be listed as a fourth grade position, as determined by the principal.
12.	If a teacher tells the administration that he/she wants to transfer, especially if that teacher has sufficient seniority to assume the transfer will be granted, can that transfer request be considered a known vacancy?

13.	Must a school advertise for all known vacancies if it wishes to participate in the interview process?
Yes. However, the school interview team will determine whom to interview and may decide not to interview any applicants for one (1) or more of the known vacancies.
COMPOSITION OF INTERVIEW TEAMS
14.	What are the contractual requirements for the school interview team?
To conduct interviews, the contract requires a school interview team "consisting of an on-site administrator, teachers, and at least one (1) parent. A majority of the team shall be teachers." Interns, permit teachers, and substitute teachers are ineligible to serve on a team.
The school/program may not conduct interviews unless an interview team is established, with teachers comprising a majority of the team members. In schools/programs with more than one (1) team, teachers must comprise the majority of each team.
In the operation of the school interview process, the principal serves as a member of the team. Each school team should determine who will chair the team. The principal may choose to assign an assistant principal to serve on the team(s), instead of the principal.
15.	Is there a minimum number of people who should serve on the interview team?
Yes. The minimum number is five (5) team members - an on-site administrator, three (3) teachers, and one (1) parent. (The only exception is a school that has no on-site administrator. At those sites, the team should consist of one [1] parent and two [2] teachers.)

16.	What does the contractual provision that "a majority of the team shall be teachers mean?
A majority of teachers means one (1) more than the number of non-teacher members. For example, if a team includes an administrator and two (2) parents, the team must include four (4) teachers.
17.	Should alternate team members be elected in case a situation arises in which a team member cannot participate when the interviews begin?
Yes. Teachers should elect an alternate for each team in case a teacher is prevented from serving on the team due to an illness or other unforeseen situation. Likewise, there should be at least one (1) parent alternate for each parent on an interview team.
Alternates should be elected at the same time as team members.
Alternates should receive training on the interview process, along with the team members at each school/program. As part of the training process, it should be made clear that alternates will serve only if needed prior to the start of the interviews for a particular vacancy.
Information shared during interviews is to be kept confidential. Accordingly, only team members will be allowed to participate in the interviews. Alternates will not be allowed to attend interviews as non-voting observers.
18.	Are alternates allowed to serve on the interview teams after one (1) or more of the applicants has been interviewed?
No. The integrity of the process is compromised if the composition of the team changes after any of the candidates have been interviewed.
19.	What if a team member is absent on the day an interview is scheduled?
Unless a duly-elected and trained alternate is available, the interview must be rescheduled. A fair process requires the presence of the same team members at all of the interviews held for a particular vacancy.

20.	May a school/program have more than one (1) interview team?
After the vacancies are determined, a school/program may decide that two (2) or more teams will serve its needs better than one (1) team.
Ideally, a decision to do multiple teams would be made jointly by the principal and teachers at the school. In most situations, a consensus decision can be reached without a formal vote.
Without a clear consensus in favor of multiple teams, the BR should conduct a written, secret ballot. To do multiple teams, a favorable vote by fifty-one percent (51%) of the teachers at the school/program is required.
21.	Should teachers get involved in the process of selecting parent members to the team ?
As a general rule, teachers should let parents decide on the parent team members.
22.	Can an MPS employee with a child attending the school where he/she works serve as a parent representative on that school’s interview team?
No. The school board policy on school governance councils, established on November 25, 1997, specifically excludes employees from serving as parent representatives on school councils. The board policy states: "A parent who is also a paid employee of his/her child's school shall not serve in the capacity of ‘parent member’ on the council, but may serve as a teacher representative or support-staff representative."
MPS has taken the position that the Board's policy on school governance councils applies to the question of employees serving as parent representatives on interview teams. This means that a teacher who has a child at the school may serve on the team only if elected as a teacher representative. An administrator who is a parent of a child at the school may serve as the onsite administrator team member, but not as a parent representative. Other employees at the school - educational assistants, secretaries, cooks, etc. - may not serve on a team at a school their child attends.
23.	What if a school/program cannot obtain parent participation on the interview team?
The contract clearly requires the participation of at least one (1) parent on the team. Without the required team members, a school cannot do interviews.

24.	What is meant by a "uniform process conducted by the BR" for the election of teachers to serve on a school interview team?
BR's must conduct a reasonable, fair, and democratic election process. Written notice of the election must be provided to all teachers at the school/program. There must be an opportunity for all teachers to be nominated and a reasonable period of time for voting by written, secret ballot.
25.	Which teachers are eligible to vote in the election of teacher team members for interview teams?
"Teachers" include all members of the teacher bargaining unit assigned to the school fulltime, including counselors, speech pathologists, social workers, etc. Teachers assigned halftime to two (2) different schools have voting rights at both schools. Teachers assigned to a school for less than half-time do not have voting rights at that school. Interns, permit teachers, and substitute teachers are ineligible to vote on a team.
Any teacher eligible to vote is also eligible to serve on the team.
26.	How should BR's handle the election of multiple teams?
In schools/programs which determine that the nature and number of vacancies dictate more than one (1) team, the BR should conduct a process that allows all teachers to be nominated for each team and gives all teachers the opportunity to vote for the members of each team.
For example, suppose a high school has one (1) vacancy in English, two (2) in science, and one (1) in LD, and the school decides to have three (3) interview teams. Nominations would be open to all teachers to serve on each of the three (3) teams, and all teachers would have the opportunity to vote for the members for each team. A social studies teacher could be elected to the LD vacancy team. The voting for the science vacancies team would not be limited to science department members. If elected, a teacher could serve on all three (3) teams. The BR would determine the mechanics of conducting the three (3) elections.
27.	Are teachers elected to school interview teams on a permanent basis?
No. Each February, the BR must conduct a new election of teacher team members.

RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE INTERVIEW TEAMS
28.	What are the rights and responsibilities of the school interview team?
School interview teams are empowered to determine which applicants they will interview, to conduct the interviews, and to select teachers who best fit the school's program and philosophy. If a team cannot reach consensus on a selection, agreement by a majority of the team is required to select an applicant.
Once a team has decided on which applicants to interview, it must interview all of them before discussing the candidates and making its selection. For example, suppose ten (10) teachers applied for a position. Based on the interview team's review of the applications, the team could decide to interview four (4) of the ten (10) teachers who applied. The team is then required to interview all four applicants and should not discuss any of the candidates until after the interviews are completed. Fairness requires that all applicants be given an equal opportunity for consideration.
MPS is responsible for providing training to those involved in interviews regarding discrimination laws and other statutes and regulations on how interviews must be conducted.
Teachers serving on interview teams are acting within the scope of their employment. The school board will defend and hold teachers harmless if legal action arises as a result of interviews.
29.	Does MPS plan to provide training on interviewing each school year?
Yes. Each year, training sessions will be made available to schools on a system-wide basis.
30.	Do the staff racial balance criteria, which were ordered by Federal Court in 1979, restrict the selection which a school interview team may make?
No. The compulsory features for staff racial balance that had been followed since 1979 have been removed from the contract. An interview team cannot be required to accept or reject an applicant based on the race of the candidate nor based on the racial make-up of the school's current faculty.
However, in accordance with Part I, Section H, of the contract, the Board and the MTEA are committed to cooperating to ensure that the professional staff at each school is racially diverse, in continuation of the Board's longstanding commitment to the faculty assignment

goals ordered by the Federal District Court in 1979. The Board and the MTEA make this commitment because they wish to avoid racial isolation of school faculties, and they believe that having racially and ethnically diverse faculty and staff at each school is educationally beneficial for all students.
31.	Does the contract provide teachers who serve on interview teams with any additional pay or compensatory time off for their service?
No. The contract does not provide additional pay and/or released time for this service.
32.	May interviews take place during the school day?
No. There is no contractual provision defining when interviews may be held. MPS has determined that all interviews must be held outside of the school day. Since teacher and parent service on interview teams is voluntary and unpaid, the scheduling should accommodate them, as well as the schedules of the applicants.
33.	Must interview team interview all applicants?
No. All applications for a vacancy at a school are given to the interview team. The interview team determines which applicant(s) it will interview.
34.	Does the interview team have the option of not selecting any of the applicants interviewed?
Yes.
35.	What happens to all of the notes, score sheets, and any other materials produced by interview team members after the process is completed?
MPS has directed the principals to permanently retain all materials - including personal notes - produced by all interview team members. Such documents may be considered as evidence if any legal action resulted from interviews.
36.	May interviews be taped?
No. MPS has determined that taping (audio or video) will not be permitted for school team interviews to fill teacher vacancies.

No.
RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF TEACHERS SEEKING INTERVIEW REASSIGNMENTS
38.	What are the rights and responsibilities of teachers seeking interview reassignments?
Teachers may apply for as many schools as they choose.
A teacher who submits an application is not guaranteed an interview; each school interview team determines whom it will interview.
Teachers who are interviewing have the right to withdraw their application^) by the close of business (5:00 p.m.) on the day following the interview. Withdrawal requires a written, inperson request (form is available in MPS’s Department of Human Resources, Certificated Staffing) by the teacher or his/her representative. Failure to withdraw an application may result in the teacher’s assignment to the school at which he/she interviewed.
Teachers who obtain an interview reassignment may not exercise their rights to a voluntary transfer under the contractual seniority or interview transfer provisions for three (3) years.
39.	If a teacher is selected and confirmed for a vacancy at the first school/program where he/she interviews, should the teacher go through the additional scheduled interviews?
No. The teacher should cancel any further interviews - in fairness to the interview teams at the other schools/programs.
40.	Where do teachers obtain application forms to apply for interview reassignments?
The MPS Department of Human Resources will make copies of the application forms available in all schools no later than April 1. Applications will also be available on the Human Resources Website. The MTEA and the MPS central office will also have copies of the form. (Please note that individual schools can also require applicants to submit additional information to the school.)
41.	Schools/programs have the option of requiring applicants to provide information in addition to the interview application form. How will this be handled?

The telephone numbers of schools/programs which require additional information from the interview applicants will be noted on the listing of schools with "vacancies known" posted in all schools/programs.
The principal/program administrator in such schools/programs will distribute the school's additional information form to all potential applicants either at the school's informational meeting or in response to requests from interested teachers.
Teachers who apply will be responsible for submitting the additional information to the principal at the school requesting it. This information must go directly to the school - not to the central office.
However, the application form for interviews for all schools must be submitted to the MPS Department of Human Resources - not to the schools.
Applicants are solely responsible for the timely filing of a separate application form for each school/program they are interested in applying to and for submitting any additional information requested by a school/program.
42.	Can a teacher who received a seniority transfer within the last three (3) years seek an interview transfer?
No. The contractual limit on receiving another transfer within three (3) years of obtaining a voluntary seniority transfer applies to both seniority and interview transfers.
43.	When are teachers selected by interview teams considered "assigned" to their new schools?
All of the "assignments" made during the May, June, and July interview process are considered tentative until the start of the next school year. They are treated the same way as the "on paper" reassignments made during the regular seniority transfer process each summer.
It is anticipated that most of the vacancies for the next school year which are known by May 1 will not change. However, unforeseen changes may become necessary after the school board adopts the budget for the coming year and/or after the student enrollment projections for the next school year are made.

If there are changes in teacher needs known by June 30 which would result in a teacher who has been selected by the interview process displacing a teacher who has been working at the school, the tentative assignment of the teacher selected by the interview process would be rescinded.
In the event that an interview assignment is rescinded by June 30, the selected teacher would remain at his/her school and be given an opportunity to submit a voluntary transfer request for consideration when the contractual seniority transfer procedures are implemented during the summer. Likewise, if that teacher's remaining at his/her school results in another teacher at the school being excessed, that teacher would be given an opportunity to complete the standard reassignment form used by excessed teachers.
Although extremely unlikely, a situation may arise late in the summer which results in an anticipated vacancy not materializing. If so, the teacher selected by the interview process would remain at his/her school - rather than displacing a teacher who has been working at the school which made the interview selection.
On organization day, teachers who are reassigned through the interview process, as well as teachers reassigned through the seniority transfer process, are considered permanently "assigned" to their new schools. As in the past, if excessing takes place based on the third Friday student count, newly-assigned teachers would be treated as assigned to the school, the same as all other teachers at the school. Excessing would be done by contract, based on system-wide seniority.
STAFFING
Agreements between the MTEA and the administration concerning various staffing questions:
QUESTION 1
When the enrollment in a building decreases to a point that one (1) teacher must be reassigned, who would be reassigned first, a fully certified teacher or a second semester intern?
The agreement as to question 1 is that volunteers would be reassigned first and if no volunteers, then the intern would be reassigned in his/her area of preparation (primary, intermediate, or secondary, etc.). If there was no position for the intern, then the regular

teacher with least seniority would be reassigned. This teacher would be able to replace a newly hired teacher in another school following conditions as set forth in question 2 below.
QUESTION 2
When a teacher is dropped from one (1) building because of a decrease in enrollment and that teacher has some system-wide seniority, may he/she take the position of a newly assigned teacher in another school?
The agreement as to question 2 was that newly hired teachers will be tentatively assigned until after staffs are balanced. Under this procedure, an experienced teacher who is out of assignment because of an enrollment drop will be offered an assignment of a newly hired teacher. If the teacher refuses the assignment, he/she will be placed on day-to-day assignment until such time that an opening occurs. At that time, he/she will be placed. It is understood that while the teacher will not be offered a choice of assignments, the MPS Department of Human Resources will accommodate the teacher's desired assignment to the extent possible.
QUESTION 3
Where a kindergarten teacher is assigned two (2) one-half (.5) positions and one (1) of those positions closes, does that kindergarten teacher have the right to bump a person with less seniority into the half-time position so that he/she may move into the full-time position that exists in one (1) of the buildings at which he/she is working?
The agreement was that if a kindergarten teacher on a regular, full-time assignment is required to shift to a split of two (2) schools, the school from which he/she is split will be considered the primary assignment and his/her seniority rights will stand at that school. In the event that a teacher originally, or due to being moved out of the school, is placed in two (2) schools simultaneously, the school to which he/she is assigned in the morning will be the primary school and he/she may exercise his/her seniority at that school.
QUESTION 4
What happens to teachers who are excessed from one (1) building and put on day-to-day assignment in terms of their being reassigned to another building? Are they given a choice as to the schools they would like, are they assigned in any form of seniority, or are they arbitrarily assigned by the personnel office?
