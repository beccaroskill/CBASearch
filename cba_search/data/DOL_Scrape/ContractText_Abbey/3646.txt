J.	When an employee moves from one salary classification to another, s/he will be placed on his/her new salary lane in such a manner that places the employee one step above his/her former hourly wage. Should this not qualify an employee for a higher step placement than s/he would have received had s/he been hired directly into that position, the employee will be placed into that step determined by Section K(l) below. However, when an employee moves from one salary lane to another within the same salary classification, s/he will move laterally, retaining his/her former step placement on the new lane.
K.	No employee’s salary level will be decreased due to a reclassification of his/her position. Any such employee will move to his/her new salary lane and step but will have his/her salary level frozen at the present dollar value of his/her base rate of pay until such time as the dollar value of his/her new salaiy level equals or surpasses his/her frozen value. At that point the employee will no longer continue to have his/her salary level frozen.

2.	Placement
a.	Each cost center will, compile a list of all positions to be eliminated for the following school year. At that time the cost center head will also identify the least senior employee at that cost, center currently working-within the job classification in which the position(s) is/are being eliminated. Pursuant to the procedures outlined in subparagraph (b) below, the cost center head, prior to May 20 of any given school year, will transmit- to the Human Resources Office a listing of all positions eliminated, employees surplussed, and vacancies anticipated.
b.	The employee(s) to be surplussed, at each cost center will be the least senior at that cost center currently working within the job classification of. the position(s) to be eliminated; provided, however; that an employee who has had his/her position eliminated may elect to remain at that cost center should s/he possess more seniority than another employee at that cost center holding a position for which the employee is qualified in his/her present job classification-. In such a case, the employee possessing the least seniority at that cost center will be surplussed. An employee whose position has been, eliminated must be given the opportunity to elect to remain at his/her cost center in another position in his/her former or a lower job classification for which s/he is qualified, and must exercise his/her election, prior to surplus lists being transmitted from the cost center- to the Human Resources Office (with the appropriate salary adjustment).
c.	Upon receipt of surplus lists from all cost centers, the Human Resources Office will compile a listing, in seniority order, of all employees who have been surplussed. That listing, as well as a listing .of all vacancies county-wide (excluding Board approved charter schools), will be posted for a period of five working days. Employees' may update their preference? lists through the conclusion of this five day period.
d.	All employees will be placed into vacant assignments on a seniority basis based upon their expressed preferences, (excluding Board approved charter schools). The most senior surplussed employee will be considered first and placement will continue on a seniority basis. Each employee must be certified and endorsed (where required by the State) for the, assignment selected. During the placement process, if no vacancy remains for which an employee is certified, the employee will replace the least senior employee in either the north or south county region (as selected by the employee) in his/her area of certification. The employee may elect to switch his/her region selection and pick from vacancies in, the other location. This process will continue until there remains no employee on the surplus list who has more seniority than any employee in the district holding a position in that area of certification. Those employees who are junior to all others in the district within their areas of certification will thus be identified. Those junior employees, for whom there are no positions available within their areas of certification, will be laid off Those laid off employees will have recall rights within the parameters set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.
e.	During the placement process, should an employee not be reassigned due to his/her failing to be assigned to one of the work sites stated on his/her preference form or because a Preference Form was not filed, management will attempt to contact said employee to explain to him/her those positions remaining available at that time.

C.	Return to Former Placement
Any employee displaced from his/her position due to the implementation of those procedures described above will be able to return to a position vacancy at his/her last former work site at his/her present or former job classification for which s/he is qualified or in the case of an employee who has suffered an involuntary reduction in his/her job classification, to any position vacancy, county-wide on his/her former job classification should such a position become available within a period of five years. Such return will be automatically granted upon receipt of the employee’s request and will be undertaken on a seniority basis in the order specified in Article XVI. It will be the employee’s responsibility to monitor such opportunities.
D.	Notification

a.	Employees receiving longevity payments under the former classified longevity payment system will continue to have the dollar value of the payment frozen until such time as the payment would be greater under the new system. No employee will receive a decrease in his/her longevity payment due to the implementation of these procedures.
b.	Longevity payments will be based upon total time of employment as an appointed employee (except as modified below) with the School Board of Sarasota County as a member of either the classified or instructional bargaining units. It will be the employee’s responsibility to apply for the recapture of prior service time in cases where service has been broken.
c.	For purposes of determining the length of continuous service for longevity purposes, an employee must have worked in an active duty capacity, one day more than one half of normal work year. Multiple partial years of service may not be combined. Active service is defined to include time on duty plus any time the employee is on any form of paid leave or worker’s compensation leave.
d.	Longevity payments are calculated by multiplying the appropriate multiplier (found in Appendix A of the respective agreements) by the Step 1 amount of the employee’s present salary lane.
e.	Each employee must have entered the appropriate longevity salary grouping by October 1 of any given school year in order to qualify for that grouping’s bonus payment. For example, for an employee to qualify for the 19 to 21 year grouping, s/he must have started his/her 19th year of service prior to October 1.

Interaction Management, The Challenge of Leadership 2 hours
This is an introductory module dealing with the Key Principles of the Interaction Management Training Program. The focus is the leadership role of the Head Custodian.
Improving Employee Performance ................4 hours
As a director of work activities, one of the Head Custodian/Senior Head Custodian’s major responsibilities is keeping the output of the employees in the work group at certain standards of quality and quantity. To meet the goals/standards established for the job, each employee must be willing to do his/her share. When an employee is under-performing, the Head Custodian/Senior Head Custodian should take action. The key is to handle the discussion with the employee in such a manner that s/he is motivated to improve performance. The employee must be motivated. There is no other way to successfully improve the performance of the work group.
Class size maximum - 12
Improving Work Habits .........................4 hours
Directors of work activities are often faced with the problem of an employee who is developing a poor work habit, such as sloppy housekeeping, inappropriate dress, unsafe procedures, improper use of the telephone, late reports, etc. A poor work habit which develops in one employee may spread to the rest of the work group. Therefore, it must be handled immediately and effectively. A poor work habit should be dealt with as soon as it appears because habits are much easier to change as they are developing than after they have become established. The effective Head Custodian/Senior Head Custodian notices the work habits of the employees in the work group. When an employee starts to develop a poor work habit, the Head Custodian/Senior Head Custodian takes immediate action to change the habit before it becomes a bigger problem.
Class size maximum - 12
Maintaining Improved Performance...............4 hours
When an employee’s performance improves, it is imperative that the. Head Custodian acknowledge that improvement in a way that will encourage the employee to maintain the improvement. While it may seem easy to encourage employees to maintain improvement, it is really a very difficult situation to handle effectively. Poor handling of this situation can be seen by the employee as an insincere compliment. Insincerity (either real or perceived) will not encourage the employee to maintain the improved performance.
Class size maximum - 12
Utilizing Effective Follow-Up Action ..........4 hours
When an employee’s unsatisfactory performance or poor work habit continues even after discussions of the problem, the Head Custodian needs to take action. This module will help

build the skills to conduct effective follow-up discussions, giving the employees another chance to solve the problem before disciplinary action is taken.
Class size maximum - 12
Handling Employee Complaints ...................4 hours
Every employee has a complaint from time to time. Sometimes . the Head Custodian can take actions which will resolve the complaint; at other times he/she can do little more than listen to the complaint. At all times it is important that the Head Custodian establish a climate which encourages employees to bring their complaints to him/her. Employees will voice their complaints no matter what the work climate. If there is an open climate, the complaint will be voiced to the Head Custodian. If a relatively closed climate has been established, the complaint will probably be voiced only to other employees.
Class size maximum - 12
Delegating Responsibility.......................4 hours
Delegating allows the head custodian time to devote to other activities that will build a more efficient and effective work unit. Effective delegation is probably the most direct and effective way of developing employees. In this module the custodian will develop skills to utilize subordinates effectively by allocating work that is accompanied by responsibility and accountability.
Class size maximum - 12
Overcoming Resistance to Change.................4 hours
The head custodian has a direct impact upon employee acceptance and involvement whenever changes must be implemented. Managing change means developing strategies to help employees through the transition and to assist those who are having difficulty adjusting during the change period. This module builds skills to effectively work with employees to help them overcome real or perceived barriers to making the change work.
Class size maximum - 12
Reducing Tardiness .............................4 hours
Tardiness is a problem that most head custodians have to deal with from time to time. It is important that the tardiness be dealt with effectively and promptly because tardiness causes several other problems. The tardy employee may get behind in his/her work. Also, other employees may be unhappy and wish to have the same “privilege.” The result may be that other employees complain about the tardy employee or come in late themselves.
Class size maximum - 12
