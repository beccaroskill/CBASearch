ARTICLE 1
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
In consideration of the covenants set forth herein, the Employer agrees that all of its employees within the jurisdiction of the Union shall be employed under the terms hereof and the Union agrees that all employees represented by it hereunder will work according to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the term thereof.

ARTICLE 2
RECOGNITION
A.	The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent with respect to wages, rates of pay, hours of employment and specific conditions of employment in a unit consisting of all employees in the classifications of work listed in Appendix A, employed by the Disneyland Hotel, Disney’s Paradise Pier Hotel, and Disney’s Grand Californian Hotel located in Anaheim, California, regardless of membership status or whether such employees are regular or temporary, part-time or full-time.
B.	It is further understood and agreed that the Employer’s recognition of the Union shall not constitute an agreement, express or implied, by any other employer, including but not limited to the following:
1.	Any corporation, business, or asset that is currently or subsequently owned,
purchased, acquired, developed, constructed, improved, operated, managed, owned, or other wise run by the Employer and any/or parent, subsidiary, or related entity or corporation, or
2.	Any third party Vendor or Concessionaire that employees at the Disneyland Resort Hotels, to recognize the Union. For purposes of this Agreement, other Disney entities such as Disney Quest, club Disney, ESPN Stores, etc., shall be considered third party Vendors or Concessionaires.

D.	Management and non-bargaining unit employees of the Employer will not perform bargaining unit work on a regular, re-occurring basis. However, it is recognized by the Parties that due to the nature of the Resort Hotel business, there are times when management and nonbargaining employees of the Employer may step in for short periods of time to ensure that Guest Service is maintained. For example, this may occur when Guest flow fluctuates dramatically at specific unit/locations or with changes in the weather leading to a potential decline in Guest Service. When staffing is short due to these types of events, management will make every effort to call in additional employees if doing so would alleviate the situation in a timely and efficient manner. The Employer will not intentionally schedule insufficient employees to create a short staffing circumstance.
In addition, when “unforeseeable circumstances” occur, it is recognized that management has a right and an obligation to do whatever it takes to get the job done. Examples of “unforeseeable circumstances” include natural disasters, major equipment failure, and injuries to guests or employees.

b.	Pre-approved vacation requests for the periods listed below must be submitted on a timely basis and the approved vacations (as determined by the Employer’s need for the employee’s services) will be posted by the dates listed below:

ARTICLE 19 SENIORITY
Seniority shall be utilized in the following manner:
A.	Company seniority, defined as the first day worked as a Regular employee for the Employer, shall be utilized to determine vacation eligibility.
B.	Unit/Location seniority, defined as the first day worked, as a Regular employee in a specific job classification, in a specific unit, shall be utilized for preference in work schedules, layoffs, and recalls, within each unit and job classification. Each restaurant, bar, etc., is considered a separate unit for purposes of unit seniority. Where employees possess the same unit seniority, preference will be given to the employee with the greater company seniority. Where practicable, based upon filling guest needs and/or requirements, the Employer shall attempt to schedule maximum hours per shift and provide the opportunity for the more senior employees to bid for the greater hours unless by employee request, bid, preference, leaves of absence, holidays and/or vacations the more senior employees shall receive greater hours than less senior employees based on the principles of seniority; however, this shall not be considered a guarantee of a forty-hour (40 hr.) workweek.
C.	In those units/locations* that have an established day and night crew and schedule, it is agreed that employees, regardless of seniority, may not claim a position on a different shift/crew until an opening occurs through attrition, the creation of an additional position/schedule, or any other bonafide on-going opening. When an available position occurs on any shift it shall be available to all employees within the unit/location on the basis of seniority where skill and ability are relatively equal as determined by the Employer. An employee who accepts a position on a different shift/crew shall initially fill the shift which is available but will thereafter be scheduled on the basis of their unit/location seniority if changes in the schedule occur.
20
The following units/locations have an established day/night crew and schedule:
D/L Hotel
Granvilles Front of House
Hook’s Point Front of House
Goofy’s Culinary
Room Service Culinary
Granvilles Culinary
Bake Shop
Custodial
Room Service
Paradise Pier Hotel
-	Main Kitchen
-	Stewarding
- Yamabuki’s
D.	In no event shall any employee, regardless of seniority, have the right to any specific assignment or schedule in the absence of an opening, except when returning from an authorized leave of absence or vacation or when there is a significant change in the nature of the operation within the specific unit. In the event of such a change the revised schedule, as determined by the Employer, will be open to affected employees and the principles of seniority will be observed where skill and ability are relatively equal as determined by the Employer.
Where requests are made simultaneously, vacation periods and leaves of absence will be awarded by seniority. Requests not to be scheduled on a holiday will be awarded by seniority. Every effort will be made to assure that the preferences are protected. This language is not meant to imply that the Employer must grant any request for time off when the needs of the business, as determined by the Employer, do not allow it.
A Casual-Temporary employee who is converted to Regular status shall receive a vacation accrual date which is identical with his most recent seasonal hire date.
E.	Seniority will be lost under the following circumstances:
1.	Discharge for just cause.
2.	Resignation
3.	Layoff and not recalled within six (6) calendar months.
4.	Loss of unit seniority:
a.	Transfer to new location
b.	Change in job classification
F.	Newly hired or rehired Regular employees shall be considered to be on probationary status during the first sixty (60) calendar days of employment with the Employer. During the probationary period, an employee shall be subject to termination at the sole and absolute discretion of the Employer and such termination shall not be subject to grievance and/or arbitration by either the Union or the employee. All other terminations shall be for just cause only.
G.	The seniority principles outlined in Article 19. Seniority shall not apply where employees are being promoted from a bargaining unit classification to a temporary non-bargaining unit management position. When this occurs the employee shall maintain his or her classification for a period of fifty-two (52) consecutive payroll weeks for purposes of transferring back to such
21
classification. The above referenced fifty-two (52) weeks may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties.
H.	An employee accepting a full-time position with the Union shall be entitled to return to their former position with no loss of seniority if they return to their former position within fifty-two (52) consecutive payroll weeks from the date of accepting such position with the Union.
See the Disney’s Paradise Pier Hotel Specific Language Section for more information.
CROSS UTILIZATION
Each Resort Hotel may utilize employees from either of the other two (2) Resort Hotels when Regular employees are not available at straight time rates of pay. When utilizing employees from one Hotel to another, the Company will first look to the Hotels in the order in which they were built and/or acquired, i.e., DLH, PPH and GCH. Seniority will then be utilized in the job classification where additional labor is needed. The Company will first offer the additional hours/shift to available employees in seniority order who are available at straight time rates of pay. If more senior Regular employees choose not to work, the Company will schedule employees in reverse order until all needed hours/shifts have been filled. This provision shall not be used to circumvent seniority.
If Regular employees are not available at straight time rates of pay from the Hotel receiving the request for additional labor and mandatory overtime must be scheduled in the Hotel originating the request, the Hotel originating the request shall schedule its own employees for the mandatory overtime. Employees from the Hotel receiving the request for additional labor shall not be required to work mandatory overtime in the Hotel originating the request for additional labor.

To be entitled to holiday pay a Regular employee must have completed their probationary period and also must have worked his last scheduled workday prior to the holiday, and their next regularly scheduled shift immediately following the holiday, unless excused by the Employer.
2.	Any work performed on recognized holidays by eligible employees shall be paid for at two (2) times the employees regular rate of pay.
3.	Any Regular employee who is regularly scheduled to work on recognized holiday and who does not work as scheduled shall not receive holiday pay in accordance with Section 1.
22
4.	Eligible employees on Personal Leaves of Absence or layoff of five (5) days or more, with the exception of Workers' Compensation, shall not receive holiday pay if holiday falls within leave period or layoff period.
5.	An eligible employee who fails to return to work immediately following a paid holiday, as scheduled, may qualify for holiday pay provided the employee proves satisfactorily to the Employer that the failure to return was caused by personal illness, injury or death in the immediate family and provided that the employee returns to work within thirty (30) calendar days following the holiday.
6.	In each unit/location, by job classification and by descending order, regular status employees will be offered the opportunity to not work on a recognized holiday.

ARTICLE 32
PROMOTIONS AND TRANSFERS
There will be no permanent changes in job classification or transfer to different units/locations without mutual consent between the Employer and employee, unless necessitated by business or operational needs (i.e., special skills or abilities, lack of qualified employees in a particular unit/location.) Under these circumstances, the Employer may unilaterally transfer people as needed, within their job classification. The decision to transfer employees would not be made in an arbitrary and capricious manner. The decision by the Company will be subject to the grievance procedure concerning whether or not the decision was arbitrary and capricious. Temporary transfers at Employers direction will not adversely affect seniority. In order to provide the employee with the opportunity to transfer from one department to another and to further provide for promotions, the Employer agrees to post available job openings within the bargaining unit for a period of five (5) days. Lead opportunities shall be posted for seven (7) days. During that posting period, the Employer shall not be limited from filling the available opening temporarily on an immediate basis or from any source on a first come first serve basis. Qualified employees shall be permitted to bid on available openings and where skill and ability are considered by the
32
Employer to be relatively equal, the Employer shall offer qualified employees on the basis of bargaining unit seniority, first; unit seniority, second; and where both seniorities are equal, Company seniority shall prevail.

If the Employer determines that the employee is unqualified in the new position, the Employer shall return said employee to the previously held position immediately with no loss of unit seniority in the previous unit. If the employee requests a return to the previous position during the probationary period, that employee will be returned to the first available opening without loss of unit seniority. The Employer's determination as referenced above shall not be arbitrary or capricious in nature.
ARTICLE 33

ARTICLE 36
DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE POLICY
1.	The Employer and the Union recognize that it must endeavor to provide safe and efficient operations for the protection and benefit of the general public, its guests and its employees. As part of its effort to achieve that goal, it must require that its work be performed by employees who do not use illegal drugs or misuse alcohol as follows. In implementing this Drug and Alcohol policy, the Employer and the Union encourage employees with a substance abuse problem to voluntarily come forward and seek medical treatment, as it is the goal of this procedure to offer employees the opportunity to seek treatment for substance abuse in order that they may avoid the necessity of discipline by the Employer for illegal use/misuse of drugs and/or alcohol. Notwithstanding this objective, the Employer retains the right to discipline employees who violate this policy, consistent with the above stated goals. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "drugs" or "drug tests" shall include both drugs and alcohol, as appropriate.
2.	Bargaining unit employees will be subject to drug testing under the following circumstances:
(a)	Drug tests for bargaining unit employees may be required where there is an objective reasonable suspicion that an employee has an in-system presence of drugs on the job. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "employee" or "bargaining unit employee" includes not only persons employed in positions covered by the collective bargaining agreement, but also persons being recalled into such positions.
(b)	Drug tests for bargaining unit employees may be required as part of a post-mishap investigation in cases where:
1.	The individual(s) subject to testing is directly linked to the mishap.
2.	The mishap resulted in death, injury requiring medical treatment other than basic first aid, or property damage estimated to exceed $5,000.
3.	Testing associated with a mishap will take place as soon as possible, under the circumstances.
(c)	In the event that any government agency duly concerned with Disneyland advises the Company that employees in specified classifications will be required to undergo job certification physical examinations, including drug tests as a condition of future employment, the Union shall be given immediate notice of any such requirement or proposed requirement. Such testing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures established by this Agreement and shall not commence until the Union and the Company have had a reasonable opportunity to discuss the impact of the government directive.
3.	An employee will not be tested under Section 2(a) above unless his conduct or other related circumstances provide an objective reasonable basis to believe that the employee may have ingested drugs or alcohol and/or is suffering from impairment of some sort while on the job site. (An objective reasonable basis would include, but not be limited to, slurred speech, unsteady gait, glazed eyes, dilated pupils, odor of alcohol, and/or erratic behavior.) Such observation will be confirmed by another member of management wherever possible.
35
4.	Any employee directed for testing shall be entitled to request the presence of a Union representative in pre-test meetings with management. Provided a Union representative has been requested, no specimen will be collected until the Union representative can discuss the matter with management and/or the employee. The Union agrees that the procedures described in Sections 3 and 4 shall not operate in a manner that will impede timely collection of a biological specimen. Refusal to provide a biological specimen will result in immediate discharge without an opportunity at a later date to reconsider/retract the refusal.
5.	Any employee who tests negative to any drug test under this Agreement (other than random tests as a follow-up to rehabilitation) shall be compensated for any scheduled hours lost, at the appropriate wage rate. Hours lost under such circumstances shall be treated as time worked for purposes of overtime premium eligibility.
6.	Specimen collection for a drug test will be accomplished in a manner compatible with employee dignity and privacy. Specimen collection shall be accomplished at the laboratory facilities utilized by the Company, currently CDT on-site mobile testing or St. Joseph Hospital. There will be no strip searches or opposite sex observation. In the usual case, the Company will not observe specimen production, but the Union agrees that specimen production may be closely monitored in those cases where the Company has an objective reason to believe that the employee may attempt to contaminate a test specimen.
7.	Test specimens shall be sent only to Laboratory facilities certified by an appropriate federal or state agency. If a dispute should arise over the selection of drug test Laboratories, such dispute shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure. The Union agrees, in order to begin the program, that UCI or Medical Center of Garden Grove are acceptable test facilities, but reserves the right to withhold approval of UCI or Medical Center of Garden Grove with adequate notice, in the event that their status as certified drug Laboratories should change in the future. The Laboratory(s) selected must, upon request, identify the drugs tested for, the methods used, the manufacturers of the test, the analytical limits and levels used, the methods of reporting results and the chain of custody procedures used to produce forensically acceptable test results. To be qualified under this section, the laboratory must participate in a program of "blind proficiency" testing where they analyze samples sent by an independent party. The laboratory(s) selected will make such results available to an authorized representative of the Company and the affected employee. At the employee's request, the Manager of Labor Relations, will report test results to the Union Business Manager. All samples will be tested twice. The first test may be a screening test, but positive screen test results may be confirmed by the Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or an equivalent scientifically accepted method of confirmation. All final positive tests results will be reviewed by a toxicologist or a physician prior to release and only confirmed results will be reported to the employer.
8. The standard drug test thresholds for positive screen and GC/MS confirmation tests shall be as follows:
DRUG	EMIT SCREEN CUT-OFF	CONFIRMATION CUT-OFF
Marijuana	lOOng/ml	lOOng/ml
Cocaine	300ng/ml	150ng/ml
Opiates	300ng/ml	300ng/ml
Amphetamines	lOOOng/ml	500ng/ml
Phencyclidine	25ng/ml	25ng/ml
36
In the event that the Company elects to utilize tests other than the EMIT screen or the GC/MS Confirmation, the Company will give the Union written notice of the test methodology used and the threshold levels employed. Positive thresholds for any other test methodologies will be reviewed with the Union before they are applied. Any dispute over the acceptability of such alternative test methodologies or the positive test threshold to be applied shall be resolved through the grievance and arbitration procedure.
9.	The laboratory shall preserve a sufficient aliquot specimen as to permit independent confirmatory testing by the Union and follow-up re-testing at the request of the Union or the employer. The laboratory shall endeavor to notify the employer and the Union of positive test results within two (2) working days after receipt of the specimen. The Union or employee may request a re-test within three (3) working days from notice of positive test result. Additionally, or as an alternative, the Union may have the sample tested at a certified laboratory of its choice. Should any test result be negative, the Company and the Union may jointly select a third certified laboratory and have the sample tested. The results of the various tests will be considered by the Company in determining the appropriate disciplinary action.
10.	Initial tests and re-tests requested by the Company will be paid by the Company; costs of retests for reconciliation will be split between the employee and the Company. In the event the Company test is proven to be a false positive, the employee shall be reimbursed for cost of test procedures paid for by the employee.
11.	The drug test laboratory and the specimen collection facility must: establish and maintain a forensically acceptable chain of custody.
12.	Where employees are required under this policy to submit blood samples for alcohol testing, the samples will be taken in a appropriate medical facility. The medical facility and laboratory will use the same or equivalent chain of custody procedures and exercise the same or an equivalent level of professional care and scientifically accepted standards and procedures in the collection and testing of blood samples for the presence of alcohol as with urine samples for the presence of drugs. For the purposes of this policy, if a test reveals the presence of alcohol at a level of .08% or more by weight, it shall be presumed that the employee has violated this policy. If the test reveals the presence of alcohol in excess of .05% by weight, but less than .08%, it will not automatically be presumed that this policy has been violated. The results of the test will be considered along with all other relevant, information (e.g. employee conduct, speech, performance, etc.) in determining whether the employee is in violation of this policy. If a test reveals the presence of alcohol of less than .05% by weight, it shall be presumed that the employee is not under the influence of alcohol in violation of this policy.
13.	Test results shall be communicated by the laboratory to the Employers medical officials or Manager of Labor Relations. The Company shall be responsible for maintaining confidentiality of test records and test results will be communicated to job site management strictly on a "need to know" basis. Employee drug test records shall not be released outside the Disneyland medical department unless required by administrative action initiated by the employee or the Union. The employee shall be entitled to written notification of positive drug test results. Copies of such reports will be provided to the Union when authorized by the affected employee.
14.	When and if it becomes necessary to impose discipline for drug-related conduct or job performance, discipline will be judged by the contractual just cause standard and will be subject to
37
the grievance/arbitration procedure. Except to the extent the employee(s) withholds consent as to particular documents personal to him, the Company agrees to provide the Union with whatever documentation or information the Union reasonably requires to process the grievance and/or arbitration. By establishing this drug policy, neither the Company nor the Union waive any legal rights. The parties agree that this drug policy shall not diminish the rights of individual employees under state or federal law relating to drug testing.
15.	The employer recognizes that employees have a right to privacy and that any adverse action taken against an employee for off-duty conduct shall take into account the employee's right to privacy, the impact of the employee's conduct on his job performance, and the Company's image and reputation. Any disciplinary action for such drug-related conduct will be subject to the grievance procedure with respect to any alleged off-duty related conduct. The Company will attempt to balance the employee's right to privacy in his off-duty time with other legitimate job-related concerns in weighing the contractual propriety of disciplinary action.
16.	Subsequent to the circumstances set forth in 2a and 2b above, and 17 below, random drug testing of employees will be permitted only as a follow-up to rehabilitation or after disciplinary action has been imposed. Such random drug testing (not to exceed one (1) time per quarter) will be allowed for a reasonable period of time after rehabilitation or disciplinary action has been imposed, not to exceed one (1) year.
17.	Any employee who voluntarily comes forward and/or admits to the use of drugs will not be subject to discipline, but will be referred to the Company's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for rehabilitation. Said employee shall be placed on a leave of absence [not to exceed the time limits as outlined in Section 16 (Leave of Absence)] until his rehabilitation program is completed or until he provides medical documentation that his presence on the job will not jeopardize his own health and safety, or the health and safety of others.
ARTICLE 37

Sideletter of Agreement
This sideletter of agreement dated June 8, 2004, shall be between Disneyland Resort Hotels, Division of Walt Disney World Company (“Company” or “Employer”), and the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Union, Local 681 (“Union”). This sideletter pertains to the Porterage Service and Storage Fees at the Disneyland Resort Hotels.
During the implementation of the 2004 H.E.R.E. Agreement, the parties discussed the issue of selling and negotiating Porterage Service and Storage Fees. The parties hereby agree that effective on June 8, 2004 the Company, in addition to the current practice of attempting to sell porterage to all groups; will attempt to sell porterage service to the following two categories of groups regardless of the groups’ mode of arrival to the Resort Hotels:
(A)	Business, corporate incentive groups when room and tax are paid by the respective companies.
Examples: Bank of America, Washington Mutual, 24 Hour Fitness Albertsons, Best Buy, Disney corporate group, Kaiser.
(B)	Student, cheerleaders, and dance groups.
Examples: Cheerleaders, High school/college leadership group, Dance Caravan, Showstoppers.
The Company will begin by attempting to sell the group porterage service for the contracted ten-dollar ($10.00) roundtrip amount. If the group declines the ten-dollar ($10.00) round trip porterage service amount, the Company agrees to consult the Bell Captain on-duty to evaluate reduced Porterage rate (refer to Porterage Sideletter Agreement dated February 16, 2004 for additional details) at the time of booking. Once a group has pre-negotiated, contracted and scheduled for the Bellpersons to handle their luggage, the porterage fee will be paid to the Bellpersons regardless of whether the service was utilized if the Company collected the porterage fees (unless the service was not utilized due to the negligence of the Cast Member).
If the groups listed above decline both the $10.00 roundtrip porterage and the porterage at a reduced rate offered by Sales and a Bell Captain, the Bellpersons shall be paid a storage fee of $1.00 in and $1.00 out per person for services rendered. Regardless of whether the group has prenegotiated for the service, the storage fee shall be paid when a Guest of a group listed above does not utilize normal Bell Services for luggage handling to and from Guest rooms, but rather physically drops off and picks-up their luggage from Bell Services or a storage area. Therefore, negotiation by Bellpersons with Guests will not be needed or permitted.
Furthermore, the parties agree that the Company will begin by attempting to sell the group porterage service for the contracted ten-dollar ($10.00) roundtrip amount to international wholesale tour companies, such as JTB, HIS, JPI, Kintetsu, Ana Halo, Trans Orbit, TransMapp, which sell tour packages to individual guests/tourists. If an international tour company declines the ten-dollar ($10.00) round trip porterage service amount during its annual contract renewal, the Company agrees to consult the Bell Captain on-duty to evaluate the reduced Porterage rate (refer to Porterage Sideletter Agreement dated February 16, 2004 for additional details). For all existing contracts, the Company agrees to contact the international tour companies without porterage services in its cunent contracts and consult the Bell Captain on-duty in an effort to
65
negotiate lower porterage rates for the balance of the contract year. Therefore, negotiation on the floor will not be permitted for all going forward and past contracts.
This sideletter of agreement shall be effective upon execution by the parties through the expiration of the 2004 Disneyland Resort Hotels H.E.R.E Agreement.
