Requests for information shall be directed to the Operations Manager or his/her designee.
Section 5.06	- Time Limits

Section 5.07	- Incident Reports
Employees shall, upon request, submit Company incident reports prior to the conclusion of their shift.

No employee shall be required to complete an incident report while off duty, unless mutually agreed to by the employee and the Employer. Employees may retain a copy for their records.
10
ARTICLE 6.	Grievance Procedure and Arbitration
Section 6.01	- Grievance Procedure
A.	The purpose of this procedure is a timely adjustment of any dispute or grievance that arises concerning the interpretation or application of any of the terms of this Agreement including but not limited to any dispute concerning wages, benefits, and working conditions, such matters shall be adjusted according to the procedures and conditions set forth below.
Grievances shall be adjusted according to the procedures and conditions set forth below, except that grievances challenging corrective action of less than a suspension or discharge may only be processed through Step Three of the grievance procedure. Should such corrective action be relied upon by the Employer to support a future suspension or discharge, however, the employee and/or Union may contest the prior corrective action in any subsequent grievance challenging the suspension or discharge.
Employees should attempt to resolve problems informally with the Employer before resorting to the grievance procedure. Any such agreement between the employee and the Employer will be a non-precedent setting settlement.
B.	Step One - The employee or the Union through its shop steward or field representative shall submit the grievance in writing via U.S. Postal Service certified mail or hand delivery to the Operations Manager within fifteen (15) calendar days of the occurrence giving rise to the grievance. Grievances sent by certified mail shall be deemed timely if postmarked or hand delivered fifteen (15) calendar days or less from the date of the grievant or Union should reasonably have been made aware of the event giving rise to the grievance. The written grievance must include the following:
1.	The specific provision of the Agreement alleged to be misapplied, misinterpreted or violated;
2.	The remedy sought; and
3.	A statement(s) identifying the specific facts of the situation.
The Operations Manager or designee shall schedule a meeting and meet with the grievant and/or his /her Union representative within fifteen (15) calendar days and give his/her answer in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days after such discussion. Grievances resolved at this step shall not be precedent setting.
C.	Step Two - If the procedure in Step One fails to resolve the grievance, the grievance shall be submitted to the General Manager in writing via U.S. Postal Service certified mail or hand delivery within fifteen (15) calendar days after the receipt of the Step One answer. The parties shall schedule a meeting and meet in an attempt to resolve the issue within fifteen (15) calendar days after such submission of the Step two grievance. The General Manager or his/her designee shall respond in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of the meeting.
11

ARTICLE 20.	Attendance and Punctuality
In an effort to improve attendance and help keep daily staffing levels to 100%, which benefits our patients as well as our coworkers, the Employer must be able to rely upon employees to report to work and remain at work as scheduled.

This procedure has been established to enable Management and the employees to maintain our level of excellence and consistent staffing for all field assignments.
Employees shall report to work punctually as scheduled and work all scheduled hours/shifts and any required overtime. Excessive tardiness and/or poor attendance disrupts workflow, increases the workload of fellow employees, and may affect employee morale and the quality of customer service. Good attendance and punctuality are fundamental responsibilities of each AMR team member.
Occurrences of tardiness and absenteeism are tracked on a continual one hundred and twenty (120) calendar day basis. These occurrences are recorded from electronic time reports and cross-referenced with daily time sheets.
Definitions

B.	Unscheduled Absence: Any time an employee fails to report for their scheduled shift within two (2) hours of their scheduled start time, and/or fails to complete any scheduled shift.
C.	Approved Scheduled Absence: Anytime an employee has been pre-approved to have a scheduled absence (e.g. PTO or LOA) by either the scheduler or supervision.
D.	Advance Notice: For the purpose of this policy advance notice will be considered a period of two (2) hours prior to the start of the employees scheduled shift when the employee is required to call and report their inability to report for their scheduled shift.
E.	Attendance Period: Any continual one hundred and twenty (120) calendar day period of time.
F.	Attendance Occurrence: Any tardy, unscheduled absence, failure to clock in/out at the required scheduled time, or any type of unscheduled overtime, incomplete, or partial shift (unless previously approved by management).
Excessive absences and/or tardiness may result in corrective action up to and including termination. Corrective action for excessive tardiness/absenteeism is outlined as follows:
1.	Any employee who has three (3) or more attendance occurrences within any continual one hundred and twenty (120) calendar day period shall be issued the appropriate level of corrective action, based on any existing corrective action in the employees file, for violation of this Article. Any additional occurrences and/or violations of this Article may result in the employee receiving additional corrective action up to and including termination.

47
illness or serious injury. Additionally, the Employer may require evidence of the illness or injury.
2.	Absences for two (2) or more consecutive shifts in the same shift segment (a segment shall be defined as a series of schedule shifts with scheduled days off at the end of the segment) due to a specific illness or injury shall count as one (1) occurrence.

Whenever an employee is placed on administrative leave, the Employer shall inform the employee (either verbally or in writing) of the general reason for the administrative leave.

61
scheduled shifts and/or PTO reinstated and paid no later than the second regular pay day following the conclusion of the investigation/determination.

In situations where an employee is placed on administrative leave pursuant to subsection(s) B and/or C above and subsequently reinstated, the employee shall not under any circumstances receive any form of compensation for any wages or benefits that were lost, or any PTO that was used, while on administrative leave. However, PTO days that were paid/taken during the administrative leave shall be credited as time served towards any additional corrective action.
