2019-2023 CARPENTERS' AGREEMENT
This Agreement made as of June 1, 2019, by and between AGC of Michigan, hereinafter called the “Association”, representing its members, who are hereinafter called “Employer”, and the Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters, which has jurisdiction in the entire State of Michigan and all off-shore areas adjacent thereto extending to the territorial boundary lines of the United States, hereinafter called the “Union”, and its successors, and any additional counties which may be added to the union through reorganization of the State of Michigan.
The geographic territory governed by this Agreement consists of Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Sanilac, St. Clair, Washtenaw and Momoe Counties and the Townships of Brighton, Deerfield, Genoa, Green Oak, Hamburg, Hartland, Osceola, Putnam, Tyrone and Unadilla in Livingston County and all offshore areas adjacent thereto extending to the territorial boundary lines of the United States (formerly known as Zones 1 and 2).
WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, it is the intent and purpose of the parties hereto to improve the relations between the Employer, his employees and the Union, and to establish an understanding relative to gross wages, hours of work, and all other conditions of employment so that the Employer, his employees and the Union may all profit from the fair and stable conditions in the industry which will result therefrom;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, the Employer and the Union hereby agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
Exclusive Bargaining, Employment and General Terms and Conditions
1.	The Association signatory hereto recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent for a majority of all persons employed as Carpenters in the geographical area coming within the jurisdiction of the Union; and
The Union recognizes the Association as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent for its members, the majority of contractors engaged in commercial, industrial, institutional and heavy construction work, for the purpose of collective bargaining in the geographical area coming within the jurisdiction of the Union.
2.	It is specifically agreed and understood that this Agreement exclusively governs the wages, terms, and conditions of employment of all Carpenters performing work of any description coming under the jurisdiction of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, employed by an Employer represented through the Association, the majority of contractors engaged in commercial, industrial, institutional and heavy construction work, regardless of whether such Employer is acting in the capacity of a prime or subcontractor.
3.	The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that they are subject to state and federal law and municipal ordinances regarding equal employment opportunity and fair employment practices and therefore will jointly take the necessary steps to comply with these laws and ordinances within the scope of this Agreement. The parties to this Agreement agree that they will in no way discriminate against any person based on race, color, religion or creed, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity and sexual orientation), national origin or ancestry, age (40 or older), veteran status, citizenship, disability or genetic information, reprisal, or any other protected class defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
1
4.	The Union agrees to furnish competent workers, if available, upon notification to the office of the Union or authorized person or persons. The Employer and Union agree that in the interest of job equity, there shall be no discrimination because of age and both parties shall endeavor to give favorable consideration to the employment of Carpenters who are 55 years of age or older providing such persons are capable to perform the work required.
5.	The Employer agrees that in the employment of workers to perform the various classifications of labor required under this Agreement, he will not discriminate against applicants because of membership or non-membership in the Union. Each employee shall, as a condition of employment, become and remain a member of the Union for the term of his employment, after the seventh (7th) calendar day after the beginning of his employment by an Employer or Employers in the area covered by this Agreement, or seven (7) days after the date of this Agreement, whichever is the later.
The Employer shall be furnished with a notice in writing by the Union, setting forth that the employee has refused to join the Union, although he has been offered membership on the same terms as other members or that the employee’s membership in the Union has been terminated for reason of nonpayment of dues or regular initiation fees. The Union will also provide the affected Employers with written notification of all members that have opted out of union dues collection.
(a)	In the event the National Labor Relations Act is amended, while this Agreement is in force so that an employee may lawfully be required to become a member of the Union as a condition of employment in less than seven (7) days, then such shorter period of time shall immediately become operative under this Agreement notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 5 above.
(b)	The Employer shall not be obligated hereunder to discharge or discriminate against any employee for non-membership in the Union:
(1)	If he has reasonable grounds for believing that such membership was not available to the employee on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members, or
(2)	If he has reasonable grounds for believing that membership was denied or terminated for reasons other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.
(c)	The Union will hold the Employers and the Association harmless and indemnify them from any loss suffered, including defense costs, as a result of any Employee claims, charges, actions or lawsuits of any kind in which the Employers and/or the Association are named as a party or responding party, claims of actions related to the union dues deduction and membership obligations under P.A. 348 of 2012; or any action, claim or suit relating to the negotiations of this Collective Bargaining Agreement provided the Union is given at least 30 days’ written notice of such claims, charges, actions or lawsuits from the time the Employer or Association is served with and receives same and the Union retains the right to tender a defense to such claims, charges, actions or lawsuits on their behalf, unless prohibited by Federal law.
2
ARTICLE II
Jurisdiction
1.	This Agreement covers all employees performing carpentry work coming under the jurisdiction of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, as determined by Agreements and Decisions of Record (such as "Plan for Settling Jurisdictional Disputes Nationally and Locally") and by area practices in the area covered by this Agreement.
2.	If, in the exercise of his management rights, the Employer makes a specific assignment of any work to an employee covered by this Agreement, the Employer agrees to provide a letter to the Union recording the specific assignment if requested to do so in writing by a Representative of the Union.
3.	To keep both parties to the Agreement fully informed of jurisdictional assignments made to the Union, the Union agrees to provide the AGC of Michigan a copy of both the original request and any Employer's (including non-Association employers) letter regarding the assignment. The letter should provide all appropriate information including project name and location, quantity, description, and specifics of the work assigned.
4.	In the event of a jurisdictional dispute involving the Union, the parties shall request the other union or unions involved to send representatives to the jobsite to meet with representatives of the Union and Employer to settle the dispute. If a settlement is not reached at that meeting the Union shall request that its International Union assign a representative who shall make arrangements to meet representatives of the other International Union or Unions involved and representatives of the Employer on the jobsite to seek settlement of the dispute. The Employer shall also request the International Unions involved to assign representatives to seek settlement of the dispute. The Union agrees that there shall be no work stoppages or strikes over jurisdictional disputes while such disputes are being processed.
5.	In the event the Association becomes a party to a National Board, or a Local or State Board is established to which the Association is a party, this Article shall be revised to include such participation.
6.	Pre-job Conferences. When requested by the Union, the Employer agrees to hold a pre-job conference to discuss carpentry work to be performed on said job and consider assignments of work, following established Agreements and Decisions rendered affecting the building industry.
7.	The Employer and/or General Contractor agree to provide the names of all known carpentry subcontractors, directly under contract, on the specific project if requested of the project superintendent by the Union representative. Such information shall be made available to the union representative within 48 business hours after award of contract and upon written request.
8.	The Union recognizes the following associations, AGC, ACTA, CCA, and WCA as the sole and exclusive representatives for their perspective members, the vast majority of contractors engaged in commercial, industrial, institutional and heavy construction work in the geographical area coming within the jurisdiction of the Union. In recognition of these associations’ standing in the industry, the Union shall designate to these associations’ sponsored industry promotion funds all IAP contributions paid by their respective members and any other employer performing work within the Union’s geographical jurisdiction, who is not signatory to another multiemployer association collective bargaining agreement with the Union, or is not otherwise a party to a separate multi-employer industry promotion trust fund.

15.	Journeymen Upgrade Training. The union and management recognize the importance of journeyman training and upgrade training for all employees, and agrees to fully cooperate with Employers in their concerted effort to provide a highly skilled workforce within which to compete in the market place.

In addition, the Union shall notify and provide the Associations with a copy of any Agreements within 48 hours upon written request.
3.	Should an Employer covered by this Agreement engage in any work within the geographic jurisdiction of this Agreement (including specialty work and/or home building work) covered by other current existing agreements between the Union and other Employers engaged in that work, then that Employer shall be required to comply with such Agreement covering such work. If there is a question on the status of any Employer such question shall be submitted to the Joint Settlement Board for determination.
ARTICLE V
Subcontracting
1.	The Employer agrees that he will not enter into subcontracts for work covered by this Agreement to be done at the site of the construction, alteration, or repair of a building, structure, or other work with any contractor who does not have a signed agreement with the Union; provided however, that where there is any dispute over work jurisdiction or assignment of work, such dispute shall be governed by Article II, hereof.
2.	The provisions of this Agreement specifically prohibit the use of labor contractors who as a subcontractor furnish workers to perform jobsite work covered by this Agreement, except where the labor contractor is signatory to this Agreement.
6
ARTICLE VI
Foreman
1.	The foreman shall be selected by and be the representative of the Employer. He shall not be required to violate any part of this Agreement as a condition of employment. When three (3) or more members of the Union are employed, one (1) shall act as working foreman and receive the foreman's rate of pay.
2.	Any Carpenter employed in a supervisory capacity and required to act in a dual capacity of Carpenter Foreman and Superintendent will be covered under terms of this Agreement.
ARTICLE VII
Apprentices
1.	The use of apprentices shall be encouraged under mutually agreeable indentureship rules and Detroit Carpentry Apprenticeship and Training Standards. The Employer agrees to abide by the rules, regulations and actions of the Detroit Carpentry Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee (JATC) in the employment of apprentices. The Employer and Union agree that it is their practical responsibility, in an effort to better the industry, to promote the apprenticeship and training program.
(a) Based on total employment, suitably distributed, the Employer shall employ apprentices in a ratio of one (1) apprentice to each five (5) journeymen. If an Employer is found to be employing apprentices in a ratio of less than one (1) to five (5), he shall be given notice to procure apprentices in the proper ratio within fourteen (14) working days. Any employee that comes through the Helmets to Hard Hats program will be recognized as an Apprentice for the purposes of calculating the Apprentice/Journeyman ratio. Apprentices shall operate under the rules of the Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee at all times.
2.	Payment for School Day. The Employer shall pay the Apprentice for attending classes on a regular attendance day, a sum equal to a full day's pay; however, should the Apprentice absent himself from the job, 10% per day missed will be deducted from payment for school day. Days missed due to weather or other acts by the Employer out of the Apprentice's control will not penalize that Apprentice for the 10% pay for each day falling in this category. Payment for school day may in no instance be less than the established scale, but shall be the actual wage the Apprentice is currently receiving. Hours spent in related classroom instruction shall not be considered as hours of work for the purpose of computing overtime.
(a)	The Apprentice attends school one day every two weeks. Five percent (5%) of the Apprentices' wage rate is included in all classification percentages for the payment of tuition.
(b)	An accepted applicant may be permitted employment on the jobsite seven (7) days prior to enrollment into the school or assignment of a school day, providing all other qualifications have been met. Such seven (7) days or part thereof shall constitute credit towards the 90 days probationary period.
(c)	It is mutually agreed that there will be periodic meetings of interested parties who will study the apprenticeship program with the purpose in mind of updating and streamlining the program.
7
3.	Apprentice Candidate Program. The Apprentice Candidate Program shall continue through the duration of this Agreement.
4.	Detroit Step Program. The Union (together with the Associations) will recommend that the appropriate JATC(s) provide the necessary Detroit Step information to the Association.
5.	Training. OSHA 30, ICRA Training, CPR/First-Aid, Scaffold, all Training - including current annual drug test and modules - must be current at time of graduation. All refresher courses should also be current/updated upon graduation. The Union, together with the Associations, will recommend to the Statewide Apprenticeship Fund and the JATCs to use their best efforts to incorporate this training into the Apprenticeship curriculum.
ARTICLE VIII
Hours of Work
1.	Day Shift. Eight (8) hours shall constitute a day’s work between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, inclusive, except for shift work and Flex Time workweek hereinafter described, and shall be paid at the regular First Shift rate of wages in Article IX. Additional flexibility in the starting time may be obtained by mutual agreement between the Employer and the Union prior to the start of the job.
2.	Flex Time Workweek Monday through Friday. Straight-time shall be paid for work up to 10 hours per day or 40 hours per week Monday through Friday, with Monday as the starting day of the workweek (regardless of when the Employer’s payroll week begins). One and one-half (1/4) the straight-time rate will apply after 10 hours per day or 40 hours per week, Monday through Friday. Saturdays may not be used as a make-up day. One and one-half (UA) the straight-time rate applies to all Saturday hours and those over 40 per week. Double-time applies on Sundays, Holidays and all time over 12 hours per day.
3.	Shift Work. All shift work shall be on a two (2) day basis regardless of the days on which worked.
(a)	When one (1) or two (2) shifts are employed, regardless of whether the day shift is worked, each shift shall work eight (8) hours before the overtime applies.
(b)	When three (3) shifts are employed, the first shift shall work eight (8) hours, the second shift shall work seven and one-half (7%) hours, and the third shift shall work seven (7) hours before the overtime rate applies.
c)	Shift work between the hours of 8:00 a.m. Monday and 8:00 a.m. Saturday shall be paid for at the regular shift rates as scheduled in Article IX. Shift work between the hours of 8:00 a.m. Saturday and 8:00 a.m. Monday shall be paid for at double the regular shift rates as scheduled in Article IX, with the exception that eight (8) hours of shift work may be performed between 8:00 a.m. Saturday and 8:00 a.m. Sunday for one and one-half the straight time rate.
(d)	Employers shall have the right to designate shift hours and shall notify the Union of the start of such shifts within twenty-four (24) hours after start of shift work, except on weekends when notice shall be given Monday morning. Failure to notify as agreed, all the time worked shall be at double time. No employee covered by this Agreement shall knowingly be allowed to work two (2) consecutive shifts.
8
(e)	It is understood that in the event job circumstances beyond the control of the Employer arise, the Employer and the Union will meet to arrange special shift provisions.
4.	Lunch Period. There shall be a lunch period at the end of the first four (4) hours of work on any shift. In the case of a flexible starting time, the period may be extended to a maximum of five hours. However, if job circumstances require the employee to work during the usual lunch period and take his unpaid lunch period at some other time, then the work performed during the usual lunch period shall be paid for at time and one-half (PZz). If an employee is requested to work more than twelve (12) hours, a lunch period of one-half (!4) hour shall be allowed at the start of the thirteenth (13th) hour.
(a) When any employee works through his normal lunch period, he shall be given his lunch period without unreasonable delay based on job conditions at the completion of his normal lunch period. If the employee is not relieved, he shall be paid at time and one-half (I1/?) from the completion of his normal lunch period until relieved. All Carpenters shall have a full one-half (14) hour lunch period.
5.	Holidays. The holidays or days so celebrated, recognized by this Agreement and calling for double time for any work performed are: New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and Labor Day. No work shall be done on Labor Day except for protection of life or property. If any of the above holidays fall on Sunday, the following Monday shall be considered the holiday and if work is performed the rate shall be double time.
(a) If a holiday is celebrated on Friday or Monday, four 1 O-hour straight-time weekdays may be worked during the calendar week in which a holiday is celebrated to enable Carpenters to have a 3-day weekend. In addition, the Employer may choose to work four 1 O-hour, straight-time weekdays during the week preceding or following this holiday week, to enable Carpenters to have a 4-day weekend. Jobs which have worked overtime on a regular basis within two weeks of the holiday may not change the workweek in accordance with this Paragraph. Notice must be given to the Union at least 5 work days before the first 4-10 day is worked.
6.	Travel. When an employee agrees to be sent out of the territorial jurisdiction of the Union by the Employer he shall receive all authorized expenses and either the scale or wages in the locality or in this Agreement.
7.	Coffee Break. Where all crafts employed on the job site agree, the following coffee break schedule shall apply. Each employee shall be allowed to take a 20-minute coffee break near their workstation during the first four (4) hour work period. If an employee is requested to work 10 (ten) hours or more, an additional 10-minute coffee break shall be provided during the ninth hour of work time for all employees. During the time period of June 1st through August 31st, Carpenters working on outdoor projects only may be permitted a ten (10) minute coffee break near their work station during the first four (4) hour work period and once during the second four (4) hour work period. The specific times of all breaks shall be determined by the Employer and need not be at the same time for all employees. This Coffee Break schedule shall only apply to the Carpenters if all other crafts employed on the job site agree to this beverage break schedule.
9
ARTICLE IX
Wages and Fringe Benefit Contributions
The gross wage shown in these schedules includes required payments for Wages, Insurance, Pension and Dues Assessment contributions. Failure to pay the Base Wage and the funded fringe benefit contributions when due is payment of less than the Gross Wage and shall constitute a status of delinquency and a violation of this Agreement. The Union shall withhold its members from Employers who are thus in violation: In the event any Employer is delinquent in the payment of Wages or his contributions to the Insurance, Pension, Apprenticeship, Dues Assessment or Labor-Management Productivity and Training Funds, the Union, after giving the Employer and the Association twenty-four (24) hours notice (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays) by certified mail or telegram, of such delinquency, shall have the right to take strike action against such Employer, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.
1.	The minimum rate of wages for Foremen, Journeymen, and Apprentice Carpenters shall be defined as follows for all geographic areas of this Agreement (formerly Zones 1 and 2):
The geographic territory governed by this Agreement consists of Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Sanilac, St. Clair, Washtenaw and Momoe Counties and the Townships of Brighton, Deerfield, Genoa, Green Oak, Hamburg, Hartland, Osceola, Putnam, Tyrone and Unadilla in Livingston County and all offshore areas adjacent thereto extending to the territorial boundary lines of the United States (formerly known as Zones 1 and 2).

21
13.	Employers for whom the Association does not stand surety shall comply with the following:
(a)	An Employer in Good Standing not later than December 31 of each year shall submit to the Trustees of the Guaranty Fund a sworn affidavit stating the average number of Carpenters on the Employer's payroll during the twenty-six week period from May 1 through October 31 of the preceding calendar year and showing a computation made by taking the highest number of Carpenters employed on any one day for each week during the period and dividing the total by the number of weeks during which Carpenters were on the payroll. The security deposit or surety bond amount required from each Employer in Good Standing corresponding to the average number of carpenters employed shall be as follows:
Classification	Average Number	Deposit
of Employer	of Carpenters	Amount
A	1-5	$25,000.00
B	6-10	$50,000.00
C	11-15	$75,000.00
D	16 or more	$100,000.00
In the alternative, such Employer shall make the $.10 per hour contribution in accordance with Section 13(b)(ii).
(b)	A New Employer or a Delinquent Employer shall have the option of either:
1)	Posting a $100,000.00 security deposit or surety bond with the Carpenters Guaranty Fund; or,
2)	(i) Paying its fringe benefit contributions on a weekly or monthly basis as required by the Detroit Carpenters' Fringe Benefit Funds' Joint Delinquency Committee, and
(ii	) Contributing $.10 to the Carpenters Guaranty Fund for each hour worked by all employees covered by this Agreement. The Guaranty Fund contribution shall be made together with all other Fringe Benefit Fund payments. The hourly contributions made under this Subparagraph (b)(ii) to the Guaranty Fund shall be paid in addition to any existing security deposit posted by the Employer. If an Employer posts a security deposit or surety bond, or joins an Association that stands as its surety, after having paid the aforesaid hourly contributions, any such payments made prior to such posting shall not be refundable to the Employer.
(c)	A New Employer is defined as an Employer who has been making fringe benefit contributions to the Funds for less than two (2) years. A Delinquent Employer is defined as an Employer who during the preceding consecutive twelve (12) month period has failed to make timely payment of any amounts due the Funds hereunder. An Employer in Good Standing is defined as an Employer who is neither a New Employer nor a Delinquent Employer. The Detroit Carpenters’ Fringe Benefit Funds’ Joint Delinquency Committee has authority to waive the delinquent status of an Employer when the status was the result of errors in payment of insignificant amounts, brief delays in payment, or errors due to unintentional clerical mistakes. A New Employer or a Delinquent Employer who becomes an Employer in Good Standing may request a refund of his deposit to the extent it is in excess of the deposit required of him as an Employer in Good Standing.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
CARPENTER BACK-TO-WORK PROGRAM
A carpenter injured while working for an Employer may return to work for that Employer at a reduced scale of wages to perform a limited work scope, "Bridge Job," as approved in writing by the administrating physician. A Bridge Job is construction-related work which may or may not be within the work jurisdiction of the Union. The scale of wages will be determined by the administrating physician's classification of the tasks to be performed commensurate with the capability of the carpenter. The work classifications are:
Very Light Work: Lifting ten pounds maximum and occasionally lifting and/or carrying such articles as dockets, ledgers and small tools. Although a very light job is defined as one which involves sitting, walking and/or standing may often be necessary in carrying out job duties. The amount of walking and/or standing permissible will be determined by the extent to which the injured body part impairs the ability to walk and/or stand.
Light Work: Lifting twenty pounds maximum with frequent lifting and/or carrying of objects weighing up to ten pounds. Even though the weight lifted may be only a negligible amount, a job is in this category when it requires walking or standing to a significant degree or when it involves sitting with a moderate degree of pushing and pulling of arm and/or leg controls.
Medium Work: Lifting fifty pounds maximum with frequent lifting and/or carrying of objects weighing up to twenty-five pounds.
The Base Wage for Very Light Work will be 30% of the Journeyman Base Wage. The Base Wage for Light Work will be 50% of the Journeyman Base Wage. The Base Wage for Medium Work will be 75% of the Journeyman Base Wage. For all work classifications, the Employer will pay the full dollar amount of fringe benefits received by a Carpenter Journeyman in addition to the applicable Base Wage. Compensation would increase as the carpenter progresses through the work classifications based on the physician's approval of the next level of physical demand.
The Workers' Compensation insurance provider may pay an additional weekly amount to the employee as an added incentive to encourage his voluntary participation in the Back-to-Work Program. This amount, if any, will be determined based on the formula as provided for by the workers' compensation guidelines. Refusal of a reasonable offer of employment may jeopardize the continued collection of benefits in accordance with State law.
A carpenter's employment under the Back-to-Work Program is limited to a maximum of six months for each incident. Implementation of the Program is discretionary on behalf of the Employer, and is subject to the availability of Bridge Jobs. Upon release for work by the administrating physician, the carpenter would return to full wages and be placed in available work.

SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT INDUSTRY ADVANCEMENT FUND
A. The Association shall establish an Industry Advancement Fund whose activities shall be financed by the payments provided for in Article IX of the Agreement. No Employer or Union has or shall have any right, title, interest or claim, legal or equitable, in or to any payments made or to be made for allocation of said Industry Advancement Fund, nor shall any part of the fund or assets of said Industry Advancement Fund or any part of any payments allocated to the Industry Advancement Fund at any time be paid to any Employer or to any other employer who is a party to an agreement with the Union requiring the same payments as provided for in Article IX, or to any employee, or to the Union except to finance such activities or benefits as are or shall be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Supplemental Agreement, or except as part, and in the form of, the activities and the benefits thereunder which the Association, as administrator of said Industry Advancement Fund, may undertake in accordance with the provisions of this Supplemental Agreement; and provided further nothing herein before contained shall be deemed in any way to limit or affect the right of the Union to compel any Employer or such other employer by legal or equitable action or otherwise to fulfill his obligation to make payments to said Industry Advancement Fund, or to collect in any bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding any such payments due from and unpaid by any Employer or other employer, and provided further, that nothing hereinbefore contained shall affect the Association's rights to subrogation. Upon termination of payments allocable to the Industry Advancement Fund, by reason of the expiration of this Agreement or because of the absence, or any other reason, of a contractual obligation upon the Employer to make payments so allocable, the assets and fund of the Industry Advancement Fund shall not be distributed among any Employers or other employers, or among employees, or to the Union but shall be held by the Association, which shall continue to administer and expand said assets and fund for the purposes, and subject to all the conditions, set forth herein.
42
The Association may use the monies allocated and paid into the fund of the Industry Advancement Fund, and the income from the investment thereof, for the purpose of meeting all costs to the Association (including, but not limited to rent, salaries of staff and legal counsel fees, office expense, cost of equipment, printing, stationery and items in the nature thereof), for carrying out the following industry-wide activities within the counties covered by this Agreement, for the benefit of the building and construction industry as a whole within said counties and particularly for the benefit of employers making payments allocated to the Industry Advancement Fund, except as an expenditure for any such activity that is prohibited by Subsection B of this Supplement.
(1)	ACCIDENT PREVENTION. For example, the costs for promoting a Safety Campaign to help prevent personnel accidents in the industry. The Association shall designate one of its staff to act on all matters pertaining to safety, whose duties shall be, among others, to distribute to Employers and employees literature advocating, explaining and promoting accident prevention; to meet with authorized representatives of the Union when necessary for discussion of matters of safety and accident prevention; to attend meetings and conferences dealing with safety and accident prevention; and to engage in similar activities for the promotion of safety and accident prevention.
(2)	EDUCATION. For example, to create, operate and maintain programs for the benefit of the building and construction industry as a whole within the counties aforesaid, such as schools for Estimators, Construction Superintendents, Foremen and other supervisory personnel.
(3)	RESEARCH INTO NEW METHODS AND MATERIALS.
For example, to investigate new methods and new materials for use in the building and construction industry and establish the necessary machinery to see to it that the assignment of work with or upon such methods or materials is made, subject to the applicable provisions of this Agreement, to the correct Trade in order to avoid jurisdictional disputes.
(4)	PUBLIC RELATIONS. For example, to conduct a Public Relations Program for the benefit of the building and construction industry in the aforesaid counties.
(5)	INDUSTRY RELATIONS with architects, engineers, building owners, government officials, subcontractors, material and equipment suppliers, manufacturers, and insurance and bonding companies.
(6)	LABOR RELATIONS. For example, to pay the compensation of the representatives of the Association participating in collective bargaining negotiations and grievance meetings with representatives of the Union; to pay the compensation of the representative or representatives of the Association in the presentation of any dispute to an arbitrator, as well as Management's share of the expenses and compensation of the arbitrator; to pay the expenses and compensation of witnesses in any grievance or arbitration proceedings; and to defray the expenses of said representatives in connection with the foregoing services and the cost to the Association of informative literature and other publications and usual sources of information relevant to collective bargaining and the processing of grievances, as well as the cost of disseminating such information among the members of the Association and other employers in the building and construction trades industry.
43
(7)	MANAGEMENT PARTICIPATION IN UNION HEALTH AND WELFARE FUNDS AND SIMILAR FUNDS. For example, to pay the compensation and the necessary expenses incurred in connection with their services as such, of the representatives of the Employers upon the Insurance Fund, the Pension Fund, and upon any other Taft-Hartley Fund composed jointly of representatives of Employers and representatives of employees.
(8)	MARKET DEVELOPMENT. For example, to educate owners and government awarding authorities and agencies to contract out construction maintenance and repair work.
(9)	STANDARDIZATION OF CONTRACTS AND SPECIFICATIONS. For example, to see to it that the architect states in the specifications at the proper place and with sufficient particularity an adequate definition of the work to be performed, thereby eliminating many needless jurisdictional disputes by improper assignment of work in the first instance.
(10)	DISASTER RELIEF AND CIVILIAN DEFENSE
B. No part of this fund allocated to the Industry Advancement Fund shall be spent directly or indirectly for any of the following or similar purposes:
(1)	Lobbying, publicity or other endeavors in the promotion of legislation, existing or proposed, opposed by either the AFL-CIO, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, or in opposition to legislation, existing or proposed, which is sponsored or favored by the AFL-CIO or the United Brotherhood of Carpenters.
(2)	Subsidies, indemnities or payments of any kind to contractors, during, for, or in connection with a period or periods of strike, lockout or work stoppage, or payments to any fund, insurance carrier, or other person or entity as a premium for, or in consideration of payment by such fund, insurance carrier, or other person or entity, of such subsidies or indemnities or payments to contractors.
(3)	Litigation of any kind before any court or administrative body against the Union, or any of the members of the Union, or the payments of any costs or expenses directly or indirectly involved in such litigation.
(4)	Payment of dues to, or the making of any other contribution, directly or indirectly, to The AGC of Michigan, or to its successor or to any like organization.
(5)	Publicity or public relations campaigns in support of Management's position respecting pending or prospective collective bargaining negotiations with the Union or in support of Management's point of view on any matter involving the industry which could, directly or indirectly, affect the availability of work or employment for, or the wages or conditions of employment of the members of the Union, when such point of view is opposed by the Union.
(6)	Any activity injurious to the Union or any of its affiliated locals. In the event that any activities of a program commenced by the Association were not apparent at the time of their commencement to be injurious to the Union, but later a complaint is made by the Union to the Association that any such activity is injurious to the Union, then, whether such activity or activities shall be continued and whether said activity or activities shall be financed out of monies already paid into the Industry Advancement Fund or to be paid into the Industry
44
Advancement Fund, shall if there is no agreement between the Association and the Union as to the complaint made, on the demand of either side, made no later than thirty (30) days after the date of the complaint, be submitted for arbitration to an arbitrator selected by lot from a list supplied by the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator shall hold the hearing and render his award within five days after his selection which award shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. In arriving at his award, the arbitrator shall be governed as follows:
(A)	In the event that the Association's obligation is only to pay for the activity of said program on a current basis as the activity progresses.
(i)	Then if the Association alters or discontinues the program pending the arbitration of the Union's complaint, the Association shall have no obligation to reimburse the funds of the Industry Advancement Fund for any monies it has paid or may be obligated to pay for such of said activities as preceded the date of Union's complaint.
(ii	) If pending such arbitration, the Association does not discontinue or alter the program to meet the Union's complaint, then the question to be decided by the arbitrator, in addition to whether the program or some phase of it was injurious to the Union, shall be as follows:
(a)	Was it within the control of the Association to discontinue or modify the program? If the answer is that it was not within the Association's control, then the Association shall not be obligated to reimburse the funds of the Industry Advancement Fund for the monies spent during the period between the date of the complaint and the date of the arbitrator's award.
(b)	If the award is that it was within the control of the Association, then the arbitrator shall be asked to decide an additional question, viz., would the discontinuance or alteration of the program have caused more harm to the Association than it would have caused to the Union. If the answer is in the affirmative, then, again, the Association shall be absolved of any liability to reimburse the funds of the Industry Advancement Fund for payments made between the date of the Union's complaint and the date of the award. If the answer is in the negative, Association shall reimburse the Industry Advancement Fund such expenditures as were made and incurred between the date of the Union's complaint and the date of the award.
(B)	Where the financing of the activities of the program is by prepayment either at the inception of the program or at various points after its inception, or is provided for by a contract which would impose upon the Association an irreducible obligation for a fixed amount irrespective of continuance or discontinuance of the program, then if the Union complains that any of the activities of the program are injurious to the Union and the Association does not discontinue or modify such activities to meet the Union's complaint, and if the arbitrator awards that any of the activities of the program are injurious to the Union, then the Association shall be obligated to reimburse the Industry Advancement Fund for a portion of such prepayment or fixed amount as the quantity of service or time utilized in said program's activities after Union's complaint and until compliance with the arbitrator's award bears to the whole quantity of the service to be rendered or to the whole of the time to be utilized for the activities so prepaid or contracted for.
In any event, if the arbitrator's award is that any of the activities of the program were injurious, then, from the date of the award the Industry Advancement Fund monies may not be used to continue such activities of the program unless altered to obviate injury to the Union, although

EXPLANATION OF CONTRACTOR
DEDUCTIONS FOR SPECIAL ASSESSMENT FUNDS
To assist you in determining the proper manner in which Special Assessment Funds are to be computed and deducted from each Employee's paycheck as per Article IX of the Contract, the following example is offered as a guide:
John Doe worked 40 hours at the base wage of $32.70 per hour which would amount to $1,308.00
Thus: Gross Earnings..................................................... $1,308.00
Special Assessment Fund ($.20 x 40 hrs)........................................8.00
Special Assessment Building Fund ($.20 x 40 hrs)...............................8.00
U.B.C. Per Cap ($.05 x 40 hrs).................................................2.00
These four items are added together in order that the Special Assessment Funds can also be taxed ...........................................................................$1,326.00
Assuming that F.I.C.A. is $95.00 and withholding tax is $200.00, thus the combined total of taxes is $295.00. Therefore, $295.00 must be deducted for tax purposes .............295.00
$1,031.00
Now that taxes have been paid on the Special Assessment Funds you must subtract the amount of these three items in order to send them to the fringe benefit fund depository .............................................................................. 18.00
You must also subtract the amount of the working dues (4% of $1,308.00) and also send it to the
fringe benefit fund depository .....................................................52.32
Amount of Pay Check ..............................................................$960.68
