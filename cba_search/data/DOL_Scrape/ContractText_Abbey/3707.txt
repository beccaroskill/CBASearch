A grievance is any claim by the Union or an employee that there has been a violation, misrepresentation, or misapplication of the terms of this Agreement.
B.	Procedures (Full-Time and Part-Time)
The parties agree that it is usually most desirable for an employee and his or her immediately involved supervisor to resolve problems through free and informal communications. When requested by the employee, a Union Representative may accompany the employee to assist in the informal or formal resolution of the grievance. If the informal process fails to satisfy the employee or the Union, a grievance may be processed using the following steps:
Step 1
The employee or the Union may present a grievance in writing to the immediately involved supervisor, or to the person who has the authority to adjust the issue of the grievance, within ten (10) working days following the end of the informal process or within twenty (20) working days following the date of the act or omission giving rise to the grievance or following the date on which the employee knew or, in the exercise of reasonable diligence if that date is later, should have known of such act of omission. The Supervisor will arrange for a meeting of the affected parties within six (6) working days after receipt of the grievance. The Supervisor shall provide a written response to the grievant within ten (10) working days after the meeting. The response shall include a reason for the decision.
Step 2
If the grievance is not resolved to the satisfaction of the employee or the Union at Step 1, then the Union may refer the grievance to the College President or his or her official designee within ten (10) working days after receipt of the response in Step 1. The College President or his or her designee shall arrange with the Union Representative for a meeting to take place within ten (10) working days of the College President's receipt of the appeal. Each party shall have the right to include in its representation such witnesses and counsel as each party deems necessary. Within ten (10) working days of the meeting, the Union shall be provided with a written response from the College President or his or her designee, including the reasons for the decision. Step
9|Page
3.	If the Union is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Step 2 or if the time limits expire without the issuance of the College President's written reply, the Union may submit the grievance to final and binding arbitration. Within ten (10) working days of receipt of the above notice the parties shall attempt to agree upon an arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within the ten (10) working day period, the parties shall immediately and jointly request the American Arbitration Association to submit a panel of arbitrators. The American Arbitration Association shall serve as administrators of the proceeding. The Arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding. If a demand for arbitration is not filed within thirty (30) calendar days of the date for the Step 2 answer, then the grievance shall be deemed withdrawn.
C.	Authority of Arbitrator (Full-Time and Part-Time)
The arbitrator shall have no right to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall consider and decide only the specific issues submitted in writing and shall have no authority to make any decision or recommendation on any other issue not submitted. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding.
D.	Bypass to College President (Full-Time and Part-Time)
If the Union and the College President agree, Step 1 of the grievance procedures may be bypassed and the grievance brought directly to Step 2.
E.	Bypass to Arbitration (Full-Time and Part-Time)
If the College President and the Union agree, a grievance may be submitted directly to arbitration.
F.	Union Participation - Employee Represented (Full-Time and Part-Time)
The Board acknowledges the right of the Union's grievance representative to participate in the processing of a grievance at any level, and no employee shall be required to discuss any grievance if the Union's Representative is not present.
G.	Union Participation - Employee Not Represented (Full-Time and Part-Time)
When an employee is not represented by the Union, the Union shall reserve the right to have its representative present to state its views at any formal stage of the grievance procedure. The administration shall make every effort to notify the Union of any adjustment of a grievance filed at the informal level when the Union is not present.
H.	No Reprisals Clause (Full-Time and Part-Time)
No reprisals shall be taken by the Board or the Administration against an employee because of his or her participation in a grievance.
I.	Release Time (Full-Time and Part-Time)
Should a grievance hearing require that an employee or a Union Representative be released from his or her regular assignment; he or she shall be released without loss of pay or benefits. Union member(s) will notify immediate supervisor(s) in advance of such meetings.
J.	Filing of Materials (Full-Time and Part-Time)
All records related to a grievance shall be filed separately from the personnel files of the participants.
10 | Page
K.	Grievance Withdrawal (Full-Time and Part-Time)
A grievance may be withdrawn at any level without establishing precedent and shall be deemed as never having been filed.
L.	Time Limit Extension (Full-Time and Part-Time)
Time limits may be extended by the mutual consent of the Union and the Board.
M.	No Written Response (Full-Time and Part-Time)
If no written response or decision has been rendered within the time limits indicated by a step, then the grievance may be processed to the next step.
N.	Expense of Arbitration (Full-Time and Part-Time)
Each party shall bear the full cost of its representation in arbitration. The cost of the arbitrator and of the American Arbitration Association shall be divided equally between the parties. If either party requests a transcript of the proceedings, that party shall bear the full cost of such transcripts. If both parties request a transcript, the cost shall be equally divided. If the arbitrator requests a copy of the transcript, these costs shall be divided equally between the parties.
ARTICLE 6	Working Hours and Overtime
Maintaining regular attendance is a condition of employment and an essential function of an employee’s job. Being absent from work diminishes a work unit’s ability to fulfill its mission and impacts morale. As specified below, the College has the right to set and modify the work schedule according to the needs of the institution. The College will make a reasonable effort to maintain a work/life balance for its employees.
A.	College-Initiated Schedule Change (Full-Time)
The College will modify schedule(s) as follows:
1.	When institutional needs require modifications to the schedule, the College will initially seek volunteers for schedule modification.
Employees in order of seniority will have first refusal. The lowest seniority employee may be assigned the schedule. No schedules will be changed if there are budgeted and posted vacancies for that position within the department.
Changes of the days worked or a change of more than four (4) hours in start or end time are considered significant changes to the job; and therefore, will be documented in an updated PDQ and job description (Article 7.K).
The earliest that employees who are currently working under an agreed upon alternate work schedule may be modified to a different work schedule will be July 1, 2019.

To qualify for overtime pay, an employee must work his or her scheduled weekly shift of forty (40) hours (thirty-six (36) in the summer) which may include a scheduled vacation day, holiday, personal leave, or sick leave. In the event of an unscheduled sick leave, Human Resources may request a physician’s certificate confirming his or her illness. If the overtime is offered after sick leave was taken, no physician’s certificate will be required to qualify for overtime pay.

c.	If a non-exempt employee is called by any supervisor at home for a work
related non-emergency and resolves the request at home, he or she will be paid at the overtime rate in increments of fifteen (15) minutes, for the total time that is spent on the matter. Example: 20 minutes would equal 30 minutes on the time card, paid at the overtime rate.
d.	If an exempt employee is called by any supervisor at home for a work-related non-emergency and resolves the request at home, he or she will accumulate compensatory time, in increments of fifteen (15) minutes, for the total time spent on the matter.

1.	When overtime pay is due a non-exempt employee, the employee may request compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay. Such time off shall be calculated by multiplying the hours worked over forty (40) in a week by one and one-half (1 %). (Example: One (1) hour worked over forty (40) in a week equals one and one-half (1 %) hours of time off at regular pay or thirty-six (36) hours during the ten (10) week summer period).
2.	The employee shall be entitled to accumulate time off in lieu of overtime pay up to forty (40) hours. In no case shall such time be accumulated to more than forty (40) hours.
3.	Compensatory time may be taken in fifteen (15) minute increments or more, up to the maximum earned. Use of compensatory time is at the employee’s choosing and may be denied only if taking of said leave will create a hardship for the department and then only to the extent that other accommodations have been explored.
4.	All requests for use of compensatory time must be submitted in writing at least ten (10) working days in advance of the leave. The supervisor must approve or deny, in writing, the request within five (5) working days of the request.
5.	Compensatory time requests maybe be submitted less than ten (10) working days in advance of the leave; however, sections 3 and 4 do not apply. Approval of the request shall be at the discretion of the supervisor. If the request is denied, a reason shall be given to the employee.

A hostile work environment exists if a person’s conduct (unwelcomed sexual conduct) “unreasonably interferes” with an employee’s work performance or creates “an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment”.
*Behaviors which, if unwelcome, may be perceived as sexual harassment can be verbal, non-verbal or physical. Verbal harassment may include, but not be limited to, epithets, derogatory comments or jokes, suggestive and insulting sounds, or whistling.

Appendix A
Scenarios With Regard to Call Back
Scenario I
An Exempt employee receives a call from any supervisor indicating the existence of an emergency. The employee handles the matter from his or her cell phone while he or she is fishing down on the Fox River. It takes the employee 15 minutes. The employee will be compensated for two (2) hours of work time and a half at his or her normal rate of pay of $20/hour. The supervisor will complete a special pay request form for a total amount of $60.00.
Scenario II
A Non-Exempt employee receives a call from any supervisor at a conference that he or she is attending on behalf of the college to assist in handling an emergency. The call is received in the evening at which time the employee is not responsible for attending any sessions. The employee and the supervisor are on the phone for 30 minutes and it is determined that the employee cannot help resolve the problem. The employee is compensated for 30 minutes of overtime pay, which is to be indicated on his or her timesheet as overtime.
Scenario III
A supervisor contacts an employee at home and begins talking with the employee about a work matter. They are on the phone for 20 minutes. As the supervisor did not indicate the call was a non-emergency, the call is treated as an emergency and is therefore compensated at two (2) hours of overtime calculated at the employee’s normal rate of pay.
Scenario IV
An employee receives a call at home from a co-worker, not directed by his or her supervisor, to assist him/her in handling a matter. They are on the phone for one (1) hour. As the call was not directed from the supervisor the employee would not receive compensation for the call.
Scenario V
A supervisor calls an employee at home but reaches a family member. The supervisor leaves a message requesting the employee to call him/her to assist in handling a work-related problem. The employee never returns the call. The employee will not be compensated as he or she did not return the call, nor be the subject of any discipline.

Letter of Agreement Regarding Separation Incentive
The Board agrees to offer a separation incentive to support staff whose salary is at or above the maximum salary allowable for their salary grade, as determined by the compensation schedule in this contract. In order to qualify for this option, the following conditions must be met:

•	The opportunity to elect this incentive expires in its entirety on February 9, 2018 at 5:00 p.m.
Upon receipt of irrevocable notice of separation, the eligible support staff shall be removed from the regular compensation schedule. Participating support staff shall not be eligible for any compensated additional work or other paid duties which qualify for SURS earnings. If participating support staff earn overtime, it shall be used as time off at applicable rates with regular pay in lieu of overtime pay, as per the contract language in Articles 6.E. and 6.F.
The eligible support staff member shall receive a salary increase of 5.0% of their current base salary on January 1, 2018 and a salary increase of 5.0% of their current base salary on July 1, 2018.
