1.	The Employer shall requisition all workers who are to be employed in the bargaining Unit of the Union from the Local Hall of the Union nearest the plant in which the worker or workers are to be employed.
2.	The Employer shall give the Union forty-eight (48) hours of notice (excluding Sundays and Holidays) of its need for workers, and within such forty-eight (48) hour period shall not hire persons not referred by the Union. The Union shall dispatch such workers as soon as possible. If, however, the Union fails to do so, the Employer shall have the right to hire persons not referred by the Union. However, in such event, the Employer will notify the Union immediately when such workers are hired, and shall make arrangements for proper referral.
3.	In notifying the Union of its need for workers, the Employer shall specify to the Union the number of workers required, the location of the plant, the specific classification of work to be performed, and other such information as may be necessary to enable the Union to make proper referral of applicants.
4.	It is understood and agreed that all dispatching of workers and the operation of any Hiring Halls by the Union shall be subject to and shall be governed by the following conditions:
a)	Selection of applicants for referral to jobs shall be on a non-discriminatory basis and shall not be based on, or in any way affected by, Union membership, by-laws, rules regulations, constitutional provisions, or any other aspect of obligation of Union membership, policies or requirements, or race, religion, sex, color, age, national origin, disability or veteran's status.
b)	The Employer retains the right to reject any job applicant referred by the Union.

3
requirements, or race, religion, sex, color, age, national origin, disability or veterans status.
B.	The following procedures shall be forthwith placed into effect at all Union Dispatching offices, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement

2.	A written referral will be given to each worker dispatched to a plant. This is not a Union "clearance", but rather, written evidence in the workers possession that he has been dispatched in accordance with this Agreement
3.	Each Union Dispatching Office shall maintain appropriate registration lists or cards, kept current from day to day, and referrals will be made in the following order of preference:

4)	The Employer may requisition workmen specifically by name from "Group A” provided said worker is qualified as set out above, and available for such employment. It is mutually agreed, however, that the Employer requisitioning such workers specifically by name from "Group A" does so only because of his knowledge of said individual worker's skill, qualifications, and ability to perform the work involved, by reasons of:
a)	Said employee having worked for the employer before or
b)	The employer having been advised of the worker's skill, qualifications, and ability by another Employer for whom he has worked, or by the Superintendent, master mechanic, or foreman currently employed by said Employer, under whose supervision said employee has performed the work involved.
4
Group B - (When "Group A" list is exhausted, workers who are qualified as follows:)
1)	Whose names are properly and currently registered (currently shall mean registration or renewal thereof at least once every thirty (30) days.
2)	Group B shall be reserved exclusively for those workers with four (4) years* experience in the related industry covered by this Agreement with two (2) months residence in Arizona and who desire to register on the out-of-work list.
3)	Anyone registered on the B list may be called by name if they have been employed by the same Employer within the past two (2) years, and shall be counted the same as a C list request.

6.	Notwithstanding the above stated order of preference in referrals, and notwithstanding any other provisions in this agreement, a Dispatching Office may give first priority preference to any classes protected by the Civil Rights Act who are properly registered where reasonably necessary to comply with affirmative action plans which are conditions of federally or state assisted construction or which are established from time to time by the Union and the Employer in concert with each other as part of a community action or industry plan.
7.	All Officers and Business Representatives of the Union, who have had experience

9.	It is further agreed that the Employer or his agent shall not contact individual workers, nor shall the individual workers contact the Employer or his agent, for the purpose of discussing potential employment under terms less favorable than those set forth in this Agreement.

Said Impartial Referee shall serve upon call in their respective Districts unless disqualified as set forth herein.
6
c)	Either the Union or the Employer may disqualify any Impartial Referee by giving notice in writing to the Impartial Referee and the other party of this Agreement of its desire to disqualify said Impartial Referee from being assigned to future grievances.

D.	No worker shall be refused registration or dispatchment because of his Union or non-Union status, if he is otherwise entitled to dispatchment.
E.	It is the responsibility of the Dispatcher to determine, in the first place, the proper group In which to place the registrant. This normally will be based upon information or papers which the worker supplies. If any doubt exists as to the registrant’s proper placement, the Dispatcher may call prior Employers, or make other prompt investigations to get to the facts needed. Similarly, the Dispatcher should make an appropriate notation, where necessary, of the qualifications of the applicant, or his
7
related experience, to assist in sending workers meeting the Employer's stated requirements. Any dispute which may arise relative to which list a registrant should be placed upon, or as to competency shall be settled as follows:
1.	The registrant shall file with the Dispatching Office a written request for review of the disputed matter, within ten (10) working days after the dispute arises.

2.	The Dispatching Office will immediately refer the request to the Impartial Referee who shall review the dispute within ten (10) days after the written request has been filed. Time and place of an informal hearing will be fixed by the Referee and notice thereof will be given to the registrant by the Union, as soon as practicable.
3.	The Referee will examine all material evidence submitted by the registrant and the Union, and will conclusively decide which group the registrant should be placed in and as to what qualifications the registrant has. The Union will then registers and classify the registrant accordingly. Nothing contained herein, however, may be interpreted to permit or grant power to the Referee to alter, amend, modify or otherwise change any term or condition of the Collective Bargaining Agreement or these Dispatching Procedures.
4.	The Referee's fees will be borne equally by the Union and the registrant, except that the registrant shall in no circumstance be required to pay a sum in excess of ten dollars ($10.00).

H.	"Available for Work" means that the registrant must be present at the time and place uniformly required for dispatchment and be ready, able and willing to go to the job site and perform the work for which he is being dispatched. The practice of the Dispatching Office shall be uniform as to all registrants, with respect to physical presence in the office at a given hour, or telephone in, being available at a telephone, etc. and registrants shall be informed of the practice.
I.	Appropriate notations shall be made opposite the registrant's name when his name is reached for dispatchment, showing the job and classification to which he is
8
being dispatched, his lack of availability, or other reason that he has been passed over. If any inquiry is made by the registrant, he shall be given exactly the same information as to reasons, etc., as appears on the notation. In such cases, or any other cases which may lead to a dispute, the Dispatcher should immediately make notes on the facts upon which he, or she, bases his or her decision to dispatch or not to dispatch the person.
J.	Disputes of grievances concerning the hiring in the first instance of any worker, or workers, shall be settled by the Union Business Representative and the highest available top management of the Employer within twenty four (24) hours after said grievance arises, Saturdays, Sundays and other non-working days accepted.
