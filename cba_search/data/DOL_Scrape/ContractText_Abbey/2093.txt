PART A - SECTION 1
PART A
PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO THE ENTIRE MULTI-PLANT BARGAINING UNIT
Section 1 - Recognition and Jurisdiction
(A)	For the period of this Agreement, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company - Marietta, sometimes hereinafter referred to as "LM Aero - Marietta”, recognizes the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO, sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "IAM&AW", and its Local Lodges 709, 1027, and 2386 thereof as the exclusive representative of hourly-paid employees in the multi-plant collective bargaining unit consisting of the following groups of employees, as hereinafter defined, for purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment:
(1)	Marietta Plant Represented Employees, as defined in Part B of this Agreement;
(2)	Clarksburg Plant Represented Employees, as defined in Part C of this Agreement;
(3)	Meridian Plant Represented Employees, as defined in Part I of this Agreement.
All of the employees in the three groups of employees referred to above constitute a single multi-plant
1
PART A - SECTION 1
collective bargaining unit. The three employee groups which constitute this multi-plant collective bargaining unit and which are each defined in the Parts of the Agreement referred to above are sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Contract Administration Groups", or individually as a "Contract Administration Group".
(B)	If, during the term of this Agreement, LM Aero -Marietta establishes, within any of the fifty states of the United States except the State of Georgia, a new "feeder plant" which produces aircraft assemblies for use in the aircraft assembled at the Marietta Plant of LM AERO - MARIETTA, the IAM&AW will make a written claim that it represents, and LM AERO - MARIETTA will recognize the IAM&AW as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for, the hourly-paid employees of LM AERO -MARIETTA who work at that new feeder plant and who are employed in one of the represented job classifications covered by Parts C or I of this Agreement and such other new production and maintenance job classifications as may be initially established at the new "feeder plant", provided that no such representation will be claimed and no such recognition will be extended where such recognition would constitute a violation of the law. For the purposes of this initial representation and recognition and to evidence the intention of all of the parties to this Agreement that the represented employees at any such new feeder plant are to be added to the multi-plant bargaining unit to which this Agreement is appli
2
PART A - SECTION 1
cable, the parties to this Agreement agree that the IAM&AW shall be deemed to also be acting on behalf of the Local Lodges which are parties to this Agreement. After such recognition has been accomplished, the IAM&AW shall charter a separate Local Lodge to automatically become a party to this Agreement and shall, along with that Local Lodge, enter into negotiations with LM AERO - MARIETTA, to the extent hereinafter provided, for the purpose of adding another Part to this Agreement and of making only related and necessary changes in this Part A, such as adding an additional Contract Administration Group. This added Part shall be applicable to the employees at the new feeder plant and shall be interpreted and applied in the same manner as provided for Parts B through I in Section 2 of this Part A. Any Local Lodge which becomes a party to this Agreement shall have rights and duties under this Part A comparable to the rights and duties which this Part A provides for Local Lodge 2386. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all of the parties to this Agreement now agree that the provisions of Part I of this Agreement shall constitute the basic provisions to be included in the Part to be added to this Agreement, except that all changes that are necessary to make those Part I provisions applicable to the new plant, Contract Administration Group, and Local Lodge shall automatically be made in those Part I provisions and that the IAM&AW and the new Local Lodge to be chartered as hereinbefore provided shall negotiate with LM AERO - MARIETTA concerning the wages, job classifications, and local
3
PART A - SECTION 1
hospital and medical benefits (to be substituted for the group insurance benefits provided for in Part I) and shall include these newly negotiated terms of employment in the added Part in place of the wages, job classifications, and local hospital and medical benefits provided for in Part I. Furthermore, the provisions of Part C, Article I, Section 9, entitled "Union Security", shall also be automatically included in any new Part added to this Agreement pursuant to this Subsection (B) unless the inclusion of the provisions of that Section or compliance with those provisions would be a violation of an applicable law.
(C)	If, during the term of this Agreement, LM AERO - MARIETTA establishes, within the State of Georgia, a new "feeder plant" which produces aircraft assemblies for use in the aircraft assembled at LM AERO - MARIETTA, Local Lodge 709 and the IAM&AW will make a written claim that they represent, and LM AERO - MARIETTA will recognize Local Lodge 709 and the IAM&AW as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for, the hourly-paid employees of LM AERO - MARIETTA who work at that new feeder plant and who are employed in one of the represented job classifications covered by Parts C through I of this Agreement and such other new production and maintenance job classifications as may be initially established at the new "feeder plant", provided that no such representation will be claimed and no such recognition will be extended where such recognition would constitute a violation of the law. For the purposes of this
4
PART A - SECTION 1
initial representation and recognition and to evidence the intention of all of the parties to this Agreement that the represented employees at any such new feeder plant are to be added to the multi-plant bargaining unit to which this Agreement is applicable, the parties to this Agreement agree that Local Lodge 709 and the IAM&AW shall be deemed to also be acting on behalf of all of the other Local Lodges which are parties to this Agreement. After this recognition has been accomplished, Local Lodge 709 and the IAM&AW shall enter into negotiations with LM AERO - MARIETTA, to the extent here in after provided, for the purpose of adding another Part to this Agreement and of making only related and necessary changes in this Part A, such as adding an additional Contract Administration Group. The added Part shall be applicable to the em -ployees at the new feeder plant and shall be interpreted and applied in the same manner as provided for Parts B through I in Section 2 of this Part A. Local Lodge 709 shall have rights and duties, under this Part A and with respect to the new feeder plant, which are comparable to the rights and duties which this Part A provides for Local Lodge 709 with respect to the Marietta Plant Represented Employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all of the parties to this Agreement now agree that the provisions of Part I of this Agreement shall constitute the basic provisions to be included in the part to be added to this Agreement, except that all changes that are necessary to make those Part I provisions applicable to the new plant, the new Contract Administration Group,
5
PART A - SECTION 1
and Local Lodge 709 shall automatically be made in those Part I provisions and that the IAM&AW and Local Lodge 709 shall negotiate with LM AERO -MARIETTA concerning the wages, job classifications, and local hospital and medical benefits (to be substituted for the group insurance benefits provided for in Part I) and shall include these newly negotiated terms of employment in the added Part in place of the wages, job classifications, and local hospital and medical benefits provided in Part I. Local Lodge 709 and the IAM&AW shall have authority to administer and enforce the provisions of this Subsection (c).
(D)	In the event that LM AERO - MARIETTA during the period of this Agreement establishes or acquires and operates a new plant in the State of Georgia other than the Marietta Plant, the Lockheed Nuclear Products Plant, the Lockheed Industrial Products Plant, or a feeder plant, and such plant is engaged in the manufacture or modification of airframes, missiles, or components of either airframes or missiles, aircraft, spacecraft or items necessary to the functions of aircraft, missiles, spacecraft, AntiSubmarine Warfare and Ocean Systems and related products, Local Lodge 709 and the IAM&AW will claim the bargaining rights for hourly-paid personnel employed at such new plant to work in any job classification covered by Part B of this Agreement. LM AERO - MARIETTA will recognize Local Lodge 709 and the IAM&AW as the exclusive representa
6
PART A - SECTION 2
tive for purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment for such personnel at such new plant, except where another collective bargaining agent has established collective bargaining rights in the affected unit at such new plant. LM AERO - MARIETTA will negotiate with Local Lodge 709 and the IAM&AW the terms and conditions of a separate agreement covering employees in the bargaining unit referred to in this Subsection (D). Except that any such facility as defined in this Paragraph (D) acquired and operated within a one-hundred (100) mile radius of the Marietta Plant within the State of Georgia, representation rights shall be extended to Local Lodge 709 and the IAM&AW and the current Labor Agreement shall apply. Local Lodge 709 and the IAM&AW shall have authority to administer and enforce the provisions of this Sub-section (D).
Section 2 - Interpretation and Application
(A)	This Agreement consists of Four (4) Parts. These Parts are designated as Parts A, B, C, and I. This entire Agreement resulted from joint negotiations between LM AERO - MARIETTA and the IAM&AW and each of the Local Lodges listed in Section 1 of this Part A of the Agreement. The entire Agreement was approved by the cumulative votes of the individual members of each of those Local Lodges. It is understood that the printing of
7
PART A - SECTION 2
certain Parts of this Agreement separately from other Parts of this Agreement is for convenience only and is not intended to create separate collective bargaining units.
(B)	For the purposes of interpretation, application, administration and enforcement, all of the provisions of this Agreement except Section 1 of this Part A, shall be interpreted and applied separately but uniformly to each of the three separate Contract Administration Groups. The provisions of this Part A are applicable to each of the Contract Administration Groups. Only Part A and one other Part of this Agreement shall, however, be applicable to each of the three separate Contract Administration Groups. The following rules shall be used to determine which Part of the Agreement other than this Part A shall be applicable in any particular situation:
(1)	Part B shall be applicable only to Marietta Plant Represented Employees;
(2)	Part C shall be applicable only to Clarksburg Plant Represented Employees;
(3)	Part I shall be applicable only to Meridian Plant Represented Employees.
(C)	The IAM&AW and LM AERO - MARIETTA shall have full and exclusive authority to administer and enforce the provisions of this Part A of the Agreement, except as otherwise provided in Section
8
PART A - SECTION 3
1 (C) and (D) and Section 3 (C) of this Part A.
Section 3 - Period of Agreement and Procedure for Amending or Replacing Agreement
(A)	This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect from March 3, 2014, until and through March 4, 2018 and thereafter from year to year unless either the IAM&AW or LM AERO - MARIETTA gives notice in writing to the other party to this Agreement during the period from 12:01 a.m., December 1, 2017, through midnight December 31, 2017, or during a like period in any subsequent year proposing modifications or amendments to this Agreement. Such notice shall specify the modifications or amendments desired. All of the parties to this Agreement agree to commence negotiations within fifteen (15) days after the giving of such notice and it is the intent of the parties to confine negotiations to such modifications or amendments as are specified in such notice. However, the 15 day time period for commencing negotiations may be extended by mutual agreement. In the event of a failure of the parties to reach an Agreement upon such modifications or amendments by March 4, 2018, or by the first Sunday in March of any subsequent yearly period for which this Agreement remains in full force and effect, either the IAM&AW or LM AERO -MARIETTA, at any time thereafter, may terminate this Agreement. Observers or specialist (excluding IAM Grand Lodge representatives) may participate in the above referenced negotiations if mutually
9
PART A - SECTION 3
agreed upon by the parties.
(B)	The Negotiating Committee which shall represent the IAM&AW and each of the Local Lodges which are parties to this Agreement in the negotiations contemplated under Subsection (A) of this Section shall consist of four (4) LM AERO - MARIETTA employees who are members of Local Lodge 709 plus the President of Local Lodge 709 plus one (1) representative from each of the other Local Lodges which is a party to this Agreement plus one (1) or two (2) Grand Lodge Representatives. This Negotiating Committee is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the Union Negotiating Committee. In votes taken by the representatives of the Local Lodges, the vote of each such representative shall be weighted in proportion to the number of employees he represents. Accordingly, the vote of each such representative shall have the same relative weight in the count of the total votes of all of such representatives of the Union Negotiating Committee as the number of employees represented by that member bears to the total number of employees included in the multi-plant bargaining unit to which this Agreement is applicable. For this purpose each of the five (5) representatives of Local Lodge 709 on the Union Negotiating Committee shall be deemed to represent one-fifth (1/5) of the Marietta Plant Represented Employees and each of the representatives from each of the other Local Lodges shall be deemed to represent the employees in the Contract Administration Group which his Local Lodge represents for the purpose of administering this Agreement.
10
PART A - SECTION 3
The Negotiating Committee which shall represent LM AERO - MARIETTA in these negotiations, sometimes hereinafter referred to as the Company Negotiating Committee, shall consist of no more members than the number of members on the Union Negotiating Committee. By mutual agreement the Union and Company Committees may establish such special sub-committees as they deem appropriate to recommend and advise them concerning specific and specialized subjects, and the persons comprising such sub-committees shall be permitted to participate in discussions concerning the subject of their specialty but shall have no vote. After the Union Negotiating Committee and the Company Negotiating Committee have reached agreement on all amendments and modifications to this Agreement or have entered into a new Agreement to replace this Agreement, all such amendments and modifications or the new Agreement in its entirety shall be accepted or rejected as a whole without acceptance or rejection of parts thereof, and the ratification and final acceptance or the rejection, by the IAM&AW and by each of the Local Lodges listed in this Part A, Section 1, of such amendments or modifications or of a new Agreement, as the case may be, shall be by a majority of the total pooled votes from throughout the multi-plant bargaining unit of all employees who are eligible to and who actually vote in each of the three (3) Contract Administration Groups enumerated in Part A, Section 1, of this Agreement.
(C)	In the event of instructions from the Federal
11
PART A - SECTION 3
Government to alter or change the working schedule now in effect, LM AERO - MARIETTA may, upon fifteen (15) days' written notice, reopen negotiations with the IAM&AW and the affected Local Lodge or Lodges for the purpose of amending such sections of this Agreement as pertain to hours of work and/or over-time payment for the sole purpose of considering objectives desired by the Government. The affected Local Lodge or Local Lodges and the IAM&AW shall have authority to administer and enforce the provisions of this Subsection (C).
(D)	Any notice given under this Section of the Agreement shall be effective only if mailed, postage prepaid, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and if addressed:
(1)	When given to LM AERO - MARIETTA, to the Site General Manager of LM AERO - MARIETTA, 86 South Cobb Drive, Marietta, Georgia 30063, or
(2)	When given to the IAM&AW, to the General Vice President of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers who has jurisdiction over Local Lodge 709 at the address which has been furnished to LM AERO - MARIETTA by the IAM&AW.

PART B - ARTICLE I, SECTION 10
turn over to the Union, the Union Membership Dues of each employee who individually and voluntarily authorizes the Company in writing to make such deductions. The term "Union Membership Dues", as used herein shall include Union initiation fees or reinstatement fees of employees rehired by the Company, with or without seniority, when such employees are reinstated or rejoin the Union. The Union indemnifies and holds harmless the Company for this provision of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Such deductions shall be made in accordance with the following provisions:
(a)	Such deductions shall be made only in accordance with instructions upon authorization cards which shall be in a form mutually agreed to between the Company and the Union in the 2005 negotiations. Dues Deduction Authorization forms in effect prior to the 2005 negotiations shall remain in effect and will be applied in accordance with provisions set forth at the time the form was signed. In order to be effective, such authorization cards shall be delivered by the Union to the Payroll Accounting Department of the Company.

PART B - ARTICLE I, SECTION 10
(c)	Deductions for other Union Membership Dues shall be made from the employee's paycheck weekly, for fifty-two (52) weeks of the calendar year. Such deductions shall be in the amount certified to the Company by the Union. Any change in the amount of deductions for such Union Membership Dues shall be made effective for the weekly pay period following two (2) full weeks' written notice of such change by the Union to the Company. In the event a de -duction for such dues is not made from one or more consecutive weekly paychecks due to insufficient earnings by the employee, then on the next paycheck that the employee has sufficient earnings, a retroactive deduction shall be made.
(d)	To be effective as of a weekly payroll period, dues deduction authorizations must be received by the Payroll Accounting Department of the Company by 4:45 p.m. on the second Tuesday preceding the Friday ending such payroll period.
(e)	In accordance with the new (2005) Dues Deduction Authorization form the employee agrees that the dues authorization shall be automatically renewed for successive one year periods or until the termination of the collective bargaining agreement, whichever is the lesser, unless the employee revokes it by giving written notice to the Company and Union not more than 20 and not less than 5 days prior to the expiration of the appropriate yearly period or contract term.

Section 11	- Separability
Should any part hereof or any provision herein contained be rendered or declared invalid by reason of any existing or subsequently enacted legislation or by a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidation of such part or portion of this Agreement shall not invalidate the remaining portions hereof and they shall remain in full force and effect. In event of any such invalidation, the Company and the Union shall meet promptly for the purpose of resolving such invalidation.
22
PART B - ARTICLE I, SECTION 12
Section 12	- Security Regulations
The Union recognizes that the Company has certain obligations in its contracts with the Government pertaining to security, and agrees that nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to place the Company in violation of its security agreements with the Government.
Therefore, in the event that the U. S. Air Force, U. S. Navy, or other Government agency duly concerned with Lockheed Martin Corporation security regulations, advises the Company in writing that any employee in the Union bargaining unit is restricted from work on or access to classified information and material, the Union will not contest such action as the Company may take pursuant to such advice to comply with its security obligations to the Government. In the event such Government Agency, following the taking of such action, advises the Company in writing that such an employee is no longer restricted for work on or access to classified information and material, the Company shall, promptly after receipt of such written advice from such Government Agency, reinstate with seniority and subject to the provisions of Article IV such an employee, if he promptly applies for such reinstatement, to the same job classification and rate of pay he held at the time such action was taken, and will join such employee and/or the Union, at such employee's request, in an application to such Government Agency for restoration by the Government of lost pay.
23
PART B - ARTICLE I, SECTION 13 & 14
Section 13	- Non-Discrimination
The Company and the Union agree that there will be no discrimination in the application of this Agreement because of age, race, color, creed, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or status as a U. S. Military Veteran or Disabled U. S. Military Veteran. The intent of the parties is to comply with all Federal, State, and Municipal employment laws as may apply to the workforce.
The masculine gender provisions which are contained in this Company-Union Agreement are intended to apply to both males and females and there is no intent to limit any rights of an employee based upon the sex of that employee.
Section 14	- Subcontracting
The Company agrees that it will not subcontract maintenance work (as distinguished from new construction or major modification or rehabilitation work) to be performed on Company premises when the work operations involved have normally been performed by employees in the bargaining unit, except in the following instances:
(a)	Where peculiar skills or specialized equipment are involved which are not available within the Company.
(b)	Where short-term or peak requirements necessitate the need for additional assistance be-
24
PART B - ARTICLE I, SECTION 14
cause of an insufficient number of employees then available possessing the necessary maintenance skills to perform such work operations within the time required.
(c)	Where unusual or one-shot jobs are required which are not usually performed by the Company.
(d)	Where the volume of work on any particular job precludes the possibility of its completion within scheduled time limits.
It is not the intent of the Company to use on-site contractors for the purpose of reducing or transferring work ordinarily performed by maintenance employees in the bargaining unit.

PART B - ARTICLE II, SECTION 1
ARTICLE II - UNION-COMPANY RELATIONS
Section 1	- Union Stewards and Committeemen
(A)	Number of Stewards and Committeemen:
(1)	As designated by the Union there shall be in the departments of the Plant, on every shift, a Committeeman for every eighty-five (85) employees, or major fraction there of, and a Steward for each department provided, however, that a department consisting of less than eighty-five (85) employees may be represented only by a Steward. Each Steward or Committeeman shall be an employee other than a Lead, regularly assigned to work in the same department and on the same shift as the employees he represents.
(2)	In unusual circumstances, particularly as may be presented in departments covering more than one location, the required number and location of Union Stewards and Committeemen may be adjusted by agreement between the parties. At a time mutually agreed upon, the Company shall permit all employees who are Union members to vote on Company property and during working hours once each year for Stewards and once each year for Committeemen. Additionally, when the merger of departments or the addition of a department or a shift makes necessary the election of a Union Steward and/or Committeeman, such election may be held on Company property and
26
PART B - ARTICLE II, SECTION 1
during working hours. The voting shall be conducted under rules and regulations agreed to between the Company and the Union. The Union will provide electronic notification (e-mail or fax) to Labor Relations upon selection of Shop Steward(s) and/or Committeemen.
(3)	In the event there are more Union Committeemen in a group or department than are provided for in this Section, the Company shall furnish to the Union a list of all Committeemen in the locations where the surplus exists. The Union shall promptly designate the Committeemen who are to remain in the capacity, provided, however, that if the Company has not received written notification of such designation from the Union within six (6) calendar days subsequent to the Company's notification, the Committeemen, in the locations where the surplus exists, who have the most seniority, automatically shall retain their status as Committeemen and the remaining Committeemen shall lose their status as Committeemen.
(B)	Time Off From Work:
While the Company and Union recognize the need for Union time, we also recognize the need to assure Company work is accomplished in accordance with operational requirements.
(1)	A Steward will be permitted to take the necessary time off from work without loss of pay
27
PART B - ARTICLE II, SECTION 1
for discussion with the Department Head of complaints or grievances of employees.
(2)	A Steward will be permitted to take the necessary time off from work without loss of pay for the following Company-Union business within his department:
(a)	For so much of one hour of the shift at a time mutually agreed upon by the Steward and the Department Head (normally the one -half hour immediately preceding the Steward's lunch period and the last one-half hour of the shift) as is required for the Steward to contact a Committeeman or to contact an employee who has a complaint or grievance. (Effective January 1, 1978, Paragraph (B) (2) (a) amended as follows: Steward designates which hour. Designation to be for one week. If Steward does not designate and no mutual agreement, then last hour of shift.) The Company may grant additional time to a specific written request to encourage resolution of the grievances. It is understood that the Steward will not abuse the use of Union time.
(b)	For discussion within the department with an authorized Business Representative of the Union when the latter finds it necessary to contact a Steward on employee complaints or grievances, or on matters arising out of the application of this Agreement.
28
PART B - ARTICLE II, SECTION 1
(3)	A Committeeman will be permitted to take the necessary time off from work without loss of pay for the following Company-Union business within his department:
(a)	For so much of one-half hour of the shift at a time mutually agreed upon by the Steward and the Department Head (normally the last one-half hour of the shift) as is required for the Committeeman to contact his Steward or to contact an employee who has a complaint or grievance. (Effective January 1, 1978, Paragraph (B) (3) (a) amended as follows: Steward designates which one-half hour. Designation to be for one week.

(b)	For discussion within the department with an authorized Business Representative of the Union when the latter finds it necessary to contact a Committeeman on employee complaints or grievances, or on matters arising out of the application of this Agreement.
29
PART B - ARTICLE II, SECTION 1
(4)	It is agreed that each Steward and Committeeman has assigned work to perform in the plant and that the contacts on Company time, which are provided for in this Section, will be no more frequent and no longer than the matter for discussion reasonably requires. A Steward or Committeeman who finds it necessary to leave his immediate work area shall first request permission from his immediate full-time supervisor. Such requests shall not unreasonably be denied.
(5)	The Company on the first day of employment shall give each new employee a copy of this Agreement.
At least once a week, at a time mutually agreed upon between the Steward and his Department Head, normally during the first one-half hour of the shift, a one-time meeting shall be arranged for the Steward to meet with any newly-hired employees, during which time he may discuss the advantages of Union membership. Upon request by the Steward to his department office, the names of employees new to the department on his shift in the current week shall be provided such Steward.
(C)	Steward and Committeeman Status on Transfers:
30
PART B - ARTICLE II, SECTION 1
A Union Steward or Committeeman of whose status as such Steward or Committeeman the Company has received written notice, with such status to be effective on the second work day following the date from the Union, shall not be transferred from one department to another, or one shift to another except with the consent of the individual Steward or Committeeman concerned, provided he is competent to perform the work remaining on the shift and warranting his classification. If a Steward or Committeeman is to be transferred to a different department or shift, the Company will give the Union seven (7) working days' written notice of such transfer. At the annual election of Union Stewards and Committeemen as provided for in Article II, Section 1, (A) (2), of this Agreement, upon written notice to the Company, such status shall become effective immediately.
(D)	Union Representation on an Overtime Day:
In the event a group of employees in the same department are required to work on their normal off-day, or on one of the holidays recognized in Article VI, Section 3 of this Agreement, the Steward may designate one of the employees within that group as an Alternate Steward, by so notifying the Department Head. During overtime hours, the union representative (Steward, Committeeman or Alternate Steward) will only be permitted to take the necessary time off from work without loss of pay
31
PART B - ARTICLE II, SECTION 2
for discussion with the Department Head of employee complaints or to contact employees who have complaints, which are of such urgent nature that they cannot properly await discussion on the next regular work day.
It is the intent that the Company give prompt notice to the Steward of those employees who will be assigned to work on their normal off-day or on holidays recognized by this Agreement.
Section 2	- Union Officials and Business Representatives
The President, Vice-President and Business Representatives of the Union shall have access to the Labor Relations Department Office for the purpose of contacting Labor Relations personnel and shall have access to the departments of the Company's plant to which they are assigned for the sole purpose of contacting the Union Steward or Committeeman concerning employee complaints or grievances or matters arising out of the application of this Agreement. Such visits shall be subject to such regulations as may be made from time to time by the Company. The Company shall not impose regulations which will render ineffective the purpose of this Section. Before entering the Company's plant for the above purpose, the President, Vice-President, or a Business Representative shall notify the Labor Relations Department of the date and time he will be in the plant,
32
PART B - ARTICLE II, SECTION 3 & 4

Section 4	- Bulletin Boards and Posting Notices
Space shall be provided on Company property at prominent locations agreed upon for Union bulletin boards (to be supplied by the Company) for the posting of the following types of notices:

Within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter, the Union will pick up and dispose of all remaining copies.
Section 5	- Solicitation of Memberships
Employees and Union representatives shall not solicit Union memberships or collect dues on Company property on the Company time of any employee, although such activities may be conducted by employees on Company property on the free time of the employees.
34
PART B - ARTICLE II, SECTION 6

39
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 1
ARTICLE III - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE AND ARBITRATION
Section 1 - Method of Handling Employee Grievances
Any employee having a problem concerning their individual rate of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment, may make such problem the subject matter of a grievance. All grievances may be processed as hereinafter provided through Section 5 of this Article, but only those grievances involving the interpretation or application of this Agreement as provided in Section 6 of this Article may be referred to arbitration.
The parties recognize the desirability of early resolution of employee grievances and the value of thorough discussion in the grievance resolution process. Accordingly, employees may take up with their supervisor any situation which may result in a grievance. If the problem is not resolved, it may be taken up with the appropriate next level of management by the Shop Steward. If the matter is not resolved, it may be reduced to writing in the form of a written grievance, delivered to the Steward and processed in accordance with Step I of the grievance procedure. Although discussion of the problem is an essential component of the grievance resolution process and is encouraged, each grievance must be considered on its merit. Failure to discuss
40
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 1
a grievance with supervision will not be the basis of denying any claimed agreement violation.
It is the desire of the Union and the Company that employee grievances be settled as quickly as possible, at the lowest possible step of the grievance procedure, and that settlements are consistent with the spirit and intent of this Agreement. The parties also recognize that honest resolution of grievances is dependent on early and truthful disclosure of the facts of the case. To facilitate this process, settlements made at Step 1 and Step 2 shall be non-precedential in nature.
The Company shall not confer with an employee with respect to a written grievance filed by the employee unless the employee’s Steward has been notified and given an opportunity to be present.
Failure of the Union to proceed within any time limit set forth in the procedure, hereinafter stated, shall constitute a waiver of the grievance unless such time limit has been mutually extended.
If a retroactive adjustment is involved in an employee’s grievance based upon a change in his job classification, such retroactivity shall not exceed thirty (30) calendar days prior to the date the employee’s written grievance was presented, unless extended by mutual agreement of the Company and the Union.
41
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 1
Failure of the Company to act within the time limit set forth in any Step shall entitle the Union to proceed to the next Step. In a particular case, any time limit specified hereinafter may be extended by mutual agreement in writing between the Company and the Union.
Employee grievances shall not be filed in the employee’s personnel folder.
(A) The procedure on employee grievances, except on grievances arising out of discharge, layoff and recall from layoff, as herein after provided, shall be as follows:
Step 1. If discussions with supervision by the employee and Shop Steward do not result in the resolution of the violation, an employee who wishes to present a grievance shall state his grievance in writing on a form to be mutually agreed upon by the Union and the Company, which shall be dated and signed by the employee and shall set forth a complete statement of the grievance, the facts on which it is based, the time of their occurrence, and the remedy or correction desired. The employee’s Steward shall deliver such grievance to the Department Head. Unless the written grievance signed by the Employee has been delivered to the appropriate manager within ten (10) working days from the date the aggrieved knew, or by reasonable diligence could have known, the grievance shall be
42
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 1
deemed to be waived. The manager shall meet and discuss the grievance with the Steward and attempt settlement. Upon request by either the Steward or the Appropriate Manager, the employee's supervisor and/or the employee shall be present in the Step 1 grievance meeting.
Upon request and by mutual agreement between the Steward and the Department Head, the appropriate Labor Relations Representative and the appropriate Business Representative shall meet with the parties in Step 1 within fifteen (15) days of the request to provide assistance toward reaching settlement of the grievance. Such request must be made within the 7 working days required for the manager to answer the grievance.
Following the foregoing discussions, management will give its written answer to the grievance as soon as possible and in any event within seven (7) working days after receipt of the written grievance.
If a settlement has not been reached, the Department Head and the Steward shall prepare a statement setting forth the specific pertinent points upon which the Company and the Union are in agreement, those points upon which the Company and the Union are in disagreement, and the issue or issues remaining in dispute. Such statement shall be signed by the Department Head and the Steward. This statement shall constitute
43
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 1
the factual basis for further processing of the grievance.
If a settlement has not been reached and the Union desires to proceed further with the grievance, the Union, within seven (7) working days after the receipt of management’s answer, shall proceed in accordance with Step 2.
If this statement of facts and issues is incomplete, either party may remand the grievance to the first step of the procedure for more complete information.
The written grievance of an employee on the active payroll arising out of the application of Article IV, Section 9 - Promotion and Upgrading, and Article IV, Section 3(A) 5(a) shall be submitted by the Steward to the appropriate manager within ten (10) working days from the date the aggrieved knew, or by reasonable diligence could have known about the basis upon which the grievance is founded. Without negotiations or any attempt to settle, the manager shall promptly sign and date the grievance and return such grievance to the Steward. Within five (5) working days after return to the Steward, if the Union desires to proceed further with the grievance such grievance shall be submitted by the Union directly from Step 1 to Step 3. The Union shall present such grievance to the Labor Relations Office for receipt and pro-
44
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 1
cessing by the Company.
Grievances arising out of the application of Article IV, Section 3 (A) 5(a) involving layoff shall be processed directly to Step 3 in accordance with Section 1, Paragraph (B) of this Article III.
Grievances arising out of the application of Article VIII, Section 1 (2) involving substantial change only shall be processed in accordance with Letter #50 by the Classification Grievance Committee.
Step 2. The Union shall deliver to the Labor Relations office a copy of the electronic grievance. Within ten (10) working days, a meeting will be scheduled for consideration of the grievance by the Business Representative and appropriate manager. The time limits for meeting may be mutually extended by the parties. If desired by management or the Business Representative, a member of the Labor Relations office may be present at Step 2 to assist in resolution. To facilitate this process, settlements made at Step 2 shall be non-precedential in nature.
If a settlement is not reached at Step 2, the Company will provide a written answer to the grievance within five (5) working days.
If the Union desires to proceed further with the
45
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 1
grievance, the Union, within five (5) working days after the receipt of such answer, shall proceed in accordance with Step 3.
Step 3. The Union shall deliver to the Labor Relations office written notice of certification that it desires to proceed with the grievance to Step 3. Unless the grievance, within thirty (30) working days after receipt by the Labor Relations office of said written notice, has been scheduled for and heard by the appropriate Committee, such grievance shall be deemed to be waived. During such period the Union and the Company will continue their efforts to resolve those grievances which remain unsettled. It is the desire of the parties to have only grievances of substance heard by the Committee. To achieve this end, the Senior Negotiating Com-mittee/Classification Grievance Committee will review all pending grievances subject to their jurisdiction prior to scheduling such grievances to be heard at Step 3.
In order to expedite the hearing of grievances, involving continuing liability, or unresolved issues which result in a negative impact to Company operations, the Company may request the Union to schedule a third step meeting on any such grievance by notifying the President of Local Lodge 709 in writing and the Union will schedule the grievance before the appropriate Committee within fifteen (15) working days. Thereafter, if the case is not scheduled for hear-46
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 1
ing at the Joint Labor Relations Committee within the fifteen (15) day period, liability on the case will be waived beginning with the date of that meeting and continuing until such time as the case is heard by the Joint Labor Relations Committee. Liability will not be waived for any period during which the Company is unwilling or unable to meet.
On the days that the Committee is scheduled to meet, such Committee shall meet for a full working day provided all grievances scheduled to be heard by such Committee have not been mutually dispositioned. If such Committee after a full day’s meeting does not hear a case which has been scheduled, the time limits herein set forth shall be extended to the time of the next meeting.
Scheduled grievances shall be presented before the appropriate Committee in the following priority order:
(1)	Grievances arising out of discharge, layoff, recall from layoff and other such grievances involving reinstatement.
(2)	Grievances held over or remaining from a previous Committee which were scheduled for but not heard by such Committee.
(3)	All other grievances scheduled for the Committee.
47
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 1
Grievances in each of the above priorities shall be heard in the order of their date of filing.
(B) The procedure on grievances arising out of discharge, layoff, or recall from layoff, shall be as follows:
(1)	Discharge and Layoff
The employee shall deliver his signed grievance to the Union who may deliver such written grievance to the Labor Relations office and proceed as set forth in Step 2 of this Section. Unless the written grievance signed by the employee has been delivered to the Labor Relations office within ten (10) calendar days after the discharge or layoff complained of, the grievance shall be deemed to be waived.
(2)	Recall from Layoff
The written grievance of an employee on layoff arising out of recall from layoff should be delivered promptly by the Union to the Labor Relations office following the recall complained of, but in no event shall such employee be permitted to file such grievance beyond ten (10) working days from the date the aggrieved knew, or by reasonable diligence could have known from the date he returns to work from such layoff. Any monetary adjustment in
48
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 2
volved in such grievance shall in no case commence prior to thirty (30) working days prior to the date the grievance is delivered to the Labor Relations office.
Section 2	- Method of Handling Multiple Grievances
In some instances, an action by the Company may affect multiple employees causing them to be aggrieved. In these cases, to avoid multiple grievance filings, a grievance shall be designated as a multiple grievance where a single grievance will represent the interests of multiple affected employees. Designation of multiple grievances should be accomplished as early as possible in the process. This will be done by the Union and/or management attaching a list of names and dated signatures of employees who believe they are aggrieved to a single grievance form and indicating on the form that it is a multiple grievance. Thereafter, other affected employees may be added to the group by agreement between the parties.
Additionally, where the parties believe that multiple grievances are being filed on the same subject, the Company/Union shall close out such grievances in favor of the settlement of the multiple grievance. When this is done, any remedy applied to the original grievance will be applicable to all employees whose grievances have been closed in favor of the group grievance. In cases where grievances have
49
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 3
been closed in favor of a single group grievance, either party may cite and rely on the facts of each and all of the cases in presenting its arguments. Once a group grievance has been filed it will be processed in line with the steps of a normal employee grievance as specified in this Article III.
Section 3	- Union Grievances
The Union may file a grievance with the Company with respect to the application or interpretation of any of the terms or provisions of Part B as follows: Article I (except Sections 1, 6 and 13), Article II, Article V (except Section 1), Section 5 of Article VI, and Sub-Section (2) of Section 1 of Article VIII. Such Union grievance shall be delivered to the Labor Relations office within ten (10) working days after the occurrence upon which such grievance is founded, and shall first be discussed by the Union and the Labor Relations office. Within seven (7) working days after receipt of such grievance the Labor Relations office shall deliver to the Union its answer in writing. If a settlement has not been reached and the Union desires to proceed further with the grievance, the Union within five (5) working days after receipt of such answer shall deliver to the Labor Relations office a written notice that it desires to present the grievance to the Joint Labor Relations Committee.
50
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 4
The grievance shall be scheduled for and heard by the Joint Labor Relations Committee within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of such written notice. If the Committee does not hear a Union grievance which has been scheduled, the time limits herein set forth shall be extended to the time of the next meeting. If that Committee fails to settle the grievance, the Union may proceed in accordance with Section 6 of this Article. Failure of the Union to proceed within the time limits herein set forth shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.
Section 4	- Joint Labor Relations Committee
There shall be established a Joint Labor Relations Committee which shall consist of representatives of the Union and the Company. The representatives of the Union shall consist of a board of five (5) members, at least four (4) of whom shall be full-time employees of the Company. The representatives of the Company shall consist of a like number, at least four (4) of whom shall be full-time employees of the Company. This Committee may establish subcommittees on a permanent or temporary basis.
The Joint Labor Relations Committee shall review and attempt to settle all grievances which remain unsettled after the procedure set forth in Section 1 of this Article has been followed, and all disagreements concerning rates for jobs established by the Company after the procedure set forth in Article VIII, Section 1, (2) of this Agreement has been followed.
51
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 5
The decisions of the Joint Labor Relations Committee shall be considered as final if a majority of the Union representatives and a majority of the Company representatives concur.
A meeting of this Committee shall be held weekly, or by mutual agreement more frequently if the volume of unresolved grievances at the third step warrants such additional meetings.
The Company will pay for one-half of the time of Union members of the Joint Labor Relations Committee (who are full-time employees of the Company) up to a maximum of four and one-half (4 1/2) hours on days during the regular work week when they meet with the Company on Company-Union business.
Section 5	- Classification Grievance Committee
There shall be established a Classification Grievance Committee which shall consist of three members of the Union and three representatives of the Company. The Committee shall meet once each week except when no grievances are pending. The Committee will consider any employee grievance in which the employee alleges that by reason of the performance of certain duties he is entitled to a classification different from the one he holds, when such grievance has been processed through the previous steps of the grievance procedure without having been settled. If the Committee acts affirmative
52
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 6
ly on the employee’s request, it shall have the authority to determine the employee’s rate in the new classification, if such rate is an issue in the grievance.
The agenda for each meeting shall consist of those grievances on which written notice has been received by the Labor Relations office as provided in Section 1 of this Article.
The Classification Grievance Committee shall meet two (2) days quarterly for the purpose of mutual review of classifications, classification usage and to consider grievances pursuant to Letter 50. The schedule for such meetings will be at a mutually agreed time.
By mutual consent of the parties, any meeting may be cancelled, or a special meeting called.
Section 6	-Arbitration
Any grievance, which has not been settled pursuant to Sections 1 through 5 or 7 of this Article, may be referred to arbitration.
The party seeking arbitration must deliver to the other party written notice of such intent to proceed to arbitration within five (5) working days after the Joint Labor Relations Committee or the Classification Grievance Committee has rendered its decision. Within ten (10) working days from the date
53
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 6
of delivery of the notice, an arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement, or the parties shall request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to submit a list of five (5) persons from which the arbitrator shall be chosen. Within five (5) working days following the receipt of such panel from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service the parties shall select an arbitrator in the following manner: The Union and the Company shall alternately strike one (1) name from such panel (the right to strike the first name having been determined by lot) until only one (1) name remains and that person shall be the arbitrator. The parties may, during the term of this Agreement, agree to an alternative method of selecting an arbitrator.
Upon receipt of acknowledgement by the arbitrator of his willingness to act, the parties shall, within five (5) working days, schedule the arbitration to be heard within the next thirty (30) calendar days at the alternating factilities unless the parties waive by mutual agreement. If the arbitrator cannot hear the case within such thirty (30) days, it shall be scheduled at the earliest date thereafter agreeable to the arbitrator, or, by the mutual agreement, the parties may agree to select a new arbitrator or request a new panel in accordance with the procedure and within the time limits specified above. Failure by the party seeking arbitration to proceed within any of the time limits herein set forth shall result in a waiver of the grievance.
54
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 6
The parties shall execute a submission agreement. If the parties fail to agree upon a joint submission each party shall submit a separate submission and the arbitrator shall determine the issue or issues to be heard, provided that said issue or issues are arbitrable in accordance with this Section. The joint or the separate submission shall state the issue or issues and the specific clause or clauses of this Agreement which the arbitrator is to interpret or apply.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to interpret and apply the provisions of this Agreement including the authority to determine under Article VIII, Section 1, (2), a basic rate of pay for a modified or newly established job. In consideration of cases involving employees off the payroll and in cases involving pay rates, the arbitrator’s authority will be limited to award no more than two hundred and forty (240) calendar days pay or pay adjustment in remedy of any grievance. The arbitrator shall not have the authority to amend or modify this Agreement or to establish new terms and conditions of this Agreement. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the Company, the Union, and the employee, and shall be complied with expeditiously.
In the event an arbitrator is selected and a hearing date scheduled and agreed upon by both parties and either party subsequently cancels such hearing, the
55
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 7
party so canceling shall pay any cost assessed by the arbitrator. Except as provided above, the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator and arbitration shall be divided equally, provided, however, that each party shall bear the expenses in respect to its own witnesses and that the cost of any report or transcript shall be divided equally only if furnished by mutual consent. Each party shall pay one-half of the aggrieved employee's time lost from work for appearance at the arbitration proceedings.
The parties recognize that honest resolution of grievances is dependent on early and truthful disclosure of the facts of the case. Accordingly, arbitrators are instructed to give greater weight to facts that are documented in case records early in the procedure and lesser weight to those facts that are raised later in the procedure. Specifically, facts or contentions that are raised for the first time before the arbitrator, that have not been considered by the parties, are to be entirely discounted and not considered by the arbitrator.
Section 7	- Alternative Resolution Process
During the life of this Agreement, either party may request the other party to enter into a program exploring the use of resolution, fact finding and/or conciliation techniques to assist the parties in addressing their disputes.
56
PART B - ARTICLE III, SECTION 7
Should the Company/Union Negotiating Committees mutually agree to implement any of the aforementioned processes, implementation ground rules will be established by mutual agreement, including at which step of the grievance procedure these techniques will be used.
57
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 1
ARTICLE IV - SENIORITY
Section 1	- Basis of Seniority
Seniority shall be the relative status of employees in respect to length of service with the Company, subject to the following qualifications:
(1)	An employee who, before February 7, 1955, was hired within the Marietta Plant of LM AERO - MARIETTA, or transferred to such Plant to work within it, shall have seniority dating from his original hire or rehire with the Corporation.
(2)	An employee transferred from an occupation covered by this Agreement to a salaried occupation within the Company prior to January 1, 2006, shall continue to accumulate seniority and in case of transfer to an occupation covered by this Agreement such seniority shall apply.
An employee transferred from an occupation covered by this Agreement to a salaried occupation within the Company on or after January 1, 2006, shall not continue to accumulate seniority, but will retain the seniority previously accumulated while holding an occupation covered by this Agreement. In case of transfer to an occupation covered by this Agreement such seniority shall apply and will continue to accumulate.
A salaried employee possessing seniority in ac-
58
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 1
cordance with the above will first be placed in their previously held hourly classification if and where an open requisition exists. Where no openings exists the salaried employee possessing seniority in accordance with the above may be placed in any previously held classification covered by this Agreement provided such salaried employee possesses greater seniority than the most senior, qualified employee on the recall list for such classification. In the event such salaried employee possesses six (6) years' or more seniority and may not, due to insufficient seniority, be placed in the classification held immediately prior to his most recent transfer to a salaried occupation nor in any previously held classification lateral thereto or higher, such salaried employee shall be considered as surplus in the classification held immediately prior to his transfer to a salaried occupation and will be afforded placement rights under Section 3, Paragraph (A) (5) of this Article IV. Placement of a salaried employee under these provisions shall be into the highest of any such job classifications. If such salaried employee has been laid off his right to placement in an occupation covered by this Agreement shall be subject to the same provisions as are set forth in Section 8 of this Article.
(3)	An employee transferred from an hourly occupation (except from an hourly occupation represented by another union) to an occupation covered by this Agreement shall have seniority dating from his original hire or rehire by the 59
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 1
Company, except that any period of time spent by such employee in the employ of another Division of the Corporation shall not be included in the establishment of such seniority. An employee hired on or after October 1, 1974 into a non-represented hourly classification and thereafter transfers into a classification covered by this Agreement shall have seniority from the date of such transfer.
(4)	A part-time employee shall be entitled to credit for length of service in the same proportion that time regularly worked by such part-time employee bears to the time regularly worked by a full-time employee except for purposes of layoff and recalling from layoff. For purposes of layoff, parttime employees shall not be considered to have acquired seniority.
(5)	In order to facilitate the training and development of especially qualified individuals, particularly those with an appropriate academic background for executive, administrative and professional positions, the Company may classify employees as Special Trainees. The number so classified shall not exceed fifteen (15) at any one time. Special Trainees may be hired or selected from the work force and given assignments in available openings without regard to Sections 4, 9, 10, and 11 of this Article. In selecting trainees, preference shall be given to those individuals already in the employ of the Company who possess the necessary qualifications. They shall be paid within the rate range established for the job classification which they are assigned to perform, and shall not 60
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 2
hold the classification of Special Trainee for a period in excess of two (2) years.
Section 2	- Establishment of Seniority Rights
Ninety (90) calendar days after an employee starts to work, he shall acquire seniority rights, and his seniority shall be retroactive to his starting date. During the first ninety (90) calendar days of his employment, he shall be considered probationary, and his retention as an employee shall be entirely within the discretion of the Company. This period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Company and Business Representative for a total period not to exceed one hundred (120) calendar days after an employee starts to work. On matters other than discharge or layoff, such employee shall be entitled to the same representation as other employees as set forth in Article I, Section 1.
If an employee is laid off during his probationary period and subsequently rehired any seniority accumulated during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding his rehire date shall be counted toward his probationary period. If such service is not continuous, the employee's seniority date shall be established as of a date ninety (90) calendar days or one hundred twenty (120) calendar days respectively prior to the completion of the probationary period.
An employee who is hired and begins work at the Company within thirty (30) calendar days following his termination at another plant of the Lockheed Martin Corporation or subsidiary thereof, or during 61
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 3
the period such employee is on layoff and possesses recall rights to such other plant, shall not be required to serve a probationary period.
Section 3	- Layoffs
(A) General Layoff:
(1)An employee who has acquired seniority rights pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 of this Article shall not be laid off under the general layoff provisions of this Sub-Section (A) unless all employees in his occupation who have not acquired seniority rights pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 of this Article have been laid off. In a department where a surplus in an occupation develops and employees in such department and occupation who have acquired seniority rights and possess the same seniority date become vulnerable to layoff, such employ-ee(s) possessing prior service will be given preference (where prior service information is available) in the following order; Marietta Hires, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Hires, Lockheed Martin Corporation Hires and Others. Employees will be considered in these groups and the employee with the earliest original hire date will be considered more senior. The next preference will be given to employees with the lowest last five (5) digits in their employee number. Employee numbers (or prior service considerations) cannot be used for the purpose of displacing into another department or classification
62
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 3
(2)	(DELETED 1986 NEGOTIATIONS)
(3)	Employees who have acquired seniority rights shall be laid off in order of seniority applied by occupation, within the Company, where ability, skill and efficiency are substantially equal. This provision shall be applied as follows:
(a)	Where ability, skill and efficiency are substantially equal, employees within the surplus group shall displace the least senior employees in the occupation in the Company.
(b)	Employees in a department where a surplus in an occupation develops whose seniority makes them vulnerable to layoff from the occupation shall be included within the group considered as surplus within the department.
(4)	An employee who has acquired seniority rights scheduled for layoff shall be placed in any lower-rated classification previously held or in any lateral classification previously held by such employee, provided that he is qualified to perform the work of any less senior employee in such classification in the department where the least senior employee in such classification is located and provided further that such less senior employee, whose work the surplus employee is qualified to perform is, himself, qualified to perform the work of the least senior employee in such classification. In this event such less senior
63
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 3
employee shall displace the least senior employee in such classification.
(5)	(a) An employee with a seniority date before January 1, 1978, with six years' or more seniority scheduled for layoff shall be placed in any lateral or lower-rated classification if he is qualified to perform the major duties set forth in the job description for such lateral or lower-rated classification which distinguishes such classification from other classifications.
The word "qualified" as used in this Subparagraph (5) (a) means that an employee must be able, without a training or learning period, to perform the major duties as set forth in the job description for such classification which distinguishes such classification from other classifications; however, such employee, placed in a classification not previously held, will be given orientation normally provided employees displacing in the classification not previously held. In order to be considered for placement consideration under this Sub-paragraph (5) (a), the employee must have on file with the Company full and factual information substantiating his qualifications for such lateral or lower-rated classification.
Such employee with six (6) years' or more seniority shall be considered as qualified for functional line placement.
(1)	In a lower-rated classification in the same 64
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 3
functional line of the job family as his current classification.
(2)	In a lower-rated classification than that previously held in the same functional line of the job family as such previously held classification, provided such classification is lateral to or lower than his current classification.
(3)	Such employee with six (6) years' or more seniority shall have functional line placement rights in accordance with Paragraph (5) (b).
(b)	An employee with a seniority date after January 1, 1978 with one (1) year or more seniority scheduled for layoff shall be considered as qualified for functional line placement and shall be placed in a lateral or lower-rated classification in the same functional line of the job family as his current classification or in a lateral or lowerrated classification in the same functional line of the job family of a previously held classification provided he possesses greater seniority than the least senior employee in such lateral or lowerrated classification. Functional line placement consideration under this Sub-paragraph (5) (b) shall be limited to the agreed upon Functional Line Charts.
Employees hired or rehired on or after March 2, 2014, shall be placed in a previously held lateral or lower-rated classification, seniority permitting.
65
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 3
(c)	Rehired LM AERO - MARIETTA Plant employees who have acquired seniority both currently and during prior employment shall have surplus placement rights to jobs previously held during current or previous tenure with the Company. Recall rights to any such jobs must be earned under current tenure as contractually defined.
In effecting placement under Sub-paragraphs (4) and (5) (a), (b), and (c) above, the Company shall, insofar as it is practicable, place the employee in the highest of any such classifications.
If such classifications are lateral (i.e., the same maximum rate), he shall displace in the classification occupied by the least senior employee.
(6)	An employee who has completed the Lockheed Martin Apprenticeship Program and who is scheduled for layoff shall have placement rights in any lower-rated job in the functional line of the job family of the classification for which he served his apprenticeship, provided he is qualified to perform the work of the least senior of any less-senior employees in such classification.
(7)	A surplus employee who has attained seniority will be placed in a lateral or lower-rated classification for which he is qualified if there is an available opening in such classification.
(8)	The Company shall have five (5) working
66
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 3
days in which to correct, without liability, any improper layoff resulting from a surplus employee accepting a job involving displacement of another employee and then declining such job within twenty-four (24) hours prior to the effective date he was scheduled to displace such other employee. Employees displacing into any classification shall be given the same guidance and instruction as given existing employees on new tools or processes added since they last held the occupation.
(9)	The Company shall make the displacements provided for in Sub-paragraphs (4) and (5) as rapidly as possible. It is recognized, however, that circumstances may occur, particularly in layoffs involving more than one and one-half per cent (1-1/2%) of the employees in the bargaining unit which will make it necessary for the Company to lay off such employees for not longer than five (5) working days, until placement can be effected.
(10)	Downgrade from a higher grade to a lower grade of an occupation, except for Lead, shall be made within the Company on the basis of seniority, where ability, skill and efficiency are substantially equal.
(11)	In the event that a Lead becomes surplus the downgrade shall be made within the smallest unit under full-time supervision where the surplus occurs. Where ability, skill and efficiency are substantially equal the least senior Lead
67
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 3
leading the same occupations within such smallest unit as the surplus Lead shall be downgraded.
(12)	An employee scheduled for downgrade within the occupation (unless the downgrade results from inability to perform the higher grade work) or scheduled for downgrade in lieu of layoff, may at the time such downgrade is offered, elect to take layoff in its place.
Provided, however, an employee in an occupation within a department having a surplus may request and receive a layoff provided such employee is more senior than a lower senior employee within the department scheduled for surplus from the occupation, and all open requisitions in the same classification within the plant have been filled. Employee written request for such layoff must be received by the department manager at least five (5) full work days prior to the effective date of the surplus or the date the affected employee is notified of the surplus declaration, whichever is later. Such employee's recall rights will be limited to the classification involved in the current layoff, and any recall rights to classifications higher than the classification from which voluntary layoff was taken to which the employee was entitled prior to the current layoff. Provided, however, that the recall rights of an employee who takes voluntary layoff shall be suspended
68
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 3
from the classification from which laid off for a maximum of ninety (90) months or until the employee notifies Labor Relations in writing that they wish to be returned to the recall list. This notification, at minimum, will not become effective for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months immediately subsequent to the employee's layoff date without extending the employee's recall rights. Such employee shall remain on recall to higher classifications to which the employee had established recall rights prior to the current lay-off. Upon notification, and following the twelve (12) month period of suspension, the employee's recall rights shall automatically be reactivated and the employee will at that time be eligible for recall to the classification for which recall rights were suspended. Such employee, by electing voluntary layoff, shall forfeit recall rights to any lateral or lower classifications including recall rights to Labor Grades 1 thru 4 granted to them under Article IV, Section 4, Paragraphs (7) and (9).
(13)	In the event an employee involuntarily loses their security clearance or program access and can no longer perform the work that is available in the department, the employee will be declared surplus and placed in accordance with provisions of this Article and Section.
(14)	The word "occupation" includes all grades
69
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 3
and Lead within an occupation, for example: Motor Rewinder is an occupation and includes Motor Rewinder Lead, Motor Rewinder A and Motor Rewinder B.
The word "classification" designates an occupation and in addition a specific grade of that occupation, as for example: Motor Rewinder A. Where there is only one grade in an occupation, such grade is assumed to be the A grade unless otherwise designated, for example:	General
Machinist. Classifications in the same labor grade are considered "lateral classifications".
Downgrading within an occupation refers to a movement from one grade of the occupation to a lower grade of the same occupation, as for example: Motor Rewinder A to Motor Rewinder B.
A downgrade in lieu of layoff refers to a movement from one classification to a lower-rated classification in a different occupation, for example:	General Machinist to Machinist-Mill/
Machine Tools Set up.
(B)	Temporary Layoff:
Temporary layoffs may be made for periods of not exceeding twenty (20) working days. Such layoffs shall be made in order of Company-wide seniority applied by occupation within the particular unit of organization, work unit or project affected where ability, skill and efficiency are 70
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 3
substantially equal. An employee shall not be temporarily laid off under this provision more than once in any calendar year until all other employees in the same classification within the affected group, as defined above, shall have been temporarily laid off once.
(C)	Emergency Reduction of the Working Force:
Step 1. When an Emergency Reduction of the Working Force which involves the layoff of 5% or more of the employees in the bargaining unit is necessary, the first step in the Emergency Reduction of the Working Force shall be the layoff of employees affected, without regard to the General Layoff Procedure for the period of time necessary to put into effect Step 2.
Step 2. The second step of the Emergency Reduction of the Working Force shall be the carrying out of the General Layoff procedure. Such assignments shall not be governed by the Recall from Layoff procedure and shall be made as promptly as is reasonably possible.
(D)	Top Seniority for Purposes of Layoff:
(1)	For the purposes of applying the Temporary and General Layoff procedures, the following employees shall be deemed to have top seniority:
(a)	Union Stewards and Committeemen of whose status as such the Company has had 71
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 3
seven (7) calendar days' written notice. Upon written notification to the Company by the Union of the Stewards and Committeemen elected at the annual election of Union Stewards and Committeemen as provided for in Article II, Section 1, (A), (2) of this Agreement, in such instance the seven (7) calendar days' written notice provided for herein shall be waived.
(b)	Union Representatives on the Senior Negotiating Committee not to exceed five (5) in number. Such representative shall not be transferred from one shift to another, except with his consent, provided he is competent to perform the work remaining within his classification on the shift in the department.
(c)	Three (3) employees of the Company who are the permanent Union Representatives on the Classification Grievance Committee.
(2)	During the period of a temporary layoff, the number of Committeemen shall not be reduced below the number allowed under the provisions of Article II, Section 1, as applied to the number of employees remaining.
A Steward shall not be laid off on a temporary layoff provided he is able and willing to perform the work remaining within the department and shift in the labor grade in which his classifica
72
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 4
tion falls or in a lower labor grade. During a temporary layoff and during the period between the first and second steps in an Emergency Reduction of the Working Force, the terms of office of laid-off Union Stewards and Committeemen shall continue.
If a department or a shift within a department is shut down for a period not to exceed one-hundred-twenty (120) days, the Steward in such department or on such shift shall upon its reopening have top seniority in his occupation and shift for purpose of recall.
Section 4	- Recall
(A)	Recall:
Employees shall be recalled from the recall list into the classification in which the opening exists in order of seniority, where ability, skill and efficiency are substantially equal. Upon recall to a classification of employees who become eligible for recall and who possess the same seniority date, such em-ployee(s) possessing prior service will be given preference (where prior service information is available) in the following order; Marietta Hires, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Hires, Lockheed Martin Corporation Hires and Others. The next preference will be given to employees with the lowest last five (5) digits in their employee number. Employees will be considered in these groups and the employee with the earliest original hire date will be considered more senior. The recall list shall include:
73
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 4
(1)	Those employees laid off from the occupation in which the opening exists; and
(2)	Employees who in lieu of layoff accepted placement in a lateral classification or downgrade from the classification in which the opening exists or who at the time of downgrade in lieu of layoff had displacement rights in accordance with Section 3 of this Article into such lateral or lower classification previously held and in which the opening exists and were not placed in such classification because of insufficient seniority; provided that regardless of the method of entry into his current classification (except in circumstances where the employee was placed into his current classification as a result of lateral recall) each employee shall have lateral recall rights to previously held lateral classifications provided a written request is filed with Labor Relations by the employee within seven (7) calendar days of his most recent placement in a job lateral to the requested classifications; and
(3)	Those employees who, in lieu of layoff, accepted downgrade from the classification in which the opening exists and who were subsequently laid off. Such employees shall remain on layoff with recall rights to the job from which downgraded for a maximum of ninety (90) months; and
(4)	Those employees on layoff who at the time of their layoff had displacement rights in ac-74
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 4
cordance with Section 3 of Article IV, into such lateral or lower classification previously held and in which the opening exists, but, because of insufficient seniority, were not placed into such classification; and
(5)	Those employees who, in lieu of layoff, accepted downgrade and at the time of such downgrade had displacement rights, in accordance with Section 3 of Article IV, into such lateral or lower classification previously held and in which the opening exists, but were not placed in such classification because of insufficient seniority, and who were subsequently laid off. Such employees shall remain on layoff with recall rights to such jobs for a maximum of ninety (90) months.
(6)	Those employees on layoff or downgrade in lieu of layoff, who at the time of layoff or downgrade in lieu of layoff, possessed displacement rights in accordance with the agreed upon Functional Line Charts into a lower or lateral classification in which the opening exists, but because of insufficient seniority were not placed into such classification.
(7)	Employees with three (3) or more years' seniority at the time of layoff who are on layoff and have recall rights to any Factory classification-(s), shall have recall rights to all Factory classifications in Labor Grades 1 through 4.
(8)	Each employee with three (3) or more years 75
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 4
of seniority at the time of downgrade in lieu of layoff who has recall rights to any Factory clas-sification(s), shall have recall rights to all Factory classifications in Labor Grades 1 through 4 which are higher rated than his/her current classification.
(9)	Employees with three (3) or more years' seniority at the time of layoff who are on layoff and have recall rights to any Technical and Office classification(s), shall have recall rights to all Technical and Office classifications in Labor Grades 1 through 4 with the following exceptions:
Typist (834-3).
(10)	Each employee with three (3) or more years of seniority at the time of downgrade in lieu of layoff who has recall rights to any Technical and Office classification(s), shall have recall rights to all Technical and Office classifications in Labor Grades 1 through 4 which are higher rated than his/her current classification with the following exceptions:
Typist (834-3).
(11)	Employees who have held both Factory and Technical and Office Classifications shall have recall rights to both Factory and Technical and Office Classifications as set forth in Paragraphs (7), (8), (9), and/or (10) above.
76
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 4
Employees recalled to a Labor Grade 1 through 4 classification under this provision are not eligible for subsequent recall within other Labor Grade 1 through 4 jobs.
Any employee recalled to the active payroll from layoff other than temporary recall shall be retained for not less than four (4) weeks or paid in lieu thereof. This paragraph is not to be construed as giving any such employee placement, displacement or retention rights different from or in addition to those provided elsewhere in this Agreement.
An employee on layoff status may refuse recall to a job of temporary duration without losing his place on the recall list or his right to be considered for the next permanent opening for which he is eligible to be recalled. Employees refusing recall of temporary duration may be excluded from consideration for subsequent temporary recall for the following three (3) month period. A job of temporary duration, for the purpose of this paragraph, is defined as a job which, in the opinion of the Company at the time the offer is made, is of an anticipated duration of ninety (90) days or less. It is understood that the Company will use its best judgment in making such a determination, but will in no event be liable for errors in judgment in so determining.
If a laid-off employee fails to report for work and provides in accordance with Article IV, Section 8 (3) a reasonable excuse, the employee shall not be entitled to the job but shall be entitled to hold his place on the seniority list and to be considered for 77
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 4
the next vacancy for which he is eligible.
(B)	Relinquishment of Recall Rights:
An employee who becomes surplus under the General Layoff provisions of the Agreement and who is subsequently placed on lay-off, shall, upon his election as provided below in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), relinquish his recall rights to such previous-lyheld, lower-rated classifications as set forth therein:
(1)	A surplus employee, who at the time of layoff possesses displacement rights in accordance with Section 3 of Article IV into a lower classification previously held, and who elects layoff in lieu of such placement, by such election automatically relinquishes recall rights to the classification in which placement was declined and to classifications which are lateral to or lower than the classification into which placement was declined.
(2)	A surplus employee, who at the time of layoff possesses displacement rights in accordance with Section 3 of Article IV into a lower classification previously held, but who cannot exercise such placement rights at the time of layoff because of insufficient seniority, may elect prior to placement on layoff to relinquish recall rights to such lower classification and by such election automatically relinquishes recall rights to classifications lateral to or lower than the classification to which recall rights were 78
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 5
declined. Such employee must, prior to placement on lay-off, provide Labor Relations written or electronic notice of such intent and complete the necessary form relinquishing his recall rights to such lower classification previously held.
(3)	A surplus employee placed on layoff while on Prolonged Leave of Absence, without the opportunity to exercise the rights provided in (B) (1) and/or (B) (2) above, may elect to exercise such rights by notification of such in writing to the Labor Relations Office of the Company within one week following the effective date of his layoff.
(4)	A surplus employee with three (3) or more years' seniority at the time of layoff may elect prior to placement on layoff to relinquish recall rights to classifications in Labor Grades 1 through 4 contractually earned under Article IV, Section 4, Paragraphs (7) and/or (9). Such employee must, prior to placement on layoff, advise the Personnel Representative of such intent and complete the necessary form relinquishing his recall rights to such classifications.
Section 5	- Physically Handicapped Employees
(1)	Physically handicapped employees (blind, those who are deaf and mute, or have similar disabilities) may be retained or reinstated regardless of the seniority principles stated in this Article in accordance with such mutual agreement as hereafter may be entered into between the Company and the Union.
79
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 6
(2)	An employee who becomes physically limited as a result of an injury, or illness, incurred in the course of his employment with the Company and determined by the Workmen's Compensation Board or the Company to be occupational, shall be retained or reinstated in a classification where an opening exists if he is qualified to perform such work, provided he applies for such reinstatement within thirty (30) calendar days after he is qualified to perform such work and further provided he has greater seniority than the most senior employee who has established priority rights under Article IV, Section 10 of this Agreement.

PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 8
Section 8	- Loss of Seniority

(1)	Resignation (a five-day unreported absence on scheduled work days without a reasonable explanation for failure to notify the Company shall be considered a resignation);
(2)	Discharge for just cause;
(3)	If, after a layoff, the employee is notified to report for work, by certified mail addressed to them at their address on record at time of layoff (or to the last subsequent address provided to the Employee Service Center), and fails within one (1) week after notification or such additional time as the Company may grant to report for work.

Section 9	- Promotion and Upgrading
(1)	On promotion to Lead consideration shall be given to qualified employees under the first fulltime supervision where the opening exists and when employee qualifications are equal, the most senior will be promoted to Lead. Leads will be selected or removed within a department based on need and job-related criteria. Non-job-related considerations will not be used in lead selection or removal.
(2)	A list of the job classifications that have current and anticipated openings will be published on the Labor Relations Website as new job openings are identified. This list will also be provided to the Union by electronic communication.
(3)	Each employee may file upgrade requests for promotion to as many as four (4) higher rated classifications, excluding trainee classifications. Employees that accept a promotion during their initial probation period will have their probation extended an additional 60 days from the time employee accepts promotion. In no case should this probation period total more than 180 calendar days. Laid off employees will be considered at Labor Grade 4 for purposes of administering this Agreement. Employees on voluntary layoff will not be consid
83
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 9
ered for upgrade. Upgrade requests, which may be filed either in writing on forms provided by the Company or electronically, will allow for the employee to document their previous job experience, education, training, and other qualifications. Requests shall be filed with the Company as provided herein prior to the date such promotion or upgrading is made. An employee background resume, shall be completed in conjunction with the employee’s request for upgrade. This resume and the job history sheet provided by the Company will be used in lieu of personnel records. After application, the candidate's resume will be evaluated against the established criteria for placement into the classification. The Union’s Senior Negotiating Committee and a committee of a like number of Company Representatives will meet as often as necessary to consider all employee requests for promotion. When new openings are identified a qualified list will be established not sooner than ten (10) calendar days after the job classification opening has been initially published. Once an initial qualified list has been established for a particular occupation, the parties will not be required to establish a new list until the list of available candidates has been exhausted or for a period of sixty (60) days if there are promotion requests for employees who are more senior than employees on the existing list. Employee applications will be reviewed in seniority order for placement on
84
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 9
the qualified list. The Committee, at each meeting, will review only the number of upgrade requests necessary to maintain a sufficient number of qualified employees to fill openings anticipated before its' next meeting. If, after review, the applicant is found to be qualified, they will be added to a list of other qualified employees for future placement and the initial upgrade request for that classification will be removed from the upgrade system. If the parties agree that the employee does not meet the established criteria for placement, the employee will be notified in writing and informed as to what part of the criteria they did not meet. If an employee is found not to meet the criteria for a classification, their upgrade request will be removed from the upgrade request system and they will not be eligible to exercise provisions established in Article III nor reapply for that classification for six months and then only if they have made a substantial change in their qualifications through additional documented education, training or job experience.
In cases where either party questions an employee’s qualifications to perform the requirements of the job, the parties may by mutual agreement establish a performance demonstration suitable to determine the employee’s capabilities in order to be determined qualified to perform the job.
85
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 9
(a)	If the parties cannot agree as to the employee’s qualifications for placement, the third party review process outlined in paragraph (c) of this section will be used.
(b)	Thereafter, when an opening occurs, employees from the qualified list will be offered the promotional opportunity in seniority order, with employees from the department where the opening occurs being given an additional twelve (12) months credit in calculation of their seniority. Employee failure to respond to upgrade requests within three (3) working days following offer extension is considered a refusal. Employees who refuse a promotion opportunity will not be eligible to re-apply for the refused classification for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of refusal.
In cases where it is determined that an employee was bypassed for promotion due to employee notification over site, the employee will be offered the promotion opportunity on a current basis provided the Company is made aware of the bypass within ten (10) working days from the date of bypass. In the event the bypassed employee accepts the promotion opportunity, he/she shall displace the wrongfully promoted employee who will return to their former classification and resume their placement on the respective qualified list. Where the Company is not notified within ten (10) days of the bypass,
86
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 9
the affected employee will be returned to the respective qualified list.
All employees who have applied and been deemed qualified will be candidates for placement. If there are no qualified applicants or if the Committee(s) have failed to review candidates for concurrence, the Company will utilize available resources to fill the vacancy. In cases where the Union has been given background information on an individual and a decision on the persons qualification has not been finalized in fifteen (15) working days, the Company will attempt to select internal candidates who, in the company’s opinion, meet the established criteria. The parties can agree to increase the days by mutual agreement. Thereafter, the Company will go to open hire. All remaining employees who have active upgrade requests for the occupation and who were not reviewed will be considered for future openings. New hires must meet the criteria established by the Company.
(c)	When the parties cannot agree that an employee is either qualified or not qualified, the dispute will be submitted to a permanent third party arbitrator for resolution. The arbitrator will be limited in authority to decide “qualified” or “not qualified”. If the arbitrator rules the employee is qualified, the arbitrator will be limited to placing the employee in the job on a current basis without back pay.
87
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 9
Each sixty (60) days, or more often if needed, the arbitrator will be scheduled to hear cases. Six (6) cases per day will be scheduled, with the oldest disputed upgrade request being heard first. Each party will be given one half hour to present such evidence, documents or testimony it sees fit. Only evidence which had previously been considered by the parties shall be considered by the arbitrator. The Company will not raise the fact in arbitration that the Union had reviewed and discussed the criteria with the Company and provided suggested input regarding its content. After consideration of the evidence, within seven (7) calendar days, the arbitrator will rule that the applicant is either "qualified" or "not qualified".
The arbitrator will be selected for a twelvemonth duration, subject to extension by agreement between the parties. The method of selection of the permanent arbitrator shall be the same as called out in Article III, Section 6 of this Agreement.
A set fee for hearing cases under these guidelines will be negotiated with the arbitrator and those fees will be equally split between the Company and the Union.
(d)	Within fifteen (15) working days from the date of submittal by the Company, the Union's Classification Grievance Committee and the
88
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 9
Company upon request by either party, will meet to review, discuss and provide input into criteria for placement into existing jobs that are currently in place.
When new jobs are placed in the bargaining unit, the Union's Classification Grievance Committee and the Company will discuss criteria for placement into the new job.
The Company will not increase or reduce the criteria for any job without discussion with the Union's Classification Grievance Committee and allowing appropriate time for their input regarding the proposed changes.
Any reasonable time spent by the Union members of the Classification Grievance Committee in performance of these functions will be paid for one half by the Union and one half by the Company to a maximum of four and one-half (4.5) straight time hours per day.
(e)	Criteria for each job and lists of qualified applicants will be made available electronically to the Union.
(f)	An employee who is placed on a qualified list shall remain on that qualified list, unless the requirements described in the job description change, until the employee is placed in the classification requested or in a lateral or higher
89
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 9
classification, or until the employee withdraws his request or refuses an offer of placement into the requested job classification. However, an employee shall not be permitted to again submit an upgrade request for placement into a classification from which his application was withdrawn after filing a grievance for placement on the qualified list, for a period of six (6) months. In the event the employee is deemed qualified and afterwards removed from the qualified list, the employee must resubmit an upgrade request for future consideration.
(g)	Decisions regarding employee promotion made as a result of this process, including decisions of the permanent arbitrator, shall not be subject to Article III.
(3)	In selecting an employee for such promotion or upgrading to an available opening the following standards shall apply:
(a)	Availability for Release. Operational requirements will be considered insofar as they pertain to the release of an employee from their present job. The Company will not unreasonably deny an employee a release for upgrading.
(b)	Where ability, skill and efficiency are substantially equal, preference shall be given to the most senior qualified employee within the applicable unit.
90
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 10
(4)	Preference shall be given to the promotion of qualified employees eligible under this section before open hire.
(5)	Employees participating in a Lockheed Training Program will not be placed in any other Lockheed Training Program until the employee has completed such program or the program has been discontinued.
(6)	Where practicable, the parties may mutually agree on classifications where automatic progression into higher classifications can be accomplished. Once identified, employee selection for placement into these occupations will be made by selecting the most senior employee(s).
Section 10 - Priority in Filling Available Openings
In filling available openings in a job classification, employees in the following groups shall be combined and preference shall be given to the most senior qualified employee where ability, skill and efficiency are substantially equal:
(1)	Employees who are surplus in a higher-rated or lateral classification and who are scheduled for placement in the job classification in which the opening exists.
(2)	Employees on the recall list of the occupation in which the opening exists as defined in Section 4 of this Article.
91
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 10
A transfer within a classification may be made without reference to the priority above stated. A full time work assignment in a lateral or lower classification without change in classification may be made for a period not to exceed thirty (30) working days. Such period may be extended an additional thirty (30) working days provided such employees being so reassigned possess greater seniority than any employee on the recall list for such lateral or lower classification to which assigned. The affected Steward shall be notified at the time of any lateral or lower work assignment made under this paragraph.
Downgrading into classifications which have a recall list may be made upon mutual agreement of the Company and the Union for the following groups of employees provided such employees have greater seniority than any employee on the recall list for such lower classification:
(a)	Physically limited employees who are unable to do the work of their current classification but are able to do the work in a lower-rated classification;
(b)	Employees who, after normal instruction are trying to perform their job assignments but are unable to do so, and whose work records indicate that they would be satisfactory employees in a lower-rated classification.
(c)	In the event no job opening exists, an employee included in one of the groups specified in
92
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 11
(a) or (b) above, may, upon mutual agreement of the Company and the Union, displace the least senior of any less-senior employees in a lower classification if he is qualified to perform the work in such lower classification.
(d)	An employee who has taken a downgrade due to medical conditions shall, upon request, and where an opening exists, be returned to the classification from which downgraded upon being deemed physically fit by their physician, seniority permitting, after examination by the Lockheed Martin Medical Department. Should a difference of opinion arise between their physician and the Medical Department, a third party physician in the field of said medical condition, who is independent of both parties shall by examination, paid for by the company, make the final determination of their medical condition as to placement into the higher rated classification.
Section 11	- Transfers
On transfers to openings, preference will be given within the applicable unit as stated below on the basis of seniority to employees who are competent to fill the openings. All transfers will be subject to and made on the basis of operational requirements of the Company. Consideration will be given first to such employees within the department; then within the division; then within the applicable major organiza
93
PART B - ARTICLE IV SECTION 12

Section 12	- Job Opportunities
Any bargaining unit employee on layoff with recall rights to any bargaining unit job, will be given preference for any pre-hire training that is offered before it is offered to non-employees provided the employee meets the respective selection criteria.

and
AERONAUTICAL MACHINIST LOCAL LODGE 709
JOINT STATEMENT OF POLICY FOR APPLICATION OF JOB DESCRIPTIONS
The following basic principles governed the preparation of these descriptions; these same principles are to govern their use:
1.	The title selected for an occupation and/or
162
SUPPLEMENT C
classification is that which most clearly indicates the general nature and character of the work performed, and yet serves to set the occupation and/ or classification apart from others described.
2.	The Occupational Summary developed for each occupation is a brief description of the occupation as a whole, the purpose of which is to set it forth in separation from other occupations.
3.	The job description describes typical and normal requirements. These requirements are characteristic of the job and illustrate a level of difficulty of work and are not intended to list or describe all work operations done within the classification. These requirements may not fit all specific individual work assignments, as the description when written was stated so as to be broad enough to include all variations of work in the occupation and/or classification as it existed throughout the Company.
4.	The work operations, duties and other distinguishing characteristics described in a job description are those which are performed under guidance or instruction which is considered usual and normal for the work described.
5.	The descriptions were prepared on the basis:
a.	That as a part of promotional procedure a worker may occasionally perform some of the work of higher-rated jobs under close guid-
163
SUPPLEMENT C
ance and instructions in order to qualify for advancement.
b.	That a worker performs the work of lowerrated jobs when required.
c.	That the normal duties of any worker may include assistance to other workers on work operations, and
d.	That normal job relationships between workers include giving guidance and instruction to each other, as long as such guidance and instruction is not extended to conflict with the duties of a Lead.
6.	The job description is written to define and illustrate the job standard to be established and as such shall be interpreted and applied in its entirety as a composite picture of the job requirements. This means that the Occupational Summary, Work Performed, (Typical Materials, Tools and Equipment Used, when applicable) and Knowledge and Ability Required, all must be considered in arriving at the proper classification.
In order to secure, or hold the classification, the employee must be assigned regularly and consistently to that work which distinguishes the occupation and classification from other occupations and classifications. An employee's classification shall be determined in the light of the overall requirements for knowledge, ability and skill necessary to perform his regularly as-164
SUPPLEMENT C
signed duties. In making this determination, duties that are performed infrequently or rarely shall not be considered or made the basis of granting the higher classification. This would not be appli-cable, however, to intermittent duties of a higher level to which the employee is specifically assigned in an area where the prevailing day to day routine may fall in lower level requirements. If the employee on such an assignment is expected to possess and apply the knowledge, skill and ability necessary for performance of the higher level work, he is entitled to the higher classification even though the majority of his work time may be spent on the lower level work. In such a case the employee is assigned to bring to the job the higher skills which he is expected to use as requirements demand.
To cite examples:
a.	An employee on a jig where Assembly Workers-Structures are working, is assigned the responsibility and is retained in the group for the specific purpose of working off difficult M.C.N.'s and difficult reworks. His other daily activities are no different from that of the remaining employees on the assembly. The employee has had only three difficult rework jobs in three weeks and four difficult M.C.N.'s in the last month. This employee is properly classified as an Assembly Worker-Structures Senior due to his assigned responsibility of performing, as 165
SUPPLEMENT C
requirements demanded, difficult structures work on the assembly.
b.	At a production rate of one ship every two weeks, assume that the ship's hydraulic system requires two days for check-out. Assignment to this work would require classification as a Hydraulic and Plumbing Controls Checkout Mechanic.
7.	The job descriptions herein referred to are of a composite nature and do thereby not require an individual employee to perform all of the work therein mentioned.
8.	The job descriptions are not intended for, and should not be confused with operation sheets, work instructions, or work assignment sheets, etc.
9.	The classifications assigned in the initial application of these descriptions shall be taken as generally indicative of the proper future application of such descriptions. This statement, however, is not intended to approve any misclassification, nor is it intended to bar correct classification of any work or any employee, subject to the limitation set forth below, or to bar grievances alleging improper classification, subject to the limitation set forth below. During the life of this Agreement the classification held by an employee as of the effective date of this Agreement shall be the classification which such employee
166
SUPPLEMENT D
shall continue to hold unless and until there is either a change in the duties such employee performs or such employee is assigned to a different job. This provision does not mean that other employees assigned the same duties after the effective date of this Agreement shall be entitled to be so classified. Nothing stated herein modifies in any way the provisions set forth in Article IV, Section 3, 9, 10, and 11, and nothing stated herein shall prevent assignment of such employee to a different job where different duties are performed.

A GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND PHRASES AS USED IN LOCKHEED MARTIN	AER-
ONAUTICAL SYSTEMS FACTORY
JOB DESCRIPTIONS
In preparation of the job descriptions the following terms and words are given definition and meaning to clearly indicate the common and consistent interpretation to be placed in them by all persons using the descriptions.
The meaning of words and phrases not included in this Glossary shall be as defined by Webster's Collegiate Dictionary.
Adapts:
167
SUPPLEMENT C
Means to utilize for other purposes than originally intended.
Angle, Compound:
Means the angle between the two non-coinciding sides of two oblique angles which are in different planes and have a vertex and one side in common. Making a compound angle usually presents a coordinating tolerance problem since it results from the holding within tolerances of two adjoining component angles.
As Required:
Means performance of work operations if and when such are necessary, as long as they are within the level of difficulty described.
Authorized Document:
Means any type of document which is used by the Company to transmit to the worker what is to be done, and how it is to be done, and/or what specifications or requirements are applicable to the work.
Blueprints, Assembly and Installation:
Are blueprints which provide information for the installation and/or assembly of fabricated and accessory parts into an assembly.
Blueprints, Detail:
168
SUPPLEMENT D
Are any class of blueprints which give necessary detailed information for fabricating one or more parts.
Blueprints, Detail Assembly:
Are blueprints which provide information for assembling parts together with the necessary information for making some or all of the individual parts.
Check, Functional:
Means to determine or ascertain whether a unit of or portion of a system performs the function for which it is intended and whether rework or alteration is required.
Check Out, Operational:
Means making a complete check of an entire completed independent system to determine if rework or alteration is necessary.
Contour:
Means a curved surface having radii of different lengths all of which lie in parallel planes or the same plane, such planes being perpendicular to the curved surface, or a curved line having radii of different lengths all of which are in the same plane. The surface of a cone or section thereon, a typical airfoil surface, the curved edge of a profiled plate and the curved layout line guiding the making of a router
169
SUPPLEMENT D
block are examples. Contour surfaces composed of sections of cylinders and edges whose profile is a section of a circle are excluded since the radii are the same length.
Contour Compound:
Means a curved surface having radii of different lengths which lie in non-parallel planes.
Contour, Reverse:
Means a contour that reverses its curvature so that it has both concave and convex portions.
Coordinated Tolerances, Coordinated Dimensions:
These expressions are used only when exacting tolerances are implied. It should be understood that the mere location of a point by two or more reference dimensions does not in itself mean that the dimensions themselves are coordinated. An example of truly coordinated dimensions is shown in the following: The precision dimensions between two holes must be held while at the same time the precision dimensions locating each of the holes must also be held with respect to another reference point or line.
Detail Bench Assembly:
Detail Bench Assembly is that type and size of assembly work where size of parts, jigs and fixtures allows their being worked on a bench. Floor type 170
SUPPLEMENT D
jigs of similar size are included.

Means to assist or aid an employee in the performance of the duties as set up in the particular job description where the phrase exists. The assisting worker is not expected to work wholly independently but rather cooperatively and, further, is entitled to, and should receive, the guidance and instructions considered usual and normal under these circumstances.
Improvises:
Means to contrive or make use of makeshift tooling and/or methods to meet immediate needs or requirements.
Improvise Shop Aids (etc.) to Facilitate Fabrication, Assembly, and/or Installation as Required:

May Suggest Changes in Installation to Engineers or Others and Assist Them in Interpreting
173
SUPPLEMENT D
and Applying Customer Specifications Relating to Armament:
"May Suggest", when used in a statement of this type, is not compulsory, but of an optional nature.
Points Out Need for Tooling, Part, or Installation Corrections:
a.	This phrase is intended to cover suggestions by the employee to the lead or supervisor as to how to do the job better, easier or quicker, and is optional and not compulsory; or
b.	This phrase is intended to cover the worker's responsibility to show or give information as to faulty parts, tools, or practices. The worker is expected to report these instances to supervision.
Processing:
(Airplane Components, or Assemblies.) An inclusive term covering various finishes, etc., such as: anodizing, cadmium plating, etching, painting, oiling, passivating, fabric doping, chromodizing, pickling, plating, degreasing, sandblasting and similar operations which do not change the basic structure of the materials processed.

Means that type and kind of work, including pickup, involving disassembly, modification, repair, and/or rebuilding of any part, assembly, or installation as set forth and described in the Work Performed section of the job description within the limits of the occupation or classification in which the rework is to be performed.
Set-Up, Sets Up:
Includes the various necessary physical work operations or steps, (other than layout) which must be accomplished before actual fabrication can proceed. Set-up of machines or equipment might include such operations as selecting and aligning proper tooling, positioning and securing material, and setting speeds, feeds, stroke, travel, pressure, flow, etc. In
175
SUPPLEMENT D
most assembly operations set-up (e.g., positioning parts, obtaining parts) is so closely inter-mingled with fitting and joining together that set-up is not customarily designated as such. This is generally true of operations where machine operation is not the primary job factor.
Shop Mathematics:
Is that form of mathematics normally used by shop workmen in the performance of the duties of the occupation in which he works.
Shop Mathematics, Including Trigonometry:
Means the use of trigonometry to solve any problem that may arise in the work to which assigned.
Shop Practice:
Means the generally accepted method of performing a basic, common, or usual operation under specified conditions. It covers the knowledge which is common to the occupation itself and to most manufacturing shops using the operation under consideration. Besides knowledge and ability to use required hand tools and equipment, it includes knowledge of general safety practices, conduct, rules of cleanliness, neatness, good housekeeping and care of equipment. When used in the phrase "shop practices and procedure", practice need not imply other than practice or methods learned or acquired at the Company.
Shop Theory:
176
SUPPLEMENT D
Implies a knowledge of "why" as well as "how" a given task should be done. It implies a real understanding of the diversity of work in an occupation, of the capacities and limitations of machines used, and of the skills involved. It is acquired by a combination of observation, experience and schooling.
Tolerances, Close:
Means those tolerances which are held by the machine, operator and/or fixture without great or special care, effort or skill on the part of the workman. This term expresses a level of difficulty rather than preciseness of linear, angular or other measurement.
Tolerances, Exacting:
Means those tolerances which require special care and attention on the part of a skilled workman to obtain or hold. These tolerances would be difficult, if not impossible, for a semi-skilled or unskilled workman to hold consistently at a good production rate. This term expresses a level of difficulty rather than a preciseness of linear, angular or other measurement.
When So Assigned:
Means that the work operation, function or job duty is usually and normally performed after or as a direct result of an order, work assignment or request from recognized supervisory personnel. Means an occasional or incidental job requirement.
177
SUPPLEMENT D
Where Complete Information Is Not Readily Available:
a.	This phrase is not to be interpreted as requiring the worker to develop his own information, except for such information which falls into the category of acceptable shop practice.
b.	Where this phrase is used in a job description it is understood that all workers in the classification will work under these conditions as required.
With or Without the Aid of Tooling:
This phrase means that in some cases where tooling does not exist or is faulty, the worker may be required to work around such a condition. At times when this condition does not exist the worker may still hold the classification, provided other qualifying factors of the classification are present in the job.
Work from Production, Pre-Release, Check, Detail, Assembly and Installation Blueprints, D.A.T.'s, Sketches, or Other Authorized Documents:
This statement when used in a job description does not mean that a worker must have a complete knowledge of all the above-mentioned documents, but only to the extent of the difficulty described in the description where used.
178
SUPPLEMENT E
Works with Authorized Liaison Personnel as Necessary (or When Required):
a.	This phrase is intended to cover situations such as when trouble develops on a job the worker goes to their lead or supervisor who in turn may call in a liaison personnel, and then the worker, being more familiar with the job, will cooperate with the liaison personnel to straighten out the trouble.
b.	Under this phrase it is not intended that workers are to contact or to be contacted by liaison personnel, except through their supervisor.
It is understood that all statements used in specific job descriptions are to be interpreted on the basis of the level of difficulty contained in the respective descriptions.

Marietta, Georgia 30060
Dear Mr. Bowen:
The original letter of understanding dated June 11, 1958, from Jack W. Farnell, Labor Relations Manager, to Mr. E. A. Demcheck, President, Aeronautical Industrial District Lodge 33, and included in the 1968 Agreement as Code 1, Supplement "F", Letters of Procedure and Understanding, is continued as follows with the underlined addition under paragraph "b" included to reflect the actual practice as agreed upon.
"This letter agreement is written to confirm the understanding reached following the 1958 negotiations regarding the payment of the difference between the amount of weekly disability benefit paid under Georgia Workmen's Compensation laws and the amount of weekly disability benefit payable for non-occupational illness or injury under the Lockheed Employees' Group Insurance Plan.
"This provision, which is a part of the Memorandum of Understanding in the 1957 CompanyUnion Agreement was inadvertently omitted from
188
SUPPLEMENT F
the Memorandum of Understanding in the 1958 Company-Union Agreement and reads as follows:
a.	Change the definition of "Dependents" in the Group Insurance Plan for Dependents to refer to "spouse" rather than "wife."
b.	Provide for payment of the difference between the amount of weekly disability benefit paid under Georgia Workmen's Compensation laws and the amount of weekly disability benefit payable for non-occupational illness or injury under the Lockheed Employees' Group Insurance Plan. Such payment will be made for not to exceed twenty-six (26) weeks and only for weeks the employee is absent from work due to such occupational illness or injury and in which he draws weekly disability benefits under Georgia Workmen's Compensation laws, except that any amount up to the full amount payable for weekly disability benefits will be made for the first week of disability if it is not payable under Workmen's Compensation.

Dear Mr. Williams:
This supersedes and cancels the letter of January 10, 1963, which deals with the manner in which vacancies are to be filled by Firemen in the Fire and Safety Department, 90-52, and will confirm the understanding reached by the Company and the Union on the filling of vacancies.
Written requests for shift assignment will be accepted by the Fire Chief each month for the duration of this contract. Preference cards will allow
194
SUPPLEMENT F
employees one specific shift preference. Shift assignments will be made by the Fire Chief in accordance with shift preference cards on file at the time of any shift reassignment.
(A)	In filling an opening on any shift, preference shall be given to the most senior qualified employee who has a written request card on file requesting the shift on which the vacancy occurs, subject to the limitations set forth in (H) below.
(B)	In filling a work week vacancy occurring on any shift which does not involve a change in manpower on the shift, preference shall be given on the basis of seniority to the most senior qualified employee on the shift. The surplus employee on the work week where the excess exists may displace the least senior of any less senior employee on any other work week on the shift. Additional vacancies or displacements thus created shall be filled in a like manner.
(C)	(1) If there exists a surplus on a shift which involves the movement of personnel to another specified shift, employees on the surplus shift who have requests on file for the shift to which employees are to be moved will be allowed to move instead of the least senior employee on the shift where the surplus exists. If no requests as outlined above exist, the least senior employee will be moved.
(2)	In the application of (C) (1) above, if the employee moving from the surplus shift has 195
SUPPLEMENT F
greater seniority than an employee on any work week on the shift to which he is moved, he may displace said employee on that work week.
(3)	If an employee is displaced as in (C) (2) above from his work week, he will remain on his shift and may be placed on a work week in accordance with his seniority. If the employee has less seniority than any employee, he shall be placed on a work week in accordance with the Company's need.
(4)	In effecting the above moves, the employees on the shift where the surplus exists and the shift to which employees are to be moved are the only affected employees.
(5)	In effecting these shift moves, the limitations of (H) below apply. On filling of work week vacancies only, the limitations in item (H) do not apply.
(D)	In filling any vacancies as a result of the employee's request, the employee will take any necessary days off to effect the reassignment; however, in the event that requirements are such that some other employee must be brought in on his sixth or seventh day for coverage occasioned by the above, the employee scheduled to take the time off to accomplish the move will be allowed to work instead of the sixth or seventh day man. This will apply to the sixth and/or seventh day of the employee's old work week. Such time, if premium time for the 196
SUPPLEMENT F
employee making the move, will not be included for purposes of the normal overtime rotation roster.
If an employee is moved for the convenience of the Company, sixth or seventh day overtime will be paid if such move necessitates work on the sixth or seventh day for the employee being moved.
(E)	The Company shall have the right to place a probationary employee on any shift and work week for orientation and training until completion of his probationary period at which time a shift and work week vacancy will be considered to exist and will be filled in the manner prescribed herein. The Company shall have the right at any time, during the employee's 90-day probationary period, to declare the existence of a shift and work week vacancy to be filled in the manner prescribed above; in this event the probationary employee will not be moved again at the expiration of his 90-day probationary period.
The Company will make every reasonable effort to place probationary employees on other than Work Week 1, Day Shift, at the earliest possible date following hire consistent with the practical requirements of the Department to provide adequate training during the probationary period. The Company will not normally place more than two (2) probationary employees on swing shift for training purposes at any one time.
197
SUPPLEMENT F
(F)	In
effecting the reassignments, employees classified as Fire Inspector will be considered as a separate group on the basis of special qualifications.
(G)	In the event that an employee changes shifts, he may elect to file a new preference card.
(H)	In the filling of shift vacancies as established by the Fire Chief, no more than four shift moves shall be made under (A) above (the initial move and three resultant moves).
(I)	An employee filing a written request for shift assignment preference shall be given a written receipt setting forth the date the request was received by the Fire Chief and showing the shift requested.
(J)	For purposes of application of the above, an employee request move shall be any move resulting from a request from an employee where such moving employee obtains a choice of work week or shift by virtue of exercising his seniority to obtain such work week or shift. A Company request move shall be defined as a move resulting in the placement of an employee in a work week or shift vacancy where the employee did not exercise his seniority to obtain such vacant shift or work week opening.
It is agreed that the interpretation and application of the provisions of Article IV, Section 10 - Filling of Shift and Work Week Vacancies - in the Agreement between the Company and the Plant Protec
198
SUPPLEMENT F
tion Lodge 615 dated December 21, 1971, will be binding and controlling for Firemen in exactly the same manner as such practice is applied for Guards should any question arise regarding filling of shift or work week vacancies for Firemen under the above-stated provisions.

Dear Mr. Stevens:
This will confirm the agreement reached during the 2005 Negotiations clarifying the intent of Part B, Article IV, Section 10 (transferring within a classification). The intent of the language is for the company to have the ability to temporarily transfer an employee to a full-time lateral or lower classification as a short-term work assignment or to perform work while the company is in the process of filling a requisition for such work assignment. The company will not use such transfers to circumvent sur-plusing by seniority or as a disciplinary assignment.

Dear Mr. Williams:
This is to confirm the discussion in my office between you, Mr. Key, Mr. Wilson and myself concerning overtime for employees on Saturday or Sunday.
You will recall that I explained that under the agreement to pay employees on Thursday that all changes of status in the future, commencing about the middle of November, would be effective each Saturday. During the recent negotiations, we agreed that overtime work on Saturday and Sunday would be paid a week later than at present. Our understanding was that the payroll would be closed at the end of swing shift on Friday. This, of course, envisioned making changes of status effective Saturday morning. By doing so, it is conceivable that some employee might allege that another employee who is transferred with a change of status effective Saturday was no longer in the affected group (releasing department) for overtime purposes. As we both agreed, it was the understanding in negotiations that such employee would be considered in the releasing department for purposes of any overtime for which he might be eligible. In 201
SUPPLEMENT F
the event such an employee is eligible and works on either Saturday or Sunday he will be paid the new rate of pay if higher or the rate he was receiving in his old department in the event that he has been downgraded.
This letter is being sent to you to assist both your staff and my staff in the future application of the overtime provisions of the Agreement.

Dear Mr. Bowen:
A.	The policy of the Company relative to establishment of rates of pay for employees promoted to a job previously held will be to have their rates of pay established on the following basis:
Upon promotion to a classification previously held wherein the employee has either continuous seniority or recall rights since previously holding the higher classification, such employee will receive his current rate, or an ingrade rate consistent with the rate such employee held at the time he previously held such classification, whichever is greater.
B.	The policy of the Company relative to establishment of rate of pay for employees promoted to a classification not previously held is to establish the rate at his then current rate at the time of promotion, or the minimum of the higher classification, whichever is greater.
204
SUPPLEMENT F
C.	The rate of pay of an employee recalled under the provisions of Article IV, Section 4, Recall, to a previously-held classification will be established at an ingrade rate in line with such employee's position in the rate range at the time that such employee was downgraded. However, in the event such employee is recalled to the classification after holding a lateral or higher classification and subsequently surplused and not placed in the classification due to insufficient seniority, such employee shall have his ingrade rate established at the same ingrade position to which he would have been entitled had he been placed in the classification at the time of the above-named surplus.
D.	Any former employee who at any time since 1950 accumulated two years' seniority and left employment with any plant of the Corporation since that date, whether through layoff or quitting, shall upon rehire without seniority:
1.	Serve no waiting period for group insurance coverage.
2.	Be eligible for savings plan participation immediately upon rehire.
3.	If rehired in a comparable classification held in their previous tenure with the LM Aeronautics Companies (Clarksburg, Fort Worth, Johnstown, Meridian, Palmdale, Helendale and Rye Canyon) with a collective bargaining agreement in effect, have their rehire rate established at an ingrade rate at least as high as 205

It is agreed that from this date forward employees hereafter downgraded from an occupation in lieu of layoff during their probationary period, and who subsequently acquire seniority while holding the lower classification, will be placed on the recall list to the classification from which they were downgraded during their probationary period. It is also understood that this agreement regarding recall rights does not include employees heretofore downgraded in lieu of layoff during their probationary period, and who thereafter never held the classification from which they were downgraded during their probationary period.
This agreement does not include employees laid off during their probationary period.

Employees will retain their existing number of attend

ance irregularities up to four (4) irregularities. If an employee has received five (5) or more attendance irregularities since the last attendance discipline, the attendance irregularities will be reduced to the most recent four (4) irregularities. For example, an employee with an EPN and five (5) attendance irregularities will be converted to a Verbal Warning and four (4) attendance irregularities. Employees that do not have any active attendance discipline on their record will have attendance irregularities reduced to zero (0).
This is only effective for the beginning of the 2005 Company/Union Agreement. Once the initial application has occurred, Supplement H will be administered as written. No other deviations will be made. Any questions regarding the application of the new 2005 Attendance Standards will be addressed by the Company/Union Negotiating Committee.

SUBJECT: Shift Transfers
This letter confirms the understanding reached by the Company and the Union during the current contract negotiations regarding shift transfers.
A.	All transfers are subject to and made on the basis of operational requirements of the Company.
B.	In the event it becomes necessary to transfer an employee from one shift to another to fill a vacancy, the following conditions and method of selection will apply.
1.	Each department will post a shift preference list for day, swing and graveyard shifts. When openings become available, employees will be offered in seniority order. If an employee refuses, the next senior employee on the list will be offered the open shift. Employee’s names that are not on the list at the time of offering will not be considered for the open shift.
2.	If an insufficient number of employees accept the transfer as provided in paragraph 1 above, the Company may then transfer the required number of qualified employees in inverse order of seniority from the classification and from within the department where the vacancy exists and such employees shall be required to accept such a transfer.
212
SUPPLEMENT F
C.	It is recognized that exceptions to the basic rule set forth in B above may occur where specific skills are needed on a particular shift. This requirement may result in an employee being retained or transferred out of sequence to the degree necessary to obtain or retain persons of specialized skills not possessed by the affected employees.
D.	1. Employees transferred to another shift for a temporary period shall be returned to their former shift upon completion of their assignment. The Company will discuss with the employees involved and the appropriate shop steward the reasons for such temporary assignment.
2. To the maximum extent consistent with operating requirements, requested transfers will be made and at the earliest practicable date.

This is to set forth certain understandings reached regarding the authorization of time off the job for the Steward for the handling of emergency situations under certain conditions.
It is expected that employee complaints or grievances shall be handled by the Steward during the periods regularly allotted by the Agreement for such matters.
It is recognized, however, that situations sometimes occur which could create hardship, hazardous working conditions, or deny the employee beyond recovery his contractual rights if not handled promptly. Such situations do not occur very often which cannot be properly and adequately handled during regularly allotted periods.
In those instances where it is established that a bona fide emergency does, in fact, exist which requires the Steward's attention at that particular time, he will be authorized the extra time off upon request to his Department Manager. Requests for this extra time off shall not unreasonably be de-214

tion to be afforded employees represented by Aeronautical Machinists Local Lodge 709 in the event they are being given a disciplinary suspension. Such an employee, under the conditions enumerated herein, will be permitted to see his Steward, if the employee so requests, for a period of up to ten (10) minutes prior to his exit from the plant due to such disciplinary suspension. Supervision may elect to be present at such time to clarify to the Steward the reason for the employee's suspension.
The criteria for determining employee entitlement to such special Union representation and the procedural rules to apply are as follows:
(1)	The employee is being suspended and escorted from the plant prior to the end of the shift, and hence will not be in a position to see his Steward during the period contractually allotted for the Steward to conduct CompanyUnion business under Article II, Section 1 (2) (a) of the Agreement.
(2)	The employee's suspension has not created an inflammatory situation, such as fighting or insubordination, where his continued presence in the plant cannot be tolerated.

(4)	The time set forth in the first paragraph of 221

Dear Mr. Williams:
This is to confirm certain understandings reached with reference to the usage of the Welder □ Maintenance classification insofar as performance of certain Maintenance Mechanic's work is concerned.
These understandings were reached following discussion of this matter in a meeting between Messrs. George Alexander, H. K. Gammon, Carson Green, Clyde Williams and W. P. Key.
It is understood that (1) Welder-Maintenance employees may per-form cer-tain Maintenance Mechanic work which is directly related but incidental to their primary function of performing work in their own classification; (2) Welder Maintenance employees who perform their function in the shop will not be assigned to installation of the equipment in some other area of the Plant unless (a) it is required for job continuity, (b) such installations require performance of welding work; and (3) it is not the intention of the Company to assign Welder Maintenance employees to the performance of Maintenance Mechanic work assignments if no welding functions are involved.
225
SUPPLEMENT F
It is the intent of the Company to make every reasonable attempt to assign the work to the classification which appears at the time to be the most affected of the two classifications.

Dear Mr. Bowen:
SUBJECT: Retirement Agreement
This letter summarizes certain provisions of the agreement reached during the current contract negotiations regarding the Hourly Retirement Plan.
The Company and the Union entered into an Agreement for a Retirement Plan as of December 16, 1961, which superseded the retirement plan agreement of March 27, 1957. Since 1961 the parties, including during the 1980 negotiations, have entered into amendments to the 1961 Agreement which have added additional benefits and provided for certain understandings concerning the Plan.
During the 1980 negotiations the Retirement Plan Amendment Agreement provided specifically for certain protections in the application and administration of the Plan to assure that changes to the Plan resulting from the restatement of the Plan during the period of 1977-1980 would not reduce or eliminate the rights or benefits of Plan Members which existed prior to the restatement. Specifically, the Retirement Plan Amendment Agreement provided as follows:
The Plan having been amended and restated as of December 25, 1976, for the sole purpose of
244
SUPPLEMENT F
compliance with ERISA, while incorporating the provisions of the Plan as in effect December 25, 1971, as specifically amended by the parties through negotiations in 1974 and 1977, there was and is no intent of the parties, by virtue of said amended and restated Plan, to reduce, limit, or eliminate any pre-existing rights and benefits of the Members of the Plan, including those represented by the Union.
Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any previous agreement pertaining to the Plan and notwithstanding any policy, practice, or interpretation of the Company in the administration and application of the Plan, if the application of any term or condition of the Plan as in effect prior to the Plan amendment and restatement of December 25, 1976, would be more favorable to a Member or retiree than would result from the application of any term or condition of the Plan as amended and restated effective December 25, 1976, the term and condition of the former shall apply.
The purpose of this letter is to effect broader dissemination of the specific agreement set forth above. It is not intended to change or replace the formal agreements of the parties concerning the retirement plan which, among other things, provide that no matter respecting the Plan is subject to the grievance procedure of the collective bargaining agreement. In that regard, the 1961 Retire-
245
SUPPLEMENT F

Subject: Processing of Substantial Change Grievances
Dear Mr. Goen:
Set forth below is the new procedure for processing substantial change grievances.
When a substantial change grievance is filed, without negotiations or any attempt to settle, the Department Head shall promptly sign and date the grievance. Within five (5) working days after receipt of the grievance by the Department Manager, the Department Manager shall convene a meeting attended by the Department Manager, the Steward, the appropriate Human Resources Representative and one member of the Union’s Classification Grievance Committee in order to develop an appropriate job duty resume which shall set forth those duties which have changed since the ratification date of the current contract. If after such a review the parties cannot agree, the parties shall develop separate job duty resumes.
After the appropriate job duty resume(s) has been developed, the grievance shall be submitted by the Union directly from Step 1 to Step 3. If between the time the joint job duty resume (or job duty resumes) is submitted to Step 3 and the time the
262
SUPPLEMENT F
grievance is heard by the Substantial Change Review Committee the Union is of the opinion that an additional change has occurred since the initial meeting to develop the joint job duty resume, the appropriate Department Manager, Steward, Human Resources Representative and Classification Grievance Committee member shall reconvene in order to develop an addendum to the initial joint job duty resume (or job duty resumes). If after such a review the parties cannot agree, the parties shall develop separate job duty resume addendums.
A Substantial Change Grievance Review Committee shall be established in order to review all substantial change grievances. The representatives of the Union shall be the Union’s Classification Grievance Committee. The representatives of the Company shall consist of a like number, all such representatives being members of the Company’s Negotiating Committee. The Company’s committee shall be chaired by the Senior Manager of Labor Relations or designee. The Substantial Change Grievance Review Committee shall convene quarterly or as otherwise mutually agreed to between the parties, to review all substantial change grievances at Step III.
The Company will pay for one-half of the time of Union members of the Union Classification Grievance Committee up to a maximum of four and one-half (4.5) hours on days during the regular work
263
SUPPLEMENT F
week when they meet with the Company on Company-Union business for the purpose of hearing substantial change grievances.
The decisions of the Substantial Change Grievance Committee shall be considered as final if the majority of the Union representatives and a majority of the Company representatives concur.
If the Substantial Change Grievance Committee decides to grant the substantial change grievance, the Company shall provide to the Union’s Classification Grievance Committee a draft of the new job description for discussion between the Committees; thereafter, the Company shall furnish the Union with the new job description and shall submit for its approval the functional line placement and the rate established for such job in accordance with Article VIII, Section 1.
If the Company and the Union Committees do not agree, then the party seeking arbitration must deliver to the other party written notice of such intent to proceed to arbitration within five (5) working days after the Substantial Change Grievance Committee has rendered its decision.
Within one month after ratification of the contract, the parties shall request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to submit a list of fifteen (15) persons, unless otherwise mutually agreed, from which the arbitrator shall be chosen. The Union
264
SUPPLEMENT F
and the Company shall alternatively strike one (1) name from such panel (the right to strike the first name having been determined by lot) until only one (1) name remains and that person shall be the arbitrator.
Such arbitrator shall be assigned to all substantial change grievances to be arbitrated. However, either party may request during the month of February each year that a new arbitrator be selected in accordance with the above provision. Within one month of notification of the death/incapacity of an arbitrator, a new arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the above procedure.
In the event an arbitrator rules that a substantial change has occurred and a new job is written whose rate is challenged by the Union and referred to arbitration, the parties shall use the same arbitrator who heard the initial substantial change case for purposes of determining the rate.
With the exception of the selection of the arbitrator, all other provisions of Article III, Section 5 shall be applicable.

Dear Mr. Carroll:
This will confirm the agreement reached during the 1996 Negotiations concerning union security and rights of employees.
In the event a declaratory judgment is awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction declaring that Air Force Plant No. 6 is a federal enclave with exclusive jurisdiction such that the Georgia right-to-work statute regarding agency shops is without effect, the following language will be immediately incorporated:
(1)	Membership in the Union is not compulsory. Employees have the right to join, not join, maintain, or drop their membership in the Union as they see fit. Neither party shall exert any pressure on or discriminate against an employee as regards such matters.
(2)	Each employee in the bargaining unit shall, beginning on the 91st day following his/her employment, rehire, reinstatement, reemployment, recall, transfer or regression into the bargaining unit, as a
266
SUPPLEMENT F
condition of continued employment in the bargaining unit, execute and deliver to the Company a union payroll deduction authorization card.
(3)	Any employee within the bargaining unit who is required to contribute to the Union as provided for in the above paragraph of this Section and who is subsequently transferred or promoted out of the bargaining unit or laid off shall not be subject to any of the provisions of this Article during the period of time such employee remains outside the bargaining unit or is laid off.
(4)	No employee within the bargaining unit shall be required to pay fees or dues covering any period during which the employee was not in the bargaining unit or was not on the Company’s active payroll including layoff.
(5)	An employee within the bargaining unit shall be considered in good standing for the purposes of this Article when such employee tenders the amount of money equal to the Union’s regular and usual initiation fee (due and payable only once per employee without regard to any interruption in service) and its regular, uniform and usual weekly dues through payroll initiation fees/dues deduction. Upon written demand from the Union, the Company shall terminate any employee within the bargaining unit who fails to tender the sum due the Union under Section (2) of this Article within thirty (30) days from the date such sum is due provided the Union informs the Company and the employee in writing and allows
267
SUPPLEMENT F
him/her an additional fifteen (15) days after notification by the Union, the Company will terminate the employee effective the end of that pay period.
(6)	Any dispute arising out of the interpretation or application of this Article, when reduced to writing as a grievance, shall be subject to the grievance procedure by initially referring the grievance to Step Three (3).
(7)	Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, an employee shall not be required to become a member of or continue membership in or pay a sum equal to Union weekly dues or continue to pay any sums equal to the weekly Union dues, as a condition of employment, if it is determined that such is unlawful by the NLRB or by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction. It is understood and agreed that the Union will defend, save, hold harmless and indemnify the Company from any and all claims, demands, suits or any other forms of liability that shall arise out of the execution, placing in effect or carrying out of the terms of this Article by the Company.

Dear Mr. Myrick:
The safety and health of our employees is vital to our success and is of utmost importance to the parties. Environmental, Safety and Health (ESH) integration into business operations is essential if we are to meet our objectives. Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems (LM AERO - MARIETTA) has had a safety committee structure in place for a number of years. The purpose of these committees is to deal with ESH issues at the lowest level in the organization, thereby fostering ESH consciousness and integration into the business function.
The Company and Union have agreed to five GSC members whose responsibility is divided among the north industrial area, the flight line and swing shift. The purpose of the committee is to ensure employee participation in, and awareness of, ESH issues.
269
SUPPLEMENT F
Each employee must accept the responsibility for integrating ESH issues into our operations and make ESH awareness and compliance an ingrained part of everyone’s job. If safety issues are raised, immediate action must be taken to fix the issue or the ESH department shall be called immediately. ESH will notify the appropriate General Safety Committee member on the issue and will apprise the GSC member of the action being taken.
ESH departments investigate complaints received from the GSC members and respond back to them. If a GSC member is needed to investigate a serious issue or participate in a company wide safety issue, the ESH representative will contact the employee’s supervisor to obtain release for the time necessary, without a loss of pay, with a commitment from the GSC member to return to their work station as soon as possible.
The General Safety Committee meets twice monthly. There is a one hour pre-GSC meeting, which serves to alert management to potential issues to be discussed at the regular monthly meeting. The monthly meeting convenes three days after the pre-GSC meeting and the committee members discuss open old business and present any new items for discussion and resolution. The union GSC members raise safety issues which their constituents have not resolved at the local level. On an as-needed basis, committee members also participate
270
SUPPLEMENT F
in regulatory inspections to include entrance and exit briefings. Committee members may request meetings on other issues of mutual concern.

Mr. Cornell Stevens, President Aeronautical Machinists Local Lodge 709 International Association of Machinists and Aerospace workers 1032 S. Marietta Parkway
Marietta, Georgia 30060-2899
Dear Mr. Stevens:
271
SUPPLEMENT F
As part of the 2005 contract bargaining, the parties have agreed to continue the understandings previously reached on the use of testing and proficiency demonstration in the selection and development of employees. The principles of those understandings are restated here in significant part:
Tests and Proficiency Demonstrations have been used in the selection of new hires and as a part of the criteria for Promotion of existing employees to certain classifications. While they will continue to be used for these purposes, the parties have agreed to shift the priority of their use toward that of employee development. To facilitate this, certain changes in procedure will be adopted.
Written tests and Proficiency Demonstrations will only be used as one of the factors of job eligibility for existing employees where specific manual clerical skills are required or where the parties have agreed the complexity of the work warrants skills testing. The parties have agreed to a list of the occupations that currently meet those criteria.
Tests developed for career advancement will be made available to employees for developmental purposes and will be administered voluntarily on an after-hours basis. Employees taking tests either for promotion or for developmental
272
SUPPLEMENT F
purposes, will be given the results by the Training Department with an explanation of their strengths/weaknesses and referral to academic, vocational, or other types of training that will help them develop their skills. Failure of the employee to report at a time scheduled for testing will be considered failure and the employee will not be allowed to retest for six (6) months.
In order to ensure that tests are predictive of success on the job and helpful to employees in developing their ability to perform, Union officials may gain input from employees experienced in the job and may work with supervision and the Training Department to incorporate that input into Tests and Proficiency Demonstrations. Appropriate Union officials will have complete access to all test materials and test results to ensure the Union's ability to properly represent its Membership. Confidentiality will be maintained by all to avoid embarrassment to anyone regarding test results and to ensure the validity of the testing on an ongoing basis.
It is recognized that, despite our efforts, a small number of people may be placed on jobs they cannot perform. In these cases, where an employee has the background, the recommended training, with proper job instructions, have re
273
SUPPLEMENT F
ceived an opportunity to do the work, and still cannot perform, the employee will be returned to the last classification held, or to the highest classification that the employee would have been recalled to had he/she not been promoted, seniority permitting.
The parties are making these changes based on their shared commitments both to the development of people and to the performance of the organization. The parties agree that placement on a job is less dependent on the ability to test well and more dependent on the ability to perform well.

Dear Mr. Goen:
This will confirm the agreement reached in the 2008 Negotiations regarding the process for review of Medical Limitations placed by the Company’s Medical Department when the employee’s personal physician is not in agreement with the Medical Department’s determination.
Where the Medical Department’s decision is not in agreement with the Employee’s Personal Physician recommendation, an independent third party review will be established. For non-occupational illness or injury, the parties will come together to mutually agree to an independent Physician or Medical Group who will then be contacted to perform the review. Occupational illness and injury will be conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the State Board of Workers Compensation.
The employee must agree to provide the necessary release for Medical Documentation. The necessary medical information will then be provided to the

Dear. Mr. Goen:
During the course of the negotiations you expressed a strong desire and interest to maintain the Maintenance personnel levels at the September 2003 level, as agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding regarding Maintenance Subcontracting.
We discussed the uncertainty of our major programs as they are currently going through the government budget process. You understand that a reduction in our current population because of lesser needs and program requirements would cause that agreed upon number to reduce in a near proportionate manner.
It is our intention to maintain a minimum level of eighty-five (85) employees within those critical

classifications (Carpenter/Painter, Mason and Plas-terer/Concrete Finisher, Plumber Maintenance, Sheet Metal Worker-Maintenance, Maintenance Pipe Welder, Automated Machines Maintenance Mechanic, Welder-Maintenance, Industrial Elec-tronics/Electrical Technician, Air Conditioning Mechanic and Lineman) to ensure adequate Program and Facility Support through the life of this collective bargaining agreement. In the event it becomes necessary to alter the minimum level of personnel assigned to critical classifications within the facilities organization due to Program closure and/ or site footprint reduction, the parties will meet for the purpose of reaching mutual agreement relative to the appropriate level of staffing.

of the Company Union Agreement provides that the employee transferred from an occupation by this Agreement to a salaried occupation within the company on or after January 1, 2006, shall not continue to accumulate seniority, but will retain the seniority previously accumulated while holding an occupation covered by this agreement.
The purpose of this memorandum is not to change those provisions of the Agreement which were negotiated in reaching agreement on the 2005 Collective Bargaining Agreement, however in response to questions raised about the seniority status of employees who are transferred to a salaried position, the following clarification and agreement was reached by the parties.
An employee transferred from an occupation covered by this Agreement to a salaried occupation within the Company for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months shall not lose seniority for the period of time in that salaried position. Those employees who are transferred to a salaried occupation as a result of an assignment outside of the United States can be considered under this provision for a longer period of time if justified. Upon completion of the salaried assignment, the employee (s) will return to the classification held immediately prior to assignment to the salaried position, seniority permitting. If the employee has insufficient seniority to be returned to the classification held immediately prior to the salaried assignment,

a.	One year - Commendation, form 5910, signed and issued by 1st level manager.
b.	Two years - Commendation signed and issued by 2nd level manager.
c.	Three or more years - Commendation signed and issued by 3rd level manager.
2.	In evaluating attendance records to determine if an employee should receive a commendation for attendance, the following criteria should be used:
a.	Perfect Attendance: No full or partial-day absence in any 12 consecutive - month period while on the active payroll. Do not count absences where the employee utilizes accrued vacation or sick leave, approved Family Medical Leave, Military Duty, Union Business, or Jury Duty.
b.	Outstanding Attendance: No chargeable attendance irregularity in any 12 consecutive - month period while on the active payroll. However, for purposes of issuing a commendation for outstanding attendance, a department leave will be considered a chargeable attendance irregularity and will disqualify the employee.
294
SUPPLEMENT H
3.	In the absence of a department manager, division manager, or branch head, the designated delegate should issue the commendation at the appropriate staff meeting.
B.	Attendance
1.	Definitions:
a.	Absence - A full day’s absence (excluding vacation and holiday - when not scheduled to work).
b.	Tardy - A part-day absence at the start of the shift.
c.	Short-time - A part-day absence after reporting for work.
2.	An employee's attendance will be considered unacceptable if the employee has five (5) or more chargeable attendance irregularities in any continuous six (6) month period of active work.
3.	Paid sick and injury leave time shall not be counted as an attendance irregularity. Employees’ who have unsatisfactory attendance (Verbal Warning or greater) are required to use any accrued sick leave prior to any unpaid absences if they have unused balances in those accounts.
295
SUPPLEMENT H
4.	Any absence from work caused by a reason deemed excusable under the terms of the Family Medical Leave Act shall not be considered an attendance irregularity. In the event the Family and Medical Leave Act is modified, the terms that are in effect on the date of ratification of this agreement will be continued for the remainder of the term of this contract.
5.	For so long as an employee does not currently have a disciplinary action on their record for unsatisfactory attendance, consecutive days of absence caused by the same illness within the same pay period will be considered as a single occurrence. Grouping of consecutive days of absence will not be allowed for employees who have current disciplinary action on their record for unsatisfactory attendance.
6.	For so long as an employee does not currently have a disciplinary action on their record for unsatisfactory attendance, the employee will be allowed one (1) tardy per month which must be one hour or less in duration. This tardy will not be counted as a chargeable attendance irregularity for the purpose of disciplinary action. Additional tardies will be considered an attendance irregularity.
7.	All absences must be reported, preferably in advance, but in any event within two hours
296
SUPPLEMENT H
of the start of the first shift of absence, to the designated absence report number, unless extenuating circumstances prevent such notice. When reporting absence, if an employee anticipates that the absence will be for three days or less, the day of contemplated return should be specified. Thereafter, it will not be necessary to report the absence unless the employee cannot return to work on the day specified. If the expected absence is for more than three (3) days, the employee must call to report the continuing absence each three (3) days. Any unreported absence without a reasonable explanation for failure to notify the Company will be an infraction of this Attendance policy and treated as a failure to follow instructions.
C.	Attendance Related Discipline
1.	It is the intent of this policy to encourage regular attendance and to be corrective rather than punitive. It is recognized however, that if employees do not comply with this agreement, successively severe disciplinary penalties leading to termination are the appropriate course.
2.	Progressive disciplinary action for unsatisfactory attendance will be imposed in the following sequence.
a.	Verbal Warning - An employee whose attendance is unacceptable will be issued a
297
SUPPLEMENT H
Verbal Warning. At this step, and at each subsequent step of the process, the employee’s Shop Steward will be notified in advance that this is occurring and will be encouraged to attend the meeting and counsel the employee on the importance of good attendance.
b.	Employee Performance Notice - An Employee Performance Notice will be issued to an employee who has been verbally warned about his/her attendance and who has had a subsequent period of unacceptable attendance. At each step of the process, only those infractions since the last step of formal discipline will be considered.
c.	Employee Performance Notice Plus Suspension. An employee who has a third period of unacceptable attendance will be assessed an Employee Performance Notice and suspension without pay for the remainder of the current day and the following day.
d.	Termination - An employee who is not responsive to the above outlined disciplinary sequence, and who has another period of unacceptable attendance, will be discharged. Before the final decision is made regarding termination, the employee's Busi
298
SUPPLEMENT H
ness Representative or the Local Union President, Division Manager, a Division Manager or higher level Manager from another area, and the Company's Director of Labor Relations or his/her designee will convene to consider any mitigating circumstances which would weigh in the favor of the employee. After that consideration, a final decision will be made.
3.	Disciplinary action for unsatisfactory attendance should be taken on a progression basis. It starts with a verbal warning and progresses to stronger measures if the problem continues to exist (based on the irregularities since the date of any prior discipline was issued for attendance). The attendance record should be reviewed with your Labor Relations representative prior to issuing discipline for unsatisfactory attendance.
4.	At each step of the process, Union Representatives and members of the Human Resources branch of the Company are available to counsel employees.
5.	Attendance Related Discipline may be mitigated based on a serious demonstration of attendance improvement as follows:
a. If, after assessment of a disciplinary
299
SUPPLEMENT H
penalty, an employee maintains perfect attendance and/or does not receive subsequent attendance related discipline as defined below, while on the active payroll (do not count absences where the employee utilizes accrued vacation or sick leave, approved Family Medical Leave, Military Duty, Union Business, or Jury Duty), the penalty will be cancelled, (i.e., the disciplinary action remains on the record but is not considered in the event of subsequent unsatisfactory attendance) as follows:
•	6 months of perfect attendance = satis-
factory attendance
•	12 months without subsequent disci-
pline = Penalty is repeated
•	18 months without subsequent disci-
pline = Penalty is reduced one step
•	24 months without subsequent disci-
pline = Attendance is considered satisfactory and attendance related discipline will be removed upon employee request
If the discipline that is cancelled is a Verbal Warning, the employee’s attendance will then be considered satisfactory and therefore, consecutive days of absence caused by the same illness within the same pay
300
SUPPLEMENT H
period will be considered as a single occurrence. Additionally, if the discipline that is cancelled is a Verbal Warning, the employee’s attendance will then be considered satisfactory and therefore, the employee will be allowed one (1) tardy per month which must be one hour or less in duration. This tardy will not be counted as a chargeable attendance irregularity for the purpose of disciplinary action. Additional tardies will be considered attendance irregularities. However, in no instance shall the discipline currently being administered revert to less than the discipline normally administered for a first offense.
D.	Responsibility and Authority
Responsibility for good attendance rests with each individual employee. Responsibility for maintaining attendance standards rests with each organization manager. It is the responsibility of the Union to encourage high standards of employee attendance and counsel with employees concerning the importance of regular attendance.
301
SUPPLEMENT I
SUPPLEMENT I
PLANT-WIDE OVERTIME AGREEMENT
Reference
"Overtime will be divided as equally as practicable among affected employees.” The phrase, “affected employees,” means those employees who are assigned the work during the regular work day and work week. Thus, the work to be performed on an overtime basis would normally be assigned to the same employees who do that same work on a straight time basis.
Applicability
The provisions of this policy are separately applicable to each supervisory group within a department by shift in the plant.
Note: This policy supersedes all prior written and oral agreements regarding the distribution and administration of overtime within each department of the plant. Furthermore, the policy cannot be deviated from nor amended without prior review and approval of the representatives of the Company-Union Negotiating Committees.
302
SUPPLEMENT I
General
To ensure that overtime is distributed in a consistent manner and in accordance with the Company-Union Agreement, the administration and application of this overtime agreement shall be by joint participation of the Manager and Shop Steward. Employees of the same classification within a supervisory group within a department by shift shall constitute an overtime group.
Principles of Operation
Affectability
Each Manager/designee shall establish and maintain by classification within a supervisory group within a department by shift, an overtime list/roster which shall initially be established by seniority and consist of affected employees assigned to the overtime group. These lists will be given to the Shop Steward or his designee to be checked for accuracy. Errors found must be corrected immediately so that the appropriate employee may be asked to work. A list shall be posted to bulletin boards within the department with a master list retained in the department office. All lists are subject to review by the Shop Steward or his designee.
2.	Any employee who desires not to be con
303
SUPPLEMENT I
tacted for voluntary overtime can advise the Company. Thereafter, the employee will not be contacted to work overtime unless the entire work group has been offered the opportunity or they are the only employee capable of doing the job.
3.	Overtime should be offered as soon as the Company is aware of the need to work. Generally, weekend overtime should be offered as early in the week as possible. When an employee has been offered and accepted overtime and then is absent from work on the day prior to the overtime assignment, (except for scheduled vacation) the employee will be replaced and will not be eligible for the offered weekend work. The employee will be charged as if the weekend work had been refused.
Recording
1.	There will be one overtime list for each classification by supervisory group within a department by shift which will show the hours charged for the date needed and the cumulative total year-to-date. This list will include in-week, weekend and holiday overtime charges.
2.	Charges shall be made on an hours-paid basis rather than actual hours worked. For example, an employee working eight (8)
304
SUPPLEMENT I
hours at time and one-half will be charged with twelve (12); an employee working eight (8) hours at double time will be charged sixteen (16).
3.	A refusal to work will be charged in the manner as if an employee worked the hours asked.
4.	Employees who are absent on days that overtime is offered will be charged with available payable hours. Employees who accept overtime hours and then do not work will be charged with two times the available payable hours.
5.	New employees entering an overtime group will be charged with the then current average overtime hours for that group.
6.	Employees returning from a prolonged leave of absence shall be charged in the same manner as new employees.
7.	Employees who are required to attend military training when overtime is being worked and are asked to work overtime and refuse will be charged with the hours refused.
8.	Employees released for paid union business will be responsible for notifying the
305
SUPPLEMENT I
Company of their location so they can be notified regarding available overtime.
Loans
1.	An employee assigned to a department on a loan basis will be treated as a new employee for purposes of overtime distribution and recording.
2.	When an employee returns to their regular classification and department from being on loan to another department, the hours worked while on loan will be charged to their total in their regular overtime group.
3.	When an employee is loaned for the purpose of overtime, it shall be by the lowest accumulative overtime hours. They will be affected for overtime only in that area in which they are loaned. Employees cannot be loaned for the purpose of placing them in preferred positions with respect to overtime.
Distribution
1.	The employee with the lowest amount of charged hours on the overtime list will be offered overtime first.
In cases where job continuity is an issue,
306
SUPPLEMENT I
the spread of hours between the employee offered the work and the employee lowest in hours on the overtime list will not exceed fifty (50) hours or as otherwise mutually agreed to by the Department Manager and the Shop Steward. Favoritism to an employee in the application of this agreement will not be tolerated.
It shall not be considered a violation of this provision if the reason the range of distribution is exceeded is a result of an employee’s failure to report for scheduled overtime.
Hours charged for consecutive days worked will not be considered to have violated the provisions of this agreement where such assignment creates a difference in the amount of overtime differentiation.
2.	If, during a Friday or Saturday shift, it is determined that overtime will have to be worked on the following day where none had been scheduled, the employees working overtime will be considered first before calling in other employees from the department.
While working weekend overtime, any hours offered in excess of originally scheduled overtime hours will not be charged
307
SUPPLEMENT I
unless accepted. However, any issues arising as a result of this application are not subject to Article III of the current collective bargaining agreement.
3.	If after all employees in the classification in an overtime group are scheduled or have been given an opportunity to work, additional employees are needed, employees in the same classification within the department on the same shift shall be asked first. Thereafter, employees in the same classification in the department on other shifts shall be asked. If a sufficient number of employees are still not available, employees in the department in the same Job Functional Line will be asked in order of low work hours.
4.	An employee temporarily transferred to salaried status will not be entitled to participate in hourly overtime on the weekend of the temporary transfer to salary, during the temporary assignment to salaried status, or on the weekend of the return to the Bargaining Unit. He shall be charged all overtime that he could have worked while hourly had he not accepted the salaried assignment.
5.	At the end of each calendar year, all over
308
SUPPLEMENT I
time lists will be "zeroed out", i.e., take the employee with the lowest amount of hours and make them zero and subtract their total hours from each person in the overtime group. These new totals would be effective in January of the following year.
6.	In situations where overtime has not been scheduled and it becomes necessary to call employees in, a record of the call-in effort will be made. If available, the Shop Steward or Committeeman or their designee in the area will be asked to witness the call-in. Any employee working as a result of callin will be charged the hours worked. Any employee who cannot be reached or refuses the call-in overtime work will not be charged.
7.	The Supervisor must furnish the Shop Steward a list of the employees who accept or reject the opportunity for weekend and holiday overtime prior to the overtime being worked. A reasonable effort will also be made to apply this provision to in-week overtime.
Any overtime equalization disparity agreed to between the parties will be remedied by the following methods:
a. If the Supervisor is notified by the Shop
309
SUPPLEMENT I
Steward in writing before the overtime is worked that his selections are not the affected employees and he refuses to correct his mistake, the affected employees will be made whole by monetary settlement.
b If the Supervisor is not notified by the Shop Steward in writing before the overtime is worked that his selections are not the affected employees, the affected employee will be offered the next available overtime. If the Company fails to offer the employee the	next
overtime opportunity, the employee will be made whole by monetary settlement.
Overtime questions/answers reviewed and agreed to by the parties shall be a part of this agreement and applied for proper handling as issues arise.
