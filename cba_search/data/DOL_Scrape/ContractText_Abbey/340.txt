COMPANY MANUAL OF RULES AND REGULATIONS
NORTHROP GRUMMAN SHIP SYSTEMS, INC. PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI
FOREWORD
Each and every employee, and others coming under the Rules and Regulations, assume full responsibility for being thoroughly familiar with the location of all controlled or hazardous areas.
1.	SMOKING
Where it can be traced (including circumstantial evidence) that smoking is the cause of a fire, the party responsible will be held accountable.
Smoking is prohibited in No Smoking Zones and those areas where No Smoking signs are posted. Violators will be subject to immediate discharge.
A No Smoking Zone is any area where:
(1)	Flammable materials are stored.
(2)	Hazards are created due to the type of work being done
(3)	Valuable irreplaceable materials, tools, or equipment are stored.
Fire hazards in various areas will, of course, change from time to time due to work progress and changing of material storage. The designation of a No Smoking Zone will be solely the function of the Management.
No Smoking Zones, to which others may be added from time to time, will at all times include the following:
(a)	Paint shop and paint storage
(b)	Paint locker rooms
(c)	Oil storage
(d)	Carpenter shop and lumber storage yard

53
(a)	Progress of the ship toward completion.
(b)	Areas on a ship where the fire hazard is great; as an example, during the refueling of a ship or the testing of various items of equipment, such as gasoline pumps, etc.
The mere reprimanding of a smoker for violation is by no means an indication that the Company is waiving its rights in other cases to discharge an employee. The Company is to be the judge of when an employee is intentionally disobeying the smoking rules, as there may be circumstances which call for more drastic measures in one case than in another. All other smoking violations will be handled in accordance with the Company’s No Smoking policy.
2.	SLEEPING
An employee found sleeping during working hours will be subject to immediate discharge.
