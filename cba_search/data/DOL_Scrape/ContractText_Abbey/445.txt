(hereinafter called the "Company"), and the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, the Broadcasting and Cable Television Workers Sector of the Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO-CLC, or its successor (hereinafter called the "Union" or "NABET-CWA"). In the event of a sale, merger or consolidation of all or a part of an entity or operation covered above, the Company will give the Union written notice thereof as soon as practicable. Upon request of the Union, the parties will meet as soon as practicable thereafter to discuss and bargain over the effect on the bargaining unit(s) impacted by such sale, merger or consolidation.
It is the intent and purpose of the parties hereto to set forth herein the basic collective bargaining agreements between the parties in two (2) parts: (I) GENERAL ARTICLES covering those subjects which are uniformly applicable to substantially all of the basic relationships, hours of work and general conditions of employment, including a procedure for prompt, equitable adjustment of grievances to the end that there shall be no work stoppages or other interferences with operations during the life of these Agreements; and (II) INDIVIDUAL ARTICLES which will contain the description of each bargaining unit, which shall not be affected hereby, the rates of pay and any unusual working conditions which have no general application. In the event of any conflict between the General and Individual Articles, the Individual Articles will prevail. Whenever in the wording of this Agreement the masculine gender is used, it shall be understood to include the feminine gender.

ARTICLE II
NO DISCRIMINATION
Section 2.1
The Company will not discriminate against any employee for anything said, written or done in furtherance of the policies and aims of the Union.

It is understood that the preceding sentence will not affect the Company's retirement policy nor will it be construed to prevent the Company from considering age when permitted to do so under applicable law.
Section 2.2
The Company will not transfer or reassign any shop steward or any officer of the Union without prior discussion with the Union and without a bona fide reason. The Union agrees to furnish a list of the respective local stewards and officers to each office of the Company, and to notify the office promptly in writing of any change in the list.
Section 2.3
The Company shall, when requested by a Local Union, schedule the Local President, the Local Vice President, or the Chairman of the Grievance Committee to tours which will facilitate discussion of labor matters with the Company. If any such person is on leave of absence or is not employed by the Company, a designee who is employed by the Company may be appointed by the Union in his or her place. It is agreed that only one (1) such person (or designee) need be so scheduled in any office of the Company except New York City and Los Angeles where no more than two (2) such officers or designees shall be so scheduled.

Section 7.7	- Meal Expense Allowance.
(a)	An employee assigned to a scheduled field pickup or other authorized Company business that requires traveling and/or work away from the home office overnight shall receive a per diem allowance of Fifty-Two Dollars ($52.00), increased to Fifty-Three Dollars ($53.00) effective April 1, 2005, for meals and incidental expenses for each calendar day that the employee is away from the home office. (On assignments outside the Continental United States, the per diem allowance will be the same as that provided to unrepresented staff employees of the Company on the same assignment.) The term "incidental expenses" as used in this subsection (a) refers to expenses incurred for items such as laundry and tips. Employees will not be reimbursed for telephone calls and transportation (other than transportation and telephone calls authorized by the Company for business purposes). In the unusual case in which an employee incurs reasonable and necessary expenses in excess of the per diem allowance, the employee shall submit a statement of such expenses to the management representative for approval. In the case of a remote in which meals are not readily available, the Company may cater meals in a restaurant, hotel dining room or equivalent accommodation, in which event the per diem allowance shall be reduced by Three Dollars ($3.00) for each meal other than breakfast so catered and One Dollar and Fifty Cents ($1.50) for each breakfast so catered. For the purpose of applying the per diem allowance, an assignment in which the employee travels by air shall be deemed to start at his or her plane's scheduled departure time and end at the actual arrival time of the plane at the gate which the employee takes to return to, his or her home office, provided that, if the actual arrival time of the plane at the gate is before 2:00 A.M., the assignment shall be deemed to have ended on the previous day. On all assignments covered hereunder lasting eight (8) or more consecutive days, an employee shall receive, in addition to the per diem allowance provided above, a special laundry allowance of Three Dollars ($3.00) per day (without submitting receipts) or up to Six Dollars ($6.00) per day reimbursement by submitting itemized receipts for the laundry expenses, retroactive in either case to the first (1st) day of such assignment.
(b)	Employees assigned to field pickups, or other authorized Company business away from the home office, not covered by the
14
foregoing (including employees assigned to the studio and subsequently assigned to a field pickup, or other authorized Company business away from the home office, for the remainder of their tour) shall be allowed a single payment of Twelve Dollars ($12.00), increased to Thirteen Dollars ($13.00) effective April 1, 2005 for meals after eleven (11) elapsed hours or Seventeen Dollars ($17.00), increased to Eighteen Dollars ($18.00) effective April 1, 2005 after fifteen (15) elapsed hours, if the employee is on assignment in the field, or on other authorized Company business away from the home office, at the end of such eleventh or fifteenth hour respectively. In lieu of the foregoing, when sleeping accommodations are not furnished but the assignment requires the employee to travel fifty (50) miles or more (one way) from the main office of the employee's Company office and requires absence from the employee's home office for at least fourteen (14) hours, a per diem will be paid in the amount of Twenty-Six Dollars ($26.00), increased to Twenty-Seven Dollars ($27.00) effective April 1, 2005 in lieu of meals.

Section 7.11
When technical equipment at the point of origination does not require the presence of an employee covered by the Engineering Agreement in order to originate a program from such point, nothing in this Article shall require the presence of such an employee. This Section shall not be construed to infringe on NABET-CWA jurisdiction where work covered by the Agreement is required to be performed at remote locations, nor shall it preclude NABET-CWA from grieving as to whether work covered by
15
the Agreement is or is not required in any specific remote pick up.
ARTICLE VIII
WORK SCHEDULE, OVERTIME AND PENALTIES
Section 8.1	- Regular Work Day.
A regular work day is defined as consisting of not less than eight (8) hours in any work day, which shall be computed by totaling the number of hours between the time an employee reports for work and the time of completion of the employee's duties for such work day, including meal periods where applicable.

None of the above turnaround provisions shall apply to regularly established watch changes where the parties have agreed upon a
16
rotating watch system, or to tours separated by vacation or by leave of absence in excess of two (2) days. In addition, none of the above turnaround provisions shall apply where two (2) hours or less elapse between the end of any tour or extension thereof, and the beginning of the next, in which event, such tour will be considered as one continuous tour.
Section 8.4	- Long Tours.
(a)	If an employee works more than eight (8) hours in any single tour, he or she shall be paid for all the hours in excess of eight (8} at one and one-half (1-1/2) times the regular rate of pay. Compensation for this excess time shall be in addition to any base pay to which such employee may be entitled regardless of the length of the tour in question. For example, an employee, who in any regular work week works three (3) eight (8) hour tours and one (1) twenty-four (24) hour tour will be compensated at the employee's base pay for such work week plus sixteen (16) hours at one and one-half (1-1/2) times the employee's regular rate of pay.
(b)	If an employee is called back to work on a calendar day on which he or she has already started and completed a tour of duty, the employee shall be paid for the time between the end of such tour and his or her start of work on the callback.

Section 8.5	- Overtime.
Hours worked outside of a regular work week or a regular work day shall be regarded as overtime and compensated at one and one-half (1-1/2) times the regular rate of pay in quarter-hour segments, except that such overtime hours worked on tours to which Article X is applicable shall be additionally compensated for as provided therein. In no case shall overtime accrue on overtime. Penalties shall not be considered overtime or part of the base pay. Once an employee has reported to work his or her scheduled tour including overtime will not be shortened.
Section 8.6	- Changes in Work Schedule.
(a)	Changes in Employees' Day or Days Off -- The posting of the schedule referred to in Section 8.2 shall freeze' the employees' days off for the period covered by the posting.
17
(b)	Work on Scheduled Day Off -- An employee may be required to work on a scheduled day of f. Seventy- two (72) hours * notice prior to 12:01 A.M. of the scheduled day off must be given, except if less notice is given a Nineteen Dollar ($19.00) penalty shall be paid. Except as provided in the following paragraph, in the event that such notice is given within such seventy-two (72) hour period, at least eight (8) hours must elapse between the end of the employee's previous tour and the start of a tour on any originally scheduled day off. If less than eight (8) hours elapse, then the elapsed time will be paid for as time worked and all hours will be paid for as one continuous tour. In the event that the Company notifies an employee to report for.work on a scheduled day off and then cancels such tour less than seventy-two (72) hours but more than twenty-four (24) hours prior to the scheduled starting time of work on such day off, the employee shall be paid a penalty of Thirty-Five Dollars ($35.00). However, such employee shall be paid for such tour if (i), after such cancellation, he or she is again notified to report for work on such scheduled day off and the employee's tour is again cancelled, or (ii), the Company cancels such tour upon less than such twenty-four (24) hours' notice.
On any tour in which an employee is assigned to a news pickup in the field using electronic cameras capable of being handheld, and associated equipment, if such assignment requires travel and/or work away from the home office overnight, the eight (8) hours specified in the third sentence of the preceding paragraph will be five (5) hours. If less than five (5) hours elapse, then the elapsed time will be paid for as time worked and all hours will be paid for as one continuous tour.
(See Stipulation 25 regarding credit days, page 220)
(c)	Daily Schedule Change - Notice of daily schedule changes affecting starting time shall be given no later than 11:00 P.M. of the second day prior to the day in question. If schedule changes are desired thereafter, such changes can only be made by adding work time to the previously scheduled hours at overtime rates as specified in Section 8.5.
In lieu of the preceding paragraph, on scheduled field pickups or authorized Company business requiring travel and/or work away from the home office overnight, notice of daily schedule changes affecting starting time shall be given ten (10) hours in advance of the changed starting time, but not later than 9:00 P.M. of the work day prior to the day in question, except that in the event an employee is notified after 9:00 P.M. of a starting time schedule change or is given less than ten (10)
18
hours' advance notice, a penalty of Thirteen Dollars ($13.00) shall be paid.
In lieu of the first paragraph of this Section, on news field assignments not covered by the second paragraph of this Section using electronic cameras capable of being hand-held and associated equipment, notice of daily schedule changes affecting starting time shall be given ten (10) hours in advance of the changed starting time, but not later than 9:00 P.M. of the work day prior to the day in question, provided that (i) in the event an employee is notified after 9:00 P.M. of a starting time schedule change or is given less than ten (10) hours' advance notice, a penalty of Thirteen Dollars ($13.00) shall be paid; or (ii) in the event an employee is notified after 11:00 P.M. of the work day prior to the day in question, the change in starting time can only be made by adding work time to the previously scheduled hours at overtime rates as specified in Section 8.5. The addition of such work time pursuant to (ii) shall be in lieu of the penalty set forth in (i) .
In either case stated above, the assignment to which the employee is to be assigned shall govern.
Starting time referred to above means either the original posted time or the new time-in, whichever is earlier.
Section 8.7
The posting of the weekly schedules and any subsequent daily schedule changes shall fulfill the Company's obligation of notification to the employees under this Article. The Company agrees to make every effort to change the posted schedules as soon as changes in starting time or end-of-tour time are known to the Company.
Before going on vacation, an employee will be informed as to what date he or she will first be required to report back to work.
On the Friday prior to the end of the employee's vacation or such other day agreeable to the local management and the local vacation committee, the employee will call his .or her designated department or scheduling area for his or her starting time for the day on which he or she is first scheduled to report to work following his or her vacation.

19
Section 8.8
(a)	If the employee has completed his or her tour prior to the posting of the daily schedule, it shall be the Company's sole obligation to notify the employee of any change. Such notice shall be considered given as of the time it is received by the employee personally, or by any responsible person at the employee's home. For each completed telephone call made by the Company to an employee's home between Midnight and 7:00 A.M., the employee shall be paid a penalty of Twelve Dollars ($12.00) .
In the case of an employee who qualifies for night shift differential under Section 10.1, for each completed telephone call made by the Company to an employee's home within eight (8) hours after the completion of the employee's prior shift, the employee shall be paid a penalty of Twelve Dollars ($12.00).
(b)	Notwithstanding any provision of the Master Agreement or any other agreements, grievance settlements, arbitration awards or past practice to the contrary, if the Company calls an employee during the employee's off-duty hours and discusses Company business (other than a schedule change in paragraph (a) above) for more than ten (10) minutes, the employee shall receive one (1) hour's pay at his or her regular rate for each such completed call, provided the need to make the call does not result from an error or omission on the part of the employee. In the event an employee receives more than three (3) such calls in any one (1) calendar day, the employee shall receive no less than eight (8) hours' pay at his or her regular rate.
(c)	Each employee shall inform the Company of any change in his or her home address and telephone number within seven (7) days after such change.
Section 8.9	- Excessive Assignments.
(a)	If an employee has worked in excess of ten (10) consecutive days without having received at least one (1) day off, for all such days worked in excess of ten (10) and until such time as the employee has received a day off, the employee shall receive additional compensation at his or her straight-time rate of pay; provided, however, that if the employee is otherwise receiving at least one and one-half (1-1/2) times his or her straight-time rate of pay for any hours thereof by virtue of another provision of this Agreement, the employee's additional compensation therefor under this Section shall be at one-half (1/2) his or her straight-time rate of pay. It is not the intention of the Company to schedule an employee to
20
work in excess of twelve (12) consecutive days unless such assignment is necessitated by unusual operating requirements.
The next succeeding paragraph shall continue to be applicable to those commonly scheduled operating groups to which it was applicable at the conclusion of the prior Agreement. Each commonly scheduled operating group to which the next succeeding paragraph was not applicable at the conclusion of the prior Agreement may elect to have it applicable under the following conditions: (i) NABET-CWA will notify NBC within thirty (30) days of the execution of this Agreement which such groups have elected that such paragraph shall be applicable; (ii) NBC will determine the date on which such paragraph becomes effective, which date will not be later than two (2) weeks after receipt of such notice. For any group to which the succeeding paragraph is or becomes applicable, the first paragraph of this Section 8.9(a) shall be revised by changing "ten (10)" to. "fifteen (15)" during the period of such applicability.
If an employee works six (6) consecutive days without at least one (1) of such days being a scheduled day off, the employee will receive additional compensation at one-half (1/2) his or her straight-time rate of. pay for all hours worked on such sixth (6th) • consecutive work day and, similarly, if an employee works' seven (7) consecutive days without at least one (1) of such days being a scheduled day off, the employee will receive additional compensation at one-half (1/2) his or her straight-time rate of pay for all hours worked on such seventh (7 th) consecutive work day. The foregoing shall not be applicable■ to any hours on such sixth (6th) and/or seventh (7th) day which are otherwise compensated for as overtime hours, nor shall this Section be construed to require additional compensation for work on an eighth (8th), ninth (9th) and/or tenth (10th) consecutive day of work without a scheduled day off. However, the foregoing additional compensation shall not be required in any situation in which an employee works a sixth (6th) and/or seventh (7th) day as a result of the Company's accommodating a request by that employee.
(b)	The Company shall refrain from assigning employees for continuous -excessive hours of work resulting in excessive mental and physical strain. In the event the Company does so assign employees, it is agreed that the matter shall be subject to the grievance procedure, and the Company shall give such grievance its attention as soon as possible.
(c)	The -Company will notify the President of the Local Union in advance of the operational use of new technical equipment or a significant change in any established method of
21
operation, provided that where the Local President is not an employee of the Company, a designee who is an employee may be appointed by the Union, and in such event, the Company will endeavor to send a copy of the above notice to said designee. Whenever possible, such notice will be given in writing at least two (2) weeks prior to the placing of such equipment into operation or the making of such change. If the Local Union claims that the Company's action will impose or has imposed a significant increase in
(i)	work load or
(ii)	physical, mental or nervous strain on the employees involved, which will or has resulted in an unreasonable work load or excessive physical, mental or nervous strain on such employees, it may invoke the grievance and arbitration procedures set forth in Article XX, including the expedited arbitration procedure. However, the expedited arbitration procedure can be invoked only within one (1) week following receipt of such notice, unless such time is extended by mutual agreement.
Should the arbitrator determine, under any and all factors which the arbitrator deems relevant, that the new technical equipment or changed method of operation imposes an unreasonable work load or excessive mental, physical or nervous strain on the employees involved, the arbitrator shall order the Company to devise an alternative which alleviates such condition, and the arbitrator will retain jurisdiction over the case until such time as he or she is satisfied that the condition has been corrected. Should the arbitrator determine, under any and all factors which the arbitrator deems relevant, that the increase in work load or mental, physical or nervous strain has rendered the employees' Group classification inappropriate, he or she may reclassify such employees within the existing Group classifications in the Agreement.
It is specifically agreed that the notice provision of this clause shall not be applicable to minor changes in operations, or to emergency situations such as changes necessary to meet suddenly arising operational needs, provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude the Company from giving the notice provided above in either such case.
Section 8.10
Notwithstanding any provisions in this Article VIII or arbitration awards to the contrary, no employee shall be entitled to payment for any scheduled work time for which he or she is not present and available to perform work assigned

(a)	Prior to the effectuation of any discharge hereunder, an employee whose performance has not been consistently satisfactory shall be so notified in writing as to how it has not been satisfactory and, thereafter, be afforded a reasonable opportunity to establish and maintain such a level of performance. A copy of such notification shall be given to the President of the employee's Local Union or his or her designee. The failure of management to have previously notified a dischargee that his or her performance has not been consistently satisfactory may not form the basis for any contention by the Union, or for any finding by an arbitrator that the Company's determination hereunder is arbitrary or capricious. However, in the event of a failure to notify, the employee in question may not be discharged until he or she has been given at least eight (8) weeks to establish and maintain a satisfactory level of performance. Any notice that is provided under this subsection shall be in writing and shall state that it constitutes notice under Section 14.2, but such notice shall not preclude the Company from imposing discipline on such employee under Section 14.1. If, for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, the employee's overall performance is satisfactory, an employee shall no longer be subject to such notice of discharge.

Upon his or her acceptance of a termination hereunder, the dischargee shall also be deemed to have been given four (4) weeks' advance notice of discharge, which period shall be converted to pay in lieu of notice. In addition, the Company will not oppose any application for unemployment insurance. In consideration of the foregoing, said dischargee and the Union shall immediately execute a general release drafted by and satisfactory to the Company.
(c} If a discharge hereunder is arbitrated, the Company's determination shall be sustained unless the Union proves that the classification of said discharge under this Section 14.2 is a pretext for some other reason, or that such
34
determination, though not a pretext, is arbitrary or capricious. In any such proceeding, the arbitrator may not substitute his or her judgment for that of the Company, and the Company shall be accorded a presumption that its classification of the discharge and its substantive determination were reasonable and made in good faith.
(d) In the event that the determination hereunder is sustained in arbitration, the Company shall have no obligation to provide the dischargee with any additional severance payment or notice pay provided in subparagraph (b) above or to provide any of the other benefits described in such subparagraph.
{e} It is expressly understood and agreed that the Company has no obligation to find or attempt to find a dischargee hereunder any other position, or to train said dischargee to perform any job or assignment, including his or her present job or assignment, as a condition of sustaining the discharge.
(f) Neither the acceptance of any terminations nor any arbitration awards rendered hereunder may be cited in any other arbitration.

Section 19.8
No employee may be recalled to duty for any reason during his or her vacation period. The Company will schedule at least two (2) days off contiguous to the employee's vacation, provided the employee requests such days in writing at least two (2) weeks prior to the vacation, or such other period agreeable to the local management and the local committee. If an employee splits his or her vacation into two (2) or more segments, the preceding sentence shall be applicable to a maximum of two (2) such segments; however, local agreements and practices which permit the preceding sentence to be applicable to more than two (2) such segments will not be affected by this sentence. An employee may not be required to work on days off which, at the request of the employee, have been scheduled contiguous to the employee's vacation.
Section 19.9

(1)	In a separate period of one (1) or two (2) weeks at a time during the vacation period selected in accordance with seniority after the primary portion of all other vacations of
46
employees in the same vacation group have been selected, and/or
(2)	On a one-day-at-a-time basis up to five (5) days with the approval of local management, provided that the taking of a particular day off is agreed upon by the Company and the employee involved, and the request for such day is made at least two (2) weeks prior to the day involved, and provided further that if an employee does not utilize or arrange to utilize his or her individual vacation days by October 1st of each year, the Company may schedule the remaining days prior to the end of the year.

(3)	Those returning after the vacation season will receive no vacation until the following year.
(4)	If the number of months the employee worked in the year in which he or she went into the service, added to the number of months he or she worked in the year in which he or she returned from service, is twelve (12) months or less, he or she shall receive one (1) full vacation period or vacation pay, for' both years combined.
Subject to paragraph (3) , if the sum exceeds twelve (12) months, the total vacation for the combined years shall be prorated, a fractional day counting as a full day. For example, if the sum is eighteen (18) months, the employee shall receive a total of one and one-half (1-1/2) vacations for both years and if, for example, the employee received in time or money a full vacation on leaving, the employee would be entitled to one-half (1/2) of a full vacation for the year in which he or she returns.
Section 19.11

47
employment, such payment shall be made to his or her estate in the case of the employee's death.
ARTICLE XX GRIEVANCES AND ARBITRATION
Section 20.1
Should a grievance arise during the term of this Agreement, the aggrieved employee or employees shall contact the designated Union Steward. The grievance shall be discussed promptly by the Steward (or another Union representative designated by the Local President) and the designated management supervisor for the purpose of ascertaining the relevant facts and attempting settlement. Such Steward or other designated Union representative and the management supervisor shall each have the authority to settle the specific incident involved in the grievance on terms mutually acceptable to them. Any settlements so reached shall be immediately reduced to writing on a special form which shall state the essential facts involved, including the date, location, Company and Union personnel involved, the precise request made by the employee or the Union and the reason therefor, and which shall be signed by the Steward or other Union representative and the management supervisor. Each such settlement shall automatically be deemed to contain the following clause: "This resolution is made on a no-precedent basis, is without prejudice to the position of either the Company or the Union with respect to any contractual issues that may be involved, and may not be cited in any subsequent arbitration or other legal proceeding other than one involving the enforcement of this particular resolution."
If a resolution is reached, a copy will be forwarded to the Local Union President or his or her designee and the Company's Labor Relations Department. Either party shall nevertheless have the right to submit the incident to arbitration (alleging that the incident did or did not involve a violation of the Agreement) as if no resolution had been reached, but only after discussion of such resolution at a meeting held pursuant to Sideletter 19 on page 258 within one hundred ten (110) days after the day of the resolution.

48
If during any calendar year at any office of the Company either party arbitrates more than three {3) incidents originally resolved in accordance with the procedures established above, the other party may, upon thirty {30) days' written notice, have the option to delete the third (3rd) and succeeding sentences of the first (1st) paragraph of this Section 20.1 and all of the second (2nd) and third (3rd) paragraphs of this Section 20.1 from the Master Agreement at that particular office.
Should the grievance remain unresolved after such discussion, it shall be reduced to writing on appropriate forms and signed by the employee, the Steward or, in the case of a grievance filed by the Union, by any Union representative. The written grievance shall state the essential facts involved, including the date, .location and the Company and Union personnel involved. Such written grievance shall be filed with the management supervisor and with the Union for processing to the Local Grievance Committee.
No grievance may be filed more than forty-five (45) days after knowledge of the incident or condition which gave rise to the grievance was known or should have been known to an Officer or representative of the International Union or to an Officer of the Local Union, including a grievance committee member, or to an Executive Board member or a steward involved in that area of the Company's operation relevant to the substance of the incident or condition involved.
(See Sideletter 19 on page 258)
Section 20.2
In the event that an employee has a personal complaint, the employee may discuss the complaint with his or her management supervisor, his or her Steward, or both, provided, however, that the Steward shall have the right to be present at the resolution of the complaint. If the complaint is not satisfied and the matter is alleged to violate this Section and/or another provision of the Master Agreement, it may be submitted as a grievance in accordance with Section 20.1.
(The Burbank Award in NB84-71 is null and void and of no further force and effect.)
Section 20.3
The Local Grievance Committee shall be designated by the Union at each office, and its size shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties. Local grievance meetings shall be held at each office on a regular, periodic basis as required, but not less

At sites not controlled by the Company at which employees covered by this Agreement are working and at which credentials to permit access are required, the Company will, upon request and whenever possible, supply such credentials to the President of the Local involved or, in his or her absence, to the President's designee. When the Company adopts special security measures at a studio or other site which it controls, it shall not bar a duly authorized representative of NABET-CWA from inspecting or investigating such operations, pursuant to the preceding paragraph, provided, however, that when the Company provides special security precautions, it may require credentials of such NABET-CWA representative if it either (1) provides the appropriate Union official with such credentials in advance, or (2) gives the Union due and timely written notice that application must be made for such credentials.
Section 20.5
When any member of the Local Grievance Committee is called upon to meet with a Company representative pursuant to the provisions of this Article, the following shall apply:
(a)	If said member of the Committee has been cleared for the day for such meeting, the member shall receive his or her regular day's pay for such day, regardless of the length of such meeting.
(b)	If said member of the Committee is on duty and is called to such meeting, and such meeting continues past the member's scheduled quitting time for the day, he or she shall be paid at the applicable overtime rate for all hours after such scheduled quitting time.
(c)	In the event a member of the Committee attends any such meeting on the member's scheduled day off, he or she shall receive a substitute day off at a time mutually agreeable to the member and his or her supervisor, which day need not be consecutive with his or her two (2) regularly scheduled days off.
In no event shall any penalty payments accrue as a result of attendance at any meeting as described herein.

Section 20.6
All grievances filed since the most recent grievance meeting held pursuant to Section 20.3 shall automatically be placed on the agenda for the next such grievance meeting, and both parties will make good-faith efforts to discuss all such grievances at that meeting. After a meeting at which such grievances are discussed, the Company shall give to the Union a written answer to each grievance. Within forty (40) days after its initial discussion at a grievance meeting or within twenty (20) days after receipt by the Union of the Company's written answer, whichever is later, or within sixty (60) days after filing if there has been no discussion, or after any longer period of time as may be mutually agreed to in writing by the Company and the Union, either party may refer the grievance to arbitration by delivering a signed, written notice to that effect directed to the other party and to the appropriate Impartial Umpire or to the American Arbitration Association, as governed by Section 20.8 below.

Howard S. Block	]
Mark Burstein	] Los Angeles Office
Joan Parker	Washington Office
_________________ Chicago Office
In Los Angeles, where two (2) Umpires are designated, the Umpire shall be selected in rotation, provided that if the appropriate Umpire has no available dates for hearing the case within a reasonable period of time after the matter is referred to him or her for arbitration, the matter shall be referred to the next Umpire in rotation who has such available
51
dates. However, it is agreed that for any cases involving jurisdictional issues, the parties shall select the Umpire by striking names from the above list unless they mutually agree otherwise.
In the event of the resignation, termination, or incapacity of an Impartial Umpire, a successor shall be designated by the parties for the remainder of the term.
Section 20.7
A grievance which is not referred to arbitration in accordance with Section 20.6 shall be deemed abandoned. A grievance which has been abandoned shall not be deemed to be a settlement or an arbitral determination adverse to the grieving party; the grieving party shall be deemed to have protested the incident or incidents upon which the closed grievance was based, but shall not be deemed to have filed a formal grievance relating thereto, and may not file a subsequent grievance based upon such specific incident or incidents.
Current grievances which are at least ten (10) years old as of the date of ratification of a successor agreement to the 1990-1994 Master Agreement shall be deemed abandoned. Any grievances filed on or after January 1, 1991 that have not been resolved within five (5) years of the date they were filed shall be deemed abandoned.
Section 20.8
If the appropriate Impartial Umpire has no available dates for hearing the case within a reasonable time after the matter is referred to him or her for arbitration, or if there is no Impartial Umpire for a particular Office of the Company, the parties may attempt to select an arbitrator themselves. If the parties do not agree upon an arbitrator within two (2) weeks (or such longer period upon which the parties mutually agree), the case may be referred to the American Arbitration Association in that city in accordance with the Association's rules, except the Association shall submit additional lists until the parties mutually select an arbitrator. The matter shall be determined by an arbitrator selected pursuant to such rules.
Section 20.9
Grievance settlements, withdrawals of grievances, and practices at offices of the Company other than the office in which the grievance being arbitrated was filed shall not be considered by the arbitrator and/or Impartial Umpire in
52
connection with the arbitration of such grievance. The arbitration award shall be applicable only to the office in which the grievance was filed. The foregoing provisions of this Section 20.9 shall not preclude the arbitrator from considering grievance settlements, withdrawals of grievances, and practices at the office where the grievance was filed.
Section 20.10
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this Article XX, if a party to the Agreement claims that there will be a violation of Article II, V, VI, VII, A-II, A-IV, N-II, P-II or Section 8.9(c) of Article VIII or of an arbitration award, such party shall have the right to file a grievance directly with the Impartial Umpire setting forth such claim, demanding injunctive relief, and invoking the expedited arbitration procedure set forth below. However, this Section 20.10, which is applicable only to complaints of action not yet effectuated, may be utilized only if time does not permit the processing of the grievance under the other Sections of Article XX. No grievance shall be filed under this Section until such grievance has been discussed (by phone or otherwise) between a designated official of the International Office of the Union and a designated official of the main office of the Company. A copy of the notice invoking this Section shall be sent simultaneously to the other party. Under the expedited procedure, the arbitration hearings shall commence at the earliest availability of the Impartial Umpire unless the grieving party consents to an extension of time.
If Joan Parker is unable or unwilling to hear the grievance within twenty-four (24) hours, Carol Wittenberg or another arbitrator by mutual agreement of the parties may be designated to hear such grievance as the Impartial Umpire under this Section. The award of the Impartial Umpire shall be rendered at the earliest possible time and, in any event, no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the hearing has been closed. The Impartial Umpire need not render an opinion with the award. The Impartial Umpire shall be empowered under this procedure to order injunctive relief or such other remedy as he or she deems appropriate if he or she finds there.will be (or has been) a violation of one of the provisions specified at the beginning of this Section or of an arbitration award. It is the specific intent of this Section 20.10 to permit arbitration proceedings concerning proposed changes in operations to commence prior to the making of such proposed changes, but not to delay the making of such changes pending the outcome of any such proceedings. The parties agree and will impress upon the Impartial Umpire the need for expedition in the processing of the grievance and the rendering of this award.
53
(It is understood that the reference to “Impartial Umpire" in other Sections of the Agreement, i.e., ARTICLE XIV and Stipulation 12, refer to the Impartial Umpire in the office concerned.)
Section 20.11
Except as provided in Section 20.10, a final decision or award of the Impartial Umpire or arbitrator shall be made within thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing. Such decision shall be binding on both parties and each of them will promptly comply. Each party will bear its own expense incurred in the conduct of arbitration proceedings but will share equally the expense of the Impartial Umpire or arbitrator. The parties agree and will impress upon the Impartial Umpire or arbitrator the need for expedition in the rendering of this award.
Section 20.12
In no event shall the Impartial Umpire or arbitrator modify or amend the provisions of this Agreement nor, except as permitted in the second sentence of Section 20.9, shall the same question or issue be the subject of arbitration more than once, except upon a showing of new evidence, change of condition, or circumstances. The Impartial Umpire or arbitrator shall have the right, in instances where violations of the contract are found to have occurred, to impose punitive damages where actual damage cannot be computed or where the imposition of a deterrent to future violations may be warranted. In case of any grievance involving a continuing liability for which the arbitration hearing is not concluded within one (1) year of the filing of the grievance, damages, if any, shall run for a period of no more than thirteen (13) months from the date of the earliest grieved incident or condition.

Section 21.2
In the event the Union wishes to retain safety consultants to advise it on matters of occupational health and safety, the Company agrees to designate a representative to meet with such consultants at times and places mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Union. Such consultants may also, at the Union's request and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company, attend meetings of the Safety Committees provided for in Section 21.1 above.
Section 21.3

In view of the foregoing, at each Company location, a special safety committee of NABET-CWA-represented employees and representatives of local management shall meet as mutually agreed, but no less than once every four (4) months, to attempt to resolve safety issues that have been raised by employees on EJ field assignments. An agreed upon number of EJ field employees shall attend such meetings to offer information or suggestions on the basis of their experience.

55
at or near the site of the pickup. In either event, such employee(s) shall use his or her best efforts to fulfill the assignment. To overcome factors that may contribute to the creation of a hazardous condition, such employee(s) may request appropriate safety gear.
Any decision not to begin or continue to perform a hazardous assignment must be made in good faith, be reasonable under all of the circumstances and be communicated as soon as possible to the appropriate assignment editor or management personnel. In the event of any conflict between an employee's decision and an order to perform given by an assignment editor or a manager, the employee shall not be regarded as insubordinate, provided that his or her decision is in accordance with the foregoing sentence.

ARTICLE A-II
TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT AND JURISDICTION
Section A2.1 - Technical Equipment and Jurisdiction
Only employees under this Agreement shall operate, maintain and, to the extent heretofore, repair technical equipment, and technical equipment for the purposes of this Contract includes those facilities of the Engineering Department of the Company used in transmitting, converting and/or conducting audio, video, and/or radio frequencies for use in broadcast, closed-
64
circuit broadcast, rebroadcast, audition, rehearsal, recording, and/or "on-the-air" playback.
Section A2.2 - Jurisdiction
(a)	In addition to the jurisdiction granted in Section A2.1 above, it is agreed that the jurisdiction of the Union is expressly applicable to all electronic video equipment (including a combination electronic and motion picture or "slave" camera) used either in connection with live broadcasting or in connection with electronic video recording. It shall include all related electronic, mechanical and optical equipment used operationally for all recording, rerecording, processing, duplicating, editing, cutting, splicing and playback, in connection with such video recordings, provided, however, with respect to kinescope recordings in New York City, this paragraph shall not modify the existing collective bargaining agreement and certification by the National Labor Relations Board.
(b)	Electronic character generators (e.g., Vidifont, Videograph, Chyron) and keyboard or other input devices used solely therewith and memory and storage devices used solely therewith are technical equipment under this Agreement when used for broadcast, closed-circuit broadcast, re-broadcast, audition, rehearsal, recording and/or "on-the-air" playback, and when used for such purposes, such devices shall be operated, maintained, and, to the extent heretofore, installed by employees hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than employees covered by this Agreement
(i)	may operate keyboard or other input devices for the purpose of visually determining the format, layout, size of font, or design of material, provided that any decisions reached on such matters by such other persons will be presented to employees covered by this Agreement for entry into the memory or storage of the device or for use live, provided further that such other employees may enter material into the memory or storage of the device on a temporary basis for the purpose of making the determinations described above, and provided further that a tape, cassette or similar memory or storage medium prepared by such other persons may be utilized only for the purpose of conveying information to the NABET-CWA-represented employee who will make entry into the memory or storage, or to others for the purpose of making the determinations described above, but such tape, cassette or similar memory or storage medium will in no case be used for such entry or for use directly to air or for any
65
other purposes;* or
(ii)	may operate keyboard or other input devices for the purpose of creating, composing, or producing sophisticated, complicated or advanced graphic or scenic displays or effects, which require operation by a person with special knowledge of the subject matter, and where the proper artistic effect requires the operation of the keyboard or other input devices by such person and such person has been responsible for the creation of a similar type of product or effect by other than electronic means;
or
(iii)	may operate keyboards, or similar devices, to visually recall material stored in the memory or storage of the device or an associated computer for purposes of information.*
(iv)	may load and unload disc-packs or any other storage medium used in connection with the technical equipment described in this Section A2.2(b).
Further, other than employees may, on election night and during rehearsals for such night, feed information into computers, wherever located.
Where inputs to the memory or storage are received from an outside, non-Company information-gathering source (e.g., election returns), nothing in the Master Agreement will be deemed to require inputs to be entered by employees covered by this Agreement. In addition, any information which has been collected, input or processed in the memory of any computer system by any person not covered by the Master Agreement may be transferred, directly or indirectly, to any technical equipment.
If there are any instances in which the foregoing paragraph or the last paragraph of this Section creates a severe operational problem for the Company resulting in unanticipated hardships, the matter will be discussed with the Union and, if no satisfactory arrangement is made, the method of handling
The Company recognizes the need to allocate its operational facilities so as not to jeopardize production for broadcast; therefore, pursuant to this paragraph, when persons not covered by the Engineering Agreement operate technical equipment in areas where employees covered by the Agreement are regularly assigned to operate the same equipment, those persons not covered by the Agreement shall follow appropriate procedures to determine the availability of such equipment for their use (e.g., notifying the supervisor or member of management on duty, if any).
66
the matter will be subject to arbitration. The Company will provide opportunities for employees to improve their skills in the use of such devices in connection with the production of program material. This will include, but will not be limited to, on-the-job training and outside sources of instruction.
Individuals described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above may utilize the operating control of the devices described herein for the purposes of creating, activating or controlling still and/or motion displays, or for the purpose of changing displays during other than on-air performance. Such individuals may also utilize such operating control on-air if it is for their own performance. In addition, such individuals may operate the keyboard and/or operational controlling device(s) of any or all devices described herein for the purpose of completing his or her creation, composition, production or modification when such equipment is used in conjunction with any other device(s) described herein. Nothing in this Section A2.2(b) shall limit the operation of electronic character generators pursuant to Section A2.2(c) by other than employees covered by this Agreement.
(See Stipulation 21, page 213)
(c) Electronic storage devices (still or motion), electronic freehand display devices, or sophisticated still or motion electronic graphic display devices (e.g., Telestrator, Chyron and/or other character generators, Dubner and/or other animation devices, Quantel Paintboxes and/or other electronic palette devices, electronic pointers), as well as single combination devices incorporating the features of both character generators and such display devices, and input devices (including keyboard devices) used solely therewith, and memory and storage devices used solely therewith are technical equipment under this Agreement when used for broadcast, closed-circuit broadcast, rebroadcast, audition, rehearsal, recording, and/or "on-the-air" playback, and when used for such purposes, such devices shall be operated, maintained, and, to the extent heretofore, installed by employees hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than employees covered by this Agreement may operate such device or devices and any associated equipment (including, but not limited to, the associated probe, pen, brush and/or controlling mechanisms which are required to produce the effect the device is capable of producing, the keyboard or input address device, the framing and focusing controls of a camera fixed to a stand, any modems and/or other communications devices, and any associated switching/effects equipment), under the following conditions:
67
(i) An individual performing on-the-air live or during recording for broadcast, his or her rehearsal thereof or preparation therefor, may operate, in any area or location, the device or devices and any associated equipment; and
(ii> An individual creating, composing or producing graphic or scenic displays or effects for storage may operate, in any area or location, the device or devices, any associated equipment and any technical equipment, including, but not limited to, any cameras and videotape machines directly related to such creation, composition or production, and may load and unload disc-packs and any other storage medium used in connection with the technical equipment described in this Section A2.2(c).
Nothing herein shall prevent any person from obtaining, transmitting and receiving material to and from technical equipment, wherever located, including, but not limited to, visually recalling for purposes of information.
In the event a single combination device incorporating the features of both electronic character generators and electronic freehand display devices or sophisticated electronic graphic display devices is utilized, and only the character generator portion of such device is used to produce, compose or create the entire display or effect, the provisions of either Section A2.2(b) above or this Section A2.2(c), at the Company's option, shall apply.
The Company will provide opportunities for employees to improve their skills in the use of such devices in connection with the production of program material. This will include, but will not be limited to, on-the-job training and outside sources of instruction.
Individuals described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above may utilize the operating control of the devices described herein for the purposes of creating, activating or controlling still and/or motion displays, or for the purpose of changing displays during other than on-air performance. Such individuals may also utilize such operating control on-air if it is for their own performance. In addition, such individuals may operate the keyboard and/or operational controlling device(s) of any or all devices described herein for the purpose of completing his or her creation, composition, production or modification when such equipment is used in conjunction with any other device(s) described herein. Nothing in this Section A2.2(c) shall limit the operation of electronic character generators pursuant to Section
68
A2.2(b) by other than employees covered by this Agreement.
(See Stipulation 21, page 213)
(d)	A process control computer used to control the operation of technical equipment, as defined in Section A2.1 of the Engineering Agreement, shall fall within such definition of technical equipment. To the extent that such work has not been performed by employees covered by the Engineering Agreement, persons not covered by the Engineering Agreement may prepare information and/or instructions for insertion into such computer. In addition, persons not covered by the Engineering Agreement may physically prepare a punched tape, magnetic tape or other device for feeding information and/or instructions into a computer as described herein and may feed such information and/or instructions, the purpose of which is to control any operation to which a Technical Director would otherwise be assigned, into such a computer by using input devices operated in any area(s) or location(s). Equipment used to override such computer will be operated by employees covered by the Engineering Agreement.
Persons not covered by the Engineering Agreement may extract information from such computers by using devices which may be located and operated in any area or location.
Devices (including computer systems) which are not within the jurisdiction of the Engineering Agreement will not be brought into such jurisdiction simply because of the fact that such devices are used to feed information and/or instructions into and/or extract information from a process control computer under circumstances described in this Section A2.2(d).
A Technical Director Group 7 will be assigned to any process control computer that is controlling any operation to which a Technical Director would otherwise be assigned. In New York and Los Angeles, a Group 7, who will be paid Ten Dollars ($10.00) per week above the Group 7 scale, will be assigned to the television switching central operation whenever a process control computer is controlling on-air broadcast operations and other broadcast operations requiring switching; such assignment shall satisfy the requirement of the foregoing sentence for such operations. Nothing herein shall preclude "experts in computer programming" from operating input devices and computer controls located in technical areas for purposes of reprogramming the computer or otherwise adjusting the logic of the system. An "expert in computer programming," as the term is used above, shall include: (i) experts who are Company personnel (whose names have been furnished in advance to the Union); and (ii) experts who are not Company personnel.
69
The provisions of this Section and practices which may develop thereunder shall have no precedential or prejudicial effect on situations which do not involve the utilization of a process control computer for the purposes set forth in the first paragraph of this Section, nor shall the inclusion of any provision herein be construed as implying that it sets forth rights or obligations which either party does not otherwise have under the Master Agreement.
(e)	When NABET-CWA-represented Engineering employees are assigned using electronic cameras capable of being hand-held and associated equipment, the following shall be applicable:
1.	Staffing as to the number of employees will be as required.
2.	The first employee assigned will be a Technical Director whenever such a camera (a) is combined with and feeds a portable video tape recorder; or (b) is feeding to a studio or remote control point, but such employee is independently responsible for the camera unit and associated equipment, and is not under the direct supervision of a Technical Director at such studio or remote control point. If there are only two (2) employees assigned to a camera unit, and (a) or (b) above is applicable, then the second employee assigned shall be a Group 3. Video control work on the equipment referred to herein performed in a Company facility in preparation for an assignment covered by this Section A2.2(e) shall be performed by an employee who is a Group 5 or higher.
3.	In cases where a Technical Director must be assigned in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph 2(a) or (b) of this Section:
(i)	On news pickups in the field, other Company personnel may communicate with Engineering employees. The Company shall designate one (1) person on location who shall have ultimate authority for communicating programming instructions to Engineering personnel, if such instructions are not being communicated from a studio or other control point.
(ii)	News material gathered hereunder, live or taped, may be transmitted to a Company office for broadcast or taping through any available facility. Such transmittal will not be performed by a non-NABET-CWA NBC employee.
4.	(i) When the Company intends to cover a news story with electronic cameras capable of being hand-held, it may pool whatever lighting work is necessary for such coverage with any news and other information gathering company(ies) or
70
organization(s). The Company agrees to review promptly with the Union any claim that Engineering employees of the Company are not performing a reasonable proportion of such pool lighting work. When NBC is to supply the lighting under such arrangement, NABET-CWA-represented Engineering employees will be assigned to perform such work.
(ii)	The Engineering employees of the Company performing the pooled lighting assignment hereunder shall, upon request, perform for any of the other companies such additional or modified lighting work (including relocating and re-focusing of lights) as may be required by them for their special use (e.g., a "standupper" that takes place before, during or after the companies' general coverage of the story itself), but may perform such additional or modified lighting for such other companies only if such additional or modified lighting takes place in the same general area as the pooled lighting itself. Where the pooled lighting itself is in a room, the term "general area" shall include the same room or an immediately adjacent area.
(iii)	In situations when it is NBC's turn to provide pool lighting, if the Company should assign an engineer(s) specifically to the remote location in advance of the arrival of its crew in order to be responsible for the necessary pool lighting work, the classification of one (1) such engineer shall be Group 6. Except as provided for in the preceding sentence, the parties recognize that lighting for the pool can be assigned to the Engineering employees assigned to the crew in accordance with this Section A2.2(e).
(iv)	It is understood that on Presidential trips some lighting functions may be performed by non-Company personnel in connection with "lighting the President," as heretofore.
(v)	The foregoing subparagraphs are only, applicable to pickups of the type described in subparagraphs (i) and (iv), where camera coverage is handled on a unilateral basis by each network company, and it is therefore understood that technical work unrelated to lighting will not be affected by this Agreement.
(vi)	A record will be kept by the Company of each time it is determined in advance that a pool assignment will be made hereunder, and will show which company's employees were assigned to do the lighting work. The purpose is to assure an equitable distribution of the work performed hereunder. Such record shall be available to the Union.
71
(vii)	This paragraph 4 is limited to the situations described above. It is not intended to imply either the same or a different treatment in other situations. It will not be precedent for any assignments of work on any pickups except those specified herein, and neither this paragraph 4 nor any practice under it on any pickup covered by it, nor any practice preceding this paragraph 4 if it had been in effect on that date, will be cited in any case covering a different type of pickup. Specifically, not to be cited in any such case is the use of the lighting "pool" arrangement hereunder for pooling only part of the technical work involved in a particular pickup.
(viii)	On news pickups in the field not covered by (i) through (vii) above, Engineering employees assigned to the event in accordance with this Section A2.2(e) shall perform any lighting functions that are performed, unless the lighting is to be performed in a location where another union has contracted "house jurisdiction" over lighting functions which does not exclude electronic news pickups.* Further, when lights have already been set up by other film or tape crews at a place where the news story is to be covered, the pickup may be made without employees hereunder setting up lights if such other lights are sufficient for the pickup.
(It is the intent of the Company that the Engineering crew and their gear will normally be assigned to the site in such a manner that they will have time and equipment to do the lighting just as though no one else had done it.)
*(See Sideletter 7 on page 243)
5. Employees hired on a daily basis pursuant to Stipulations 18 and 19 shall be paid for each day so worked no less than a daily base rate of pay equal to one-fifth (1/5) of the applicable weekly wage scale set forth (at any step of the escalator) in the group classification in the wage provisions of Article A to which the employee is assigned. Daily employees may be assigned to work at such rate for any eight (8) consecutive hours within any twenty-four (24) consecutive hours, provided that for the hours referred to in Article X, such employees shall receive additional compensation as provided in that Article. Any work performed by such employees in excess of eight (8) hours in any day or forty (40) hours in any regular work week (as defined in Section 8.2) shall be paid as overtime at one and one-half (1-1/2) times the regular rate of pay hereunder in quarter (1/4) hour segments. In no case shall overtime accrue on overtime. In addition, any work performed by such employees on a holiday as defined in Sections 18.1 or 18.9 shall be compensated at a rate equal to one and one-half (1-1/2) times their straight
72
time rate of pay for all straight-time hours worked on any such holiday, and at a rate equal to two (2) times their straight-time rate of pay for all overtime hours worked on any such holiday. A day is defined as a calendar day. In addition, employees may be hired on a daily basis to work a minimum of four (4) hours on any day at a rate of pay equal to one-eighth (l/8th) of their daily base rate for each hour worked, and shall not be entitled to any meal period unless they work more than six (6) consecutive hours in any day. In the event that such employees are required to work more than six (6) hours, they shall be paid the full daily base rate.
Daily employees shall receive Fifty Dollars ($50.00) (increased to Fifty-Five Dollars ($55.00) effective January 1, 2003) a day in lieu of benefits except that a tour of twelve (12) hours or less which begins on one (1) calendar day and ends on another calendar day shall require only one (1) such payment. In the event the Company is required to cover dailyhire employees in any employee benefit program, the costs to the Company of providing such coverage shall be offset against such Fifty Dollars ($50.00). The amount to be offset to provide such coverage shall be determined by the Company's Vice-President, Labor Relations and the International President of the Union, or their designees. If they should fail to agree, the matter may be submitted to an Impartial Umpire by either party for determination of the appropriate amount to be offset.

Section A6.1
Only Engineering employees shall install, connect and operate the sound effects equipment of the Engineering Department of the Company and shall, to the extent that such work was previously performed by employees in jobs now under this Agreement, design, develop, construct, maintain, improve, repair, catalog, inventory and demonstrate sound effects equipment. Sound effects may be executed and put into the electronic system in any way.
An Engineering employee may perform other functions, in addition to sound effects functions, at any time. The excessive workload provisions of Section 8.9(c) shall be applicable to such assignment. The Company and the Union will expeditiously arbitrate any dispute involving a potentially excessive assignment.
Section A6.2 - Definition of Sound Effects
Sound effects are all those sounds (exclusive of live voice, live music, non-electronic sounds or non-mechanical sounds) used to create the illusions necessary in radio broadcasting and in television.
Section A6.3 - Television
In television broadcasting, sound effects may be either on or off the set. Sound effects on the set are effects in which the sound emanates from a set where the action on-camera is taking place. Sound effects off the set are effects where the sound emanates from a point other than a set where the action on-camera is taking place.
92
(a)	Sound effects off the set, which are executed off the set, shall be effected by an employee covered by this Agreement. The fact that the production of such sound effects must coincide with a visual effect which is produced by someone other than a covered employee shall not deprive such covered employee of his or her responsibility for installing, connecting and attending the sound effects equipment.
(b)	Sound effects off the set, which are mechanically or electrically executed from on the set, may be executed by a performer, if the operation is necessary to the action, timing, or portrayal of the performer's role, provided, however, that such effect may be executed only by the performer, while performing his or her role on the set. A covered employee shall, in this case, install, connect and attend the sound effects equipment.
(c)	Sound effects on the set, which are executed from off the set, shall be executed by an employee covered by this Agreement.
(d)	Sound effects on the set may be executed on the set by a performer, if the execution of this effect requires no props or only props on the set and is necessary to the action, timing or portrayal of the performer's role, provided, however, that such effect may be executed only by the performer, while performing his or her role on the set. An employee covered by this Agreement may, however, be called upon to produce such an effect. In the event that a performer operates sound effects equipment on the set, which is not physically contained by a stage property and which is not intended to be seen at any time in the broadcast picture, an employee covered by this Agreement shall install, connect and/or attend the equipment.
Section A6.4
In the event that Technical Employees are engaged by the Company within the area covered by this Agreement in the operation of new devices, any sound effects equipment used for that purpose shall be operated by employees covered by this Agreement.
Section A6.5
An employee covered by this Agreement need not be assigned to handle sound effects equipment and/or produce sound effects in connection with:
(a)	The broadcast of a production, or portion thereof, from a theatre, auditorium, or other similar place not owned or
93
operated by the Company if there is in effect as to such place a contract requiring the use of other than employees of the Company for the production of sound effects.
(b)	The production of certain sound effects which have traditionally been made in the theatre, vaudeville, or radio by musicians, actors or singers.
(c)	The demonstration of sound effects to tourists in any office of the Company.
Section A6.6
The Company may deduct from the salary of an employee an amount equal to (i) the number of hours, if any, computed to the nearest quarter (1/4) hour, during which the employee performed work for the production of electrical transcriptions, recordings and other means for mechanical reproduction, now or hereafter devised or perfected, which are covered by the AFTRA National Code of Fair Practice for Transcriptions and Recording for Radio Broadcasting Purposes and for which the employee receives fees thereunder, (ii) times the salary of the employee computed on an hourly basis.
Section A6.7 - Musical Recordings - Sound Effects
In Chicago, musical recordings, especially those used as musical signatures, bridges, background where no illusion of musicians playing is intended, and musical numbers in whole or in part where the emphasis is on the music rather than on any dramatic connotation, will be handled the same as heretofore.

Under no circumstances shall this seventh (7th) hour meal period be pre-scheduled.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any employees who are assigned for the majority of their tour to perform any job functions associated with editing may not receive a scheduled meal period, but shall be given an opportunity to eat during the workday. Such employees shall receive a flat payment, in addition to their regular compensation, of Forty Dollars ($40.00) per day for each such day.

PRODUCERS
Section H8.1
(a)	Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require that a Producer (i.e., a Newswriter assigned as Producer or any other person assigned as Producer) must be assigned to each program, nor shall anything contained herein be deemed in any way to confer on members of the bargaining unit jurisdiction over producing news programs, or producing elements, portions, segments, inserts, stories or pieces for such programs.
(b)	In no event will a producer upgrade be required for producing elements, portions, segments, inserts, stories or pieces of such programs.
SIDELETTER H-l
Notwithstanding any provision of the Master Agreement or any other agreements, grievance settlements, arbitration awards or past practice to the contrary, NABET-CWA-represented staff Newswriters on the payroll as of December 7, 1995 will not be required to convert to non-unit status to retain their current positions (e.g., Nightly News Broadcast Producer or 6 o'clock Producer) . However, in the event of reassignment of current NABET-CWA-represented staff Producers (of shows) in Local News and Senior Producers in Local and Network News (as those Producer positions are generally understood in the Industry) within such positions, all of which require the exercise of
124
managerial and/or supervisory authority, said Newswriters may be required to covert to non-unit status, but only if they applied for or requested such reassignment.
Furthermore, except for such positions as Producer (of shows) in Local News and Senior Producer in Local and Network News which require the exercise of managerial and/or supervisory authority, NABET-CWA-represented staff Newswriters will not be required to convert to non-unit status as a condition for selection for positions to which Newswriters have been traditionally or customarily assigned. Neither the Company nor the Union shall exert any undue influence upon any Newswriters who are considering whether to convert to non-unit status. Moreover, nothing herein shall affect the Company's right of employee selection or to make work assignments.
While no Newswriter will be guaranteed a specific work assignment, it is the Company's objective to use the journalistic skills, abilities and experience of members of the bargaining unit. In furtherance of that objective, the Company will continue to make reasonable efforts to provide a range of assignments for the unit as a whole which reflects the variety of duties which have been .traditionally and customarily performed by television Newswriters in the unit.
At any time during the term of the Agreement, the Union may grieve in accordance with Article XX the lack of reasonableness of the Company's efforts hereunder in an arbitration before the Impartial Umpire. However, to prevail in such proceeding, the Union must prove that, over a period of at least six (6) months, the Company has not made a range of assignments to unit personnel which reflects the variety of duties that have been traditionally and customarily performed by television Newswriters in the unit. If the Union meets this burden, the Umpire may only direct the Company to comply with the "reasonable efforts" standard contained in this Sideletter as a remedy for the first violation.
SIDELETTER H-2
With respect to persons employed as regular staff employees in the Chicago Newswriters unit as of November 5, 1984, whose jobs may be eliminated because of the use of a computerized newsroom system, the Company agrees to make a good-faith effort to find other positions in Chicago; provided, however, that the decision of the Company with respect to each such application shall not be subject to arbitration. This shall not be construed, however, as indicating any commitment to secure another position for any such employee.
125
SIDELETTER H-3
Notwithstanding any provision of the Master Agreement or any other agreements, grievance settlements, arbitration awards or past practice to the contrary, management or supervisory personnel may perform any work in connection with teases and auditions.
SIDELETTER H-4
This Sideletter applies to regular NABET-CWA-represented staff Newswriters under the H Contract. The parties recognize that the continued employment of such employees could be affected by changes in this contract made during the 1994 negotiations. Accordingly, it is agreed as follows:
The Company shall give consideration for daily employment as a Newswriter to any laid-off H Contract employee with recall rights in the H bargaining unit who notifies the Company at the time of the layoff, and each six (6) months thereafter, that he or she desires to work on a daily basis in that unit, provided that any such employee (s), in the sole discretion of the Company, possesses the skills and abilities necessary to do the specific work involved. Any disputes regarding this paragraph shall be subject to the procedure set forth in paragraph 5 of Sideletter 32.
SIDELETTER H-5
Notwithstanding any provision of the Master Agreement or any other agreements, grievance settlements, arbitration awards or past practice to the contrary, any person may perform any of the duties previously performed by Desk Assistants.
(The Award in NC88-4 is null and void and of no further force and effect.)

PRODUCERS
Section H8.1
(a)	Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require that a Producer (i.e., a Newswriter assigned as Producer or any other person assigned as Producer) must be assigned to each program, nor shall anything contained herein be deemed in any way to confer on members of the bargaining unit jurisdiction over producing news programs, or producing elements, portions, segments, inserts, stories or pieces for such programs.

SIDELETTER H-l
Notwithstanding any provision of the Master Agreement or any other agreements, grievance settlements, arbitration awards or past practice to the contrary, NABET-CWA-represented staff Newswriters on the payroll as of December 7, 1995 will not be required to convert to non-unit status to retain their current positions (e.g., Nightly News Broadcast Producer or 6 o'clock Producer). However, in the event of reassignment of current NABET-CWA-represented staff Producers (of shows) in Local News and Senior Producers in Local and Network News (as those Producer positions are generally understood in the Industry) within such positions, all of which require the exercise of
124
managerial and/or supervisory authority, said Newswriters may be required to covert to non-unit status, but only if they applied for or requested such reassignment.
Furthermore, except for such positions as Producer (of shows) in Local News and Senior Producer in Local and Network News which require the exercise of managerial and/or supervisory authority, NABET-CWA-represented staff Newswriters will not be required to convert to non-unit status as a condition for selection for positions to which Newswriters have been traditionally or customarily assigned. Neither the Company nor the Union shall exert any undue influence upon any Newswriters, who are considering whether to convert to non-unit status. Moreover, nothing herein shall affect the Company's right of employee selection or to make work assignments.
While no Newswriter will be guaranteed a specific work assignment, it is the Company's objective to use the journalistic skills, abilities and experience of members of the bargaining unit. In furtherance of that objective, the Company will continue to make reasonable efforts to provide a range of assignments for the unit as a whole which reflects the variety of duties which have been traditionally and customarily performed by television Newswriters in the unit.
At any time during the term of the Agreement, the Union may grieve in accordance with Article XX the lack of reasonableness of the Company's efforts hereunder in an arbitration before the Impartial Umpire. However, to prevail in such proceeding, the Union must prove that, over a period of at least six (6) months, the Company has not made a range of assignments to unit personnel which reflects the variety of duties that have been traditionally and customarily performed by television Newswriters in the unit. If the Union meets this burden, the Umpire may only direct the Company to comply with the "reasonable efforts* standard contained in this Sideletter as a remedy for the first violation.
SIDELETTER H-2
With respect to persons employed as regular staff employees in the Chicago Newswriters unit as of November 5, 1984, whose jobs may be eliminated because of the use of a computerized newsroom system, the Company agrees to make a good-faith effort to find other positions in Chicago; provided, however, that the decision of the Company with respect to each such application shall not be subject to arbitration. This shall not be construed, however, as indicating any commitment to secure another position for any such employee.

Section M7,2
Whenever layoffs of employees occur under Section 11.6 that may affect an employee who is then currently assigned to a series of sponsored programs, NABET-CWA will in good faith consider and discuss with the Company any request for a waiver of the provisions of Section 11.6 to the extent necessary to enable the Company to continue the assignment of such employee to said series of sponsored programs.
Section M7.3

The number of employees to be protected shall be rounded upward to the nearest whole number, but shall in no event be less than one (1). Prior to each layoff, the Company shall notify the Union of the names of the employees who are to be protected from that layoff. The Company's decisions regarding protection from layoff may not be arbitrated.

In the event, however, that the Company's layoff decision is challenged in any forum or before any tribunal, and the layoff is sustained, no additional severance shall be payable and any additional severance that has already been paid shall be due and owing to the Company.
(c)	Section 11.6(a) and (b) shall not be applicable to employees covered by Contract M.

ARTICLE M-X
UPGRADING OF EDITORIAL ASSISTANTS
Section M10.1
(a)	The Company and the Union recognize the desirability of establishing opportunities for Editorial Assistants to obtain training in duties ordinarily performed by Newswriters. This may include the rotation of assignments to different units of operations. It is understood, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to promote Editorial Assistants to regular Newswriter positions, except as may be required by the upgrading provisions set forth below.
(b)	As part of their training, Editorial Assistants may . perform limited Newswriter duties of a routine nature.
In addition, an Editorial Assistant may be assigned to write individual items of greater importance, so that he or she may gain experience and be given instruction and , criticism.
(c)	The duties set forth in the paragraph above may be performed by Editorial Assistants without upgrading. However, if the Union believes that such additional assignments are being misused to the extent that an
154
Editorial Assistant is regularly performing the general functions of a Newswriter, the Company, after due notice from the Union, will discontinue such practice with regard to such Editorial Assistant, unless when such functions are performed, the Editorial Assistant is upgraded in accordance with the provisions below.
(d)	An Editorial Assistant who is temporarily transferred to a Newswriter position shall be paid during the period of the transfer for not less than a full tour of duty, except that such upgrading shall not apply to meal period or personal relief unless such relief exceeds- two (2) hours in that tour.
.(e) Regular Editorial Assistants in the employ of the Company as Editorial Assistants as of November 10, 1984, who are upgraded for a total of more than seventy-eight (78) weeks, not necessarily consecutive, shall be given the first available regular Newswriter position.
Such Editorial Assistants who are upgraded for more than fifty-two (52) weeks will be given at least one (1) written evaluation of their performance as a Newswriter. It is not the intent of the Company to schedule for the purpose of deliberately 'avoiding giving such an Editorial Assistant a Newswriter classification on a regular basis.
(f)	An Editorial Assistant who is temporarily transferred to a Newswriter position shall be paid the applicable Newswriter rate equal to or next above his or her salary at the time of transfer.	.	.
(g)	An Editorial Assistant who has been upgraded to a Newswriter position on a permanent basis shall, for a period of one (1) year after such upgrading, retain the Unit Seniority of his or her Editorial' Assistant classification, and the Unit Seniority acquired in the Newswriters classification shall be added to'that of the Editorial Assistant classification for* the purposes of determining his or her Unit Seniority within the lower grade. In the event of a layoff, in the Newswriter classification, such an Editorial Assistant who may be affected because of lack of Unit Seniority in the Newswriter classification shall have the right to transfer on the basis of .Unit Seniority to the Editorial Assistant classification at the maximum rate provided therefor. It is understood that this procedure may require the layoff of another Editorial Assistant with less Unit Seniority. After a period of one (1) year in a regular Newswriter position, however, such "bumping" right.shall- not be available to the Editorial Assistant,
155
and he or she shall have only the Unit Seniority obtained in the Newswriter classification.
(h)	In filling News or News Special Events Writer vacancies, the Company will give consideration to Editorial Assistants who apply to fill such vacancies.
ARTICLE M-XI
TEMPORARY
Section Mil.1
Editorial Assistants employed by the Company after November 10, 1984 will be employed for a maximum period of eighteen (18) months and shall be deemed temporary employees. Temporary employees may be discharged or laid off in the sole discretion of the Company.

Such temporary Editorial Assistants who have been upgraded to Newswriter for more than sixty (60) days subsequent to January 1, 1985 will receive at least one (1) written evaluation of their performance as a Newswriter.
All temporary Editorial Assistants shall be entitled to one (1) day of vacation pay for each thirty (30) calendar days of temporary service during that year, or to the equivalent time off with pay by mutual consent of the Company and employee, in lieu of the provisions of Article XIX.
Sections 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, Article XIV, Article XV, Article XIX, and Stipulation 22 shall not apply to such temporary Editorial Assistants.
ARTICLE M-XII
(RESERVED)
ARTICLE M-XIII PART-TIME EMPLOYEES
Section M13.1

rate of (see Wage Schedule in M3.1) per hour. Such employees shall normally be employed for no more than twenty (20) hours per week. Articles VIII, X, XI, XIV, XV, XVIII, XIX, XXII, and XXIII shall not be applicable to such employees.

SIDELETTER M-l
Notwithstanding any provision of the Master Agreement or any other agreements, grievance settlements, arbitration awards or past practice to the contrary, NABET-CWA-represented staff Newswriters on the payroll as of June 13, 1996 will not be required to convert to non-unit status to retain their current positions (e.g., Nightly News Broadcast Producer or 6 o'clock Producer). However, in the event of reassignment of current NABET-CWA-represented staff Producers (of shows) in Local News and Senior Producers in Local and Network News (as those Producer positions are generally understood in the Industry) within such positions, all of which require the exercise of managerial and/or supervisory authority, said Newswriters may be required to convert to non-unit status, but only if they applied for or requested such reassignment.
Furthermore, except for such positions as Producer (of shows) in Local News and Senior Producer in Local and Network News which require the exercise of managerial and/or supervisory authority, NABET-CWA-represented staff Newswriters will not be required to convert to non-unit status as a condition for selection for positions to which Newswriters have been traditionally or customarily assigned. Neither the Company nor the Union shall exert any undue influence upon any Newswriters who are considering whether to convert to non-unit status. Moreover, nothing herein shall affect the Company's right of employee selection or to make work assignments.
While no Newswriter will be guaranteed a specific work assignment, it is the Company's objective to use the
157
journalistic skills, abilities and experience of members of the bargaining unit. In furtherance of that objective, the Company will continue to make reasonable efforts to provide a range of assignments for the unit as a whole which reflects the variety of duties which have been traditionally and customarily performed by the television Newswriters'in the unit.
At any time during the term of the Agreement, the Union may grieve in accordance with Article XX the lack of reasonableness of the Company's efforts hereunder in an arbitration before the Impartial Umpire. However, to prevail in such proceeding, the Union must prove that, over a period of at least six (6) months, the Company has not made a range of assignments to unit personnel which reflects the variety of duties that have been traditionally and customarily performed by television Newswriters in the unit. If the Union meets this burden, the Umpire may only direct the Company to comply with the "reasonable efforts" standard contained in this Sideletter as a remedy for the first violation.
SIDELETTER M-2
With respect to persons employed as regular staff employees in the Los Angeles Newswriters Unit as of November 5, 1984, whose jobs may be eliminated because of the use of a computerized newsroom system, the Company agrees to make a good-faith effort to find other positions in Los Angeles; provided, however, that the decision of the Company with respect to each such application shall not be subject to arbitration. This shall not be construed, however, as indicating any commitment to secure another position for any such employee.
SIDELETTER M-3
Notwithstanding any provision of the Master Agreement or any other agreements, grievance settlements, arbitration awards or past practice to the contrary, management or supervisory personnel may perform any work in connection with teases and auditions.
SIDELETTER M-4
Notwithstanding any provision of the Master Agreement or any other agreements, grievance settlements, arbitration awards or past practice to the contrary, any person may perform any Editorial Assistant duties.
158
SIDELETTER M-5
This Sideletter applies to regular NABET-CWA-represented staff Newswriters, and to Editorial Assistants employed by the Company prior to November 10, 1984 (hereafter, for purposes of this Sideletter only, included under the term "Newswriters"), under the M Contract. The parties recognize that the continued employment of such employees could be affected by the changes in this contract made during the 1994 negotiations. Accordingly, it is agreed as follows:
■» The Company shall give. consideration for daily employment as a Newswriter to any laid-off M Contract employee with recall rights in the M bargaining unit who notifies the Company at the time of the layoff, and each six (6) months thereafter, that he or she desires to work on a daily basis in that unit, provided that any such employee (s) , in the sole discretion of the Company, possesses the skills and abilities necessary to do the specific work involved. Any disputes regarding this paragraph shall be subject to the procedure set forth in paragraph 5 of Sideletter 32,

(b)	If a layoff shall involve regular employees, such layoff shall proceed in inverse order of Unit Seniority; provided, however, that the Company may, starting from the bottom'of the seniority list for each layoff, protect up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the employees in the unit-, irrespective of their seniority.	The number of
employees to be protected shall be rounded upward to the nearest whole number, but shall in no event be less than one (1). Prior to each layoff, the Company shall notify the Union of the names of the employees who are to be protected from that layoff.

The first paragraph of Stipulation‘12(1), -12(3), and any other relevant provisions of Stipulation 12-and‘of the other Stipulations shall also be applicable to such employees.
: ‘	SIDELETTER-N-l
With respect to persons employed as regular staff employees in the New York Newswriters Unit as of November 5, 1984, whose jobs may be eliminated because of the use of a computerized newsroom system, the Company agrees to make a good-faith effort to find other positions in New York; provided, however, that the decision of the Company with respect to each such application shall not be subject to arbitration. This shall not be construed, however, as'indicating any commitment to secure another position for any such employee.
SIDELETTER N-2
Notwithstanding any provision of the Master Agreement or any other agreements, grievance settlements, arbitration awards or past practice to the .contrary, NABET-CWA-represented staff Newswriters'on the payroll as of December 7, 1995 will not be required to convert to non-unit status to retain their current positions (e.g., Nightly News Broadcast Producer or 6 o'clock Producer). However, in the event of reassignment of current NABET-CWA-represented-'staff Producers (of shows) in Local News and Senior Producers in ♦ Local and Network News’ (as those Producer positions are generally understood in the Industry) within such positions’, all of which require the exercise of managerial and/or"supervisory authority, said Newswriters may be required- to convert to non-unit status, but only if they applied for or requested such reassignment.
Furthermore, .except for such positions as Producer (of shows) in Local News and Senior Producer in Local and Network News which require the exercise of managerial and/or supervisory authority, NABET-CWA-represented staff Newswriters will not be required to convert to non-unit status as a condition for
174
selection for positions to which Newswriters have been traditionally or customarily assigned. Neither the Company nor the Union shall exert any undue influence upon any Newswriters who are considering whether to convert to non-unit status. Moreover, nothing herein shall affect the Company's right of employee selection or to make work assignments.
While no Newswriter will be guaranteed a specific work assignment, it- is the Company's objective to use the journalistic skills, abilities and experience of members of the bargaining unit. In furtherance of that objective, the Company will continue to make reasonable efforts to provide a range of assignments for the unit as a whole which reflects the variety of duties which have been traditionally and customarily performed by the television Newswriters in the unit.
At any time during the term of the Agreement, the Union may grieve in accordance with Article XX the lack of reasonableness of the Company's efforts hereunder in an arbitration before the Impartial Umpire. However, to prevail in such proceeding, the Union must prove that, over a period of at least six (6) months, the Company has not made a range of assignments to unit personnel which reflects the variety of duties that have been traditionally and customarily performed by television Newswriters in the unit. If the Union meets this Lburden, the Umpire may only direct the Company to comply with the "reasonable efforts" standard contained in this Sideletter as a remedy for the first violation,
SIDELETTER N-3
This Sideletter applies to regular NABET-CWA-represented staff Newswriters under the N Contract. The parties recognize that the continued employment of such employees could be affected by changes in this contract made during the 1994 negotiations. Accordingly, it is agreed as follows:
The Company shall give consideration for daily employment as a Newswriter to any laid-off N Contract employee with recall rights in the N bargaining unit who notifies the Company at the time of the layoff, and each six (6) months thereafter, that he or she desires to work on a daily basis in that unit, provided that any such employee(s), in the sole discretion of the Company, possesses the skills and abilities necessary to do the specific work involved. Any disputes regarding this paragraph shall be subject to the procedure set forth in paragraph 5 of Sideletter 32.

SCOPE OF UNIT
Section Ul.1
The term "employees" as used in this Agreement applies to the Couriers in Network News and in WNBC-TV's News Department.
ARTICLE U-II
DUTIES
Section U2.1
The duties of employees under this Agreement shall be, as heretofore (1982-1986), the pickup, transportation and delivery of news material (film and tape), from the field, recorded by network and local news crews of the Company for network and local news programs, and the pickup from and/or delivery of any such material to airports. In addition to the foregoing, employees shall henceforth be assigned to so-called film lab work, but only when it is in connection with the sale of Company-owned film and/or tape and then only when the Company, in its sole discretion, arranges for the pick up and/or delivery of film and/or tape to be done by it rather than by or through its clients or customers.
Employees may also be assigned to handle, move and transport technical or other equipment, to perform various errands and any kind of messenger service and to move any Company or other personnel, all in the absolute discretion of the Company. It is not the intention of the Company to regularly assign employees to errands which would be reasonably considered as menial or, except when done in support of EJ news coverage on the Company's premises, to assign employees to handle, move and transport technical equipment on said premises. It is expressly understood that any understandings or arrangements with respect to the handling, moving and transporting of technical equipment by employees under this Agreement does not apply to the driving of mobile units and, in any event, such understandings or arrangements may not affect or change whatever Engineering jurisdiction exists with respect to any such work outside the New York office and extends only to employees under this Agreement. If, as a result of an express
written cancellation or modification of this Agreement with respect to the handling, moving and transporting of technical equipment, or the elimination of "heretofore" jurisdiction hereunder, the Company seeks to assign non-unit personnel to such work, exclusive jurisdiction over such work shall revert to New York engineers under the "A" Contract to the extent that such jurisdiction existed as of the date of ratification of the 1987-1990 Master Agreement and was thereafter granted to employees under this Agreement.
The Company may satisfy the numerical equivalent of its "heretofore" obligation under this Agreement by assignments totally under the first paragraph of this Section, or by assignments totally under the second paragraph of this Section, or by any combination of assignments under either paragraph, provided that, with respect to assignments made under the second paragraph, such assignments are of a duration substantially similar to assignments under the first paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, assignments to handle, move and transport technical or other equipment, or to move any Company or other personnel, or to make airport or film lab pickups and/or deliveries shall be deemed to be the equivalent of assignments under the first paragraph irrespective of their duration.
In the event that employees who were on staff as of February 13, 1988 terminate or are terminated,' for any reason, the Company need not replace them and, whether or not said employees are replaced, there shall be a proportional reduction of jurisdiction under this Agreement, so that as each of' the ten (10) staff employees leaves the employ of the Company such jurisdiction shall be reduced by one-tenth (1 /10 th) of the percentage that i t had been under the "heretofore" clause on said ratification date. It is expressly understood that no such proportional reduction of jurisdiction shall occur in the event of a layoff until the laid-off employee's recall rights have expired either pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or by any other legitimate means...
Except as expressly set forth above, it is understood that the foregoing shall not affect or change any existing jurisdictional provisions of other NABET-CWA-represented employees.

In addition, computers, monitors, and other technical equipment associated therewith, all of which are located at the New York and Burbank offices of the Company and which are used as the control points of the Skypath™ System shall be deemed technical equipment and when so used shall be operated and maintained by NABET-CWA-represented employees, except that any equipment, technical or otherwise, being maintained by the Harris corporation pursuant to the Comsat General/NBC service agreement for the Skypath™ System shall continue to be so maintained.
In the event that the Company is prohibited and/or prevented from maintaining and/or repairing a particular piece of equipment, technical or otherwise, by a renewal of the Comsat General (service provider)/NBC service agreement or by a service agreement analogous to the Comsat General/NBC agreement, for proprietary reasons, then the service provider or its representative may perform such maintenance and/or repair to the extent that the Company is not allowed to do so. At the request of the Union, proof of the service provider's refusal to permit the Company to perform the work involved will be supplied by the Company to the Union.
When maintenance, as outlined above, is performed by nonCompany personnel in the New York and Burbank Skypath™ control rooms on equipment within NABET-CWA’s
221
jurisdiction, at least one (1) NABET-CWA-represented engineer will be present.

"Personnel who are expert in Satellite Network Management Systems," as the term is used above, shall include: (i) Company personnel (whose names have been furnished in advance to the Union) , and (ii) experts who are not Company personnel.
In addition, nothing herein nor any provision of the Master Agreement nor any practice thereunder shall prohibit NBC Engineering management personnel from operating any of the aforesaid technical equipment when it is done to guarantee the integrity of the Skypath™ System in the event of unexpected, unusual workloads, program outages, or any other unforeseen, unexpected or irregular circumstance, beyond the reasonable control of the Company, which calls for expeditious corrective or preventive action. The intention of the parties during the above situations is to allow NBC Engineering management personnel to temporarily perform work normally within NABET-CWA's operational jurisdiction and not to replace NABET-CWA-represented engineers.
All employees assigned to operate any of the technical equipment which is located at the control points of the Skypath™ System shall receive the wage classification of Group 7 A (i.e., Ten Dollars [$10.00] above the Group 7 pay grade).
222
When an Engineering employee operates the satellite uplink equipment contained in a satellite newsgathering vehicle or transportable satellite equipment, when either is used for uplink, such employee shall be upgraded to Group 5 or higher. The provisions of Section 12.3(c) shall not be applicable to upgrades pursuant to this Stipulation 28.
Nothing herein shall prejudice the contractual position of either party as to whether or not the Master Agreement covers services or work performed in connection with or relating to any direct-delivery satellite or direct-delivery ‘satellite-related transmission and/or relay system.

(c)	Whenever video tape editing requires the use of a computer-controlled edit system and a sophisticated switcher with special effects equipment (e.g., GVG 200, GVG 300), the Video Tape Engineer will be upgraded to Group 8 for any tour involving such use of that equipment.
d)	In Los Angeles and New York, when an Assistant Editor is assigned and performs sophisticated and complex audio functions, he or she will be upgraded to Group 5 for the day in accordance with the existing practices in those offices. In Chicago and Washington, if such audio functions are anticipated, the parties will meet to discuss the particular
233
circumstances, and the Company will not unreasonably deny the Group 5 upgrade.
5.	(a) It is recognized by both parties that employees
editing under this agreement have unique talents and skills, and that they are expected to make significant artistic contributions to the program material which they edit; however, employees covered by this agreement shall at no time be responsible for the editorial content of program material which they edit. Employees who are assigned to the recording of incoming feeds may be required to make brief notes of significant events to facilitate the subsequent editing of that material.
(b) Employees shall, at the direction of the person(s) taking editorial or creative responsibility, work alone, and may be required to make adequate notes on the substance of any material to facilitate any subsequent editing.
6.	Tape Library - Flow;
(a)	A Video Tape Engineer, Group 5 (except a Group 6 in New York and Los Angeles), will be assigned five (5) days per week, one (1) tour per day to each Video Tape Library (such as EJ Local when a separate departmental Library, EJ [Local and Network) when one (1) separate departmental Library, Production when a separate departmental Library, etc.) which exists as of February 9, 1991. To the extent delegated by appropriate management, he or she may direct and coordinate the activities of other employees in each such Video Tape Library and may be responsible for the shipping, receiving and in-house handling of all video tapes.
(b)	Those persons assigned to the video Tape Library may perform machine operating functions in relation to video tape for archival purposes (e.g.-, assembling, dubbing, copying, degaussing, timing, inspecting and previewing of video tape so that the tape will be suitable for cataloguing, storage or reuse). Such persons may be assigned to perform any other video tape functions if appropriately upgraded.
7.	Rest Periods:
Engineers assigned hereunder will receive a reasonable rest period which may be scheduled.
234
8.	Labels with a NABET seal (a NABET-CWA seal when the current supply of labels runs out) will be applied to tape reels, reel containers, field cassettes and electronic count-down devices.
9.	Air Credits:
Whenever air credits are given on a taped program to personnel covered by the Engineering Agreement, other than the Technical Director, an air credit will also be given to the Video Tape Engineer who edited such program. Such credit may be given on the same frame containing credits for other technical personnel. In no case will credit have to be given to the Video Tape Engineer where circumstances make the giving of such credit impractical, e.g. , where the credit crawl was completed prior to the assignment of the Video Tape Engineer to the program.
10.	Training:
An engineer assigned to any video tape operation shall be given an adequate opportunity to adjust to his or her new duties and shall receive individual training if necessary. A conscientious, good-faith effort shall be made to provide engineers with appropriate training.
11.	At and enroute to or from a field location, non-Company personnel who normally perform such work may move, transport and deliver editing equipment. Normally, the Company shall make such arrangements, but if they are not made, an engineer hereunder is authorized to do so, and shall make arrangements exercising prudent judgment. Nothing in this paragraph 11 shall prejudice the parties' contractual positions with respect to the movement, transportation or placement of technical equipment.
12.	The following applies to Engineering employees covered by the Master Agreement assigned to editing assignments in the field, when not reporting to a Group 7 or 8:
(a)	In the event that one (1) employee is assigned, he or-she shall be a Group 6.
(b)	If two (2) or more employees are assigned to the same location at the same time, for a single editing package, the first employee shall be a Group 6 and any additional employees shall be Group 3's. Where more than one edit package is utilized at the same location, the first employee shall be a Group 7, additional editors shall be Group 5' s, and additional employees may be Group 3's. The Group
235
6's and 7's referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) may be operational.
(c)	Group 6, 7 or 8 employees will work, separately from and not be under the supervision of the A2.2(e) T.D. or the T.D. at any office. Such Group 6, 7 or 8 employees may supervise any other engineers who are assigned to editing sessions. Other than NABET-CWA-represented employees may instruct and/or direct such Group 6, 7 or 8 employees.
(d)	The provisions of Paragraph 4 ("Editing Upgrades") shall apply to field assignments.
13.	All Local Agreements prior to November 10, 1984 covering video tape operations are cancelled, except for upgrades already received by virtue of such Agreements. In any location where certain employees were being upgraded prior to November 10, 1984, on a temporary basis to Group 5 at the flat rate of pay, those particular employees, if temporarily upgraded in the future, will continue to receive the top rate of pay for Group 5, notwithstanding the creation of a Group 5 escalator.

SIDELETTER 1
The Union recognizes that the broadcasting industry is undergoing significant technological changes and improvements , and gives the assurance that it will not prevent or impede such progress. The Company recognizes that employment of ^individuals covered under the Engineering Agreement, who have attained long years of service, may be affected by the new methods of operation. To this end, it is agreed that a special severance allowance will be paid to employees covered by the aforesaid Agreement, having three (3) years or more of Unit Seniority, who are laid off due to reduction in force, as follows:
	Amount of Special
Years of Unit Seniority	Severance Allowance
3-5 years 5-10 years 10 years and over	$1,750.00 3,250.00 4,000.00
Such special severance allowance shall be in addition to the severance pay provided for in Section 15.1 of the Master Agreement, and shall be disbursed in installments of $100.00 per week starting with the termination of the severance pay period as set forth in Section 15.1 (e.g., an employee with three (3) years of Unit Seniority who is laid off shall receive $100.00 at the start of the fifth (5th) week after he or she is laid-off). Payment of the special severance allowance, however, is subject to the following qualifications and limitations:
(1)	If the employee is recalled for employment prior to the end of the severance pay period as set forth in Section 15.1, and he or she accepts such recall, the special severance allowance shall not be payable; if the employee refuses such recall, no special severance allowance shall be payable.
(2)	If the employee is recalled for employment prior to the end of the special severance allowance period, and he or she accepts such recall, the special severance allowance installments shall cease as of the time of such recall. If the employee refuses such recall, the special severance allowance installments shall cease as of the time of such refusal; however, if the job for which the employee is recalled is specified as for a period equal to or less than the unused portion of the employee's special severance allowance period, he or she may refuse the
239
recall and still be entitled to the remaining portion of the special severance allowance installments.
(3)	If the employee at the time of lay off or at any time within the severance pay period accepts a position in another department of the Company at a rate not more than twenty percent (20%) below the rate of his or her last position, he or she shall not be entitled to the special severance allowance unless he or she is subsequently laid off in the new position before he or she has completed six (6) months of service.
(4)	Where an employee has received the total special severance allowance to which he or she is entitled and is reemployed at any time thereafter, he or she shall not be entitled to a second special severance allowance unless, subsequent to his or her reemployment, he or she accumulates sufficient years seniority to qualify the employee for another special severance allowance and is laid off. Service prior to his or her reemployment shall in no event be counted for this purpose.
(5)	Where an employee has received a portion of the total special severance allowance to which he or she is entitled and is reemployed at any time thereafter, the employee shall be entitled to the unused portion of his or her special severance allowance upon layoff subsequent to the employee's reemployment, plus a second special severance allowance if he or she accumulates sufficient years' seniority, subsequent to his or her reemployment, to qualify the employee for the special severance allowance. Service prior to the employee's reemployment shall in no event be counted for this purpose.
The Company will endeavor to find other positions within its organization for employees having three (3) years or more of Unit Seniority who are scheduled to be laid off, and will provide such employees, where possible, time off to be interviewed for positions outside the Company during their regularly scheduled work day.
SIDELETTER 2
The Union confirms the Company's interpretation on the following:

240
(b)	The Company has the right to negotiate personal service contracts with better terms than the Master Agreement without Union involvement. Moreover, the Fifty Dollars ($50) per day required to be paid pursuant to Sideletter 32 and/or Stipulation 22 to an employee covered by a personal services agreement may be credited against any bonus or other compensation included in such agreement which was intended to cover such Fifty dollars ($50) per day.

(g)	Sideletter 40 applies in situations where the Company at one time had the right to determine the technical crew and did not retain it.
(h)	With respect to automation systems, the Company may assign NABET-CWA-represented employees or persons not covered by the Master Agreement to input data or instructions into a computer system for the purpose of,	including, but not limited to,

241
SIDELETTER 3
The following represents the understanding between the Company and Union regarding Section 7.1(i) and Section A2.3(b)(7) of the Master Agreement:
In the event that the Union alleges that the Company is utilizing the provisions of either or both of the aforesaid Sections in such a manner as to cause the Union to believe that a substantial threat to employment has been created by such utilization of the provisions, the Union may, upon notice to the Company, refer the matter to a Joint Study Committee to be comprised of two (2) Company and two (2) Union representatives and the Impartial Umpire acting as mediator. The Company may designate as one (1) of its representatives a representative of ABC.
Such Committee shall meet for the purpose of discussing and attempting resolution of the alleged problem. Any resolution thereof shall remain in effect and govern the application of such clause during the balance of the term of the Master Agreement.
SIDELETTER 4
It is agreed that all written stipulations, sideletters and other written agreements entered into between the National Broadcasting Company, Inc. and the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, AFL-CIO, during the period from April 1, 1987 to March 31, 2002 will be deemed to be in effect for the period of the current contract. This will not apply to stipulations, sideletters and other agreements which the parties have specifically cancelled or which are modified by provisions of the current contract.
SIDELETTER 5
The deletion of the News Insert Sideletter was occasioned by clarifications of and other changes in the Union's jurisdiction under the Master Agreement made during the 1990 negotiations. As a result of these clarifications and changes, it is understood and agreed that the Company may accept for broadcast, without limitation, live and/or taped outside-produced program material, portions of programs (live inserts or segments of any length) or entire programs. This includes material supplied by any news and other informationgathering organizations.
For example, in addition to entire outside-produced programs, the Company may broadcast within a program produced by the
242
Company outside-produced inserts or segments or other outside-produced material, or vice versa.
SIDELETTER 6
When an employee on a remote assignment travels one hundred (100) miles or more (one-way) from his Company office to the site of such assignment and will be on the clock for at least fifteen (15) hours, he/she may request sleeping accommodations for the purpose of rest before returning and the Company shall not unreasonably deny such a request.
An employee who is provided with sleeping accommodations will be credited with the travel time it would have taken to return from such assignment. Such travel time shall be attributed only to the day of such assignment.
SIDELETTER 7
This will confirm our understanding that in applying subparagraph (viii) of Section A2.2 (e)(4), the Agreement dated May 12, 1971 between NBC, NABET Local 41 and IATSE Local 2, concerning field lighting in the Chicago area, remains in effect and incorporates by reference the Award, as modified, of May 15, 1970 by Daniel J. Healy. It is our understanding that with respect to remote lighting in other than houses maintaining IATSE jurisdiction, the Company may assign IATSE or NABET-CWA-represented employees to lighting duties in its sole discretion, except the Company agrees that any person assigned to perform Light Direction Engineer functions in all cases covered by the Healy Award shall be a NABET-CWA-represented employee. NABET-CWA and NBC are agreeable to naming Edwin H. Benn as the arbitrator under the May 12, 1971 Agreement. It- is understood that the five-day notice requirement does not apply to news pickups with hand-held electronic cameras.
SIDELETTER 8
This will confirm our understanding that Part (2) of the second paragraph of Section 7.1(k) is without prejudice to the positions of the parties on the use of clip leads by non-NABET-CWA personnel.

SIDELETTER 9
It is agreed that the Award of Eva Robins in NN75-12 shall be applied nationally to Section 3.3 in the General Articles and to Section N12.1 of the New York Newswriters Agreement insofar as that Award is relevant to the content of that Section.
SIDELETTER 10
This will confirm the understanding which we reached during the negotiation of our Settlement Agreement regarding the assignment by the Company of NABET-CWA-represented employees to work outside of the Continental United States.
If the Company wishes to make any such assignments during the term of this Agreement, it will discuss and agree upon the conditions of such non-news assignments with the Union.
With respect to NABET-CWA-represented Newswriters and Engineering employees assigned, at the Company's option, to news assignments overseas, the parties agree as follows:
1.	For each day a covered employee is employed overseas in an exclusive overseas work week, the Company will pay him or her at a rate of two hundred percent (200%) of his or her applicable daily rate under the Master Agreement. Such flat rate shall constitute full payment■for each day, in lieu of all other payments, including, but not limited to, regular wages, overtime, penalties and premium pay. However, any covered employee hired pursuant to Section A2.2(e)5 or Sideletter 32 shall receive the daily payment in lieu of benefits in addition to the flat rate set forth in this subparagraph.
For the purposes of this Agreement, "work week' shall be defined as a seven (7) day period commencing on Saturday at 12:01 A.M. and ending on Friday at midnight, and "an exclusive overseas work week' shall be defined as a work week wherein the covered employee performs only overseas assignments.
2.	For each day a covered employee is employed overseas in a week split between domestic and overseas assignments (split week) , the Company will compensate him or her on the same basis as if he or she were on domestic assignment.
For the purposes of this Agreement, "split week" shall be defined as a work week wherein the covered employee performs both domestic and overseas assignments.
3.	An overseas assignment shall be deemed to start at the time the employee leaves the first point of departure within
244
the Continental United States from which his or her travel to the overseas destination is uninterrupted by an overnight stay in the Continental United States. It shall end at the conclusion of the employee's return trip or an overnight stay in the Continental United States on his or her return trip, whichever is sooner. If such trip ends no later than 8:00 A.M., and the employee performs no work on that calendar day, payment for such day shall be at the applicable domestic rate.
4.	Nothing in this Agreement shall affect a covered employee's right to payments due under Section 7.7 of the Master Agreement.
5.	The terms of this Agreement will be explained to the employees in advance, and they will only be so assigned should they agree to these terms.
SIDELETTER 11
NBC recognizes and appreciates the unique contribution its NABET-CWA-represented EJ crews have made on a daily basis throughout the years in gathering news material in the field for the Company, and it is committed to continuing to use its NABET-CWA-represented crews in the future for such work. However, the parties recognize that, due to technological advances, it may be desirable for the Company to assign other than NABET-CWA-represented engineers at times to gather news material in the field utilizing hand-held digital cameras (including, but not limited to, DVX 1000, Sony PD 150 and TRV 1000) . Therefore, the parties agree as follows regarding the utilization of such hand-held digital cameras in the field by such non-unit personnel:
1.	Non-unit persons (except interns) may use such cameras when such use is combined with (but which may or may not be performed simultaneously with) other work or functions which (i) such person normally performs, (ii) are outside the scope of duties of a NABET-CWA-represented Engineering employee, and (iii) are in connection with the same program or same material. Operation of such cameras by such non-unit persons shall not be their primary function.
2.	A non-unit person may use such cameras if he/she has specialized knowledge or special access to a location or event due to such person's identity or particular involvement in an event, or relationship to a news story or to persons related to such story.
3.	In both 1 and 2, above, such person need not perform all of the work in connection with such program or material. If
245
there is more than one (1) such person in connection with the same program or the same material, the Company shall determine whether and how the work shall be distributed among such persons, and it need not assign any of the work to each such person.
4.	Nothing herein shall prohibit the Company from assigning any or all of the work to a NABET-CWA-represented engineer.
5.	NABET-CWA-represented engineers may, in combination with their normal work functions, be assigned to perform news production duties in accordance with Sideletter 54.
6.	Material obtained by a non-unit person pursuant to this Sideletter may be transmitted by such person. The foregoing sentence is not intended to affect either parties' rights with respect to microwave or satellite equipment installed in a vehicle.
7.	No EJ news field engineer (i.e. member of one or two person camera crew) on regular staff as of March 31, 2002 shall be laid off during the term of the 2002-2006 Master Agreement as a direct result of the use of such cameras by non-unit persons in accordance with the terms of this Sideletter.
8.	The terms of this Sideletter 11 are without prejudice to the contractual positions of the parties regarding the utilization of hand-held digital cameras to gather news material in the field and the application of the Computer Sideletter thereto. The provisions of this Sideletter are applicable only to the equipment, personnel and operations described and any assignments involving the use of such equipment shall not create a precedent or a practice. Moreover, the inclusion of any provisions herein shall not be construed as implying that it sets forth rights or obligations which either party does not otherwise have under the Master Agreement or that it limits or restricts such rights.

In recognition of increased production complexity/ the Company may designate any programs (including Telesales activities) as requiring special consideration in application of the T.D. work rules as those rules limit the issuing of production directions by the Director to the operators of technical equipment. When a program has been so designated by the Company, the following will apply during the rehearsal and broadcast (or taping) of such programs:
259
1.	Notwithstanding any provision of the Master Agreement, production directions, as distinguished from technical instructions, may be given to the operators of technical equipment at any time during the rehearsal and broadcast (or taping) of such programs by the Producer, Program Director(s) and/or Associate Director(s), subject to the operating procedures set forth in Paragraph 2 below. In addition, the Producer, Program Director(s) and/or Associate Director(s) may mark the Technical Director's script, prepare shot cards and/or give instructions to camerapersons regarding the preparation of shot cards, and the camerapersons may prepare their own shot cards. The number of Associate Directors who may issue production directions on any such program will not exceed two (2) times the number of Technical Directors who are assigned to that program.
2.	It is recognized that operating procedures on such programs must insure that:
(a)	the Technical Director is able to maintain his or her responsibility for the production of a technically acceptable television production, and his or her responsibility for the technical performance of the entire assigned group of technicians engaged in lighting, video control, audio, camera, and all other functions of a technical nature necessary to the production;
(b)	production directions to the crew, when not given by the Technical Director, are given in a manner that will not cause confusion among members of the crew, nor impose an unreasonable strain or workload on the crew; and
(c)	the Technical Director is informed in advance of the specific methods and channels of communication by which crew members will be receiving production directions, and the sources of such production directions.

3.	At each office of the Company where programs have been designated pursuant to this Sideletter, there will be established a Technical Director Advisory Committee, consisting of two (2) Technical Directors, who have experienced working under this system, designated by the Union, two (2) management officials of the Engineering Department, the President of the Local Union (or his or her
260
designee) and the chief Labor Relations official of that office (or his or her designee) , which committee will meet periodically to review the operation of the new procedures envisioned by this Sideletter 21, and to discuss mutual problems and complaints by Technical Directors. Individual Producers and/or Directors may be invited to participate in such meetings to facilitate a full discussion of the matters involved.
4.	In any situation where there is an agreement or a practice of production directions being given by persons other than the Producer, Program Director or Associate Director, the provisions of paragraph 1 above which limit the category of persons other than the Technical Director who may give production direction to the technical crew, will not be prejudicial to the position of the Company, nor shall this Sideletter 21 have any effect on current practices with respect to the issuance of production directions by Associate Directors to operators of video tape machines.
5.	(a) Outside lighting or audio consultants may consult directly with any Group 5 or higher Light Direction Engineer(s) and/or any Group 5 or higher Audio Engineer(s) assigned to the production and may provide written specifications, diagrams or other materials, including, but not limited to, lighting plots. They shall fully cooperate with each other to achieve the desired lighting and audio production requirements.
(b)	All rental lighting equipment, gel orders, gel cut orders, etc., will be ordered by the NBC Light Direction Engineer if such equipment is being ordered through the NBC Staging Equipment Department. If such equipment is ordered by the Production Company, the lighting consultant may order the equipment, but the NBC Light Direction Engineer will not be responsible for any problems resulting from such orders.
(c)	The NBC Light Direction Engineer will be the only person to give lighting directions to the Staging Crew. This includes, but is not limited to, focus of lamps, setting light cues of any kind and lamp replacement during rehearsal and broadcast. The Light Direction Engineer shall be the only person other than the T.D. to give technical lighting directions during rehearsal and broadcast.
(d)	When an artistic difference arises as to how a scene should look, both the NBC Light Direction Engineer and the lighting consultant will go to the Program Director or his or her designee for resolution.
261
(e)	The Producer and the lighting consultant will be advised of the guidelines set forth in this Sideletter 21.
6. The inclusion of "telesales activities" in the definition of "program" hereunder is without prejudice to the positions of the parties with respect to the definition of "program" under the Master Agreement.
SIDELETTER 22
Since Section 8.9(c) of the Master Agreement is applicable to staffing arid the time allowances in color operations, the Color Operations Awards between the parties, and all agreements, settlements and practices based on such Awards, are terminated.

During the 1983 negotiations for a new Master Agreement, the parties agreed to a revision of Article A-III which resulted in the establishment of- new maintenance classifications in Group 5 and Group 7, and the deletion of "Maintenance" from Group 2 and Group 3.
This will confirm our understanding that, notwithstanding these changes, Groups 2, 3 or 5 employees may continue to perform maintenance functions on a temporary basis without being upgraded to Groups 5, 6 or 7. In the event an employee is regularly assigned to maintenance, including vacation relief employees, such employee shall be paid pursuant to the wage schedules set forth under Groups 5, 6 or 7.

SIDELETTER 58
The Company and NABET-CWA encourage employees under this Agreement to improve their skills and knowledge by applying their initiative and using all available training resources.
In accordance with this objective, the Company will make an effort to provide those employees who wish to improve their skills and abilities on their own time with the opportunity to use its equipment and facilities. The Company will also give consideration to releasing such employees for training during their working time, provided that operational requirements permit such release. Any release for training during working time shall be in the Company's sole discretion.
The Company may also expand its existing training programs to train NABET-CWA-represented employees, upon their request, on
287
Company equipment and facilities. NABET-CWA-represented Engineering employees assigned to train two (2) or more other NABET-CWA-represented employees will be paid a Group 6 for each tour so assigned. Any other NABET-CWA-represented trainer will be paid at his or her normal rate of pay for each tour so assigned. It is expressly understood, however, that the Company's assignment of a paid NABET-CWA-represented trainer shall not provide the Union with the basis for any claim that it has established or acquired any jurisdiction by virtue of performing any training duties.
If an employee is interested in participating in a training program, he or she may contact his or her immediate supervisor and request the opportunity to participate in such program. If there are openings in the program, the Company will make an effort to grant the employee's request to participate, provided that such participation is on the employee's own time.
The goals of training may often be attained through educational opportunities at colleges and/or technical schools that offer job-related instruction on a degree or non-degree basis. The NBC Tuition Refund Plan provides excellent opportunities for employees to obtain reimbursement up to the current maximum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) in an academic year for successful completion of a variety of training programs, and the Company and NABET-CWA encourage its use.
At each office, the parties will establish a Joint Training Committee for the purpose of reviewing and seeking to improve training opportunities and programs at each office. The Training Committee shall consist of the principal Labor Relations official at the office (or his or her designee), two (2) members of operational management from the office, the Local President (or his or her designee) and two (2) NABET-CWA-represented employees covered by this Agreement.
The support of training and the agreement to reimburse employees for certain educational expenses shall not constitute any commitment to upgrade or transfer any employee, or to give any employee rights to employment opportunities greater than those expressly set forth in any provision of the Master Agreement.
SIDELETTER 59
In the event of the absence of any of the present Mail Messenger employees in Chicago due to illness, payback days, leaves of absence, vacation, transfer to another department, or in the event of a mail messenger workload (which may result

Any such employees shall continue to be covered by other terms and conditions of employment contained in their respective non-Engineering contracts, except that Sideletter 50 does not apply to any assignments under this Sideletter.
4.	Except as otherwise required by paragraph 5 herein, non-staff employees who perform work covered by this Sideletter may be discharged or laid off in the sole discretion of the Company, and any such decision shall not be arbitrable.

SIDELETTER 66
In the course of negotiations for the 1994-1999 Master Agreement, there was discussion concerning the involvement of NABET-CWA-represented employees in the linear editing of on-air video tape promos at the Los Angeles office of the Company.
As discussed, it is the intention of the Company to continue its practice of assigning NABET-CWA-represented employees to linear editing of video tape promos in Company facilities, and
292
to continue having persons not covered by the Master Agreement perform such editing at other than Company facilities for creative reasons (including, but not limited to, promotional campaigns of the type typically prepared by advertising agencies), or because NBC equipment is unsuitable or unavailable in a timely fashion, or because the work to be done is not within the current capabilities or qualifications of NABET-CWA-represented employees.
Based upon the foregoing and the discussion the parties have had, the Union will not assert during the term of the 1999-2002 Master Agreement that such non-assignment of NABET-CWA-represented employees to the linear editing at other than Company facilities as described above is a violation of the Master Agreement unless the Company substantially decreases the approximate proportion of linear editing that NABET-CWA-represented employees in Los Angeles have performed. It is expressly understood that the foregoing is without precedent and without prejudice to the contractual positions of the parties with regard to promo jurisdiction.
SIDELETTER 67
Notwithstanding any provision of the Master Agreement, or any other agreements, grievance settlements, arbitration awards or past practice to the contrary, the News Channel may, from its own studios located in its main office (currently Charlotte, North Carolina), originate "Nightside" (or any successor program), and any program intended for syndication.
SIDELETTER 68
This will confirm our understanding that, in order not to be deemed to have resigned, staff employees must return from a leave of absence for work-related accidents or work-related illnesses which are compensable under the District of Columbia or applicable state worker's compensation law within eighteen (18) months of the start of such leave.

SIDELETTER 70
During the 1994 negotiations for a new Master Agreement, the parties agreed that the Computer Sideletter gives the Company full discretion in making assignments to non-linear computer editing systems such as AVID, ImMIX, Lightworks and Quantel Editbox which, it is agreed, are included in the definition of computer systems as set forth in paragraph (a) of that
293
Sideletter. It is further agreed that persons not covered by the "A" Contract may also operate any audio and/or color-correcting equipment which is not part of such systems, but is associated therewith or used in connection therewith, provided such operation is in conjunction with their assignment on such systems, but which may or may not be performed simultaneously. To encourage the Company to assign’ NABET-CWA-represented engineers to operate such non-linear computer editing systems, the parties agree as follows:
1.	The Company recognizes the value in having NABET-CWA-represented engineers operate such non-linear computer editing systems. Toward this end, the Company will provide training, as necessary, to engineers, and any staff engineer not so trained may seek training pursuant to Sideletter 58.
2,	Persons employed by NBC who are assigned by the Company to operate such non-linear computer editing systems to "edit" material for broadcast as part of a program covered by the Master Agreement, but who at no time are responsible for the editorial content of program material which they are "editing” (hereinafter "editorial responsibility"), shall be covered by the "A" Contract when they perform such function. When NABET-CWA-represented engineers are given editorial responsibility, they shall continue to be covered by the "A" Contract while exercising such responsibility. It is understood ■that dubbing •(including digitizing, copying, cloning and transfers), screening and/or other non-editing functions are not covered by the above, but nothing herein precludes NABET-CWA-represented engineers from being assigned such functions or given some editorial responsibility.
"Editorial responsibility" is the duty to make a decision(s) and/or a judgment(s) (which decision(s) and/or judgment(s) may include elements of an artistic or creative nature) with respect to the content of program material during the process of assembling or producing a program, or any segment thereof. The failure to perform, or to properly perform, such duty may result in discipline. The Company's designation of editorial responsibility shall be conclusive for the purpose of determining "A* Contract coverage, except that NABET-CWA may challenge such designation of non-unit personnel solely on the grounds that it was made in bad faith, with no intention that any such personnel would exercise said responsibility.
3.	When a NABET-CWA-represented engineer is assigned by the Company to operate such a system, the minimum grade of such employee shall be a Group 3 (except a Group 1, pursuant to the terms of Sideletter 64, for dubbing). A NABET-CWA-represented engineer in a higher wage classification shall not
294
be downgraded solely because of an assignment to operate such a system.
4.	Notwithstanding the provisions of Section A8.2, an engineer who is assigned for the majority of his or her entire tour to operate such a system may not receive a scheduled meal period, but shall be given an opportunity to eat during the workday. Such an engineer shall receive a flat payment, in addition to his or her regular compensation, of Forty Dollars ($40.00) per day for each such day. This payment shall be in lieu of any premiums or penalties, or meal periods added at the end of a tour, which might otherwise be required pursuant to the provisions of Article A-VIII.
5.	It is agreed that any assignment of NABET-CWA-represented employees to such systems shall not create a precendent or a practice. In addition, any such assignment of NABET-CWA-represented engineers alone shall not make that area in which such assignment is performed a technical area, or an area in which NABET-CWA-represented engineers are deemed to be regularly or normally assigned.
6.	The parties agree to meet, at the request of either party, on a semi-annual basis (or more frequently if mutually agreed), to discuss any problems which may arise over this Sideletter. The parties also agree that no grievances may be filed on issues arising out of paragraphs 1 through 5 of -this Sideletter until the parties have thoroughly reviewed and discussed the issues at these meetings. With respect to any such issues which are not resolved at meetings held pursuant to this paragraph, it is agreed that either party may file formal grievances within forty-five (45) days after the conclusion of such meeting, and that any such grievances may be referred to arbitration on a national basis by either party.
[Outstanding grievances involving such non-linear computer editing systems shall be withdrawn.]
