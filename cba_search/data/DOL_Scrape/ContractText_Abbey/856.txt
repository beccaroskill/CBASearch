2003-2006 BASIC AGREEMENT
This Agreement, effective September 30, 2002, is between the 30 Major League Clubs and the Major League Baseball Players Association (hereinafter referred to as the “Players Association” or the “Association”).
In making this Agreement the Association represents that it contracts for and on behalf of the Major League Baseball Players and individuals who may become Major League Baseball Players during the term of this Agreement, and the Clubs represent that they contract for and on behalf of themselves, any additional Clubs which may become members of the Major Leagues and the successors thereof.
ARTICLE I—Intent and Purpose
The intent and purpose of the Clubs and the Association (hereinafter “the Parties”) in entering into this Agreement is to set forth their agreement on certain terms and conditions of employment of all Major League Baseball Players for the duration of this Agreement. Each of the Parties acknowledges the rights and responsibilities of the other Party and agrees to discharge its responsibilities under this Agreement.
ARTICLE II—Recognition
The Clubs recognize the Association as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent for all Major League Players, and individuals who may become Major League Players during the term of this Agreement, with regard to all terms and conditions of employment, provided that an individual Player shall be entitled to negotiate in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Agreement (1) an individual salary over and above the minimum requirements established by this Agreement and (2) Special Covenants to be included in an individual Uniform Player’s Contract, which actually or potentially provide additional benefits to the Player.
ARTICLE III—Uniform Player’s Contract
The form of the Uniform Player’s Contract between a Club and a Player is attached hereto as Schedule A which is incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.
1
During the term of this Agreement, no other form of Uniform Player’s Contract will be utilized. Should the provisions of any Contract between any individual Player and any of the Clubs be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern. Subject to the limitations set forth in Article IV below, nothing herein contained shall limit the right of any Club and Player to enter into Special Covenants in the space provided in a manner not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement. The termination of this Agreement shall not impair, limit or terminate the rights and duties of any Club or Player under any Contract between any individual Player and any of the Clubs.
ARTICLE IV—Negotiation and Approval of Contracts
A Player, if he so desires, may designate an agent to conduct on his behalf, or to assist him in, the negotiation of an individual salary and/or Special Covenants to be included in his Uniform Player’s Contract with any Club, provided such agent has been certified to the Clubs by the Association as authorized to act as a Player Agent for such purposes.
The Association shall provide the Office of the Commissioner with a comprehensive list of the certified Player Agent(s) whom each Player has designated to act on his behalf for the purposes described in this Article IV. Further, the Association shall provide the Office of the Commissioner with any changes to such Player Agent designations, including the Player Agent designations of Players who have been added to a Major League roster, on a weekly basis.
If the Association has notified the Office of the Commissioner that a Player has designated a certified Player Agent or Agents to act on his behalf for the purposes described in this Article IV, no Club may negotiate or attempt to negotiate an individual salaiy and/or Special Covenants to be included in a Uniform Player’s Contract with any Player Agent(s) other than such Player Agentfs).
A Club may require a Player’s physical presence only once during contract negotiations. This limitation shall not apply to telephone conference calls, at reasonable times, with a Player and his certified Player Agent. A Player required to be physically present during negotiations
2
shall be entitled to be paid by the Club for round-trip first-class transportation and first-class hotel costs.
Upon execution of a Uniform Player’s Contract by the Club and Player, the Club promptly shall submit the Contract, in duplicate, to the Commissioner for approval. Within 20 days of receipt, the Commissioner shall approve or disapprove the Contract (with notice to the Association), or provide the Association with a written explanation of why the Contract has not been approved. This period is extended to 30 days if a Contract is received by the Commissioner between February 15 and April 15. Within ten days after the Commissioner is to provide an explanation of why a Contract has not been approved, the Commissioner shall approve or disapprove the Contract. (See Attachment 1.) Any Grievance challenging the Commissioner's conduct under this Article shall be handled by the Parties on an expedited basis with documents being exchanged within 10 days of the filing of the Grievance, a hearing commencing within 15 days of the filing of the Grievance and the Panel issuing an Award (with an opinion to follow, if necessary) no later than 15 days following the commencement of the hearing.
ARTICLE V—Scheduling
A.	Length of Season
During the term of this Agreement, each Club shall be scheduled to play 162 games during each championship season. A championship season will not be scheduled over a period of less than 178 days or more than 183 days. If, however, any Club's championship season is scheduled to open with a game played outside of the United States and Canada, and the scheduling of such a game causes the championship season for those Clubs to be scheduled over a period of more than 183 days (an “International Opener”), then the championship season far all other Clubs shall commence on the date of the first regularly scheduled championship season game within the 183 days preceding the regularly scheduled end of the championship season. (See Article V1(C) and Article XV(J)(6), below.)
Following completion of each championship season, eight Clubs shall engage in best of five (seven if the Division Series is expanded) Division Series. (See Attachment 25.) The winners of the Division Series
3
in each League shall then engage in a best of seven League Championship Series, and the winners of the two League Championship Series shall engage in a best of seven World Series. If during the term of this Agreement the format of the Division Series, the League Championship Series or the World Series is proposed to be changed, the Clubs shall give the Association notice thereof and shall negotiate the proposed change with the Association; provided, however, that if during the term of this Agreement the Division Series is proposed to be changed to the best of seven games, the Clubs shall give the Association notice thereof and shall negotiate with the Association but the Clubs shall not be required to negotiate with the Association over contributions to the Players’ pool beyond those specified in Article X. Any failure to play the Division Series, the League Championship Series or the World Series, in whole or in part, by reason of causes beyond the control of the Clubs, shall not constitute a change in the format of such Series or a breach of this Agreement.
During any negotiations between the Parties on the subject of a renewal of or successor to this Agreement, the Clubs agree that any proposal made by the Association to reduce the number of championship season games shall not be resisted on the ground of commitments made by the Clubs in local television and radio contracts. However, nothing herein shall interfere with or limit the right of the Clubs to resist such proposal on any other ground or the right of either Party to take any other position in future negotiations on this or any other proper subject for collective bargaining.
B.	Championship Schedules
On or before July 1st of each year, copies of the tentative championship schedules of the Major Leagues for the next ensuing season shall be submitted to the Association for review. The Association shall complete its review not later than October 15th.
C.	Additional Scheduling Agreements
(1)	Split doubleheaders shall not be scheduled in the original schedule. Provided that neither of the Clubs involved in the proposed rescheduled game already has played or has been rescheduled
4
to play a total of two split doubleheaders in that championship season:
(a)	each Club shall have the right to reschedule any postponed game as a split doubleheader when ticket sales for the game at the time of postponement exceed, in any respect, the number of comparable tickets available to be exchanged by the Club for the balance of the championship season, and both the postponed and rescheduled game occur in the last regularly scheduled series between the two Clubs at the Club’s park; and
(b)	when there is no practical alternative to doing so, the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs shall have the right to reschedule a postponed game as a split doubleheader to be played in, respectively, Fenway Park and Wrigley Field, even if the criteria set out in subparagraph (a) above are not met. Scheduling a postponed game as part of a conventional doubleheader will not be considered a practical alternative.
The Association shall have the exclusive right to approve the additional rescheduling of postponed games as split doubleheaders in circumstances that are not automatically permitted by subparagraph (a) or (b) above.
(2)	One-day stands will not be scheduled except as “openers" or doubleheaders to be followed by an open day. A game will not be rescheduled as a one-game stand except as required to complete the championship schedule.
(3)	During the championship season, no Club shall be scheduled to play an exhibition game other than the Hall of Fame Game. No Club shall be scheduled to play in more than one Hall of Fame Game during the term of this Agreement. For purposes of this paragraph (3), a spring training exhibition game that is scheduled to commence at least three hours before the start of the first championship season game shall not be considered played “during the championship season.”
(4)	The following shall apply to the scheduling or rescheduling of games prior to day doubleheaders:
(a)	a game will not be scheduled to start after 5 P.M. if either Club is scheduled to play a day doubleheader the next day;
5
(b)	a game will not be rescheduled to start after 5 P.M. if either Club is scheduled to play a day doubleheader the next day unless such rescheduling is necessary to complete the championship schedule.
(5)	Day games shall not be scheduled or (unless necessary to complete the championship schedule) rescheduled to start before 1 P.M., except as provided in paragraph (6) below, and except that such games may be scheduled or rescheduled to start between Noon and 1 P.M., if each Club meets one of the following two conditions:
(a)	if an off-day occurred the previous day; or
(b)	if a game were played in the same city within the previous 24 hours.
Day games may be scheduled or rescheduled to start between Noon and 1 RM. on holidays if each Club meets one of the above conditions or if on afternoon game starting not later than 5 P.M. or a doubleheader starting not later than 1:30 P.M. was played in another city the previous day and the travel time required in-flight is 114 hours or less.
(6)	With the approval of the Commissioner, not more than 4 games per League per year may be scheduled or rescheduled to start between 10:30 A.M. and Noon, if, with respect to both Clubs, the conditions stated in paragraph (5) above with respect to scheduling and rescheduling of day games between Noon and I P.M. are met.
(7)	No Club shall be scheduled to play a game starting after 5 P.M. if such game is a road game and is followed by a home off-day, unless:
(a)	a later game is required to be scheduled pursuant to a national television agreement; or
(b)	the road Club is playing at Texas or Florida on or after June 1.
Other getaway games shall not be scheduled or rescheduled to start later than 5 P.M. if either Club is required to travel for a day game, scheduled the next day, between cities in which the in-flight time is more than L'A hours. Each championship season the Clubs may utilize six exceptions to the rule in the immediately preceding sentence
6
provided that the exceptions must be utilized by a Club traveling to Chicago to play the Cubs and the in-flight time cannot exceed 2‘A hours.
(8)	To the extent reasonably practicable, open days shall be nontravel days, except as permitted in paragraph (9), below.
(9)	An open day shall be scheduled for or following travel from cities in the Pacific time zone to cities in the Eastern time zone except that the Commissioner may schedule not more than seven (7) games per championship season in each League with a starting time after 7 P.M. in the Eastern time zone which include a Club that the day before played a game scheduled to start prior to 5 P.M. in the Pacific time zone. In any championship season, however, no Club may be scheduled to play more than one (1) game in the Eastern time zone the day after it has played a game in the Pacific time zone.
(10)	No Club shall be scheduled, or rescheduled if practicable, to play more than 20 consecutive dates without an open day, or 21 consecutive dates if necessary to accommodate the Hall of Fame Game. A rained-out game may be rescheduled to an open date in the same series, or to an open date at the end of the same series, if (a) the open date is a road off-day for the visiting Club, and (b) the rescheduling does not result in the home team playing more than 24 consecutive dates without an open day, or 25 consecutive dates if necessary to accommodate the Hall of Fame Game.
(II)	Commencing with its second scheduled championship season game, a Club shall not be scheduled for more than two open days in any seven-day period.
(12)	Home games which are scheduled or rescheduled away from the park of the home Club shall be considered road games for the purposes of Players’ meal and tip allowances, hotel accommodations and transportation,
(13)	Doubleheaders shall not be scheduled on consecutive dates in the original schedule.
(14)	Twi-night doubleheaders will be limited in the original schedule to three per home Club per season. A twi-night doubleheader will not be scheduled on a getaway day.
7
(15)	Only postponed, suspended and tied games shall be rescheduled, except as may be required to accommodate network television commitments or to comply with stadium leases, in any of which events the rescheduling rules set forth in this Article V shall apply; provided, however, that any game may be rescheduled for any reason if as rescheduled it conforms to the rules governing the original schedule.
(16)	Club championship season games shall not be played during the All-Star break. Further, any workout scheduled by a Club for the day following the All-Star Game shall be voluntary.
(17)	With respect to the rescheduling of any game, except for games rescheduled as split doubieheaders as set forth in Section C(l), any scheduling or rescheduling rule set forth in this Article V may be waived by the secret ballot vote of a majority of the Players on the Club(s) that would be in violation of the rule. Separate votes shaii be required with regard to each game for which a waiver is sought. A waiver granted pursuant to this provision, as well as a waiver granted by the Association pursuant to Section C(l), shall not constitute a precedent with regard to future waiver requests. With respect to the rescheduling of any such game, and all games rescheduled pursuant to Section C(l), the Club(s) shall consult with the Association concerning the actual date and time of such rescheduled game. The Club(s) shall use best efforts to notify the Association in advance of notifying the Players on the Club(s) affected.
D. Interleague Play

ARTICLE VI—Salaries
Individual Player salaries shall be those as agreed upon between a Player and a Club, as evidenced by the execution of a Uniform Player’s Contract, subject to the following:
8
A.	Definition of Salary
The term “salary” for the purposes of interpretation and application of the maximum salary cut, contract tender, signing and renewal rules shall be determined by applying the following principles:
(1)	Multi-year contract providing for current salary only (no upfront payment or deferred compensation)
(a)	If the annual salary payment schedule satisfies the maximum salary cut rule, the salary specified for the last year of the contract shall be the base for applying the maximum salary cut rule to the year following the expiration of the contract.
(b)	If the annual salary payment schedule does not satisfy the maximum salary cut rule, that rule shall not be applicable during the term of the contract and the aggregate salary payment provided by the contract shall be averaged and the average annual '	salary shall be the base for applying the maximum salary cut rule
to the year following the contract’s expiration.
(2)	Multi-year contract including up-front payments and/or deferred compensation which are specifically allocated to one or more years of the contract
Treat as in (1) above with the allocated up-front or deferred amounts included as specified as part of the salary for each year.
(3)	Multi-year contract including up-front payments and/or deferred compensation which are not specifically allocated to certain years of the contract
Average the aggregate of such payments, include the annual average as part of the salary for each year, and then treat as in(1) above.
(4)	Deferred Compensation
If any deferred compensation is included in the base determined as described above, it may be payable as deferred on the same terms, or the Club and Player may elect to substitute the discounted present value of such deferred amount.
9
(5)	Performance Bonuses
Regardless of whether or not any portion of a performance bonus is earned, the Club has the option of either: (a) including the entire bonus (both earned and unearned portions) in the salary base or (b) excluding it from the base but repeating the performance bonus on the same terms.
(6)	Other Forms of Additional Compensation
All other forms of compensation, including but not limited to the following, are not addressed herein and are to be determined according to the facts in each situation:
(a)	payments for performing services for a Club in addition to skilled services as a baseball player;
(b)	cash, lump sum, payments made in accordance with agreed upon special covenants to compensate for trading a Player, releasing a Player, etc,;
(c)	the value of individual property rights granted to a Player by a Club;
(d)	any compensation for post-active Major League Baseball playing career employment;

provided that any amounts payable upon the occurrence of a specific event or events shall not be included in the definition of “salary” if such event or events fail to occur within the specified period.
(7)	Disputes
In the event of a dispute regarding a contract tender, signing or renewal with respect to any form of additional compensation referred to in paragraph (6) above, either the Player or Club may file a Grievance in order to obtain a determination with respect thereto as the exclusive means of resolving such dispute, and both parties shall be bound by the resulting decision. The contract tender, signing or renewal shall be altered as necessary to conform
10
to the decision, and such tender, signing or renewal shall remain valid.

(3)	(a) Cost of living adjustments for the Major League minimum salary described above in paragraph (1) shall be computed as follows:
(i)	to determine the 2005 salary rate, $300,000 shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (CPIW) for November 2004 and the denominator of which is the CPfW for November 2002;

(i)	to determine the 2005 salary rate, $50,000 shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the CPIW for November 2004 and the denominator of which is the CPIW for November 2002;
(ii)	to determine the 2006 salary rate, the adjusted salary rate for 2005 shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the CPIW for November 2005 and the denominator of which is the CPIW for November 2004.
C.	Standard Length of Season
For the purpose of calculating a Player’s daily rate of pay, a championship season shall be deemed to commence on the date of the first regularly scheduled championship season game and to conclude on the date of the last regularly scheduled championship season game.

For the purposes of this section, the “salary” of a Player with a salary stipulated in paragraph 2 of his Major League contract of less than the then applicable Major League minimum salary shall be deemed to be the greater of either (a) the total amount of his actual baseball salary earnings from Major League Clubs (and from Minor League clubs if any) in that season or (b) the amount stipulated in paragraph 2 of his Major League contract for that season.
(2)	The term “salary” shall include any salary amounts which were not paid to a Player for the season by reason of any fine or suspension which may have been imposed on the Player, or by reason of any other deduction from salary.

F.	Salary Arbitration
The following salary arbitration procedure shall be applicable:
(1)	Eligibility, The issue of a Player’s salary may be submitted to final and binding arbitration by any Player or his Club, provided the other party to the arbitration consents thereto. Any Club, or any Player with a total of three or more years of Major League service, however accumulated, but with less than six years of Major League
13
service, may submit the issue of the Player’s salary to final and binding arbitration without the consent of the other party, subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) below.
In addition, a Player with at least two but less than three years of Major League service shall be eligible for salary arbitration if: (a) he has accumulated at least 86 days of service during the immediately preceding season; and (b) he ranks in the top seventeen percent (17%) (rounded to the nearest whole number) in total service in the class of Players who have at least two but less than three years of Major League service, however accumulated, but with at least 86 days of service accumulated during the immediately preceding season. If two or more Players are tied in ranking, ties shall be broken consecutively based on the number of days of service accumulated in each of the immediately preceding seasons. If the Players remain tied, the final tie breaker will be by lot.
(2)	Trade Demand-Club Consent to Arbitration. Any Player whose Club has offered to proceed to salary arbitration pursuant to Article XX(C)(5) may elect salary arbitration in the same manner and at the same time as other Players.
(3)	Notice of Submission	■
(a)	Plaver Submission. Election of submission shall be communicated by telephone or any other method of communication by the Player to the Association. Written notice of submission shall then be given, within the specified time limits, by the Association on behalf of the Player to the designated representative of the Major League Baseball Labor Relations Department (“LRD”).
Within three days after the notice of submission has been given, the Association and the LRD shall exchange salary figures. It shall be the responsibility of the Association during this three-day period to obtain the salary figure from the Player, and the LRD shall have a similar responsibility to obtain the Club's figure.
(b)	Club Submission. Written notice of submission by the Club shall be communicated to the Player by registered letter mailed between January 2 and January 12 (both inclusive) to the
14
last address the Player has supplied to the Club, with copies to the Association and the LRD. The submission shall be deemed to be made on the third day following the date of mailing by the Club. Salary figures shall be exchanged by the Association and the LRD as soon as practicable thereafter.
(c)	Special Exceptions to Maximum Salary Reduction Rules
(i)	A Club may submit a salary figure for salary arbitration that is at least 80% of the Player’s previous year's salary and earned performance bonuses (and at least 70% of his salary and earned performance bonuses two years previous), the provisions of Section A(5) above notwithstanding. This exception shall not be used by any party, or considered by any salary arbitrator, in support of, or in opposition to, any argument regarding the evaluation of Player contracts.
(ii)	A Club may submit a salary arbitration figure without regard to the provisions of Section D above if the figure submitted is with respect to a Player who, in the immediately preceding year, won a salary arbitration which increased the Player’s prior year’s salary by in excess of 50%.
The above exceptions to the maximum salary reduction rules do not alter the obligations of the Clubs to comply with Articles VI(D) and XX(A) of this Agreement and paragraph 10(a) of the Uniform Player’s Contract for the purposes of contract tender and renewal.
(4)	Withdrawal from Arbitration. In the event the Club submits the matter to arbitration, the Player may within 7 days after receipt of the Club’s salary arbitration figure notify the Club that he does not wish to arbitrate and the matter shall be deemed withdrawn from arbitration. In such event, or in the event that neither the Club nor the Player submits to arbitration, the rights and obligations of the Club and Player shall be as they would have been had the salary arbitration procedure never been invoked. In the event the Club and Player reach agreement on salary before the arbitration panel reaches a decision, the matter shall be deemed withdrawn from arbitration.
15
(5)	Timetable and Decision. Submission may be made at any time between January 5 and January 15.

There shall be no release of the arbitration award by the arbitration panel except to the Club, the Player, the Association and the LRD. The panel chair shall initially inform the Association and the LRD of the award only and not how the panel members voted. The panel chair shall disclose to the Association and the LRD the individual votes of the panel members on each March 15 following the February hearings. The panel chair shall insert the figure awarded in paragraph 2 of the duplicate Uniform Player’s Contracts delivered at the hearing and shall forward both copies to the Office of the Commissioner.
(6)	Form of Submission. The Player and the Club shall exchange with each other in advance of the hearing single salary figures for the coming season (which need not be figures offered during the prior negotiations) and then shall submit such figures to the arbitration panel. At the hearing, the Player and Club shall deliver to the arbitration panel a Uniform Player’s Contract executed in duplicate, complete except for the salary figure to be inserted in paragraph 2. Upon submission of the salary issue to arbitration by either Player or Club, the Player shall be regarded as a signed Player (unless the Player withdraws from arbitration as provided in paragraph (4) above).
(7)	Selection of Arbitrators. The Association and the LRD shall annually select the arbitrators. In the event they are unable to agree by January 1 in any year, they jointly shall request that the American Arbitration Association furnish them lists of prominent, professional arbitrators.

16
be assigned to three-arbitrator panels. The Association and the LRD shall designate one arbitrator to serve as the panel chair.

The aforesaid time limitations may be extended by the arbitration panel in the event of lengthy crossexamination of witnesses, or for other good cause.
(10)	Continuances, Adjournments or Postponements. There shall be no continuances or adjournments of a hearing, but the commencement of a hearing may be postponed by the arbitration panel upon the application of either the Player or Club based upon a showing of substantial cause. Any request for the postponement of a scheduled hearing shall be made to the panel chair in writing, with copies to the Association and the LRD. Disclosure of individual votes by panel members shall be in accordance with paragraph (5) above.
(11)	Hearing Costs. The Player and Club shall divide equally the costs of the hearing, and each shall be responsible for his own expenses and those of his counsel or other representatives.
(12)	Criteria
(a)	The criteria will be the quality of the Player’s contribution to his Club during the past season (including but not limited to his overall performance, special qualities of leadership and public appeal), the length and consistency of his career contribution, the record of the Player’s past compensation, comparative baseball salaries (see paragraph (13) below for confidential salary data), the existence of any physical or mental defects on the part of the Player, and the recent performance record of the Club including but not limited to its League standing and attendance as an indication of public acceptance (subject to the exclusion stated in
17
subparagraph (b)(i) below). Any evidence may be submitted which is relevant to the above criteria, and the arbitration panel shall assign such weight to the evidence as shall appear appropriate under the circumstances. The arbitration panel shall, except for a Player with five or more years of Major League service, give particular attention, for comparative salary purposes, to the contracts of Players with Major League service not exceeding one annual service group above the Player’s annual service group. This shall not limit the ability of a Player or his representative, because of special accomplishment, to argue the equal relevance of salaries of Players without regard to service, and the arbitration panel shall give whatever weight to such argument as is deemed appropriate.
(b)	Evidence of the following shall not be admissible:
(i)	The financial position of the Player and the Club;
(ii)	Press comments, testimonials or similar material bearing on the performance of either the Player or the Club, except that recognized annual Player awards for playing excellence shall not be excluded;

The names and Clubs of the Players concerned will appear on the tabulation. In utilizing the salary tabulation, the arbitration panel shall consider the salaries of all comparable Players and not merely the salary of a single Player or group of Players.
18
(14)	Prohibition Regarding Competitive Balance Tax. No participant in a salary arbitration shall refer in any fashion, either orally or in writing, to any of the provisions in Article XXIII (Competitive Balance Tax).

B.	Procedure
Step 1. Any Player who believes that he has a justifiable Grievance shall first discuss the matter with a representative of his Club designated to handle such matters, in an attempt to settle it. If the matter is not resolved as a result of such discussions, a written notice of the Grievance shall be presented to the Club’s designated representative, provided, however, that for a Grievance to be considered beyond Step 1, such written notice shall be presented within (a) 45 days from the date of the occurrence upon which the Grievance is based, or (b) 45 days from the date on which the facts of the matter became known or
34
reasonably should have become known to the Player, whichever is later. Within 10 days following receipt of such written notice (within 2 days if disciplinary suspension or a grievance involving Player safety and health), the Club’s designated representative shall advise the Player in writing of his decision and shall furnish a copy to the Association. If the decision of the Club is not appealed further within 15 days of its receipt, the Grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of that decision and shall not be eligible for further appeal.
Step 2. A Grievance, to be considered in Step 2, shall be appealed in writing by the Grievant or by the Association to a designated representative of the LRD within 15 days following receipt of the Club's written decision. The Grievance shall be discussed within 10 days thereafter (within 2 days if disciplinary suspension or a grievance involving Player safety and health) between representatives of the LRD and representatives of the Association in an attempt to settle it. Within 10 days following such discussion (within 2 days if disciplinary suspension or a grievance involving Player safety and health), the designated representative of the LRD shall advise the Grievant in writing of his decision and shall furnish a copy to the Association. If the decision of the LRD representative is not appealed further within 15 days of its receipt, the Grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of that decision and shall not be eligible for further appeal.
Grievances which involve (a) more than one Club, or (b) a Player who is not under contract to a Club which is party to the Grievance, may be filed initially in Step 2, provided that written notice of the Grievance shall be presented to the designated representative of the LRD within (a) 30 days from the date of the occurrence upon which the Grievance is based, or (b) 30 days from the date on which the facts of the matter became known or reasonably should have become known to the Player, whichever is later.
In a Grievance alleging that the assignment of a Player to a Minor League club was in violation of Article XIX(C)(1), any party to the Grievance may request the appointment of a “Medical Expert,” according to the following procedures.
Within 20 days of receipt of the Notice of Grievance, the Office of the Commissioner shall provide to the Association all medical records related to the Grievance (and not previously provided to the Associa
35
tion) and any other documents properly requested by the Association. Within 10 days after receipt of those records, the Grievant may request appointment of a Medical Expert. (If the Grievance was filed at Step 1, that date shall be the deadline for an appeal to Step 2.) If the Grievant does not so request, the Club may request appointment of a Medical Expert within 15 days after supplying the medical records.
If neither party requests appointment of a Medical Expert, the parties shall proceed under normal procedures to the Step 2 meeting.
In the event of a proper request, within 10 days the parties shall appoint a Medical Expert, either by agreement or by randomly (and blindly) selecting seven specialists in the area of the Player’s alleged injury from the second medical opinion list contemplated by Article XIII(D), and then alternately striking names from the list until only one name remains. As a condition of his appointment, the selected Medical Expert must agree to testify at the arbitration of the Grievance if called by a party. Should that physician decline to serve as Medical Expert, the appointment process shall be repeated from the beginning, with the declining physician’s name being removed from the pool of specialists from which the list of seven is selected.
Within 10 days of the appointment of a Medical Expert, the parties shall arrange to submit to that physician (i) a list of medical questions for the physician to attempt to answer and (ii) all pertinent .medical records and any other documents that either party believes are relevant to the submitted questions. The Medical Expert may request addition* al documentary information and/or a physical examination (but not an interview) of the Grievant. Within 30 days from receipt of the parties’ final submission (including the physical examination of the Grievant, if requested), the Medical Expert shall issue a written report to the parties. The Medical Expert may inform the parties, if no other finding is appropriate, that he is unable to provide an answer to a question(s) before him with a reasonable degree of medical certainty. The Medical Expert, in his discretion, may request a meeting with the parties, by teleconference or in-person, either before issuance of the Medical Expert’s written report or within 10 days thereof.
Within 10 days of receipt of the report (or of the meeting with the Medical Expert, if later), the parties shall hold a Step 2 meeting.
36
If the Grievance proceeds to arbitration, the Medical Expert's written report shall be admissible in the arbitration; provided, however, that the Arbitration Panel shall give the report such weight as it deems appropriate and in no event shall the Medical Expert’s opinion be deemed dispositive of the Grievance.
All costs associated with retention of a Medical Expert, including fees and expenses, shall be borne equally by the Association and the Office of the Commissioner.
Arbitration. Within 15 days following receipt of the Step 2 decision, the Grievant or the Association may appeal the Grievance in writing to the Panel Chairman for impartial arbitration. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Chairman of the Arbitration Panel shall set a time, date and place for hearing the appeal, which hearing shall be commenced as soon as practicable but no later than 20 days following receipt of the notice of appeal (5 days if disciplinary suspension or a grievance involving Player safety and health). Such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules of Procedure attached hereto as Appendix A. The Arbitration Panel shall render a written decision as soon as practicable following the conclusion of such hearing (within 5 days if disciplinary suspension or a grievance involving Player safety and health), and may affirm, modify or reverse the decision from which the appeal is taken. The decision of the Arbitration Panel shall constitute full, final and complete disposition of the Grievance appealed to it.
With regard to the arbitration of Grievances, the Arbitration Panel shall have jurisdiction and authority only to determine the existence of or compliance with, or to interpret or apply agreements or provisions of agreements between the Association and the Clubs or any of them, or between individual Players and Clubs. The Arbitration Panel shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from, or alter in any way the provisions of such agreements.
All costs of arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the impartial arbitrator, shall be borne equally by the parties, provided that each of the parties shall bear the cost of its own party arbitrator, witnesses, counsel and the like.
37

Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the President and Chief Operating Officer or the Commissioner, as the case may be, shall designate a time and place for hearing the appeal, which hearing shall be commenced within 10 days from the date of receipt of the appeal.

Such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules of Procedure attached hereto as Appendix A. The President and Chief Operating Officer or the Commissioner, as the case may be, shall render a written decision as soon as practicable following the conclusion of such hearing, and may affirm, modify, or revoke the disciplinary action originally imposed. The decision by the President and Chief Operating Officer or the Commissioner, as the case may be, shall constitute full, final and complete disposition of the complaint and shall have the same effect as a Grievance decision of the Arbitration Panel.
(2)	Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) above, if any such discipline imposed upon a Player by the Vice President, On-Field Operations involves a fine in an amount which exceeds $5,000 or a suspension exceeding 10 days, any complaint relating thereto shall be appealable from the decision of the President and
38
Chief Operating Officer to the Commissioner for determination in the same manner and with the same effect as provided in paragraph 1(b) of Section A hereof.
D.	Grievances Initiated or Appealed by a Club
Step 1, Any Club which believes it has a justifiable Grievance shall present a written notice of the Grievance to the Player with a copy to the Association, provided, however, that for a Grievance to be considered beyond Step 1, such written notice shall be presented within (a) 45 days from the date of the occurrence upon which the Grievance is based, or (b) 45 days from the date on which the facts of the matter became known or reasonably should have become known to the Club, whichever is later. Within 10 days following receipt of such written notice, the Player shall advise the Club in writing of his decision and shall furnish a copy to the LRD.

Step 2. A Grievance, to be considered in Step 2, shall be appealed in writing by the Club or the LRD to the Association within 15 days following receipt of the Player’s written decision. The Grievance shall be discussed within 10 days thereafter between representatives of the LRD and representatives of the Association in an attempt to settle it. Within 10 days following such discussion, the Association shall advise the LRD in writing of its decision. If the decision of the Association is not appealed further within 15 days of its receipt, the Grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of that decision and shall not be eligible for further appeal.

The procedures to be followed in arbitration and the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Panel shall be as set forth in Section B above.
Nothing contained in this Section D shall be deemed to limit or impair the right of any Club to impose discipline upon a Player or Players or to take any other action not inconsistent with the Uniform Player’s Contract or any agreement with the Association to which the Club is a Party. Any complaint or dispute which may be a subject for discipline shall not constitute a proper basis for a Club Grievance under this Section D.
E.	Grievances Initiated or Appealed by the Association
(1)	The Association may on its own motion appeal Grievances or complaints on behalf of a Player or Players as provided in this Grievance Procedure, except that the Association will not appeal a Grievance or complaint involving player discipline without the approval of the Player or Players concerned.'
(2)	The Association may on its own motion, initiate Grievances or complaints on behalf of a Player or Players on all matters not involving player discipline. Nothing herein shall interfere with the right of a Player who initiates a disciplinary Grievance or complaint to be represented by the Association at any Step of the Grievance Procedure.

40

In any such discussion or hearing, any other party may be accompanied by a representative who may participate in such discussion or hearing and represent such party.
G.	Survival Following Termination of Basic Agreement
Unless eliminated or modified following an impasse in bargaining, Article XI shall remain in full force and effect after termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that disputes arising after the termination of this Agreement related to the legality or validity of unilateral changes of terms and conditions of employment following an impasse in bargaining and any other self-help conduct of the Parties, including but not limited to, unilateral changes in nonmandatory subjects of bargaining, shall not be subject to Article XI.
ARTICLE XII—Discipline
A.	Just Cause
The Parties recognize that a Player may be subjected to disciplinary action for just cause by his Club, the Vice President, On-Field Operations or the Commissioner. Therefore, in Grievances regarding discipline, the issue to be resolved shall be whether there has been just cause for the penalty imposed.
If discipline imposed upon a Player is determined to be improper by reason of a final decision under this Grievance Procedure, the Player shall promptly be made whole.
The term “make whole” means:
(1)	if a fine is found to have been imposed improperly, the fine will be promptly repaid;
(2)	any salary loss as a result of an improper suspension will be promptly paid;
41
(3)	in the application of items (1) and (2) above, interest will also be paid at the rate per annum set forth in Article XV(K) below; and
(4)	crediting the Player with performance statistics for the purpose of determining whether a performance level contained in any special covenant to his Uniform Player’s Contract has been met. Such credit shall be determined by multiplying the Player’s relevant average per game statistic while he was on a Club’s Active List for the current championship season by the number of games for which the Arbitration Panel determines the Player was improperly suspended and adding that product to the Player's year-end total. Such credit shall not be awarded to a Player for such time that his suspension covers time the Player is on the Disabled List.
B.	Notice
Written notice of discipline of a Player (a.fine, or suspension, or both) imposed by the Commissioner of Baseball, the Vice President, OnField Operations, or a Club (except for actions arising from participation in the Winter Leagues) and the reason therefore shall in every case be given to the Player and the Association,
With respect to discipline imposed upon a Player by the Vice President, On-Field Operations or the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall immediately give to the Association notice by mail of fines, and facsimile notice of suspension and of an appeal for a hearing.
C.	Discovery
A Player who is disciplined shall have the right to discover, in timely fashion, all documents and evidence adduced during any investigation of the charges involved.
D.	Compliance
(1)	Nothing contained in this Grievance Procedure shall excuse a Player from prompt compliance with any discipline imposed upon him.
42
(2)	Payment of fines
(a)	Club Fines. A fine imposed by a Club pursuant to Regulation 5 of the Uniform Player’s Contract in excess of $ 1,000 may not be deducted from the Player’s salary until such fine is finally upheld in the Grievance Procedure or the lime in which to file a Grievance has expired.
(b)	Fines Imposed by the Vice President. On-Field Operations or Commissioner. A fine imposed by the Vice President, OnField Operations or the Commissioner in an amount of $2,000 or less shall continue to be payable when imposed. Fines in an amount greater than $2,000 shall be payable only when such fine becomes final. When a fine imposed by the Vice President, On-Field Operations or the Commissioner becomes final, the Player’s employing Club is authorized, at the request of the Vice President, On-Field Operations, or the Commissioner in the case of a fine imposed by the Commissioner, to deduct the amount of the fine from the Player’s salary and transmit such sum to the Commissioner.
E.	Investigations
Except where circumstances require expeditious handling, the Player and the Association shall receive reasonable advance notice of any investigatory interview with a Player. Where circumstances requiring expeditious handling are present, the Player and the Association shall receive as much advance notice as is possible, but in no event shall the Association receive less notice than the Player. All parties recognize the right of the Player to be represented at such interview by the Association and counsel of his choice.
E Major League Rules 15 and 16
The following time limit provisions set forth in Major League Rules 15 and 16 shall be inapplicable in disciplinary matters:

70
assigned to another Club. If the Player, however, subsequently signs a contract with the assignee Club, the Player shall not be eligible to require that Club to assign his contract if the contract executed with the assignee Club covers the next succeeding season.

72
Section B(2) of this Article XX, whether the Club offers to proceed with the Player to salary arbitration for the succeeding season.

No such decision from a Player shall be considered effective until twenty-four hours from his receipt of the Club’s notice.
74
If the Club fails to give written notice, as set forth herein, to the Player prior to the date of such assignment, the Player may, at any time, elect to become a free agent pursuant to this Section D, provided, however, that if the Club subsequently gives such written notice to the Player, he shall, within 3 days thereafter, or 10 days, if during the period from the close of the championship season to the opening of spring training, advise the Club in writing as to his decision. No such decision from a Player shall be considered effective until twenty-four hours from his receipt of the Club’s notice.
E.	Individual Nature of Rights
(1)	The utilization or non-utilization of rights under Article XIX(A)(2) and Article XX is an individual matter to be determined solely by each Player and each Club for his or its own benefit. Players shall not act in concert with other Players and Clubs shall not act in concert with other Clubs.
(2)	Upon any finding of a violation of Section E(I) of this Article XX by two or more Clubs, any injured Player (or Players) shall be entitled to recover in monetary damages three (3) times the lost baseball income, he (or they) would have had but for the violation. Such lost baseball income shall be limited to lost salary and other lost contractual terms, including lost additional contract years, lost signing bonuses, lost trade restriction provisions, lost option buyout provisions, and lost incentive bonuses (e.g., performance, awards, attendance and weight bonuses). Damages (and fees and interest) may be recovered only from the Clubs found to have violated Section E(l) of this Article XX.

However, no such termination shall take effect during the period beginning on February 15 and ending with the conclusion of the World Series. If the finding of the Arbitration Panel is issued at any time on or after January 15, but before February 15, the Player shall have the right to terminate his existing contract (or reserve status) at his option either (a) immediately; or (b) within the fifteen (15) day period following the conclusion of the next succeeding World Series.

If at the end of the period the Player has not signed a new contract and has not exercised his right to reinstate his existing contract (or reserve status), at that point, the Player shall be considered an unrestricted free agent.
(8)	Utilization or non-utilization of the procedures set forth in paragraph (6) above shall be without prejudice to any injured free agent Player. However, the experience of each Player who utilizes
76
such procedures shall be considered by the Arbitration Panel in determining such further relief, if any, to which he may be entitled.
(9)	It is understood that in the event of a violation of Section E(l) of this Article XX, the Arbitration Panel shall have the author' ity to order such other and further non-monetary (e.g., injunctive) relief as may be necessary to give full force and effect to the purposes of and to the rights and benefits afforded to Players under this Article XX.

The Competitive Balance Tax rate applicable in the 2006 Contract Year to a Club with an Actual Club Payroll that was above the Tax Threshold in the 2003 and 2005 Contract Years (but not in the 2004 Contract Year) shall be 30%. A Club with an Actual Club Payroll above the Tax Threshold in the 2006 Contract Year but with an Actual Club Payroll in the 2005 Contract Year that was not above the Tax Threshold shall be assessed no tax, even if the Club’s Actual Club Payroll was above the Tax Threshold in the 2003 and 2004 Contract Years.
(4)	Collection of Competitive Balance Tax Proceeds
(a)	On the December 20 following each Contract Year, the Commissioner’s Office shall notify the Association and all Clubs of any amounts owed by any Clubs under the Competitive Balance Tax. Clubs shall make Competitive Balance Tax payments to the Commissioner’s Office on or before January 31 of the next calendar year.
(b)	Any Club that does not remit the full amount of the Competitive Balance Tax due by that date shall have its next Major League Central Fund (“Central Fund”) distribution and subsequent distributions, each net of any debt service obligation to Fleet Bank, reduced by up to 50% until such obligation is satisfied. For purposes of this subparagraph (b) only, royalty payments from Major League Baseball Properties shall not be considered part of a Club’s Central Fund distribution. Beginning with the day following the payment date specified in subparagraph (a) above, interest shall be charged on any unpaid Competitive Balance Tax amounts at the Imputed Loan Interest Rate for the then current Contract Year. Any interest collected pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be for the benefit of and made available to the Industry Growth Fund and used for the purposes set out in Article XXV.
81
C.	Determination of Actual Club Payroll
(1)	Definition of Actual Club Payroll
“Actual Club Payroll" of a Club in a Contract Year shall be the sum of:
(a)	a l/30th share of Player Benefit Costs (and a similar pro rata share if the number of Major League Clubs changes), as determined in Section D below;
(b)	the sum of the yearly Salaries (as determined in accordance with Section E below and as allocated among Clubs in accordance with this Section C) attributable to that Contract Year of all Players under a Uniform Player’s Contract with the Club for that Contract Year (including optionally assigned contracts); and
(c)	any other amount includible in or deductible from Actual Club Payroll as a result of the operation of Section C(2)(g) below or as a result of any Club, any Player and/or either of the Parties hereto having engaged in a transaction contrary to Section G(l) below or as a result of an award by the Arbitration Panel under Article XI and/or Section F below,
(2)	Rules for Allocation of Salary
(a)	General Rule
If a Player remains on a Major League Club’s Active List (as defined in Article XXI) for an entire championship season, then all of the Salary attributable to the Contract Year in which that championship season falls shall be allocated to the Club’s Actual Club Payroll in that Contract Year.
(b)	Assignment of Contract
If a Uniform Player’s Contract is assigned by any means to another Major League Club, the assignor Club shall be allocated Salary through the date of the assignment and Salary shall begin being allocated to the assignee Club on the following day, regardless of the Player’s reporting date. Beginning with Player assignments after September 30, 2002, an assignor Club that pays cash consideration to defray all or part of the salary obligation of the
82
assignee Club for an assigned Player shall include such cash consideration in its Actual Club Payroll in the Contract Year in which the cash consideration is paid; provided, however, that any such cash consideration included as part of a Player assignment made during the 2006 Contract Year but not payable until the 2007 Contract Year shall be included in the assignor Club’s 2006 Actual Club Payroll to the extent that the assignee Club does not have equivalent salary obligations under Player contracts obtained in the assignment in the 2007 championship season or beyond. Any cash consideration that is, pursuant to the preceding sentence, included in the Actual Club Payroll of the payor Club shall be subtracted from the Actual Club Payroll of the payee Club in the same Contract Year in which it is added to the payor Club’s Actual Club Payroll.
(c)	Salary Increase Upon Assignment
If a Uniform Player’s Contract provides for an increase in Salary upon its assignment to another Major League Club, such increase shall be included in a Player’s Salary upon assignment and attributed to the Contract Year (or Years) in which it is to be paid. Any such increase in Salary attributable to the Contract Year during which the assignment occurred shall be allocated to the Actual Club Payrolls of the assignor and assignee Clubs pursuant to Section C(2)(b) above. Any such increase in Salary attributable to a later Contract Year shall be allocated exclusively to the assignee Club.
(d)	Contract Signed After Opening Day
If a Player first enters into a Uniform Player’s Contract with a Club after opening day of the championship season with a Base Salary payable over a full championship season, the Club shall include in Actual Club Payroll such pro rata portion of the Base Salary attributable to that Contract Year as the number of days that the Player was on the Club's Active List (as defined in Article XXI) bears to the number of days in the championship season. If such a Player has a Base Salary expressly payable only over the portion of the championship season that the Player is on the Club’s Active List, the Club shall include in Actual Club Payroll the entire Base Salary attributable to that Contract Year.
83
(c) Termination of Contract
(i)	If a Club terminates a Uniform Player's Contract that covers a single championship season, the Club shall include in its Actual Club Payroll for the Contract Year in which that season falls any Salary paid to that Player, either under this Agreement or a Special Covenant to the Contract (subject to any offset called for by this Agreement or a Special Covenant).
(ii)	If a Club terminates a multi-year Uniform Player’s Contract while it remains obligated to pay Salary under either this Agreement or a Special Covenant to the Contract, Salary shall be allocated to that Club for each Contract Year during which its obligation continues. Salary shall be attributed to each such Contract Year pursuant to this Article XXIII (subject to any offset called for by this Agreement or a Special Covenant). This attribution shall apply even if the Club pays the Salary in advance.
(f)	Split Contracts
The earnings of a Player signatory to a Split Contract shall be included in Actual Club Payroll at the total amount of the Player’s actual baseball earnings under that Contract from Major League Clubs (and from Minor League clubs, if any) for that Contract Year, subject to subparagraph (g) below.
(g)	Outright Assignment to a Minor League Club
If a Uniform Player’s Contract is assigned outright to a Minor League club, the Club shall exclude from its Actual Club Payroll such pro rata portion of the Salary attributable to that Contract Year as the number of days during the championship season that the Player was off the Major League Club’s 40-man roster bears to the number of days in the championship season; provided, however, that the above exclusion shall not apply to die Salary of any Player whose Contract has been assigned outright to a Minor League club for the purpose of defeating or circumventing the intention of the Parties as reflected by this Article XXIII.
84
D.	Benefits or Player Benefit Costs
(1)	Definition
The Clubs’ Benefits ar Player Benefit Costs for a particular Contract Year shall include the sums paid (or to be paid on a proper accrual basis for that Contract Year) by or on behalf of the Clubs for, to, or on behalf of present Players (and former Players when expressly noted) for:
(a)	Contributions to the Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan, in the full amounts called for by paragraph 5 of the Agreement Re: Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan (including contributions made on behalf of former Players and others);
(b)	Workers’ compensation premiums, payroll, unemployment compensation and social security taxes (including payments made on behalf of a Player released from a Contract that covers that Contract Year, provided that the Player’s Salary is included in a Club’s final Actual Club Payroll for that Contract Year);
(c)	Spring training allowances (as described in Article VII(C)), championship season meal and tip allowances (as described in Article VII(B)), All-Star Game expenses (as described in Article V1I(E)) and “in-season supplemental allowances” (as described in Article VI1(F));
(d)	Moving and traveling expenses (as described in Article VIII), including payments made to former Players in connection with relocations resulting from assignments while they were active Players;
(e)	Contributions (in their entirety) to the post-season Players’ pool as described in Article X;
(f)	The College Scholarship Plan (including payments made on behalf of former players); and
(g)	Player medical costs (i.e.. fees to doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers, and the drugs and other medical supplies for the treatment of Player injuries), but not including salaries of trainers or other Club personnel, or the costs of Club medical or training equipment, or any costs reimbursed or paid
85
for through workers’ compensation or any other medical insurance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount of Player medical costs included in “Benefits” may not increase by more than ten percent (10%) each Contract Year beginning with the increase from the 2002 to the 2003 Contract Year.
(2)	Limitation on Annual Increase
Notwithstanding the foregoing, beginning with the increase from the 2002 to the 2003 Contract Year, the annual rate of increase for Player Benefit Costs in any Contract Year may not exceed the annual rate of increase over that year in the combined “sum of the yearly Salaries” (described in Section C(l)(b) above) for all Clubs.
E.	Determination of Salary
The determination of a Player’s Salary for a particular Contract Year for the purposes of interpretation and application of this Article XXIII only shall be in accordance with the following rules.
(1)	General Rule
“Salary" shall mean the value of the total compensation (cash or otherwise) paid to a Player pursuant to the terms of a Uniform Player’s Contract, including any guarantee by the Club of payments by third parties, for a particular championship season. Consistent with the rules set out below, all compensation paid to a Player pursuant to the terms of a Uniform Player’s Contract shall be attributable to the Contract Year(s) in which the Player is required under the Contract to render services to a Club as a baseball player, regardless of how the compensation is characterized under the Contract.
(2)	Average Annual Value of Guaranteed Multi-Year Contracts
A Uniform Player’s Contract with a term of more than one (1) championship season (“Multi-Year Contract”) shall be deemed to have a Salary in each Guaranteed Year equal to the “Average Annual Value” of the Contract (plus any bonuses subsequently included by operation of Section E(4) below). “Average Annual Value” shall be calculated as follows: the sum of (a) the Base Salary in each Guaranteed Year plus (b) any portion of a Signing Bonus (or any
86
other payment that this Article deems to be a Signing Bonus) attributed to a Guaranteed Year in accordance with Section E(3) below plus (c) any deferred compensation or annuity compensation costs attributed to a Guaranteed Year in accordance with Section E(6) below shall be divided by the number of Guaranteed Years.
(3)	Signing Bonuses
Any Signing Bonus in a Uniform Player's Contract (and any other payment this Article deems to be a Signing Bonus) shall be attributed, pro rata, over the Guaranteed Years of the Contract. If a Contract contains no Guaranteed Years, the Signing Bonus shall be attributed in full to the first year of the Contract.
(4)	Performance, Award and Other Bonuses
(a)	Any amounts that are actually earned by a Player as Performance Bonuses, Award Bonuses or any other bonuses properly included in a Uniform Player’s Contract shall be included as part of the Player’s Salary in the Contract Year in which the service or performance giving rise to the Bonus was provided. Potential bonuses shall not be included in the Average Annual Value calculation made pursuant to Section E(2) above.
(b)	A Special Covenant in a Uniform Player’s Contract that provides that Player performance or achievement in one year of the Contract will increase the Base Salary in other year(s) of the Contract shall not be considered in the determination of Salary until the triggering event occurs (other than, if applicable, as a “potential bonus”), unless it is determined by the Arbitration Pane] that the Special Covenant was designed to defeat or circumvent the intention of the Parties as reflected in this Article XXIII. As long as such a finding is not made, the additional Base Salary triggered by the Special Covenant shall count as part of the Player’s Salary in the Contract Year(s) to which it is attributed by the Contract once the triggering event has occurred. Multi-Year Contracts shall not be recalculated on an Average Annual Value basis once the triggering event has occurred; the additional Base Salary shall be added to the Salary as originally calculated for the Contract Year in question.
87
(5)	Option Contracts
(a)	Definitions
(i)	A “Club Option Year” shall mean a championship season covered by a Uniform Player’s Contract in which the amount payable pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Contract becomes due or guaranteed at the election of the Club or by reason of specified performance by a Player. Club Option Years shall not be considered “Guaranteed Years.” In addition, any other championship season included in a Multi Year Contract that is not a Guaranteed Year shall be treated as a Club Option Year.
(ii)	A “Player Option Year” shall mean a championship season covered by a Uniform Player’s Contract: (A) in which the amount payable pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Contract becomes due or guaranteed at the election of the Player; or (B) that can be nullified by a Player for a reason other than those set forth in paragraph 7 of tlic Contract. A Player Option Year shall be considered a “Guaranteed Year” if, pursuant to the Player's right to elect or subject to his right to nullify, the terms of that year are guaranteed within the definition in Section A(8); provided, however, that a Player Option Year shall not be considered a Guaranteed Year if the payment the Player is to receive if he declines to exercise his option or nullifies the championship season is more than 50% of the Base Salary payable for that championship season.
(iii)	The parties recognize that Uniform Player’s Contracts have covered and may cover championship seasons that could be characterized under the above definitions as both “Club Option Years” and “Player Option Years” (hereinafter referred to as a “Mutual Option Year”). Salaries under any such Contract that cannot extend beyond the 2006 Contract Year shall be calculated as if the Mutual Option Year is a Player Option Year. Salaries under any such Contract that can extend beyond the 2006 Contract Year shall be calculated as if the Mutual Option Year is a Player Option Year unless, pursuant to subparagraph (c)(ii) below, the “Club Option Year Value” exceeds 122.5% of the “Highest Guaranteed Year Value” prior to the Mutual Option Year, or its substitute. In the latter event. Salaries under the Contract shall be calculated as if the Mutual Option Year is a Club
88
Option Year and the calculation called for in subparagraph (c)(i i)(B) below shall be made and the entire Signing Bonus shall be allocated over the Guaranteed Years prior to the Mutual Option Year.
(b)	Option Buyouts
(i)	General-Rule
(A) If a Uniform Player’s Contract contains a Club Option Year or a Player Option Year that is not deemed a Guaranteed Year pursuant to subparagraph (a)(ii) above and the Player is to receive consideration upon the non-exercise of that option or the nullification of a championship season (“Option Buyout”), then such Option Buyout shall be deemed a Signing Bonus. If a Uniform Player’s Contract contains an Option Buyout for a Club decision not to exercise a Club Option Year and an Option Buyout for a Player decision not to exercise a Player Option Year (or to nullify a championship season) that is deemed a Signing Bonus pursuant to this subparagraph (b)(i), then the higher Option Buyout payment shall be deemed the Signing Bonus.
' (B) If a Contract contains an Option Buyout relating to more than one Option Year, then only the Option Buyout that relates to the earliest Option Year in the Contract shall be deemed a Signing Bonus. If, however, the Player ultimately receives an Option Buyout that relates to an Option Year other than the earliest Option Year, that Option Buyout shall be included in Salary in the Contract Year covered by the option that was not exercised.
(ii)	Potential Adjustment to Payroll or Tax Refund
Notwithstanding subparagraph (b)(i) above, if the Player ultimately does not receive the Option Buyout, then for the Contract Year covered by that option, no portion of the Buyout shall be included in any Club's final Actual Club Payroll. In addition, any Club whose final Actual Club Payroll in a previous Contract Year had included that Buyout (or a portion thereof) may elect to:
89
(A)	receive a deduction (in the full amount of the Buyout included in previous Contract Years) in its final Actual Club Payroll in the Contract Year covered by that option; or
(B)	receive a distribution from the Competitive Balance Tax proceeds described in Section H(l) below in the amount of any Competitive Balance Tax paid by that Club for any Contract Year as a result of the previous inclusion of the Buyout in the Club’s final Actual Club Payroll.
(c)	Club Option Years
(i)	General Rule. If a Uniform Player’s Contract covers one or more seasons that are Club Option Years, the Player’s Salary for the championship seasons that are Club Option Years, if exercised, shall be the total of the Base Salary and any bonuses included by operation of Section E(4) above.
(ii)	Contracts Extending Into 2007 or Beyond. This subparagraph (ii) shall apply only to a Uniform Player’s Contract agreed to after September 30, 2002 that includes one or more Club Option Years that fall in the 2007 Contract Year or later.
(A)	Special Definitions. For the purposes of this subparagraph (ii) only, the following definitions shall apply:
“Club Option Year Value” shall be the Salary attributed to a Club Option Year under subparagraph (i) above, plus any potential bonuses (other than Award Bonuses) attributable to that Year, minus any Option Buyout that relates to that Club Option Year.
“Highest Guaranteed Year Value" shall be the sum of the Base Salary plus any attributed Signing Bonus, deferred compensation or annuity costs, plus any potential bonuses (other than Award Bonuses) in the Guaranteed Year of the Contract with the highest such sum; provided, however, that if the Highest Guaranteed Year Value is itself greater than 127.5% of the Average Annual Value of the Contract, then 127.5% of the Average Annual Value of the Contract shall be substituted for the Highest Guaranteed Year Value in the calculation called for by subparagraph (ii)(B) below.
90
(B)	Rule. If the Club Option Year Value exceeds 122.5% of the Highest Guaranteed Year Value, then the difference between the Club Option Year Value and 122.5% of the Highest Guaranteed Year Value shall be treated as a Signing Bonus in the calculation of the Contract’s Average Annual Value.
(C)	Potential Tax Refund. If a Club Option Year in a Uniform Player’s Contract subject to this subparagraph (ii) is not exercised, any Club (including a Club to which the Contract was assigned) that paid Competitive Balance Tax in a Contract Year in which that Club’s final Actual Club Payroll included an amount attributed under subparagraph (ii) shall receive a distribution from the Competitive Balance Tax proceeds described in Section H(l) below in the amount of any Competitive Balance Tax paid as a result of that attribution.
(d)	Plaver Option Years
(i)	If a Player fails to exercise or chooses to nullify a Player Option Year that is deemed a Guaranteed Year pursuant to Section E(5)(a)(ii) above, the difference between the amount paid to the Player under his Contract (including any Option Buyout payment) and the amount that has been attributed to Actual Club Payroll of a Club under that Contract shall be added to (or subtracted from) Actual Club Payroll in the Contract Year in which the Player Option Year falls. If the Contract has been assigned, the adjustment called for in the preceding sentence shall be made to the Actual Club Payroll(s) of the Club(s) to which Salary under that Contract had been attributed in any Contract Year. If a Player exercises or fails to nullify a Player Option Year that was not deemed a Guaranteed Year, the Player’s Salary in the Player Option Year shall be the difference between the Salary provided in the Player Option Year (including any earned bonuses) and the Option Buyout that had been attributed, in all previous Contract Years, to a Club pursuant to Section E(5)(b)(i) above.
(ii)	If a Player Option Year falls in the 2007 Contract Year or later, and the Base Salary (plus any attributed Signing Bonus, deferred compensation or annuity costs) in the Player Option Year (“Player Option Year Value”) is less than 80% of the Base Salary (plus any attributed Signing Bonus, deferred compensa
91
tion or annuity costs) in the Guaranteed Year with the smallest such figure before the first such Player Option Year (80% Figure), then the difference between the 80% Figure and the Player Option Year Value shall be allocated pro rata across the Guaranteed Years preceding the first such Player Option Year; provided, however, that if the 80% Figure is itself less than 75% of the Average Annual Value of the Contract (calculated as if the Player Option Year was not a Guaranteed Year), then the 80% Figure shall instead be 75% of the Average Annual Value calculation set out immediately above.
(iii)	Potential Tax Refund.' If a Player exercises or chooses not to nullify a Player Option Year subject to subparagraph (d)(ii) above, any Club (including a Club to which the Contract was assigned) that paid Competitive Balance Tax in any Contract Year in which that Club’s final Actual Club Payroll included an amount attributed under subparagraph (ii) above shall receive a distribution from the Competitive Balance Tax proceeds described in Section H(l) below in the amount of any Competitive Balance Tax paid as a result of that attribution.
(6)	Deferred Compensation
(a)	Definition	'
“Deferred Compensation” shall mean any Salary payable to a Player pursuant to a Uniform Player’s Contract in a Contract Year after the last championship season for which the Contract requires services as a baseball player to be rendered.
(b)	Attribution
(i)	Deferred Compensation shall be included in a Player’s Salary as if paid in the championship season to which it is attributed under a Uniform Player’s Contract. If a Contract does not attribute Deferred Compensation, the Contract shall be treated as if the Deferred Compensation was attributed equally to each of the Guaranteed Years in the Contract.
(ii)	If the Deferred Compensation is to be paid with interest at an effective rate that is within one and one-half percentage points of the Imputed Loan Interest Rate for the first Contract Year cov
92
ered by the Contract, then the Deferred Compensation shall be included at its stated value. Otherwise, the Deferred Compensation shall be included at its present value in the season to which it is attributed, said present value to be calculated by increasing any such payments by the Contract's stated interest rate, if any, and then reducing such payments back to their present value by applying as a discount rate the Imputed Loan Interest Rate for the first Contract Year covered by the Contract. If the terms of a Contract are confirmed by the Association and the Office of the Commissioner before the Imputed Loan Interest Rate for the first Contract Year covered by the contract is available, the Imputed Loan Interest Rate shall be the annual “Federal mid-term rate” as defined in section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code for the month preceding the month in which terms are confirmed. If a Uniform Player’s Contract uses the date or year in which a Player retires as a triggering event for the commencement of payment of the Deferred Compensation, it will be assumed for purposes of calculating Salary under this Article only that the Player retires on the day that he reaches age 40 or at the end of the Contract, whichever is later.
(c)	An “Annuity Compensation Arrangement” is an agreement in a Uniform Player’s Contract whereby the Club promises to purchase an annuity to pay the Player after he is no longer required to render services as a baseball player under such Uniform Player’s Contract.
(i)	The portion of the cost of the annuity to be paid by the Club while the Player is required to render services as a baseball player under the Contract shall be included as Salary for the Contract Year in which such cost is to be paid.
(ii)	The portion of the cost of the annuity instrument to be paid by the Club after the Player is no longer required to render services as a baseball player under such Contract, if any, shall be treated as Deferred Compensation attributable pro rata over the Guaranteed Years of the Contract at its present value as calculated pursuant to paragraph (6)(b) above. Any compensation that the Player is scheduled to receive pursuant to such Annuity Compensation Arrangement shall not be considered Salary or Deferred Compensation.
93
(7)	Loans to Players
For purposes of this Article XXIII, the following rules shall apply to any loans made by a Club to or at the direction of a Player.
(a)	If any such loan bears no interest rale or an effective interest rate more than one and one-half percentage points below the Imputed Loan Interest Rate, then an amount of “Imputed Income” as calculated pursuant to subparagraph (b) below shall be included in the Player’s Salary for each Contract Year that the loan remains unpaid. For any other loan, there shall be no “Imputed Income” (as defined in subparagraph (b) below) included in the Player’s Salary.
(b)	“Imputed Income” for each Contract Year covered by a Uniform Player’s Contract shall be calculated by .multiplying the difference between the Imputed Loan.Interest Rate and the stated rale, if any, by the outstanding balance of the Ioan.
(c)	If a Club has made a loan to a Player and forgives part or all of the loan, the forgiven loan amount shall be counted as Salary in the Contract Year in which the loan is forgiven; provided, however, that if a loan that is made after September 30, 2002 is forgiven in a Contract Year in which there is no Competitive Balance Tax, and if the Club forgiving the loan would have been assessed a Competitive Balance Tax for any Contract Year had the loan, by itself or in combination with other loans, been considered Salary from the outset, then the forgiveness of the loan shall be presumed to be an action designed to defeat or circumvent the Competitive Balance Tax. Unless the Club that forgave such a loan can rebut the foregoing presumption, the Club shall be required to pay into the Central Fund an amount equal to the Competitive Balance Tax(es) that the Club would have paid (based on the Tax Thresholds that were in effect when final Actual Club Payrolls were calculated for the Contract Year(s) in which a Competitive Balance Tax would have been paid) had the forgiven loan (or portion thereof) originally been considered Salaiy.
94
E Association’s Rights
(1)	Actual Club Payroll Information
(a)	On or before opening day of the 2003 championship season, the Office of the Commissioner shall provide the Association with a list for the 2002 Contract Year of each Club’s final Actual Club Payroll, broken down by Player, and 2002 Player Benefit Costs.
(b)	In each Contract Year in which the Competitive Balance Tax is operational, the Office of the Commissioner shall provide the Association with two “Preliminary Actual Club Payroll Compilations,” the first of which shall be provided within 14 days following opening day of that championship season and the second of which shall be provided within 14 days following that season’s All-Star Game. Each Preliminary Actual Club Payroll Compilation shall consist of a list of each Club’s Actual Club Payroll, broken down by Player, and an estimate of Player Benefit Costs for that Contract Year, as of opening day and the All-Star game, respectively. In addition to the above, the Association may, from time to time, request the Office of the Commissioner to produce a Preliminary Actual Club Payroll Compilation or any portion thereof (including the Office of the Commissioner evaluation of any Uniform Player’s Contract, the terms of which have been confirmed by the Association and the Office of the Commissioner) and the Office of the Commissioner shall provide such information within 14 days of each such request, provided that the Association will not make an unreasonable number of requests in any Contract Year.
(c)	Upon the presentation of any evidence that a Player and a Club are prepared to agree to a Uniform Player’s Contract, either Party to this Agreement (i.e., the Association or Office of the Commissioner) may initiate a process whereby the Parties prepare and exchange evaluations of that prospective Contract for Competitive Balance Tax purposes. The evaluations shall be exchanged within 48 hours of the initiation of the process by either Party.
(d)	The Office of the Commissioner shall provide the Association with a list of the final Actual Club Payrolls, broken down by Player, and Player Benefit Costs for that Contract Year and the Competitive Balance Tax assessed against each Club (“final Actual Club Payroll Compilation”), if any, for the just completed championship
95
season on or before the December 21 following each championship season covered by this Agreement in which the Competitive Balance Tax is applicable.
(2)	Association’s Rights to Challenge
(a)	Information Provided Pursuant to Section Ft 1 kb)
The Association shall have the right to question any calculation included in any information provided pursuant to Section F(l)(b) above and the Office of the Commissioner shall provide an answer to any such question within 10 days. If thereafter the Association disagrees with any calculation, it may file a challenge in the Grievance Procedure in Article XI at any time before the next November 30. At the request of either Party, any such Grievance shall be handled on an expedited basis, with documents being exchanged within 10 days of the filing of the Grievance, a hearing commencing within 15 days of the filing of the Grievance and the Panel issuing an Award (with opinion to follow, if necessary) no later than 15 days after the commencement of the hearing. Failure by the Association to challenge any such calculation shall not preclude the Association from challenging that calculation if contained in a final Actual Club Payroll Compilation nor shall such failure be of any relevance in such a challenge.
(b)	Information Provided Pursuant to Section F(l)(c)
The Association shall have the right to question any calculation included in any information exchanged pursuant to Section F(l)(c) above and the Office of the Commissioner shall provide an answer to any such question within 24 hours. If thereafter the Association disagrees with the calculation put forward by the Office of the Commissioner, it may file a challenge in the Grievance Procedure in Article XI within three business days. Any such Grievance shall be handled on an expedited basis, with documents being exchanged as soon as possible, a hearing commencing within three business days of the filing of the Grievance (or as soon thereafter as is practicable) and the Panel issuing an Award (with opinion to follow, if necessary) no later than three business days after the commencement of the hearing. Failure by the Association to challenge any such calculation shall not preclude the Association from challenging that cal
96
culation if contained in a final Actual Club Payroll Compilation, nor shall such failure be of any relevance in such a challenge. Failure by the Office of the Commissioner to raise or pursue with the Arbitration Panel any disagreement with the Association concerning information exchanged pursuant to Section F(l)(c) above shall be irrelevant to any challenge by the Association to any calculation.
(c)	Information Provided Puisuant to Section F(l)(d)
The Association may challenge any calculation included in information provided pursuant to Section F(l)(d) (the final Actual Club Payroll Compilation) by filing a Grievance pursuant to Article XI. If the Association disagrees with any calculation that affects the Competitive Balance Taxes assessed for that Contract Year, it shall file a Grievance within 45 days after it has received that Year’s final Actual Club Payroll Compilation and the notice of assessed Competitive Balance Taxes (see Section B(4)(a)). Failure by the Association to challenge any calculation included in a final Actual Club Payroll Compilation shall not preclude the Association from challenging that calculation if contained in a final Actual Club Payroll Compilation for a later Contract Year, nor shall such failure be of any relevance in such a challenge. Such a challenge, however, will not result in changes to Competitive Balance Tax amounts assessed for prior Contract Years.
Any Grievance challenging a final Actual Club Payroll Compilation shall be handled by the Parties on an expedited basis with documents being exchanged within 10 days of the filing of the Grievance, a hearing commencing within 15 days of the filing of the Grievance and the Panel issuing an Award (with opinion to follow, if necessary) no later than 15 days after the commencement of the hearing. The filing of a Grievance by the Association shall not preclude the Office of the Commissioner from assessing and collecting the Competitive Balance Tax in accordance with Section B and using Competitive Balance Tax proceeds in accordance with Section H, unless the Chairman of the Arbitration Panel, upon application by the Association, provides otherwise. Unless the Chairman provides otherwise, arty adjustments to the Competitive Balance Tax assessments and distributions made pursuant to Section F above necessitated by the resolution of an Association Grievance shall be
97
made by the Office of the Commissioner once the Grievance is finally resolved.
(d)	Relationship to Grievance Procedure
(i)	Nothing in this Section F is intended to affect the application of the Grievance Procedure to any other complaint involving the existence or interpretation of, or compliance with, this Article XXIII or any provision therein. Moreover, unless specifically modified by this Section F, it is intended that the provisions of Article XI will govern the resolution of disputes under this Article XXIII.
(ii)	It is agreed that the existence of the expedited procedures in this Section F will not prohibit either Party from arguing that another dispute subject to Article XI should be heard prior to any dispute related to this Article XXIII.
G.	Other Undertakings
(1)	Neither the Parties hereto nor any Club or any Player shall enter into any agreement, Uniform Player’s Contract or other transaction, that includes any terms designed to defeat or circumvent the intention of the Parties as reflected by this Article XXIII.
(2)	At the time a Club and a Player enter into any Uniform Player’s Contract, or at the time of the assignment of any Uniform Player’s Contract, there shall be no unreported understandings or agreements of any kind between the Player and the Club. No other understandings or agreements, whether made before or after the signing of the Uniform Player’s Contract or its assignment, shall be valid, recognizable or of any effect whatsoever, unless expressly set forth in a new or supplemental Uniform Player’s Contract executed by the Player and the Club and complying with this Agreement and the Major League Rules. (See “Supplemental Agreements” paragraph of the Uniform Player’s Contract.)
(3)	If a Club and a Player currently signatory to a Uniform Player’s Contract desire to modify or amend their contractual relationship, they must enter into a new Uniform Player’s Contract that covers the then current championship season or, if signed after the championship season has started, the next immediate championship

ARTICLE XXIV—The Revenue Sharing Plan
A, Definitions
(1)	“Financial Information Questionnaire,” or “FIQ,” shall mean the questionnaire completed by each of the Major League Clubs and submitted, together with audited financial statements, on an annual basis for each revenue sharing year to the Office of the Commissioner. A revenue sharing year is defined as the fiscal year of the championship season that falls in that year (and shall be referred to, for any specific revenue sharing year under this Article, as “2003,” “2004,” “2005,” etc., or the “2003 revenue sharing year,” the “20(M revenue sharing year,” etc.). From time to time, Clubs are also required by the Office of the Commissioner to supplement the FIQ by submitting additional information in a “Supplementary Information Questionnaire” (“SIQ”).
(2)	“Defined Gross Revenue” shall mean the aggregate operating revenues from baseball operations received, or to be received on an accrual basis, as reported by each Club on an annual basis in the Club's FIQ. “Baseball Operations” shall mean all activities of a Club that generate revenue, except those wholly unrelated to the business of Major League Baseball. Baseball Operations shall include (by way of example, but not by way of limitation):
(a)	an activity that could be conducted by a non-Club entity but which is conducted by a Club because its affiliation or con
100
nection with Major League Baseball increases the activity’s appeal; and
(b)	an activity from which revenue or value is received as a result of a decision or agreement to forego what otherwise would be Defined Gross Revenue,
(3)	“Central Revenue” shall mean all of the centrally-generated operating revenues of the Major League Clubs that are administered by the Office of the Commissioner or central baseball including, but not limited to, revenues from national and international broadcasting agreements (television, cable, radio and Internet), Major League Baseball Properties, Inc., Baseball Television, Inc., Major League Baseball Enterprises, Major League Baseball Advanced Media, Inc., the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, superstation agreements between the Commissioner’s Office and the Clubs whose games are transmitted on a distant signal (“Superstation Agreements”), the AllStar Game and national marketing and licensing.
(4)	“Local Revenue’’ shall mean a Club’s Defined Gross Revenue less its share of Central Revenue.
(5)	“Actual Stadium Expenses" shall mean the “Stadium Operations Expenses” of each Club, as reported on an annual basis in the Club’s HQ.
(6)	“Net Local Revenue” shall mean a Club’s Local Revenue less its Actual Stadium Expenses.
(7)	The “Base Plan” shall be a 34% straight pool plan. The amount of net payment or net receipt under the Base Plan for each Major League Club shall be determined as follows: Each Club contributes 34% of its Net Local Revenue to a putative pool; that pool is then divided equally among all Clubs, with the difference between each Club’s payment into the putative pool and its receipt therefrom producing the net payment or net receipt for that Club.
(8)	Those Clubs that receive net receipts in a given revenue sharing year under the Base Plan shall be referred to for that year as “Payee Clubs.” Those Clubs that make net payments in a given revenue sharing year under the Base Plan shall be referred to for that year as “Payor Clubs.”
101
(9)	The revenue sharing plan shall also have a “Central Fund Component” under which a portion of Major League Central Fund money will be reallocated from Payor Clubs to Payee Clubs. The amount of net payment or net receipt under the Central Fund Component for each Club shall be determined as follows:
(a)	Net Transfer Value. At 100% implementation, the net transfer value of the Central Fund Component, in each revenue sharing year, shall be 41.066% of the net transfer value of the Base Plan in that revenue sharing year. “Net transfer value” shall mean the sum of the amounts transferred from Payor Clubs to Payee Clubs.
(b)	Contributors and Recipients. During each revenue sharing year, Major League Central Fund money shall be reallocated from Clubs that are Payor Clubs for that revenue sharing year ("Contributors”). Distributions under the Central Fund Component for each revenue sharing year shall be made only to Clubs that: (i) are Payee Clubs for that revenue sharing year, and (ii) have a mean Net. Local Revenue for the, preceding three revenue sharing years that is below the industry’s mean Net Local Revenue for that three-year period (“Recipients").
tc) Calculation
(i)	Contributors. To determine the amount of Major League Central Fund money to be reallocated from each Contributor (at 100% implementation), multiply the Contributor’s mean Net Local Revenue for the preceding three revenue sharing years by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net transfer value of the Central Fund Component in that revenue sharing year and the denominator of which is the sum of the means of each Contributor’s Net Local Revenue for the preceding three revenue sharing years.
(ii)	Recipients. To determine the amount of Major League Central Fund money to be distributed to each Recipient (at 100% implementation), multiply the net transfer value of the Central Fund Component in that revenue sharing year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the difference between the industry’s mean Net Local Revenue for the preceding three revenue sharing years and the Recipient's mean Net Local
102
Revenue for that period, and the denominator of which is the sum of all such differences for each of the Recipients.
(d) Distribution. The Administrator, with each set of estimated payments under the Base Plan (see Section D(2)(a), below), shall disseminate to the Clubs an estimate of the reallocations and distributions to be made under the Central Fund Component for that revenue sharing year. Reallocations from the Contributors will be made by reducing the post-season distributions of the Major League Central Fund money those Clubs would have received during that revenue sharing year but for the operation of the Central Fund Component. Recipients shall receive their distributions of the Central Fund Component on December 1 of each revenue sharing year. Adjustments to these reallocations and distributions caused by changes in any Net Local Revenue figures shall be made at the time of the next distribution under the Base Plan.
(10)	The “Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund” shall consist of no more than $10 million in Major League Central Fund money that is raised equally from all Clubs for each revenue sharing year. The Commissioner may make distributions from the Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund to a Club or Clubs, in amounts and at times to be determined at the Commissioner’s discretion, subject to the following guidelines and procedures.
(a)	Guidelines. The Commissioner, in exercising this discretion, shall take no action that is inconsistent with the agreement of the Parties as reflected in this Agreement. By way of example, but not limitation, the Commissioner may not consider: (i) positions that a Club has taken with respect to any matter before the Clubs, the Executive Council or the Office of the Commissioner; (ii) a Club’s contracting decisions with respect to or contemplated offers to free agents or free agent eligible players; or (iii) whether a Club’s payroll is or has been above the Competitive Balance Tax threshold established in Article XXIII, above.
(b)	Procedures
(i)	Written Requests. Any Club seeking a distribution from the Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund shall submit a request in writing to the Commissioner. The written request
103
must include, but need not be limited to: (A) the amount requested; (B) the use(s) to which the Club intends to put the requested distribution; and (C) an explanation of how, in the Club’s view, the requested distribution should improve the Club’s performance on the field. The Commissioner shall respond in writing to each request for a distribution from the Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund.
(ii)	Consultation with the Association. The Commissioner shall, within 30 days of receiving a request pursuant to subparagraph (b)(i) above, provide to the Association a copy of the written request and his preliminary position on the request (e.g.. inclined to grant, might consider if modified, or not inclined to grant). The Commissioner shall, at the Association’s request, consult with the Association prior to making any distribution. At the Association’s request, the Commissioner shall also consult with the Association regarding a request that he is not inclined to grant in its current form. The Commissioner shall give notice to the Association at least 15 days prior to making any distribution, unless such notice is not possible under the circumstances. In such case, the Commissioner shall provide as much notice to the Association as is possible under these circumstances, but, in no event, shall any distribution be made without at least five (5) days’ written notice to the Association, As part of any such consultation process, the Commissioner shall provide the Association with the documents required to be produced pursuant to Section E(2)(k) of this Article and any document reasonably requested by the Association pursuant to Section E(2).
(iii)	Timing of Distributions. The Commissioner shall attempt to make distributions for a given revenue sharing year no later than December 1. If the Commissioner does not distribute the entirety of the Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund in any given revenue sharing year, the Commissioner shall distribute the remainder of the Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund to the Clubs on a pro rata basis before the close of the revenue sharing year. In no event may the Commissioner carry over any remaining funds in the Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund to a subsequent revenue sharing year.
104
(Il)	The “Administrator” shall be the representative (or representatives) responsible, in consultation with the Association, for administration of the revenue sharing plan under this Article. (See Section D, Administration, below.)
B.	General Principles
(1)	Intent of the Plan
The intent of the revenue sharing plan is to effect in each revenue sharing year the equivalent net transfer of revenue among the Clubs of $248,014 million at 100% implementation, based on 2001 “Payment 5” local revenue data, plus such net transfer as may result from distributions of the Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund.
(2)	Other Sharing
(a)	Gate Receipts. The functions formerly handled by the League Offices shall be funded in a substantially equivalent fashion as they have been in the past.
(b)	Central Revenue. Except as expressly provided in Sections A(9) and A(10) above, nothing in this Article is intended to alter current agreements among the Clubs pertaining to Central Revenue, including but not limited to, the Major League Central Fund, the Office of the Commissioner, Major League Baseball Properties, Inc., Baseball Television, Inc., Major League Baseball Enteqprises, Major League Baseball Advanced Media, Inc., the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, Superstation Agreements, the All-Star Game and national marketing and licensing. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence and except as expressly provided in Sections A(9) and A(10) above, the Office of the Commissioner shall take no action regarding the allocation or distribution of Central Revenue that is (i) in response to the operation of the revenue sharing plan or (ii) inconsistent with the manner in which the Commissioner has allocated or distributed Central Revenue in the past.
(3)	Accounting Rules
In calculating net payments and net receipts, the Administrator, on behalf of the Clubs, shall use the definitions contained in the 2002 FIQ, subject to the provisions of Section D below. The inten
105
tion is to continue to follow Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“the GAAP rules") in the adoption and application of revenue and expense definitions contained in the FIQ and to use GAAP or, in designated situations, federal tax principles, as the “default" standards in the accounting conventions, policies and practices reflected in the FIQ (and in any changes to any of the foregoing). It is acknowledged, however, that specific exceptions to the GAAP rules have been and will be warranted to ensure uniformity, consistency and fair treatment among the Clubs, subject to the provisions of Section D, below.
(4)	Interests of the Association
The revenue sharing plan may have a significant impact on the industry globally as well as on individual Clubs. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge that the Association has a significant interest in any aspect of any of the components of the revenue sharing plan or its operation materially alTecling either: (a) the overall industrywide transfer of revenue among Clubs; or (b) the amounts of payments made by individual Clubs and the amounts of receipts received by individual Clubs. This paragraph shall not be construed to limit the Association’s right to assert that it has other legitimate interests in the operation of the plan.
(5)	Other Undertakings
(a)	A principal objective of the revenue sharing plan is to promote the growth of the Game and the industry on an individual Club and on an aggregate basis. Accordingly, each Club shall use its revenue sharing receipts (from the Base Plan, the Central Fund Component and the Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund) in an effort to improve its performance on the field. The Commissioner shall enforce this obligation by requiring, among other things, each Payee Club, no later than April 1, to report on the performance-related uses to which it put its revenue sharing receipts in the preceding revenue sharing year. Consistent with his authority under the Major League Constitution, the Commissioner may impose penalties on any Club that violates this obligation.
(b)	The Clubs and the Association recognize that the participation of two Clubs is necessary for the production of the on-field
106
competition that the Clubs sell to the public. The net payments and net receipts required by this Article XXIV reflect a continuation of the amounts paid directly to the visiting Clubs and are in recognition of the principle that visiting Clubs should share, and in fact traditionally have shared, in the economic benefits jointly generated by the Game at another Club’s home field.
(c)	None of the Parties hereto shall enter into any agreement, or engage in any transaction or other conduct, designed to defeat or circumvent the intentions of the Parties as reflected in this Article XXIV.
C.	Implementation

The Base Plan shall be fully implemented in each year of this Agreement.
(2)	Central Fund Component
Under the Central Fund Component, in 2003, the amounts reallocated from the Contributors and the amounts distributed to the Recipients shall be 60% of those produced at full (100%) implementation. In 2004, the reallocations and distributions, respectively, shall be 80% of those produced at full implementation. The Central Fund Component shall be fully implemented in 2005 and 2006.
(3)	Commissioner's Discretionary Fund
The Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund shall be fully implemented in each year of this Agreement.

Dear Don:
I understand that the Players Association has expressed concern that the Commissioner might take some action pursuant to Article XI(A)(l)(b) of the Basic Agreement which could negate rights of Players under the new Basic Agreement. While I have difficulty seeing that this is a real problem, I am quite willing to assure the Association that the Commissioner will take no such action.
Sincerely,

Dear Gene:
The Players Association has consistently maintained that a centralized effort by the Office of the Commissioner and/or the Clubs to reduce the number of Major League Clubs is a mandatory subject of bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”). The Clubs, on the other hand, have consistently taken the position that such action is a permissive subject of bargaining under the NLRA. Without resolving this difference of opinion, the Parties have reached certain agreements on this topic during the negotiations over a successor Basic Agreement. Those agreements are reflected in Article XV(H) (Future Contraction) of the new Basic Agreement. The Parties agree, by this letter, that their agreement on this topic and the bargaining that preceded it shall not be used by either party as evidence that the topic is or is not a mandatory subject of bargaining in any subsequent litigation, including any grievance or NLRB proceeding.
Very truly yours,
Robert D. Manfred, Jr.

Re: Central Tender Letter

Pursuant to Article XX(A) of the Basic Agreement and paragraph 10(a) of the Uniform Player's Contract (“UPC”), the Clubs hereby tender contracts to the following players for the term of the next year as follows:

Accordingly, the following players have not been tendered contracts for the term of the next year:

This will set forth the understanding of the Parties regarding the last paragraph of Article XX(A) of the Basic Agreement and, specifically, the exercise of free agency rights by Players on Restricted, Suspended, Disqualified, Ineligible, Voluntarily Retired or Military Lists:
I.	A Player who properly has been placed on a Restricted List for either failing to report to his Club or failing to contract with it, or who properly has been placed on a Disqualified List for failure to render his services to his Club, shall be eligible to become a free agent as provided in Article XX, if otherwise qualified as set forth therein. Upon becoming a free agent, such Player shall automatically be removed from the Restricted or Disqualified List and reinstated to active status.
2.	A Player who properly has been placed on a Disqualified List for a reason other than that stated in paragraph 1 above, or who properly has been placed on a Suspended, Ineligible, Voluntarily Retired or Military List, shall also be eligible to become a free agent as provided in Article XX, but he shall not be eligible to sign or play with a new Club until removed from such List and reinstated to active status.
ATTACHMENT 11
This will set forth the understanding of the Parties regarding Article XX(A) of the Basic Agreement and, specifically, the obligations of Clubs to tender Contracts to and renew Major League Contracts of Players on Restricted, Suspended, Disqualified, Ineligible, Voluntarily Retired or Military Lists:
1.	The Clubs’ obligations to tender and renew Contracts, as set forth in paragraph 10(a) of the Uniform Player’s Contract, shall apply with regard to any Player who, at the applicable time, is on a Restricted List for either failing to report to his Club or failing to contract with it, or is on a Disqualified List for failure to render his services to his Club, Should a Club fail to so tender or renew a Contract, the Player shall become a free agent without any restrictions or qualifications, and he automatically shall be removed from the Restricted or Disqualified List.
148
2.	With regard to any Player who is on a Disqualified List for a reason other than that stated in paragraph 1 above, or is on a Suspended, Ineligible, Voluntarily Retired or Military List, the Clubs shall not be obligated to tender or renew a Contract until the Player is removed from such List and reinstated to active status. If a Player is removed from such List during a period beginning on December 10 and extending through the next championship season, the Club shall tender a Contract to hint within 10 days following such removal. Thereafter, should the Club and the Player fail to agree upon the terms of a new Contract within 10 days after the Player’s receipt of the tendered contract, the Club shall be obligated, within the next 5 days, to renew the Player’s prior Major League Contract, provided, however, that if the tender is made during the period beginning on December 10 and ending on the next March I, the renewal period shall be as set forth in paragraph 10(a) of the Uniform Player’s Contract. Should a Club fail to tender or renew a Contract as provided in this paragraph, the Player shall become a free agent without any restrictions or qualifications.
ATTACHMENT 12
This will set forth the understanding of the Parties regarding Article XX(A), of the Basic Agreement:
With respect to a Minor League Player with no existing Major League Contract, whose Minor League contract has been assigned to a Major League Club, it is understood that the placing of such a Player on the Major League Club’s Active Reserve List (40-man Roster) and the tendering to such a Player of a Major League Contract without die necessity of renewing the Minor League contract will provide the Major League Club with reservation rights to such a Player. Thus, such a Player will not become a free agent under Article XX(A)(2)(d), which provides that a Player will become a free agent if his Club fails to exercise its contract renewal rights, there being no prior Major League Contract to renew.

the Documents will execute an Acknowledgment, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1.
7.	The Documents and all photocopies thereof shall be returned to the Clubs within 30 days after a successor Basic Agreement to the
152
new Basic Agreement is executed by the Clubs and the Association, along with a written representation that no copies have been retained. The Association shall be entitled to retain all Work Product.

3.	TESTING
A.	Steroids
1.	During the 2003 season (which shall include spring training but not include the post season), all Players will be subject to two tests (one initial test and one follow-up test conducted not less than five and not more than seven days following the initial test) at unannounced times for the presence of Schedule JU steroids (“Survey Testing”). In addition, the Office of the Commissioner shall have the right to conduct additional Survey Testing in 2003 in which up to 240 players, selected at random, may be tested.
2.	If the results of the Survey Testing conducted in 2003 show that more than 5% of Players tested test positive for Steroids, all Players will be subject to two unannounced tests (an initial test and a followup test five to seven days later) for Steroids during the 2004 season (“Program Testing”). If a Player tests positive in the Program Testing, he shall immediately be placed on the Clinical TYack and shall be subject to discipline for further violations. The Program Testing shall continue for each season until less than 2.5% of Players tested test positive for Steroids for two consecutive seasons combined.
3.	If the results of the Survey Testing conducted in 2003 show that 5% or fewer of the Players tested test positive for Steroids, all Players will be subject to two unannounced Survey Tests (one initial test and one follow-up test conducted not less than five and not more than seven days following the initial test) for Steroids during the 2004 season. In
161
addition, the Office of the Commissioner shall have the right to conduct additional Survey Testing in 2004 in which up to 240 players, selected at random, may be tested.

4.	At the time the collector takes the initial sample, he shall inform the Player that the player should cease using any over-the-counter supplements for at least seven days. If the Player tests positive for a Steroid in the follow-up test, such test result may not be disputed on the ground that its result was based on the consumption of an over-the-counter supplement.
5.	If, in either the Survey Testing or the Program Testing, a Player tests positive in the initial test for a Steroid and such positive test cannot be a result of the Player taking an over-the-counter supplement, the initial test shall be considered a positive result regardless of the outcome of the follow-up test.
6.	In all seasons covered by the Basic Agreement, there will be a minimum of Survey Testing.
7.	The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that the provisions of Section 3.A.1-3 shall, in all events, not survive the expiration of the Basic Agreement.

Begin again with another sealed kit in order to collect the 60 ml. Note: Problem Collection Log must be completed.
Collector must tell the donor the following:
“You must watch me as I pour the sample into the bottles and seal them.”
6.	Place bottle caps on specimen bottles. Ensure that caps are on tight to prevent leakage.
173
7.	Complete the bottle custody seals for the “A” and “B” samples as follows;
Ask the donor to verify that the specimen ID numbers on the top right side of the chain-of-custody form match those on the security seals.
8.	Peel the back off the bottle custody seals and place over the bottle caps and down the sides of the bottles.
9.	Have donor initial and date the security seal.
10.	Check the specific gravity of the urine remaining in the cup, and record the findings on the chain of custody. Specific Gravity must be 1.010 or higher.
11.	If the specimen does not meet these standards, it will be processed anyway and the donor shall be required to provide additional specimens until these requirements are met. ONLY THE SAMPLE MEETING THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL BE SENT FOR TESTING ALONG WITH THE FIRST SAMPLE. Collector shall make a notation on Problem Collection Log.
12.	Read the Donor Certification statement aloud to the donor, in the DONOR AFFIDAVIT section of the Chain-of-Custody form:
“I certify that the specimens) sealed with the above specimen ID number was provided by me on this date and the speci-men(s) has not been altered.”
13.	After Collector has read this statement to the donor, player must sign and date form.
14.	Collector shall read and sign the COLLECTOR AFFIDAVIT (bottom of page). Collector shall print his name, date of collection and time of collection.

Dear Rob:
The Clubs, throughout this round of negotiations, have consistently maintained that the Commissioner’s effort to regulate industry debt is not a mandatory subject of bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act. We, on the other hand, have consistently taken the position that it is.
In furtherance of the negotiations on an overall Basic Agreement, you will today be proposing debt regulations, contingent upon a prior acknowledgment by the Association that the proposal and any discussion that it may generate, including any subsequent counterproposals, are without prejudice to the Clubs’ legal position on bargainability. The Association, by this letter, provides that acknowledgement. It agrees that the proposal and discussions shall not be used as evidence by the Association that the topic of debt regulation is a mandatory subject of bargaining in any subsequent litigation, including any grievance or NLRB proceeding.
This acknowledgment and agreement is, of course, without prejudice to the Association’s position that the topic is a mandatory one.
Sincerely,
Eugene D. Orza

Re:	Debt Regulation
Dear Michael:
This letter will memorialize our additional understandings on debt regulation, and shall be considered an agreement between the Association and the Clubs within the meaning of Article XI (A)(1)(a) of the Basic Agreement.
First, the parties agree that the Panel cannot resolve disputes concerning the meaning, interpretation or application of the Debt Service Rule without resort to its bargaining history, which reflects understandings that significantly inform the meaning of the Rule as intended by the parties.
Second, our negotiations over and agreement to the Debt Service Rule, which we agree will become an attachment to the new Basic Agreement, are both subject to the agreement reflected in Attachment 20. Moreover, the parties reserve their legal positions regarding the bargaining status of any action taken by the Commissioner pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Debt Service Rule.
Third, during the three-year Automatic Grace Period set out in Section 3.2 of the Debt Service Rule, the Commissioner will continue to enforce the 60/40 Rule as he has done in the past. In particular, the Commissioner will continue during the Automatic Grace Period to enforce the 60/40 Rule in a manner that does not affect any Club’s Major League Player contracting decisions.
Fourth, following the 2005 fiscal year, and no later than May 15, 2006, the Commissioner shall determine whether he desires to retain the Debt Service Rule. If the Commissioner elects to retain the Debt Service Rule, the Commissioner shall immediately rescind the 60/40 Rule and inform the Clubs and the Association that the 60/40 Rule is no longer in effect. If the Commissioner decides not to retain the Debt
190
Service Rule, he shall immediately inform the Clubs and the Association that the Debt Service Rule is no longer in effect.
Fifth, it was the parties’ intention, in agreeing to the Debt Service Rule, to ensure that each individual Club has or would have sufficient resources to support its level of debt or proposed debt, as opposed to an intention to limit or reduce the amount that the Clubs or a particular Club could spend on Player salaries.
Sixth, during the term of this Agreement, and subject to Paragraph 7.1 of the Debt Service Rule, the Commissioner shall adopt no other form of debt regulation.
Sincerely,
Office of the Commissioner

ATTACHMENT 22
DEBT SERVICE RULE
Section 1.	The Rule. Subject to the transition rules set out below, no Club may maintain more Total Club Debt than can reasonably be supported by its EBITDA. A Club’s Tbtal Club Debt cannot reasonably be supported by its EBITDA if Total Club Debt exceeds the product of the average of that Club’s EBITDA over the most recent three years multiplied by the Cash Flow Multiplier applicable to that Club.
Section 2.	Definitions. Subject to the amendment procedures set out in Section 7.1 below, the following definitions shall be utilized in the administration of the Debt Service Rule:
(a)	EBITDA, “EBITDA" means a Club’s earnings for its fiscal year, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as calculated and reported in accordance with Part IV(B), Line 5 of the annual Financial Information Questionnaire (“FIQ”), which each Club must submit to the Office of the Commissioner after the close of each fiscal year. For the purposes of this Debt Service Rule, each Club shall calculate its annual EBITDA net of the Club’s net receipts or net payments under any revenue sharing arrangements then in effect .among the Major League Clubs.
(b)	Total Club Debt. “Total Club Debt” means a Club’s total outstanding debt, calculated as an average over the course of each fiscal year, including without limitation all long-term and short-term obligations and all indebtedness resulting from: (1) funding from Major League Baseball’s industry credit facility; (2) other third-party debt; (3) deferred compensation (other than deferred compensation payable to Major League Players (see clause (8) below)); (4) stadium-related debt incurred for or in connection with ballpark construction or improvements; (5) loans or advances from related parties, but only if those loans or advances are collateralized by the assets of the Club; and
192
(6)	any other debt that is properly classified as an indebtedness of the Club under generally accepted accounting principles, but excluding (7) the Excludable Debt and (8) any compensation payable to Major League Players, including deferred compensation or any other commitment under a Uniform Player’s Contract, or any obligation to the Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan or the Industry Growth Fund. In 2003, “Excludable Debt” shall be the first twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) in outstanding debt from any of the sources described in clauses (1)(6) above and shall grow in each succeeding year by the percentage growth in the industry’s Net Defined Local Revenue plus the Clubs' net Central Fund distribution in that fiscal year.
(c)	Cash Flow Multiplier, “Cash Flow Multiplier” means the number to be multiplied by the average of a Club’s EBITDA over the most recent three years in order to determine the maximum Total Club Debt that reasonably can be supported by that Club’s EBITDA. The Cash Flow Multiplier shall be ten (10), except that any Club which incurs (or has incurred within the last ten years) stadium-related debt to finance construction of a new ballpark or the major renovation of its existing ballpark may use a Cash Flow Multiplier of fifteen (15) for the first ten (10) fiscal years after that ballpark’s opening or re-opening.
(d)	Accounting Rules. Each Club’s reporting and accounting practices relevant to an evaluation of its compliance with the Debt Service Rule shall be subject to the Commissioner’s review and approval. Unless otherwise provided in this Rule, when accounting for and reporting on Total Club Debt and EBITDA for purposes of the Debt Service Rule, the Clubs shall comply with the revenue and expense definitions and the accounting conventions, policies and practices reflected in the then-current version of the FIQ. The Commissioner reserves the right to modify the FIQ reporting requirements as they relate to the Debt Service Rule.

Re:	Licensing
Dear Don:
During the course of the negotiations for a new Basic Agreement, the Major League Baseball Players Association (“MLBPA”) and the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball (“the Office of the Commissioner”) at times discussed a number of matters relating to the parties’ respective licensing and sponsorship businesses. Among the matters discussed were the potential resolution of certain disputes, areas for potential cooperative endeavors between the parties (including the area of memorabilia and game used merchandise) and the possibility of the Office of the Commissioner purchasing certain portions of the MLBPA’s licensing and sponsorship businesses unrelated to trading cards. Those discussions have yielded some agreements that will be included as part of the Basic Agreement but other areas remain open. Accordingly, we have agreed as follows:
(1)	No later than October 8,2002, the parties shall exchange lists of subjects for further discussion relating to their licensing and sponsorship businesses.
(2)	No later than October 31, 2002, the patties shall exchange relevant financial information and a full description of the rights each party controls in this area.
(3)	No later than November 15, 2002, a committee of representatives from the MLBPA and the Office of the Commissioner (“the Licensing Subcommittee”) shall meet to discuss the subjects identified by the parties pursuant to paragraph 1 above.
(4)	The Licensing Subcommittee shall be composed of at least two, but no more than four, representatives of the MLBPA and at least two, but no more than four, representatives of the Office of the
200
Commissioner. One representative of the MLBPA shall be an Associate General Counsel of that organization and one representative of the Office of the Commissioner shall be a senior representative from the Labor Relations Department.
(5)	The Licensing Subcommittee shall meet with appropriate frequency during the period between November 15, 2002 and Opening Day 2003 in a good faith effort to reach an agreement.
(6)	If no agreement is reached by Opening Day 2003, the Licensing Subcommittee may continue to meet by mutual consent. Absent such mutual consent, the parties’ obligations under this agreement shall be deemed discharged as of Opening Day 2003.
I would ask that you sign a copy of the letter below to indicate your agreement with these terms.
Very truly yours,
Robert D. Manfred, Jr.

Re: World-Wide Draft
Dear Don:
During the negotiations for a new Basic Agreement, the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball (“Office of the Commissioner”) and the Major League Baseball Players Association (“Players Association") agreed that the First-Year Player Draft should be expanded to cover all players who are first entering Major League or Minor League baseball, regardless of u player's residence. In the course of those discussions, however, it became apparent that there was insufficient time for the type of deliberation and negotiation necessary to reach agreement on the many issues posed by such a significant change in the First-Year Player Draft.
The parties agreed, therefore, that the matters which were left unresolved in bargaining would, within the time frame established below, be addressed by a committee of representatives of the Players Association and the Office of the Commissioner in an attempt to forge a comprehensive agreement on a world-wide draft. The parties further agreed that if, despite their good faith efforts, the committee process did not result in such a comprehensive world wide draft agreement, the existing draft rules and procedures, including those Major League Rules changes made pursuant to the new Basic Agreement, would remain in effect for the balance of the new Basic Agreement, unless later modified by the agreement of the parties.
More specifically, we have agreed that:
1.	No later than October 15, 2002, a committee of representatives from the Players Association and the Office of the Commissioner (“World-Wide Draft Subcommittee”) will begin discussions related to the implementation of a world-wide draft.
202
2.	The World-Wide Draft Subcommittee shall be composed of an equal number of representatives of the Players Association and the Office of the Commissioner, and shall include at least one Associate General Counsel of the Players Association and at least one senior representative of the Labor Relations Department of the Office of the Commissioner.
3.	In its deliberations, the World-Wide Draft Subcommittee shall consider all issues relating to the acquisition of players through a world-wide draft system, including but not limited to:
(a)	the number of rounds of the world wide draft, which number shall be at least 20 and not more than 38;
(b)	the appropriate eligibility age for players residing in countries that do not play organized high school baseball;
(c)	a structure to ensure or provide for the development of players who reside in countries that do not play organized high school baseball prior to their eligibility for the draft, including but not limited to the issue of maintaining and/or developing baseball academies;
(d)	the benefits to be provided to some or all players signed following selection in a world-wide draft;
(e)	the procedures governing whether and, if so, how players opt in and out of the world-wide draft;
(f)	the date on which the world-wide draft shall be held each year;
(g)	the disproportionate allocation of selection rights designed to improve competitive balance;
(h)	the assignability of selection rights, negotiation rights and/or the contracts of First-Year Players, including any restrictions on such assignment rights;
(i)	the compensation that is awarded when a Club does not sign a player selected in the First-Year Player Draft;
(j)	the compensation that is awarded pursuant to Article XX(B)(4) of the Basic Agreement;
203
(k)	a fixed signing deadline for selected players, particularly as such a deadline relates to the “draft and follow” concept;
(1)	special draft rules regarding players from countries with which United States residents and institutions are prohibited or restricted from doing business;
(m)	the operation of player protocols between the Office of the Commissioner and other professional baseball leagues;
(n) whether the world-wide draft should be implemented commencing with the June 2003 or the June 2004 First-Year Player Draft; and
(o) any other matters that the parties agree are appropriately discussed in the World-Wide Draft Subcommittee process.
This will also confirm that certain matters will not be revisited by the World-Wide Draft Subcommittee. Specifically, the parties agreed that there should be a world-wide draft, leaving only the many issues relating to the implementation and operation of such a draft to the Subcommittee. Further, the parties agreed that the draft would be not less than 20 and not more than 38 rounds.	■
