1.3	During the life of this Agreement, the Employer agrees not to and expressly waives any right it may have to withdraw recognition concerning, or in any other way to challenge the inclusion in the bargaining unit of any classification or job titles which are currently included in the unit on the grounds that they are or may be supervisors or supervisory. This does not apply to any change in the supervisory status of an individual employee that occurs as a result of a change in duties or a reconfigured position. This provision shall continue in full force and effect after the expiration of this Agreement and up to and including July 1, 2012 and be enforceable through the grievance and arbitration provision.

5.2	Part-time Employee. An employee who is regularly scheduled to work on a continuing basis less than forty (40) hours per week or less than eighty (80) hours within a fourteen (14) day period and who has successfully completed the required probationary period.
5.3	Temporary Employee. An employee hired to work during any period when additional work of any nature requires a temporarily augmented work force or in the event of an emergency, or to relieve regular employees because of illness, leave of absence, or to work during holidays or vacation periods. Temporary employees shall include employees scheduled on a "per diem/on call" basis. Temporary employees are excluded from the Union’s bargaining unit and are not covered by this Agreement.
5.4	Probationary Employee. An employee who has been hired by the Employer on a full-time or part-time basis and who has been continuously employed by the Employer for less than ninety (90) calendar days. After ninety (90) calendar days of continuous employment, the employee shall attain regular status unless specifically advised by the Employer in writing of an extended probationary period not to exceed an additional ninety (90) days. Any extension of the probationary period will not adversely impact the accrual of, or eligibility for, or utilization of benefits. During the probationary period, an employee may be discharged without notice and without recourse to the grievance procedure.
5.5	Month and Year. For purposes of this Agreement and the method of computing sick leave, annual leave and seniority, a "month" shall be defined as 173.3 hours of work, and a "year" shall be defined as 2080 hours of work. Low census hours shall count toward the accrual of benefits, longevity steps and seniority. For purposes of computing longevity (wage) steps, a "year" shall be defined as 1664 hours of work or twelve (12) months, whichever comes last.
Time paid for, but not worked (excluding stand-by pay) shall be regarded as time worked for purposes of computing wages and benefits. Time worked which is paid on an overtime basis shall count as time worked for purposes of computing wages and benefits not to exceed 2080 hours within any twelve (12) month period.
5
5.6	Regular Rate of Pay. The regular rate of pay shall be defined to include the employee's hourly wage rate (11.1), shift differential when the employee is regularly scheduled to work an evening or night shift (11.2), and lead pay when the employee has a designated lead position (11.6).
5.7	Contract Rate. The contract rate of pay shall be defined to be the employee's hourly wage rate (11.1) only.
ARTICLE 6	- SENIORITY
6.1	Seniority Definition. Seniority is defined as an employee’s continuous length of service as a Tech in the bargaining unit based upon hours worked with the Employer from most recent date of hire or from the most recent date in the bargaining unit, which ever came last. Seniority shall not apply to an employee until completion of the required 90-day probationary period. Length of service as an employee of the Swedish Medical Center shall be used to determine annual leave and sick leave accruals.
6.2	Termination. Seniority shall terminate upon cessation of the employment relationship; for example, discharge, resignation, acceptance of severance benefits, retirement, eighteen (18) consecutive months of layoff subject to Article 7.6, or failure to comply with recall procedures specified by the Employer. When seniority terminates, the employee shall, if ever re-employed, be regarded as a new employee.
ARTICLE 7	- LAYOFF, RESTRUCTURING AND RETRAINING
Swedish Medical Center and the Union are committed to working together within a system where employees will have continued job security within reason given any restructuring Swedish experiences. At the same time, it is understood that management needs to define the patterns of work and scheduling so that hospital needs are met. In order to demonstrate these commitments, the Employer and Union have agreed upon the following steps:
In applying this article, reassignments or transfers shall not be subject to the posting provisions of Article 8.4.
7.1	Layoff. When management finds it necessary to permanently reduce FTEs, layoff, or eliminate positions, it will look at the overall area and needs which could include redesigning the work or phasing out unnecessary work. The Union and employees subject to potential layoff will be notified thirty (30) days in advance (or pay in lieu thereof to the employee) of the possibility of reductions except for unforeseeable conditions preventing such notice which are beyond the Employer’s control. During this thirty (30) day period the Employer will reserve any openings for jobs that are in the affected classifications, classifications common to any applicable occupational groups, and any open position for which the employer determines the employees may be qualified, in order to afford the greatest possible opportunity to locate positions for displaced employees. In the event that departmental or area reduction in personnel is determined to be necessary (rather than a
6
reduction in hours as specified in section 10.4.1), seniority of those employees in the affected job classification or occupational group shall be the determining factor in determining which employees shall be displaced, providing skill, ability, experience, performance and/or quality of work are substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer. Departments will be defined and identified by the Employer. Agency employees on the affected unit will be the first to be released. The Employer shall be the judge in assessing the above factors and qualifications.
Occupational groups will continue to be discussed in Labor Management Committee Meetings. Specific groups will be identified as needed in conjunction with the change team process.
7.2	Notification. A meeting between all employees and the manager will occur. Any employee has the opportunity at any time to do skills evaluation with Human Resources.
7.3	Employee Options. A meeting between the manager and employees occupying position(s) affected by the change will be held. Employees will be offered vacant positions for which they qualify (in the opinion of the Employer) within the department and will have up to three (3) days to accept or decline the offer.
7.3.1	Skills Evaluation. If the affected employee is still without a regularly scheduled position or has a permanently reduced regularly scheduled position, a skills evaluation will be scheduled with Human Resources. The managers and Human Resources will evaluate all current and known upcoming vacancies in other departments. The employee’s current skills and training needs will be assessed. The employee will be given preference for any positions for which he/she qualifies as determined by the Employer.
7.3.2	Oriented / Trained. An employee will be considered eligible for a vacant position if, in the Employer’s opinion, the employee can become oriented/trained to the vacant position within four (4) weeks. If the employee has not achieved a satisfactory level of performance in the judgment of the Employer within four (4) weeks, the employee will be subject to layoff.
7.3.3	Comparable Job. An employee, who has rejected a job offer where any of the following apply, will not forfeit their right to: a) continued preference for open positions for which they are qualified; or b) severance pay; or, c) layoff:
1)	The FTE of the offered position is more than a .2 FTE reduction;
2)	The base pay of the position is greater than a ten percent (10%) reduction;
3)	The change in the start of the shift is greater than two (2) hours;
An employee who has rejected a job offer where any of the above does NOT apply, will be considered to have voluntarily resigned;
4)	An employee who has rejected a job offer that results in a loss of eligibility for employee medical coverage or dependant medical coverage may continue in preference for open positions for which they are qualified or request to be placed on the recall roster.
7.4	Layoff, Recall/Severance. If the employee is still without a regularly scheduled position after two (2) weeks (fourteen (14) calendar days) from notification in 7.2 above, and the employee has not rejected a job offer except as noted in 7.3.3 above, the employee is subject to
7
layoff with recall rights or severance pay.
7.5	Severance. Any employee choosing severance pay shall lose all seniority and shall not have
recall rights.
Years of Service

Severance Pay
2	weeks pay
3	weeks pay

5	weeks pay
6	weeks pay

7.6	Recall. Employees will be eligible for recall to open positions in their former classification, occupational group or for positions identified in the skills evaluation to which they could become oriented within four (4) to six (6) weeks. These employees shall retain their seniority for eighteen (18) months from the date of layoff. Employees desiring to retain eligibility must monitor job postings and inform the Human Resources office of their desire to compete for the position. If an employee rejects a comparable position, the provisions of Article 7.3.3 will apply.
7.7	Training. Retraining efforts benefiting bargaining unit employees would be accomplished through on-the-job training, or educational resources outside the workplace as determined appropriate by the Employer.
The training is to be accomplished during a period of up to four (4) to six (6) weeks, but this time frame could be extended at the option of the Employer.
7.8	Unit Merger and/or Restructure. The Employer will provide the Union with at least thirty (30) days advance notice prior to a unit merger or restructure.
In the event of a merger of two (2) or more units into a single unit or the restructure of a single unit, the Employer will determine the number of full-time and part-time FTEs by shift required for the new or restructured unit. Prior to determining the schedule on the affected unit the employer will meet with employees to receive input on their preferences.
ARTICLE 8	- EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES
8.1	Equal Opportunity. The Employer and the Union agree that conditions of employment shall be consistent with applicable state and federal nondiscrimination laws. The Employer and the Union shall not discriminate against any employee by reason of race, creed, age, color, sex, national origin, religious belief, marital status, sexual orientation, political ideology, ancestry, or the presence of any sensory mental or physical disability. Allegations of discrimination shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of Article 17 of this Agreement.
8
8.1.1	Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Where the requirements of the ADA conflict with this Agreement, the ADA shall supersede this agreement.
8.1.2	Consistent with Swedish Medical Center’s policy on disabled employees, if a new bargaining unit position can be created to accommodate an incumbent employee’s permanent disability, the Union agrees to waive seniority rights for that position. The position will not be posted, and the position will be offered to the disabled employee.
8.2	Notice of Resignation. Employees shall be required to give at least twenty-one (21) calendar days written notice of resignation. Failure to give notice shall result in loss of accrued annual leave. Failure to work the notice period, unless approved by the employee’s supervisor, shall result in loss of accrued annual leave, with the exception of previously scheduled and approved time off.
8.2.1	Notice of Termination. Employees who have completed the required probationary period shall receive twenty-one (21) calendar days notice of termination or three (3) weeks pay in lieu thereof, except in cases of discharge for just cause.
8.3	Discipline/Discharge. No full-time or part-time employee shall be disciplined or discharged
except for just cause. "Just cause" shall be defined to include the concept of progressive discipline (such as verbal and written reprimands and the possibility of suspension without pay). A copy of all written disciplinary actions shall be given to the employee. Employees shall be required to sign the written disciplinary action for the purpose of acknowledging receipt thereof. Progressive discipline shall not be applied when the nature of the offense requires immediate suspension or discharge. An employee may request the attendance of a union representative during any investigatory meeting which may lead to disciplinary action.
8.4	Recruitment and Selection. Swedish Medical Center will recruit and hire the most qualified applicants to meet the staffing needs of the Center and thereafter transfer, promote, and retain such persons as employees. All such actions and decisions shall comply with the Center's desire to promote from within whenever qualified candidates are identified, interested, and available.
8.4.1	Postings. The Employer will post job openings for a period of seven (7) calendar days prior to filling the job opening. Departments shall post job opportunities within their departments concurrently with the Human Resources posting.
8.4.2	Department Openings. Employees will be considered first and given preference for their departmental job opportunities. Examples of departments are: Surgical Services at First Hill campus, Medical Imaging at Cherry Hill campus, and Cardio Pulmonary at Ballard campus. If there are no departmental candidates who have applied (via the Employer’s internal transfer application process) within the seven (7) day posting period, other internal candidates will be considered for job openings prior to external applicants. Seniority shall be the determining factor in filling a job opening providing skill, ability, experience, past performance and/or quality of work are substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer. FTE, shift, shift length, and every weekend designation (if applicable) will be included in all job postings.
9
8.4.3	Employee Transfers. Employees shall be required to give at least twenty-one (21) calendar days written notice of transfer to their current manager. Whenever possible, the effective date of transfer should coincide with the start of a pay period, following the twenty-one (21) day notice period. Employee transfers will occur at the end of the twenty-one (21) day period, except under exceptional circumstances due to patient care considerations. Some examples of appropriate patient care considerations are that a department will go without enough staff to provide an essential skill set or patients will be diverted. Chronic staffing shortages will not be considered exceptional circumstances. If the transfer is not made in twenty-one (21) days the employee will be notified in writing. In any case the transfer will be made within ninety (90) days. Management will consider a variety of solutions, including the use of temporary coverage, to ensure that transfers occur in accordance with this section.
Employee’s who accept a transfer may not apply for another opening for a period of three (3) months from the effective date of the transfer unless approved by the employee’s manager.
8.4.4	Ninety-Day Performance Review. Employees transferring or reclassified to a new department or a new position shall be subject to a ninety (90) day period for performance review. This ninety (90) day period of performance review may be extended in writing by mutual consent. At any time during this performance review period, the Employer will notify the employee in writing of any deficiencies in performance. Except for situations involving safety issues, gross incompetence, or gross misconduct, the Employer will give two (2) weeks advance notice of performance deficiencies prior to terminating the employee from the new position. If the employee fails to meet standards of performance, as determined solely by the Employer, the employee will no longer be allowed to continue in that position. The employee will be eligible for reinstatement to the employee’s prior classification and prior department based upon available openings. If the employee is not reinstated due to the lack of an available opening, the employee will be treated as being on layoff status and subject to the recall provisions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.6.
This clause shall not apply to transfers within a job classification where the employee is to perform substantially the same duties as were performed in their former position.
8.4.5	FTE Changes. If an employee requests to increase his or her FTE, and the department manager approves, the above posting procedures (Article 8.4) will apply. Just the approved FTE increase would be posted.
If an employee requests to decrease his or her FTE, the employee must submit the request in writing to their manager. The request should indicate that they are requesting to give up that portion of their FTE on a permanent basis. The manager must approve any FTE decrease. An FTE decrease does not need to go through the posting process described herein. Examples of considerations of the impact of an FTE decrease are benefit eligibility and tuition assistance.
8.5	Certification/Registration. All employees subject to this Agreement should seek continuous advancement in their performance, productivity, skills, and knowledge which may
10
include certification or registration. Failure to achieve this objective within a reasonable period of time may adversely affect an employee's opportunity for continued employment with the Employer. Attaining these objectives will be considered in regard to promotional opportunities.
8.6	Evaluations. The Employer shall maintain an annual employee evaluation system.
8.7	Uniforms/Personal Grooming. Uniforms shall be neat, clean and presentable. Employees' personal grooming will adhere to Swedish Medical Center policies. Such policies shall be uniformly applied to all employees of the Employer.
8.8	Personnel Records. Personnel records will be maintained by the organization for each employee. Information retained by the organization will include: employment application and supporting materials, performance appraisals, records of payroll activity, licensure and training records, letters of commendation and recognition, and records of disciplinary action. By appointment, employees may inspect their Human Resources records on the next business day (24 hours). Every effort will be made to make all other records available within 72 hours. If records cannot be made available within 72 hours employees will receive notice of when material will be available and an explanation for the delay. A human resources representative may be in attendance. Documentation regarding employment conditions, such as rate of pay, unit, shift, hours of work, reason for termination, change in employment status, and leaves of absence, shall be maintained. Upon request, an employee will be given a copy of any material in the employee's record. A copy fee may be charged. Employees may respond in writing to any documents contained in their record.
8.9	Parking. On-call employees shall be provided parking within close proximity to the
Swedish Medical Center.
8.10	Travel. An employee who in accordance with Swedish Medical Center policy accompanies a patient traveling by ambulance, helicopter, etc., shall be considered to be in the employ of the Swedish Medical Center. The Employer will be responsible for providing and approving travel arrangements for the employee to and from the Swedish Medical Center.
8.11	Subcontracting. There shall be no subcontracting of any bargaining unit work for the life of the contract. This shall not apply to work that is done on an occasional or temporary basis by nonbargaining unit personnel or contractors, existing work that has been customarily and historically subcontracted, to work requiring specialized and unique skills and/or equipment not generally available within the unit and where training cannot reasonably be provided, to overload work (providing such work does not result in a reduction of the FTE status or layoff of any bargaining unit member), and new work that cannot feasibly be performed by bargaining unit employees. This section does not apply to the customary and historical use of agency and travelers for RN and technical work.
ARTICLE 9	- FLOATING AND MULTI-CAMPUS ASSIGNMENTS
9.1	Floating Assignments. Provided safe and cost effective staffing alternatives are available, every effort will be made to limit floating assignments to areas where staff have been cross-trained or will have the appropriate basic skills for the areas to which they float. The Employer retains the
11
right to change the employee’s daily work assignment on a shift by shift basis to meet operational needs.
Staff will receive orientation to the department or unit and will be assigned a resource person for guidance as needed. Orientation will be appropriate to the assignment and will be dependent upon the staff member’s previous experience and familiarity with the area to which such staff member is assigned.
If during the floating assignment a staff member is asked to perform a task or procedure for which the staff member is not qualified, the staff member should immediately discuss the matter with the lead, charge nurse or manager. If the lead, charge nurse or manager is not available and the situation continues, the nursing supervisor should be paged immediately to address the situation.
In areas where patient care is provided, staff will be expected to perform all basic patient care functions, but may not be required to perform tasks or procedures uniquely applicable to the department or unit that they are not qualified or trained to perform.
9.2	Multi-Campus Assignments. If an employee (1) begins work at one campus and goes to work at another campus during his or her shift, or (2) is scheduled (on a posted or published work schedule) to work at one campus but is reassigned in advance of his or her shift to perform work at a different campus, a premium of two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) per hour shall be paid for all hours worked at the other campus. If the employee returns to the original scheduled work site during the shift, this pay premium shall continue to be paid. This premium shall not apply to an employee that works in a position that was designed to service multiple campuses (e.g., Pharmacy Tech Systems Coordinator). Article 10.4 Schedule Changes, does not apply to this section. Delays resulting from transportation between campuses shall not be counted as a dependability occurrence. Parking will be provided to employees floating during a shift to another campus at no additional charge. If an employee incurs an additional parking fee, the Employer will reimburse the employee within two (2) weeks.
9.2.1	It is not the intention of Swedish Medical Center to regularly use staff from a department on one campus to fulfill staffing needs on another campus, and the use of such assignments on a regular basis shall be minimized.
9.2.2	Nothing in this section shall prevent the Employer from responding to emergency situations or urgent patient care needs.
9.2.3	Multi-Campus Units. In the event the Employer decides to expand the use of cross campus assignments to a department where the practice does not currently exist, the Union will be notified at the earliest opportunity. The Employer will meet with the Union and representatives of staff to address staff concerns and convene a change team. All applicable contractual practices will be followed. In the event a new multi-campus unit is created, all affected employees shall be assigned a home campus pursuant to the contractual procedures identified by the change team potentially including but not limited to 8.4 Recruitment and Selection, and/or 7.1 Layoffs.
12
9.3	Volunteers. When it is necessary to float an employee to another unit or department or to assign an employee to another campus, the Employer agrees to first seek volunteers from the employees working or scheduled, provided skill, ability and competence are substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer. In the event there are no volunteers, the Employer will rotate floating or reassignments equitably among all employees in the affected job classification on a unit on each shift, starting with the least senior employee first, provided skills, competence, ability and availability are considered substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer. If an individual volunteers to float or to go to another campus that shall be counted for purposes of the rotation list. The rotation list will be restarted January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning with the least senior employee.
ARTICLE 10	- HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
10.1	Normal Work Day. The normal work day shall consist of eight (8) hours' work to be completed within eight and one-half (8 1/2) consecutive hours.
10.2	Normal Work Period. The normal work period shall consist of forty (40) hours of work within a seven (7) day period or eighty (80) hours of work within a fourteen (14) day period.
10.3	Flexible Work Schedules. A flexible schedule is defined as a work schedule that requires a change, modification or waiver of certain provisions of this Agreement. Flexible work schedules may be established in writing by mutual agreement between the Swedish Medical Center and the employee involved. See Addendums for specific work schedules.
Prior to the implementation of a new flexible work schedule, the Employer and the Union will review and determine conditions of employment relating to that new work schedule. Where flexible work schedules are utilized, the Employer retains the right to revert back to an eight (8) hour per day schedule or a flexible schedule recognized by this Agreement after at least thirty (30) days' advance notice to the employee, or pay in lieu of notice.
10.4	Schedule Changes. The Employer retains the right to adjust work schedules to maintain an efficient and orderly operation. If schedules are posted, the Employer will post the schedule seven (7) days prior to the scheduled work period. Except conditions involving patient care and low census conditions, individual scheduled hours of work set forth on the posted work schedules may be changed only by mutual consent. Call schedules will be posted ten (10) days prior to the beginning of the scheduled call period.
10.4.1	Low Census/Reduction in Hours. Low census is defined as a decline in patient care requirements resulting in a temporary staff decrease. During temporary periods of low census, the Employer will first ask for volunteers to take time off before determining and implementing the reduced staffing schedule required. In the event there are no volunteers, the Employer will rotate low census equitably among all employees on a unit on each shift (on each campus) starting with the least senior employee first, providing skills, competence, ability and availability are considered substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer. If an individual volunteers to take a low census day off, that day off shall be counted for
13
purposes of the rotation list. The rotation list will be restarted January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning with the least senior employee. The Employer reserves the right to determine which job classification(s) shall be subject to low census or reduction in hours at any particular time. Subject to skill, competency and ability, agency and per diem employees on the unit subject to low census shall be released from work prior to implementing mandatory low census.
10.4.2	Low Census Standby. If a low census day is offered and it is uncertain whether the employee will be needed for part of the shift, an employee who agrees to be on standby will be paid standby pay. If an employee has been notified of low census but will be needed and agrees to a later start time on that shift, the employee will not receive standby pay. If the employee chooses not to take off a portion of the scheduled shift, the option will be offered to other staff.
10.4.3	Low Census Fund. Where mandatory low census (as opposed to voluntary low census) hours are required, the Employer will assign other duties, skill development or cross training consistent with organizational and patient care needs as determined by the Employer, up to a maximum of 1750 hours per calendar year. Where low census hours exceed 1750 hours on a Swedish Medical Center-wide basis within a calendar year, then employees will be released from work due to low census conditions, as provided for in Section 10.4.1. The Low Census Fund is utilized for projects and may involve some patient contact. The Employer will determine appropriate projects and will assign these projects to the staff.
During the course of a shift, if the needed staffing hours increase on a unit, the remaining hours of the employee’s shift will be charged to the unit budget rather than to the Low Census Fund. The Low Census Fund shall not be available to employees during that period of time that the Employer is subject to a ten (10) day strike notice, as provided for by Section 8(g) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended.
10.5	Overtime. Overtime shall be paid at one and one-half (1 1/2) times the regular rate of pay for all time worked beyond the normal full-time work day of eight (8) or more hours in duration (excluding innovative work schedules) and for all time worked beyond the normal work period. All additional overtime hours after twelve (12) consecutive hours of work within the twenty-four (24) hour period shall be paid at the rate of double (2x) the employee's regular rate of pay. For purposes of computing overtime, the employee's straight time hourly rate of pay shall include shift differential and all applicable premiums. Overtime shall be calculated to the nearest fifteen- (15) minutes. Time paid for but not worked shall not count as time worked for purposes of computing overtime pay, except for paid holiday time off. All overtime must be approved by supervision. The Employer and the Union agree that overtime should be minimized. If in the Employer's opinion overtime is necessary, volunteers will be sought first and if there are insufficient volunteers, reasonable overtime may be assigned equitably. There shall be no pyramiding or duplication of overtime pay or premium pay paid at the rate of time and one-half (1 1/2) or double time (2x). When an employee is eligible for both time and one-half (1 1/2) and double time (2x) pay, the employee shall receive the higher of the two pay rates. Except in the event of an emergency, or for employees on call, or by mutual agreement, no employee shall be required to work more than 17 consecutive hours. Prior to
14
mandatory overtime, reasonable efforts will be made to: 1) seek volunteers, 2) contact employees who have indicated that they are willing to pick up extra shifts, 3) use per-diem staff, 4) seek personnel from temporary agency. In the event there are insufficient volunteers, reasonable overtime may be assigned.
10.5.1	Ten (10) Hour Shifts. The work period for overtime computation purposes shall be a seven (7) day period. Employees who work in excess of ten (10) hours in any day, or in excess of forty (40) hours during a seven (7) day work period will be paid for the excess work hours at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times their regular pay rate. All overtime hours in excess of twelve (12) consecutive hours of work during any day shall be paid at the rate of two times (2x) the regular rate of pay.
10.5.2	Twelve (12) Hour Shifts. The work period for overtime computation purposes shall be a seven (7) day period. Employees who work in excess of twelve (12) hours in any day, or in excess of forty (40) hours during a seven (7) day work period will be paid for the excess work hours at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times their regular pay rate. If an employee works more than one (1) hour beyond the end of a twelve (12) hour shift, all overtime hours, including the thirteenth (13th) hour, will be paid at the rate of two times (2x) the regular rate of pay.
10.5.3	Work in Advance of Shift. An employee who reports to work in advance of the assigned shift will not be released from duty prior to the completion of that scheduled shift for the purpose of avoiding overtime pay unless there is mutual consent.
10.5.4	Work on Day Off. Full-time employees who work on their regularly scheduled day off shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1 V2) times the regular rate of pay for the hours worked. Part-time employees, who work on a day not regularly scheduled, shall be paid at the applicable rate of pay.
10.6	Meal/Rest Periods. All employees shall receive an unpaid meal period of one-half (1/2) hour. Employees who are required to work during their meal period shall be paid for the time worked as required by law. All employees shall be allowed a paid rest period of fifteen (15) minutes in each half shift of four (4) hours or more duration.
10.7	Split Shifts. Except for unforeseeable emergency situations that may occur, there will be no split shifts unless mutually agreed to by the Employer and employee.
10.8	Report Pay. Employees who report for work as scheduled including mandatory meetings or training (unless otherwise notified in advance) and are released from duty by the Employer because of low census or meeting cancellation shall receive four (4) hours work or four (4) hours pay at the regular rate of pay or their scheduled shift pay, whichever is less. This commitment shall not apply when the Employer has made a good faith effort to notify the employee in advance of shift cancellation at least one (1) hour in advance of the scheduled day shift or one and one-half (1 1/2) hours in advance of the scheduled evening or night shift. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to notify the Swedish Medical Center of the employee's current address and telephone
15
number. This section shall not apply to optional continuing education, committee meetings, staff meetings or to time spent on standby, or callback assignments.
10.9	Rest Between Shifts. In scheduling work assignments, the Employer will make a good faith effort to provide each employee with at least twelve (12) hours off duty between shifts. If an employee is required to work with less than twelve (12) hours off duty between shifts, all time worked within this twelve (12) hour period shall be paid at time and one-half (1 1/2). This section shall not apply to flexible work schedules (Section 10.3), continuing education, committee meetings, staff meetings or to time spent on stand-by and callback assignments performed pursuant to Sections 11.4 and 11.5. If attendance at a staff meeting or in-service is required and there are no other options, with prior approval, the staff meeting or in-service will be considered time worked for purposes of this section.
10.9.1	Innovative Shifts. In the event an employee that works a ten (10) hour shift is required to work with less than ten (10) hours off duty between shifts, all time worked within this ten (10) hour period shall be paid at time and one-half (1 1/2). Rest between shifts does not apply to employees that work twelve (12) hour shifts.
10.10	Weekends. In the event a full-time or part-time employee is required to work two successive weekends, all time worked on the second weekend shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half (1 1/2) the regular rate of pay. The third regularly scheduled weekend shall be at the employee's straight time rate of pay. Every other weekend off cycles may be altered at the discretion of management provided ten (10) days notice is given to the employee of the change. Subject to management approval, employees may request to trade weekends providing the schedule does not place the Employer into a premium pay or overtime position. Overtime pay provided for in this section shall not apply to employees who voluntarily agree to more frequent weekend duty, to work every weekend, or to employees filling more than one (1) position. The Employer shall determine the availability of weekend work. The weekend shall be defined for day and evening personnel as both Saturday and Sunday; for night personnel, the weekend shall be both Friday and Saturday night.
10.11	Extra Hours of Work. Extra hours shall be made available equitably to regular full and part-time employees who have volunteered.
ARTICLE 11	- COMPENSATION
11.1	Wage Rates. Schedule "A" attached hereto and made a part of this Agreement is the wage schedule which shall be effective during the term of this Agreement.
11.2	Shift Differential. Employees assigned to work the second shift (3-11:30 p.m.) shall be paid a shift differential of one dollar and seventy-five cents ($1.75). Employees assigned to work the third shift (11 p.m. - 7:30 a.m.) shall be paid a shift differential of two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50). Employees shall be paid shift differential for those hours worked on a second or third shift if four (4) or more hours are worked on the designated shift. If an employee works a total of less than four (4) hours and all hours worked are on the evening and/or night shift, then the applicable shift differential will be paid for the actual hours worked on each shift.
16
11.3	Recognition for Past Experience. All employees hired during the term of this Agreement shall be given full credit for continuous recent experience when placed on the wage scale. For purposes of this section, continuous recent experience shall be defined as experience in an accredited hospital, ambulatory care setting, home health agency or equivalent health care experience (including temporary employment with an employer, without a break in experience which would reduce the level of clinical/technical skills in the opinion of the Employer).
11.4	Standby Pay. Employees placed on standby status off Swedish Medical Center premises shall be compensated at the rate of four dollars ($4.00) per hour. An employee shall receive five dollars and twenty-five ($5.25) per hour for all standby hours over fifty (50) standby hours per pay period. Standby duty shall not be counted as hours worked for purposes of accruing longevity steps or benefits. Employees on standby shall be provided with signal devices for the time the employee is on standby. Employees who are on low census shall not be required to be on standby for that low census shift. Effective July 1, 2009 stand-by shall be increased to four dollars and twenty-five cents ($4.25). Also effective July 1, 2009 for all standby hours in excess of fifty (50) per pay period, an employee shall receive five dollars and seventy-five cents ($5.75). Effective July 1, 2010 for all standby hours in excess of fifty (50) per pay period, an employee shall receive six dollars ($6.00) per hour.
11.5	Callback Pay. Any employee on standby who is called to work shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half (1 1/2) the regular rate of pay. Callback pay shall be paid in addition to any standby pay. If an employee has been released from duty and is called back, the employee shall receive time and one-half (1 1/2) for a minimum of three (3) hours. Travel time to and from the Swedish Medical Center shall not be considered time worked. When an employee on standby is called to work in advance of the scheduled shift and continues working during the scheduled shift, the minimum callback hours shall not apply however, all hours worked prior to the scheduled shift shall be paid at time and one-half (1 1/2) the regular rate of pay. Work performed during the scheduled shift shall be paid at the regular straight time rate of pay.
11.5.1	Callback Relief. Subject to patient care considerations, the Employer will make a good faith effort to provide relief for an employee who requests the immediate next scheduled shift off or a change in the employee's start time or end time for the immediate next scheduled shift when the employee has been working on call within eight (8) hours of the start of his or her next scheduled shift. To be considered, the employee must notify the Employer no later than one and one-half (1 1/2) hours in advance of the employee's scheduled shift if making such a request. At the employee's request, an annual leave day or sick leave can be used. This schedule adjustment will not count as an occurrence per the Employer's Dependability Policy.
11.5.2	Callback Guidelines. Stand-by time shall not be used to avoid filling vacant positions. The Swedish Medical Center will schedule procedures in the best interests of the patient and will make a good faith effort to schedule such patient procedures so that call back is not required.
17
Each affected unit or department with mandatory call will establish a Call Staffing Committee with a Management co-chair and a Union appointed staff co-chair. The committee shall have an equal number of representatives from management and physicians, and staff from the unit. The committee shall:
•	Develop utilization guidelines specific to the type of unit and unit’s patient population that will include urgent/emergent definitions.
•	Discuss methods by which staff and physicians can be held accountable for meeting the expectations developed by the committee.
•	Participate in a regular review of the call cases in relation to the developed utilization guidelines. The schedule for these review meetings will be developed by the Unit Based Call Staffing Committee.
•	Serve as the units committee to resolve any other issues relevant to stand-by.
11.5.3	Stand-By Hours. In order to recruit and retain employees who take call as part of their jobs, there shall be established in each department a maximum number of mandatory scheduled stand-by hours per employee. If the maximum number of mandatory scheduled stand-by hours per employee is exceeded then 11.5.3 (b) below will be triggered. The maximum number of scheduled stand-by hours per employee that will trigger 11.5.3 (b) will be 132 hours per month unless the Call Staffing Committee exempts the department from the maximum by consensus. Employees are permitted to trade, volunteer or signup for a greater number of stand-by hours voluntarily but to a safe and reasonable level as determined by the manager.
a.	The maximum mandatory scheduled stand-by will be implemented within ninety (90) days of ratification of the contract.
b.	When the total average stand-by per group of employees (who have an expectation to share in the unit’s collective stand-by) hit the mandatory maximum number of stand-by hours, the Call Staffing Committee will be called to a meeting to determine a course of action to lower the stand-by hours. Management, with the committee, will make every effort to immediately lower the overall mandatory stand-by hours per employee. The committee will continue to meet to determine a course of action to lower the stand-by hours long term. If, after thirty (30) days, the mandatory scheduled stand-by hours remain over the established mandatory maximum, the next level of management for the department will participate in the committee’s work to facilitate a course of action to lower the standby hours.
NOTE: LOW CENSUS - An employee that is on stand-by that is called back can be released and put back on stand-by due to low census prior to seeking volunteers. The reason is that an employee called back is not on a regular scheduled shift.
11.6	Lead Technologist. Any employee assigned as Lead Technologist shall receive an additional two dollars ($2.00) per hour over the regular rate of pay.
18
11.7	Compensation Increases. Longevity steps (an employee’s individual step increase) set forth in this Agreement shall become effective at the beginning of the first full payroll period after the employee works (is paid) at least 1664 hours or twelve (12) months, whichever happens last. Wage scale increases and increases in other forms of compensation shall become effective at the beginning of the pay period closest to the date designated by the contract.
11.8	Preceptor. The Employer may assign employees as preceptors. Preceptor duties and assignments are at the sole discretion of the Employer. Employees assigned to preceptor students will be eligible for preceptor pay. Preceptor pay will not be paid in addition to lead pay. An employee that is assigned preceptor duties by the department manager will receive a premium of one dollar ($1.00) per hour.
11.9	Promotion, Demotion and Lateral Job Transfers. The following rules shall govern an employee’s base pay adjustment and longevity step progression when an employee moves from one job classification to another:
11.9.1	Promotion. If an employee moves to a higher paid classification, the employee shall be placed at the first step in the new classification that provides at least a three percent (3%) increase in pay. The employee shall retain all hours previously credited toward their next longevity increase and shall move to the next longevity increment upon completion of the required hours for that longevity step provided the increase is less than six percent (6%). If the increase is six percent (6%) or greater, the employee’s longevity increment counter will be reset to the date of transfer.
11.9.2	Demotion. If an employee moves to a lower-paid classification, the employee shall be placed at the step of the new classification that at least corresponds with the step they occupied in their previous classification. The employee shall retain all hours previously credited toward their next longevity increase and shall move to the next longevity increment upon completion of the required hours for that longevity step.
11.9.3	Lateral Transfer. If an employee moves to a classification with the same pay scale as their current classification the employee shall be placed at the step of the new classification that corresponds with the step they occupied in their previous classification. The employee shall retain all hours previously credited toward their next longevity increase and shall move to the next longevity increment upon completion of the required hours for that longevity step.
11.10	Weekend Premium Pay. Any employee who works on a weekend shall receive two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) per hour. Weekend premium pay shall not be included in the employee's regular rate of pay for overtime pay calculations, unless required by the Fair Labor Standards Act. The weekend shall be defined as all hours between 11:00 p.m. Friday and 11:00 p.m. Sunday. Premium pay provided for in this section shall not apply to time spent for educational purposes.
11.11	Temporary Assignments. Temporary assignments to a lower paid position will not result in a decrease in rate of pay. Temporary assignments to a higher classification, other than for training, of a week or more shall result in payment at the rate of the scale for the higher classification at the
19
step which is equivalent to the employee’s step in their regular assignment for all time worked in the classification.
11.12	Certification Pay. Employees certified in a specialty area by a national or state organization and working in that area of certification shall be paid a premium of fifty cents ($0.50) per hour, provided the particular certification has been approved by the Vice President for the area, or designee, and further provided that the employee continues to meet all educational and other requirements to keep the certification current and in good standing. A certified employee is eligible for only one certification premium, regardless of other certifications the employee may have. Certified employees will notify their respective Director/Manager in writing at the time certification is received, providing a copy of the original certification document. Certification pay will be effective the first full pay period after the date documentation is received by the Director/Manager. Certification pay will not be paid for certifications that are not applicable to the employee’s current area of responsibility. Certification pay will not be paid for certifications that are required as a minimum qualification for their position.
ARTICLE 12	- ANNUAL LEAVE
12.1	Accrual. Full-time and eligible part-time employees shall receive annual leave benefits based upon hours of work in accordance with the following schedule:

12.2	Scheduling. Annual leave shall begin accruing the first day of employment. During the probationary period, an employee is not eligible to receive compensation from the annual leave account. Upon satisfactory completion of the required probationary period, the employee shall be eligible to take any annual leave which has accrued. The Employer retains the right to schedule annual leave in such a way as will least interfere with patient care and work load requirements of the Swedish Medical Center. Consideration for time off for annual leave purposes shall be given to employees based upon length of service. No person shall schedule the same annual leave time off two (2) years in a row unless no other person desires the same time period.
12.2.1	Annual Leave/Prime Time. Prime time will be defined from June 1 through
20
September 15 of each year. Requests for prime time vacation submitted by February 15 will be approved on a seniority basis if there are no conflicting requests. In the event there are conflicting requests, then the same vacation period may not be granted to the same person annually so that equitable access exists in obtaining vacation time. The annual leave will be posted by each March 15.
Requests for prime time submitted after February 15 will be granted on a first-come, first-serve basis after the annual leave schedule is posted on March 15. Employees will be notified in writing within three (3) weeks after the request is submitted as to whether the annual leave is approved. When developing the vacation schedule, no more than three (3) calendar weeks of annual leave will be granted during prime time. Thereafter, additional annual leave may be granted.
12.2.2	Annual Leave/Non-Prime Time. Annual leave during non-prime time will be granted on a first-come, first-serve basis. In the case of conflicting requests for annual leave, all annual leave requests will be considered on the basis of the date the request was submitted and seniority. Written request for annual leave shall be presented as far in advance as is possible, but not less than two (2) weeks before the work schedule is posted. Employees will be notified in writing within three (3) weeks after the request is submitted as to whether the annual leave is approved.
12.2.3	Annual Leave/Holiday. Holiday annual leave will be defined from November 15 to January 2 of each year. Requests for holiday leave submitted by October 1 will be approved on a seniority basis if there are no conflicting requests. If there are conflicting requests, then the same vacation period may not be granted to the same person annually so that equitable access exists in obtaining vacation time. The holiday schedule will be posted by October 15. Annual leave granted during holidays shall be in conjunction with the holiday rotation. Adequate core staffing will be maintained.
12.3	Loss of Annual Leave. Annual leave accrues each pay period based on the number of hours paid in that pay period, not to exceed 2080 paid hours in a calendar year. The accruals accumulate if not used to a maximum of two times (2x) the annual accrual depending upon years of service. Employees may not accumulate annual leave beyond two times (2x) their respective annual accrual. Annual leave not accrued because the accumulation cap is reached cannot be made up. Once hours have been used to bring the employee’s accrued balance under the cap, accruals resume up to the proscribed limit.
12.4	Work On Holidays. Employees who work on the following holidays, New Year's Day, Presidents' Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day, shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked on the holiday.
12.4.	1... Pay for Time Off On Holiday. Eligible employees receive annual leave pay for scheduled time off for each of the observed holidays (except the Personal Holiday which must be arranged). Annual leave will be paid in relationship to the assigned FTE.
21
Employees that do not have sufficient hours in their annual leave balance will be paid the balance of their hours (not to exceed one full day at their FTE level) or no annual leave payment.
Employees that work in departments that close or substantially reduce their staffing on holidays will automatically be paid annual leave if they are normally scheduled, do not work, and have sufficient annual leave hours accrued.
12.4.	2 Employees must use all accrued annual leave prior to taking any time off as unpaid.
12.4.	3 Martin Luther King Day. Employees that participate in presenting at Swedish Medical Center’s Martin Luther King Day celebration will be paid the appropriate contract rate for time spent presenting, not to exceed two (2) hours of paid time. Time spent in preparation will not be eligible for paid time.
12.	5 Designated Dates. Calendar dates to be observed as holidays shall be specified by the Employer at least one (1) month in advance by notices posted in conspicuous locations in the Swedish Medical Center.
12.	6 Termination. After completion of one (1) year of employment, employees shall be paid upon termination of employment for any annual leave benefits earned; provided, however, this provision shall not apply to those employees who terminate their employment without giving the required twenty-one (21) days prior written notice, or to those employees who are discharged for cause. Failure to work the notice period, unless approved by the employee's supervisor, shall result in loss of accrued annual leave, with the exception of previously scheduled and approved time off.
12.	7 Cash Out. Eligible employees may choose to cash out up to forty (40) hours of accrued annual leave once per calendar year provided, at the time of the request, a minimum of one hundred (100) hours will be in the employee’s account after the cash out has been made. If an eligible employee reduces their FTE to Per Diem or other non-benefit eligible status, all accrued hours for which she/he is eligible will be paid to the employee at the time of the status change.
ARTICLE 13	- SICK LEAVE
13.1	Accrual. Full-time and part-time employees shall accumulate sick leave benefits at the rate of eight (8) hours for each 173.3 hours worked. No sick leave shall be allowed for a fractional calendar month of employment. The maximum accumulation of sick leave shall be limited to 800 hours per employee.
13.2	Compensation. If a full-time or part-time employee is absent from work due to illness or injury (including emergency medical-dental appointments), the Employer shall pay the employee sick leave pay for each day of absence to the extent of the illness or injury or to the amount of the employee's unused sick leave accumulation, whichever is less. Sick leave may be used for the illness or injury of a dependent child under the age of eighteen (18). Prior to payment for sick leave, reasonable proof of illness may be required. Proven abuse of sick leave will be grounds for discharge. An employee is not eligible to take sick leave during the probationary period.
22
13.3	Notification. Employees working the first (day) shift shall notify the immediate supervisor or other designated person(s) at least one (1) hour in advance of the employee's scheduled shift if the employee is unable to report for duty as scheduled. Employees working the second (evening) and third (night) shift shall notify the immediate supervisor or other designated person at least three (3) hours in advance of the employee's scheduled shift if the employee is unable to report for duty as scheduled. Failure to do so may, at the Employer's discretion, result in loss of paid sick leave for that day.
13.4	Notice of Termination. Employees shall not be paid sick leave for any illness or injury which occurs during the twenty-one (21) day period prior to the employee's termination date after the employee has given proper notice of termination (8.2).
ARTICLE 14	- HEALTH AND SAFETY
14.1	Safe Workplace. The Employer agrees to maintain a safe and healthy workplace in compliance with all federal, state, county and municipal regulations.
14.2	Alcohol and/or Chemical Dependency. The Employer and the Union recognize that alcohol and chemical dependency are chronic and treatable conditions. The Employer and the Union support efforts that will enable the chemically impaired employee to remain in professional practice so long as performance expectations are maintained. Efforts should be made by the employee to identify these conditions and the treatment options at an early stage to prevent or minimize erosion in work performance. The Employer and the Union will encourage and support employee participation in treatment programs, including individually tailored return-to-work agreements, through which employees may seek confidential assistance in the resolution of chemical dependency or other problems which may impact job performance. The Employer further acknowledges that alcoholism and chemical dependency are health conditions for which the employee is eligible for accrued sick leave and/or medical leave of absence under the same terms as other health conditions. It is the intention of the Employer to work with an employee to adjust their work schedule on an ad hoc or temporary basis to support the chemically dependent employee’s participation in prescribed treatment programs. The Employer and the Union acknowledge that employees continue to be responsible for maintaining satisfactory job performance and attendance and for compliance with the Employer’s policies and procedures.
14.3	Health and Safety. The Employer remains committed to providing education, products and equipment, work practice controls, and engineering controls to minimize employee risks from occupational injury or exposure. The Swedish Medical Center shall also continue to provide confidential twenty-four (24) hour information and referral for employees sustaining occupational injury or exposure. This commitment to employee health and safety is documented in Employer’s Infection Control and Exposure Control Manual and the Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual that is available on every unit/work area throughout the Swedish Medical Center.
14.3.1	Hepatitis B Vaccine and Hepatitis C Exposure. Vaccine is offered in Employee Health Services without cost to any employee at risk of exposure to Hepatitis B. Following a
23
blood borne exposure, the Employer will not only test for HEP B and HIV, but also HEP C and provide appropriate treatment at no cost to employee.

To ensure that this purpose is met, the parties will attempt to resolve issues at the lowest possible level within the management structure. Additionally, the parties will engage annually in joint union/management training on contract interpretation and effective resolution of grievances.
The parties agree that potential grievances should be resolved informally whenever possible. To that end, the parties agree in ordinary circumstances to meet informally prior to submitting a written grievance. In the event these informal meetings are not occurring when they should be (in the opinion of either party) the matter may be taken to the Labor Management Committee for discussion and resolution.
17.1	Grievance Defined. A grievance is defined as an alleged breach of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. It is the desire of the parties to this Agreement that grievances be adjusted informally wherever possible and at the first level of supervision.

A time limit which ends on a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday designated in Section 12.4 hereof shall be deemed to end at 4:30 p.m. on the next following business day. Failure of an employee or the Union to file a grievance on a timely basis or to timely advance a grievance in accordance with the time limits set forth below will constitute withdrawal of the grievance by the employee and the Union. If the Employer fails to comply with the time limits set forth below the Union may advance the grievance to the next step, in writing.
17.3	Grievance Procedure. A grievance shall be submitted to the following grievance procedure:

designee) may also be present at this Step 1 meeting. Upon receipt thereof, the immediate supervisor shall attempt to resolve the problem and shall respond in writing to the employee within fourteen (14) calendar days following receipt of the written grievance.
A grievance concerning a termination or suspension may be initially presented at Step 2 of the grievance procedure.
Step 2. Department Director.

A meeting between the employee (and the Union Delegate/Representative, if requested by the employee) and the Department Director (or designee) and a Human Resources representative (or designee) shall be held within ten (10) days for the purpose of resolving the grievance. The Department Director shall issue a written reply within fourteen (14) calendar days following the Step 2 grievance meeting.
Step 3. Vice President.
If the matter is not resolved at Step 2 to the employee’s satisfaction, the grievance shall be referred in writing to the Vice President (and/or designee) within fourteen (14) calendar days of the Department Director's Step 2 written decision.

In that arbitration submission letter, the arbitrator will be requested to provide available dates within the sixty (60) day period following receipt of the letter. The arbitrator will be determined from the listing of arbitrators listed below. The first arbitration case (under this Agreement) will be assigned to the first arbitrator identified below. Thereafter, each arbitration case will be assigned on a rotating basis to the next arbitrator appearing on the list.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT Quality Improvement — Re-engineering
Swedish Medical Center and the Union acknowledge the need for continual quality improvement in order to provide superior patient care. To this end, the parties acknowledge the importance of continually reviewing work practices and procedures to ensure the utilization of the most efficient, practical procedures and delivery of the highest quality product to our customers.
The parties also acknowledge that continual quality improvement means that work performed by employees should be examined and adjusted to meet and maintain the best work practices. Swedish acknowledges that Union members play a crucial role in the success of its quality improvement efforts. In the event that work performed by groups of employees in the bargaining unit is redesigned, the following principles shall guide the Union’s and management’s efforts.
1.	The Union will be informed of the plans to redesign bargaining unit work and given the opportunity to appoint employee representatives to participate in the redesign with management and identify the impacts.
2.	Should the redesign result in a reduction in force, management will utilize a variety of voluntary options to address any displacement. These options may include attrition, internal transfers, external placement, etc.
3.	Primary emphasis of any change in work will be to retain qualified bargaining unit members. Where additional training is required, management agrees to provide reasonable resources if such training will result in the retention of bargaining unit members.
Prior to implementing any redesigned jobs, the Union and the Swedish Medical Center will meet to negotiate the pay rates for such jobs as well as any other required terms and conditions of employment affected by the quality improvement efforts.
This Letter of Agreement applies to Quality Improvement - Re-engineering only and does not apply to restructuring resulting from mergers, acquisitions, or alliances with other organizations.

Per-diem Employees
If the Union believes there is an employee classified as per-diem who has been working regular full or part-time hours for a period of over three (3) months, they can request to have the matter reviewed by Human Resources. If, following the review, it is confirmed that the employee is working regular full or part-time hours that are not concluded to be temporary, the position will be submitted for justification and approval. Any new position must go through the normal approval process and if approved, it will be filled by the employees who have been working those hours.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT
Job Security Agreement Regarding CIS Implementation
1.	Swedish Medical Center has initiated a long-term (2005-2009) process of Implementing a Clinical Information System (CIS Implementation) which will improve the ability of health care providers to deliver high quality patient care, and will allow Swedish to maintain its position as a pre-eminent health care system in the Pacific Northwest. This project will also potentially result in a great number of changes to employees’ jobs. In undertaking this project, Swedish intends to utilize the skills and talents of all employees, strengthen job opportunities, and promote staff retention on all campuses.
2.	Swedish recognizes that its employees are instrumental to the success of the hospital, and recognizes that its employees possess extraordinary skill, dedication, experience and expertise. Swedish furthermore intends to draw on these skills throughout the process of implementing these changes, and recognizes that employees will help make the best decisions regarding these changes. To further the commitment to excellence in health care, to reassure employees with respect to their employment in light of the project, and to retain valued employees, Swedish agrees to take steps that will minimize involuntary layoffs or reductions in FTE.
3.	In order to provide this job security and stability, and in keeping with normal Human Resources practice, Swedish agrees to continue to minimize involuntary layoffs or reductions in FTE resulting from the implementation of CIS. To that end, Swedish will identify as far in advance as possible any jobs that may change significantly or possibly be eliminated as a result. Employees in these positions will be identified and one-on-one consultations will be held by the Employee Advancement Center (EAC). Job opportunities will be identified for each employee as well as training and education dollars that may be used to pursue the education or training.
4.	The parties recognize that technological changes may result in changes to existing job duties
as well as the creation and/or elimination of some job classifications. In order to carry out its commitment to minimize layoffs or reductions in FTE, Swedish encourages employees to access the EAC and Swedish Medical Center funds as outlined in the Tuition Reimbursement Policy so they may be better qualified to fill newly created or existing positions.
5.	Basic computer skill development (computer equipment use, e-mail, Internet use, and word processing skills) is encouraged for all employees and is currently available for employees. Swedish will provide technology education for EPIC end users, both for basic computer skills and for the EPIC application well in advance of go-live. Employees that are displaced as a result of CIS will be provided appropriate technology education.
48
SEIU 1199 NW, Swedish management, Human Resources staff and CIS project management will meet on a regular basis to discuss topics of mutual interest relating to the CIS project. Topics will include communication issues, problem solving identified areas of concern, process improvement, etc.

SWEDISH MEDICAL CENTER
SEIU HEALTHCARE 1199NW LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
During Negotiations that resulted in the 2008 - 2011 Agreement between the parties, certain additional understandings were reached. This letter will serve to memorialize those understandings.
1.	Pay Check Errors
It is recognized that the employee is responsible for completing his or her time card accurately according to Swedish Medical Center policy. When an error is made by the Employer of four (4) hours or greater, the Employer will provide the employee with a corrected amount via direct deposit within two business days. If the Employer error is for less than four (4) hours, then the employee will receive the corrected amount in the next pay cycle. Notice of errors must be submitted in writing to the Payroll Department by the employee’s manager.
Employee errors will be corrected on the next full pay cycle provided the notice of errors is submitted in writing to the Payroll Department by the employee’s manager no later than one week following the pay period in which the error occurred.
2.	Low Census
The Labor Management Committee will monitor low census fund utilization on a periodic basis. If the fund utilization exceeds 1250 hours in a calendar year, the Labor Management Committee will identify the area(s) where utilization has been the highest and determine if steps can be taken in those areas to reduce utilization.
3.	Subcontracting
Swedish Medical Center will give the Union forty-five (45) days advance written notice of its intent to subcontract, sell, or transfer any part of its existing operations covered by the Agreement that may result in the displacement of bargaining unit employees. Swedish will meet with the Union to discuss alternatives.
4.	Mutual Commitment
For the duration of this Agreement, Swedish Medical Center and the Union desire to work together to ensure the long term stability of Swedish. In order to maximize the ability of employees to work in a stable environment, Swedish Medical Center pledges that it will not seek to reach its financial goals through cyclical layoffs. While this assurance does not restrict the ability of Swedish Medical Center to make changes in programs or services that impact jobs, or layoff employees as a result of an acquisition or merger, it does commit Swedish Medical Center to find means other than cyclical layoffs in order to achieve its financial goals. The Union, Swedish Medical Center and each member of the Swedish Medical Center team, employees and management alike, are fully committed to use their best efforts to provide the highest quality patient care, maintaining a long term sense of security, and ensuring that Swedish Medical Center is the premier healthcare provider in the
50
Northwest.
5.	Union Organizing
Absent unexpected circumstances, Swedish Medical Center’s (SMC) philosophy is that on occasions where non-represented employees seek representation by SEIU 1199NW, each employee in the group being organized is given the opportunity to make an informed decision through a voting process as agreed upon by both SMC and the Union. SMC and the Union will determine the appropriate bargaining unit. SMC will provide information to employees when requested by an employee regarding their rights under federal law, may respond to factual inaccuracies should that occur, and answer any other related employee questions without offering an opinion for or against union representation.
6.	Joint Labor Management Action on Health Care Issues
The parties recognize that decisions made by elected officials and policy makers in Olympia and Washington, D.C. can have a significant impact on the financing of health care and how care may be delivered at Swedish Medical Center. The parties further agree that one effective way to advocate for a better health system is to work in partnership on issues of common concern and interest. Swedish Medical Center Senior Leadership and SEIU 1199NW Leadership agree to meet on a semi-annual basis to discuss health care policy issues and to determine if there is interest in developing joint action plans on any issues of common concern. If so, these issues will be referred to the Labor Management Committee for specific planning and implementation.
7.	Paid Release Time for Negotiations
For contract renegotiation occurring in the year 2011, Swedish Medical Center will provide three hundred sixty (360) hours of paid release time for the Union's negotiating committee (Technical B.U.). These monies are intended to supplement the TECH bargaining unit's vacation donations to negotiating team members.
8.	Vacation Donations for Negotiations
Technical Employees will be able to donate vacation hours to a vacation donation pool for use by the Union’s negotiating team during negotiations as follows:
1.	All members of the Union’s bargaining unit may donate earned vacation/annual leave hours to a common pool, from which members of the Union’s negotiating team will be able to draw at their regular rate of pay to make up for wages lost through participation in bargaining sessions.
2.	The Union will collect the donated vacation hours into a pool, and allocate hours for
disbursement on the normal paychecks received by negotiating team members. Hours paid from the vacation pool will be paid as vacation time (shown on recipient’s pay stub as “UN NG VAC” for Union Negotiations Vacation) and will accrue benefits for the recipients. This process will be separate from the timecardpayroll online system, and will rely on electronic Excel spreadsheets; no cost center will be needed for the purpose. After each payout from the pool, HR will provide the Union with an accounting of the hours remaining in the pool.
51
3.	Donated hours authorized by the employee and collected by the Union will be deducted from donors’ vacation banks at the beginning of the bargaining process, and shown on donor’s pay stub as “VLA - Vacation Leave Adjustment”. These hours will NOT accrue toward benefits. Any vacation hours pledged which were not paid out to cover lost wages will be returned to the donors’ vacation bank as designated by the Union.
4.	The Union will be responsible for providing management the following:
a.	A signed authorization from all donors, modeled on the Swedish Medical Center Vacation/Annual Leave Donation form language, with the additional clarification that the donor is entering an agreement with the Union and also authorizing Swedish Medical Center to debit the donated hours from the employee’s vacation bank. The authorizing language on the Union’s petition reads as follows:
By signing this petition, I agree with our union 1199NW to donate no less than four (4)* vacation hours to help our negotiators with missed shifts as a result of negotiations and I authorize Swedish Medical Center to deduct these hours from my vacation bank.
* Hours not needed by negotiators will not be charged.
Donors’ names will be both printed and signed. A copy of the authorizing signatures will be provided to the Swedish Medical Center on numbered signature pages and numbered lines for ease of verification.
b.	An Excel spreadsheet of all donors, the page and line number of their
signatures, employee identification numbers, and the number of hours authorized for donation (minimum of four (4) hours) will be provided to the Employer. Additional columns will be included to show the number of hours approved for debiting for each bi-weekly payout. Data needs to be submitted to the Human Resources Department by the second Tuesday of the pay period for it to be paid on the next regularly scheduled payday.
c.	For each payout, Swedish Medical Center will need an Excel spreadsheet of all negotiating team members who are to receive payments from the pool, employee identification numbers, the number of hours to be paid and the date of the session. The Swedish Medical Center will provide the Union with advance notification of the appropriate payroll periods for submission of distributions. There will be no individual exceptions for requests for payouts that do not meet this deadline. The biweekly payouts will continue as long as needed to cover all bargaining dates, or until the pool is depleted.
52
5.
Additionally, we have agreed on the following points:
a.	Donated time will take priority over the donor’s own time for purposes of vacation requests.
b.	Donated hours will be paid out as hours, and will not be converted to dollars prior to payout.
c.	The Union will work with the Swedish Medical Center HRIS manager to format the Excel spreadsheets.
d.	Donated time will be charged against the negotiating team member’s
home department.
9.	Safety Committee and Safe Patient Handling Subcommittee
Safety Committee
The objective of this committee is to develop, implement and evaluate the overall environment of care safety program and the incident/accident/injury prevention program; to identify hazardous conditions, unsafe practices or trends, and recommend plans for improvement; and to maintain and report safety hazards to appropriate regulatory agency. The Union shall appoint six (6) employees representing each campus and Home Care Services and the Employer will have managers representing all campuses. The Committee will meet at least monthly. The Union and the Employer agree to share any information they may have concerning injury prevention programs at other hospitals in order to facilitate the Committee's action plan.
The Employer and the Union are committed to working together in the Safety Committee and Safe Patient Handling Subcommittee to evaluate the environment of care performance data, number of injuries, lost work days, and employer worker compensation and medical costs, caused from manual lifting and transferring patients and other non-clinical events, and to work together to reduce such injuries and safety hazards.
Safe Patient Handling
In addition, Swedish will maintain a Safe Patient Handling subcommittee with membership representation in compliance with Washington State Engrossed House Bill (EHB) 1672 (Chapter 165, Laws of 2006). The purpose of the committee is to design and recommend the process for implementing a safe patient handling program. At least half of the members of the safe patient handling committee shall be frontline non-managerial employees who provide direct care to patients. Bargaining Unit participants will be appointed by the Union.
Acknowledging that back, neck and shoulder injuries are some of the most prevalent occupational hazards for employees, management agrees to continue its comprehensive ergonomic and injury reduction program.
53
10.	Dependability Policy
The Swedish Medical Center agrees that the following absences will not count as occurrences under the Employer's Dependability Policy:
•	Family Care Leave
•	FMLA Leave
•	Time loss for workers comp
•	Any reasonable accommodation for a qualifying disability
•	Pre-approved scheduled absences
11.	Technical Employees’ Wage Adjustments
Because of the dynamic labor market for Technical employees, Swedish and the Union understand that from time to time it is necessary to adjust wages outside of the normal bargaining process. Both the Union and Swedish want to respond quickly to changes in the market and will make every effort to process and approve interim wage adjustments for the Technical unit on an accelerated basis.
In the event that Swedish Human Resources has researched a Tech unit job classification and determines a wage adjustment is necessary, it will submit a proposed wage adjustment to the Union for review. At the Union’s request Swedish will met with the Union to discuss modifications to the adjustments the union may feel is appropriate.
Positions will not typically be reviewed more that once every six (6) months.
12.	Voluntary Political Action Fund Deductions
In consideration for the Employer’s Agreement regarding voluntary PAC Fund deductions, the Union agrees that neither bargaining unit employees nor Union representatives will solicit for political action fund deductions in patient care areas nor will there otherwise be any disruption to patient care.

APPLIES TO REGISTERED NURSES, SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE AND TECHNICAL UNITS
1.	Maintenance of Benefits. The Swedish Medical Center agrees that during the term of this
Agreement it will not reduce the current level of medical plan benefit coverage provided in the Standard Plan, nor raise the cost to employees by increasing co-payments, deductibles, co-insurance, or out-of-pocket maximums. This commitment shall not apply to administrative changes (including physician panels) that may occur to the plan.

Out of pocket maximums for in-network services are $2,000 for an individual and $4,000 for a family.
2.	Contract Term. Beginning with the 2008 contracts, Swedish will agree to negotiate all three collective bargaining agreements (RN, Service & Maintenance, Technical units) simultaneously. Following negotiations, the parties agree to discuss the 2008 bargaining process to assist in planning for 2011 negotiations. This will include recommendations for a more streamlined and efficient process.
3.	Mental Health Parity. Effective January 1, 2007, Swedish's self-insured benefit plans shall include mental health benefits that are at least equal to the terms and conditions of member health benefits as mandated by the Mental Health Parity Law of 2005, substitute House Bill 1154.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT #2
Between
SWEDISH MEDICAL CENTER and
SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
ADDITIONAL FACILITIES
Swedish Medical Center unless superseded by law agrees that:
(a)	if Swedish Medical Center builds or opens a new facility and Swedish Medical Center is the legal employer of the employees, the employees at that facility who perform the same or similar work to that which is covered by this Agreement will be covered by the terms of this Agreement and will be included in the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement;
(b)	if Swedish Medical Center acquires an existing operation and some of the employees at that facility are represented by SEIU Healthcare 1199NW, then all such employees at that facility who perform the same or similar work to that which is covered by this Agreement will be covered by the terms of this Agreement and will be included in the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement if the acquired operation is in King, Snohomish, or Pierce, County. The parties will promptly meet to bargain the terms and conditions of employment of employees at that facility who are represented by SEIU Healthcare 1199NW who do not perform the same or similar work to that which is covered by this Agreement. In the event the acquired operation is located elsewhere, Swedish Medical Center agrees to immediately recognize SEIU Healthcare 1199NW as the representative for the employees already represented by the Union, and will promptly meet to bargain the terms of employment for covered employees;
(c)	if Swedish Medical Center acquires an existing operation and some of the employees at that facility are represented by another union or are unrepresented, the Employer will cooperate fully with the Union to determine promptly and efficiently whether accretion is appropriate under established principles of labor law, and if so, to effectuate it. Following an accretion the parties will promptly meet to bargain any outstanding issues;
(d)	if Swedish Medical Center acquires an existing operation and some of the employees at that facility are represented by another union or are unrepresented and an accretion is not appropriate, the parties agree to be bound by the Neutrality Agreement below. In the event the Union files a representation petition with the NLRB, Swedish Medical Center will agree to have the case processed through the NLRB Consent Election procedures;
(e)	The preceding provisions apply to Swedish Medical Center employees of any facility which becomes part of the Swedish Medical Center healthcare operations during the term of this Agreement, including but not limited to a hospital, urgent care facility, clinic, or ambulatory surgical center. These provisions do not apply to the operation of a facility for which Swedish Medical Center is a not the employer, or where Swedish Medical
57
Center is a joint employer with some other entity, and does not exercise authority over terms and conditions of employment;
(f)	In the event the new facility or acquisition is geographically located in a significantly different market such that an economic adjustment based on market conditions is necessary to maintain competitiveness, the parties will promptly meet to bargain such market adjustment in wages, hours and working conditions.
Neutrality Agreement
The parties establish the following rules for the purpose of ensuring an orderly environment for the exercise of the rights of employees under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.
1.	Swedish Medical Center (including its administrators, supervisors, agents and other representatives) will remain neutral and will not oppose attempts by employees to organize or select a collective bargaining representative and will not take any action or make any statement that degrades unionization, promotes “no union” as a choice in the election or that directly or indirectly states or implies any opposition by the Employer to the selection by employees of the Union, or preference or opposition to any particular union as a bargaining representative. Swedish Medical Center will provide information to employees when requested by an employee regarding their rights under federal law, may respond to factual inaccuracies should that occur, and answer any other related employee questions without offering an opinion for or against union representation;
2.	In the event the Union files a petition with the National Labor Relations Board: a.) Swedish Medical Center will immediately provide the Union with a current roster of employees including name, job title, department, work location, home address and most recent date of hire; and b.)Swedish Medical Center will provide the Union with access to non-work areas of its facilities for the purpose of communicating with employees on nonwork time;
3.	The parties agree that any disputes over the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be submitted to expedited arbitration before an impartial arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties. Should the parties be unable to agree upon an impartial arbitrator, then the impartial arbitrator shall be chosen from a list of seven (7) arbitrators submitted by the American Arbitration Association, pursuant to its rules for expedited arbitration, upon the written request of either party. The parties shall request that the list of arbitrators contain only names of individuals familiar with labor law and with experience in the field of arbitration. It is understood and agreed between the parties that the impartial arbitrator shall not have the power to add to or subtract from, or modify any of the terms of this Agreement. The fees of the impartial arbitrator and administrative expenses shall be shared equally between the parties. Each party shall pay its own counsel. The arbitrator's authority shall be limited to resolving the dispute, and issuing a cease and desist order, or other forms of injunctive relief, but does not include delaying, postponing or otherwise affecting the normal NLRB election process.
58
4.	Swedish Medical Center is not expected or required under this Agreement to take any action that is prohibited by the NLRA.
