The Detroit Federation of Teachers will be asked to participate in this implementation study.
4.	Organization of Grades
Classes shall be "organized" for the fall and for the spring semesters at levels sufficiently below the above maximums so that school population shifts will not result in classes exceeding the maximums. For grades kindergarten through five, classes shall be "organized" at a level sufficiently below 30 so as to provide a reasonable expectation that school population shifts will not result in class sizes exceeding the mandatory limit of 30 students. For grades six through twelve, classes shall be "organized" at a level sufficiently below 35 so as to provide good faith assurance that school population shifts will not result in class sizes above 35.
*These maximums also apply to summer school. The parties agree that there may be exceptions. In such instances, the oversize classes shall be shared equitably within the area of grade and/or subject assignments. Total student load shall not exceed 108 in grades K-5 and 115 in grades 6-12 respectively for a teacher with three classes when it is necessary to maintain the summer school program.

b.	From and after the 4th Wednesday in the fall and the 2nd Wednesday in the spring semesters, if in spite of good faith efforts, oversize classes in grades 6-12 develop or if classes above 34 are the result of inequitable school organization, classes shall be reorganized by the school administration within 10 school days with provision for additional teacher service, extra assistance and/or other types of relief so that no class exceeds the above maximums.
c.	In schools involving at least 45% of the enrolled students in reorganization, one-half (1.2) day will be provided for updating records and planning.
B.	Class Size Review Board
1.	The Class Size Review Board shall act to assure that the class size maximums are not exceeded. The Class Size Review Board shall be composed of at least three teachers selected by the Union and at least three administrators appointed by the CEO

The Class Size Review Board shall have the power to investigate complaints from any teacher or from the Union concerning violations of class size maximums as stated above, or inequitable school organization which results in class sizes over 30 in grades K-5 and 34 in grades 6-12. Further, the Class Size Review Board shall have the power to act on its own motion; to select particular schools and particular classes in selected schools for review; to effectively recommend the priority and method of correcting any inequities found including provision for additional teacher service, extra assistance and/or other types of relief; and to recommend the use of specific State and/or Federal Funds. 3. The Class Size Review Board in arriving at its conclusions shall reasonably evaluate the number of classroom teachers and the amount of space available; the objectives of the instructional program; the educational advantage and desirability of utilizing available teachers to reduce class size in basic programs and in programs where specialized instruction has been determined to be necessary; and the desired goals of quality integrated education jointly shared by the District and the Union.

A minimum of six (6) hours and ten (10) minutes of time defined as instruction by the guidelines set forth by the Michigan department of education will be provided.
The regular school day for assigned teaching, planning, and consultation shall be no longer than seven (7) hours and fifty-one (51) minutes for the 2002-03 school year.
Beginning with the 2003-04 school year the length of the high school day shall be no longer than seven (7) hours and five (5) minutes.
Teachers shall not cover halls during passing time prior to their lunch period or preparation period. Alternate schedules may be developed by the administration as long as they meet the state mandated hours of instruction.
The Union will be consulted in advance concerning such proposed alternate schedules. When another assignment or other educational responsibility which is equivalent to a class is assigned, the teacher will be relieved of one of the five class assignments.
In senior high schools sponsoring a school paper, a yearbook or a school play, the teachers involved shall not have more than five classes, one of which shall be called Journalism (Y or N)* or Drama. These classes may be extended into a duty period.
Dissimilar preparations per teacher in middle and senior high schools should be limited to three (3). Prior to the assignment of a fourth dissimilar preparation, the Administration and Union Committee will meet to see if the additional dissimilar preparation can be avoided. Dissimilar preparations shall not exceed five (5).
Each high school teacher shall have a 55-minute period daily which shall be used for lunch.
Each high school teacher shall also have one 55-minute preparation period daily.
Each high school teacher shall also have a 55-minute duty period daily. Beginning with the 2003-04 school year, the high school duty period will be eliminated.

DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 19 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 19 High School Sixth Period
The parties reaffirm the Letter of Agreement dated January 9, 1987 regarding the policy and procedure when a high school teacher agrees to teach a sixth (6th) class.
The letter states that teachers certified and qualified to teach in those areas designed as being short due to the lack of personnel may volunteer to accept an additional class. Such classes in the high schools shall be taught during duty periods by persons volunteering. Subsequent to receiving written applications, additional assignments shall be first offered to members of the department in which the class is scheduled, based on seniority. Eligible teachers must be satisfactory in their current assignment in order to qualify.
Shortage areas will be identified at the beginning of the school year or semester with the understanding that the Board's goal is to fill all vacancies with regular full-time teachers and offer additional classes to staff only when it becomes apparent such positions cannot be filled. The Union will be notified of each shortage area so identified before providing assignments.
Such additional assignments shall be for one semester. Each class period
shall be considered a one-hour assignment with teachers being paid one-eighth (1.8) [0.125] of their daily rate.
Teachers who volunteer and are assigned to teach additional classes will still work their regular clock hour day while receiving compensation for the assignment.
The school administration, in consultation with the Union Committee, shall prioritize staff needs for various duty assignments. The administration will make multiple assignments based on priorities established.
Duties shall not include preparation, plans, grading or reports unless time is provided during the period.
Every effort shall be made to assign each teacher to one (1) classroom by making full use of each available classroom in the school for instructional purposes.
When teachers are required to teach in more than one (1) classroom, every effort shall be made to limit the total number of classrooms to three (3).
2.	The middle school teaching program shall consist of teacher-pupil contact by each teacher of 315 minutes per day. This time shall be utilized for instructional periods, record-homeroom, and passing time between classes.
Each middle school teacher shall teach five 55-minute periods, one 15-minute record-homeroom and supervise students during passing time between classes. Alternate schedules may be developed by the administration as long as they meet the 315 minute requirement. The Union will be consulted in advance concerning such proposed alternate schedules.
When another assignment, such as a duty or other educational responsibility which is equivalent to a class is assigned, the teacher will be relieved of one of the five class assignments.
20 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05)
2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 20
Each middle school teacher shall have a twenty-five (25) minute lunch period daily.
Each middle school teacher shall have a daily preparation time of fifty (50) minutes.
3.	Beginning with the 2002-03 school year, each elementary teacher, (Pre-K-5) shall receive a minimum of four (4) sixty (60) minute preparation periods per week within the regular school day.
Beginning with the 2003-04 school year, each elementary teacher, (Pre-K-5) shall receive a minimum of five (5) sixty (60) minute preparation periods per week within the regular school day.
4.	When a teacher's preparation period must be assigned for other purposes, the assignments shall be rotated so that all of the staff share these burdens equitably.
5.	Whenever a teacher loses scheduled preparation time at the request of the administration, the teacher shall subsequently be granted, at a mutually convenient time, time for preparation equal to the preparation time lost. Time must be repaid within five school months of the time lost.
Effective July 1, 1997, lost preparation periods shall not carry over from one school year to the next school year. Lost preparation periods not made up by the end of the school year shall be compensated in the form of the current hourly rate.
6.	Substitute service shall be provided for teachers who accompany pupils on APPROVED field trips whenever a school is unable to provide class coverage without a substitute. This clause is not intended to
COVER the loss of preparation periods nor is it intended to preclude the voluntary exchange of preparation periods.
F. Interruptions
Classroom interruptions are detrimental to a good learning environment and to the continuity of a well planned classroom operation. Therefore, teachers and administrators accept the joint responsibility to minimize such interruptions. G. Lunch Period 1. Elementary Every elementary teacher shall have a duty-free lunch period of exactly forty-five minutes except in case of emergencies. Arrangements for aides shall be completed by the fifth week of the school year.
DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 21 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 21 2. Special Education The Administration will provide Special Education teachers with a full lunch period free of supervision of children as rapidly as possible. In any school where lunch time relief has not been provided, the Administration shall, on request of the Union, state the reason(s) in writing. 3. Counselors Counselors will have a scheduled duty-free lunch period corresponding to the lunch period for teachers in the same building. In each building, lunch periods of counselors shall be scheduled so as to insure maximum available counseling service to students throughout the lunch times. Except in emergencies, counselors' lunch periods will not be interrupted.
H. Relief from Non-Teaching Chores
To the extent that Federal or other funds are available for such purposes, School Service Assistants should be provided to handle non-teaching chores connected with the classroom under the direction of the assigned teacher.
The use of teachers to perform non-instructional functions shall be kept to a minimum and positive action shall be taken by the Administration to eliminate the need for teachers to perform such functions as soon as funds and staff permit. Positive action will include seeking out and utilizing state and federal funds. In the event that it is necessary to assign teachers to non-teaching duties, it shall be on an equitable basis for the entire staff.
The assignment of School Service Assistants in a particular school is a proper subject of discussion between the Administration and the School Union Committee. Before finalizing the assignment of School Service Assistants in a particular school the principal will afford the School Union Committee the opportunity to make observations concerning them. I. Release from Assigned Duties for Building Representatives In any senior high school in which there are more teachers than are necessary to fill the required study hall assignments, the Union duties of the Union building representative shall constitute his/her duty assignment.
In any elementary or middle school in which there are more teachers than there are homerooms or conference classes, whichever is applicable, the Union building representative shall be excused from such assignment. In schools where no such relief is possible, relief from some other duty assignment shall be arranged.
It is understood that in the determination of whether or not there are a sufficient number of teachers in the elementary school available to perform required duties, the parties acknowledge the necessity to
consider such factors as the size and organization of the particular school. In consideration of such factors, however, the priority will be given to the School Union Representative whenever it is determined that at least one of the teachers in such building is to be released from a duty assignment. In no case shall release from such assignment deprive students of essential services.
22 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 22 In determining whether or not there are more teachers than necessary to cover homeroom or conference classes, teachers assigned to more than one school for the purpose of providing supportive services shall not be counted.
In pursuance of his/her Union duties the Union building representative shall not interfere with any teacher who is engaged in a regular class, a duty, a conference, or homeroom assignment.
VIII. DISCIPLINE
A.	Within the framework of the Discipline and Corporal Punishment Policy of the School District of the City of Detroit a consistent and reasonable discipline procedure shall be developed within each school by the principal, assistant principal, department heads, counselors, and classroom teachers. Counselors and classroom teachers shall be selected by the instructional staff.
B.	The teacher's authority in his/her classroom is undermined when pupils discover that he/she has little or no administrative backing in discipline. As a result the entire school suffers deterioration in standards, morale, and climate favorable for teaching and learning.
C.	A teacher may exclude from his/her class a child who in the teacher's opinion is causing serious disruption. The teacher shall be available to confer with the principal or assistant principal or counselor to provide the necessary information concerning the problem and shall provide a statement of the problem in writing as soon as possible not to exceed twenty-four hours. The teacher will re-admit the child after some adjustment has been made, following a conference with the child and at least two of the following parties as determined by the principal: an administrator, a counselor, school social workers, school psychologist, attendance officer, a parent of the child.
Whether the teacher is present shall be determined by mutual agreement between the principal and the teacher. The teacher shall be provided a verbal statement of the results of the conference before the child is returned to class. A written statement of the result of the conference and/or adjustments will be given to the teacher as soon as possible, not to exceed 24 hours after conclusion of the conference.
D.	Following such a conference one of several courses of action will be taken:
1.	The child will be returned to the class with the understanding that he/she will correct his/her behavior.
2.	Depending upon the seriousness of the infraction, the child may be returned to class while his/her case is being referred to one of the special services by the school social worker, school psychologist, or an attendance officer/agent.
3.	In case all the teachers who work with a child in regular classes recommend suspension and the principal disagrees, the teachers shall address a request to the designee of the CEO who shall meet with the principal and the teachers to determine if the child shall be suspended. 4. The child will be suspended by the principal.
DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 23
2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 23
E.	Examples of offenses for which teachers may exclude students from class: profanity or obscenity, fighting, gambling, possession of tobacco, class skips, deliberate and open defiance of authority, inciting others to violence or disobedience, possession of pornographic literature, petty theft, petty vandalism.
F.	Security. The police department shall be called immediately in the event a criminal act is committed on school property.
1.	Examples of offenses which require principals to notify police: extortion of money or articles, possession of narcotics, arson or attempted arson (notify Fire Department), use or possession of alcoholic beverages, serious theft, serious vandalism, false reports of fire and bombs, possession of knife or other weapons, possession and/or sale of fireworks.
Upon inquiry, the principal will inform the teacher of the status of the case. The principal and the teacher will cooperate in the prosecution of the case upon request.
G.	Suspension may result from any persistent disobedience that interferes with the well-being of other students or that prevents the teacher from carrying on normal class activities.
H.	When in the opinion of the counselor his/her dissemination of a discipline decision will destroy or seriously impair the counselor/counselee relationship, the counselor will so inform the principal or his/her designee and request the principal or his/her designee to disseminate the discipline decision.
I.	A continuous record of student discipline cases will be maintained in a place available for staff use as a basis for recommendations for suspension and intelligent administering of penalties for misdemeanors. J. Where a principal is unwilling or unable to support teachers in maintaining school discipline, the principal's superior shall counsel with him/her and in the event his/her performance is not improved further appropriate action shall be taken.
K. Principals shall report to the CEO and to the police all cases of assault suffered by teachers in connection with their employment in which injuries have been suffered or in which there appears to have been malicious intent. Upon request, a copy of the report will be given to the teacher.
In any reported assault case the Legal Affairs Office shall:
1.	Inform the teacher of his/her rights under the law in connection with assault, and
2.	Assist the teacher by acting as liaison between the teacher, the police, and the courts.
L. A child who assaults a teacher will be suspended. Age and size of the offender will be taken into consideration.
When the parent/guardian of a student assaults a teacher, the student shall be transferred to another school.
If requested by the teacher, the District shall expedite the immediate transfer of the teacher to another school where a vacancy exists for which the teacher is certified. If no vacancy exists, the teacher may request CTAL status.
24 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 24 M. It is recognized that, in developing responsible student conduct the positive disciplinary techniques of example, counseling, and guidance should take precedence over punitive disciplinary measures.
In this regard, this Agreement provides for communication with parents on matters of discipline, safety, and other local school regulations
(Article XI, Section C.), and Union-sponsored workshops on classroom management
(Article XVIII, Section G, fifth paragraph).
It is general policy to expect that teachers will maintain discipline by means other than the use of corporal punishment. Therefore, use of corporal punishment as a routine measure is not contemplated.
This policy does not prohibit corporal punishment (as provided by Chapter 15, School Code of 1955, Section 755, et. seq.) but does restrict its use to those cases in which there is no adequate substitute treatment.
However, a distinction must be made between physical restraint, which is occasionally necessary to keep a young person from injuring himself/herself or others, and punishment, which is utilized to discourage repetition of misbehavior.
Punishment which, in the judgment of the CEO is more severe than that which might be administered by a reasonable parent; which is cruel or excessive; which is more severe than indicated by the gravity of the offense, or the apparent motive and disposition of the offender; which is excessive with respect to the sex, size, or physical strength of the pupil; which results in lasting pain or injury; or which is administered wantonly or from malice or passion, is prohibited in the Detroit schools.
It is essential that a clear understanding should exist between the principal and the teachers in each school concerning the above. The principal should be informed promptly by a teacher when incidents occur which require the use of physical restraint or corporal punishment. This will permit principals to be of greatest assistance in working with parents and the teacher for a full understanding and solution of the problem.
Teachers will receive full support of the principal and the central administration in actions taken by them pertaining to discipline, provided they act in accord with the provisions of this Article. This support shall include defense of the teacher's action by the principal against complaints of parents as well as legal assistance by the central administration in the event that a criminal complaint is made or civil court action is instituted for damages.
Attendance/Tardiness Policy
A revised attendance/tardiness policy for Grades K-12 shall be developed and implemented.
N. Uniform Code Review Committee (UCRC)
1.	A Uniform Code Review Committee shall be established. The Committee shall be composed of three (3) teachers selected by the Union and three (3) administrators appointed by the CEO The goal of the UCRC shall be to insure that schools are where teachers can teach and children can learn.
2.	The Uniform Code Review Committee shall have the power to investigate complaints brought by the School Union Committee concerning non-implementation or non-compliance with the Uniform Code.
DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 25
2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 25
Further, the UCRC shall have the power to act on its own motion, to select particular schools for review; to recommend the priority and method of correcting any documented cases of non-implementation or non-compliance; and to recommend to the CEO the use of state and/or federal funds, specified for school security/safety.
3.	The UCRC shall develop and make available to the DFT a standard form on which complaints shall be made. Prior to submitting any complaint to
the UCRC, the following attempts at resolution shall be made: a. The Detroit Federation of Teachers' representatives and the complainant( s) shall meet with the principal to attempt to resolve the complaint. If the complaint is not resolved within five (5) school days of the initial meeting, it shall be submitted to the District Review Committee (DRC).
b. A DRC meeting shall occur within ten (10) school days of the conclusion of the school level meeting. The DRC shall be composed of the school representative, a DFT staff representative and the principal. If the Committee does not reach an agreement, within five (5) days of its last meeting the complaint must be filed with the UCRC.
4.	The complaints shall be filed with the co-chairpersons who shall submit them to the UCRC. The UCRC shall identify and analyze data needs related to the specific complaint. Conclusions drawn and recommendations made will be based on objective analysis of these data.
The UCRC shall consider the complaint and make its recommendations to the CEO within ten (10) school days after the complaint has been received. An official copy of the recommendations shall be forwarded to the Union President at the same time.
5.	The CEO will make his response within five (5) school days. IX. PUPIL'S REPORT CARD MARKS
The mark of a teacher is the record of the teacher's evaluative judgment of the work of a pupil. The teacher shall be considered the expert in evaluating the work of his/her pupils and the integrity of the teacher in marking the pupil will be respected. It shall be the responsibility of the teacher to maintain adequate records to support all marks, which shall be the basis for determining the suitability of the grade. Pupil Report Card Marks
The report card marks for each marking period will be based on grades accumulated within the marking period. The final grade will reflect the average of the previous report card marks.
Every effort shall be made to avoid scheduling report card marking and administration of standardized testing during the same week. If such simultaneous scheduling is made, the local school administrator shall give the building representative a written explanation as to why the scheduling was unavoidable.
Student report cards shall be distributed two (2) times each semester — four (4) times per year — with parental conferences and/or advance written warning to parents of possible failures.
26 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 26 There shall be non-graded report cards for primary students. There shall be computerized attendance sheets for all grade levels by June 30, 2003.
Elementary teachers shall have at least three (3) full working days from the date of receipt to complete report card marking materials.
Middle and high school teachers shall have at least three (3) full working days from the date of receipt of report card marking materials to complete them.
Beginning the second semester of the 2002-03 school year, SMI forms will only be completed in homeroom classes.
Kindergarten report cards shall be distributed one (1) time per semester — two (2) times per year.
When a child's progress is such that failure seems likely, the counselor or principal should be advised by the teacher and appropriate steps taken to see that the parent is informed of the situation well in advance.
GRADE REVIEW PROCEDURES
BUILDING LEVEL PROCEDURES: FIRST LEVEL
Within 30 days of the issuing of the report card, a student or his/her parent may appeal a mark directly to the School's principal.
The grading teacher must be given an opportunity to respond to the parent/student compliant at a meeting conducted by the principal. If the parties cannot reach agreement, the principal will issue, in writing, a decision and his/her rationale. A copy will be given to the teacher and the parent.
The teacher, parent or student can appeal the pincipal's decision to the CEO or designee no later than 30 days from the date of the principal's decision.
No minimum or maximum limitations shall be set on the number of students who pass or fail. GRADE REVIEW PANEL PROCEDURES CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER LEVEL There will be two Grade Review Panels. One for Elementary Schools and another for Middle and High Schools.
A pool of candidates for the Grade Review Panel(s) will be identified by the Union and the District. Selection of candidates will be determined by identified criteria.
1.	The designee of the CEO will notify the Grade Review Panel upon receipt of the grade review request.
2.	The teacher will submit written justification for the grade in contention.
3.	The parent/student will submit written justification for changing the grade in contention.
4.	The building administrator will submit a chronology of his/her investigation, including a recommendation to resolve the dispute. DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 27 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 27
5.	The building administrator will forward all documentation pertinent to his/her decision to the designee of the CEO
6.	The designee of the CEO will convene a meeting of the Grade Review Panel to hear/discuss the case within thirty (30) school days.
7.	The Grade Review Panel may request a hearing with the involved parties.
8.	The Grade Review Panel decision will be made on the basis of the facts submitted.
9.	All parties (student, parent/guardian, teacher, and building administrator) will be notified in writing of the panel's decision and its rationale.
10.	The decision of the Grade Review Panel is final.
The Grade Review Panel will be made up of three (3) people selected by the CEO, using a random process. At least one of the Panel Members must be a classroom teacher. No member may be from the school where the appeal arose. X. PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCES
Two half-days per semester* shall be designated for parent-teacher conferences. These conferences shall be held on school time and all regular classes shall be dismissed, or one or both of the conferences may be held at another equivalent time, with classes dismissed one half day per conference at a time mutually agreed upon by the principal and the School Union Committee.
Teacher attendance is required up to six p.m. at any conference scheduled outside regular school hours. The dates, times and procedures for such conferences shall be established jointly by the principal and
the School Union Committee in consultation with representatives of the official parent group of that school.
In the event a mutually agreeable plan cannot be established, an appeal may be made to the CEO's designee.
In addition to the scheduled conference day or half-days referred to above, teachers shall confer with parents at other times mutually convenient to the teacher and the parent.
The parties will form a Labor/Management Committee to study the feasibility of scheduling parent-teacher conferences after 6:00 p.m. Special education teachers may, with the approval of the principal, utilize the one full day or two half-days designated for parent-teacher conferences to make home visits or follow-up calls.
In cases of particular urgency, additional time may be granted upon request and with the approval of the principal and the CEO's designee. Elementary teachers may, with permission of the principal, utilize the half-day or a part of the day now designated for parent-teacher conferences for home visits.
*Upon request of the kindergarten teacher and approval of the principal and CEO or his/her designee, an additional half-day may be used for parent-teacher conferences each semester.
28 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 28 The Union fully supports community and especially parental participation in the school program. However, such participation must not be allowed to distract pupils at work in the classroom(s), or in any way disrupt or obstruct the school's instructional program. This would make the community's interest in the school operation self-defeating.
Parent visits to the classrooms of their children will be encouraged The administration and teacher will try to prearrange the time of the visitation.
There may be occasion when a visit must be postponed.
Classroom visits by persons other than parents must be agreed upon by the teacher, the Union and the administrator. The purpose of such visits by other than parents must be clearly defined and stated in writing at the time the appointment is requested. Any disagreement regarding this paragraph should be immediately referred to the Union Office and the Office of Labor Contract Management which will take immediate action in an attempt to resolve the problem on a case by case basis based upon the information obtained and the best judgment of the responsible parties (see fourth paragraph of this Article).
XI.	SCHOOL COMMITTEES*
A.	Committee Participation
It is recognized that effective management of the school is dependent upon teacher participation on committees on school citizenship, finance, etc., or as sponsors of school clubs, organizations, or other activities. The dividing of these responsibilities among the faculty benefits all members of the school by equalizing the work load and providing, whenever possible, an opportunity for teachers to make their maximum contributions in areas of interest.
B.	School Fund
Money earned through school projects shall be kept in the school fund. The administration of this fund is the responsibility of the principal. The allocation of this money for school purposes not now provided for by the District shall be the joint responsibility of the principal and a School Fund Committee.
Teacher members of the School Fund Committee shall be elected by the teaching faculty. Membership on this committee shall not be dependent
upon organizational affiliation.
A statement of all income, expenditures, and balances shall be posted on the official bulletin board not less than every three months.
*See Article XXIII for School Union Committee and Sections H and I concerning faculty representation.
DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 29
2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 29
C.	Community-School
An advisory committee of administrators, counselors, teachers (selected by the Union) and community representatives may be organized at the local school level for the purpose of assuring greater communication with parents on matters of discipline, safety, and other local school regulations. Such committees are encouraged to coordinate efforts within their high school constellation and with schools in other constellations.
Plans developed by these committees shall not include any matter which is inconsistent with the collective bargaining Agreement, other District policy and/or the policies of other public agencies.
XII.	PERSONNEL ASSIGNMENTS
(See Also Article XIV.)
A.	Balanced Staff Concept
The District and the Union reaffirm their commitment to the balanced staff concept under which teachers assigned to schools shall have the necessary qualifications to teach the subject area and grade level, and pupils shall have experiences with teachers and administrators of different races, and shall have both new and experienced teachers on a faculty which includes both men and women. This concept has not been in the past and is not intended as an involuntary transfer procedure.
In order to implement the balanced staff concept: In filling vacancies and/or when a school's staff is increased or decreased, appropriate assignments or transfers will be made in the school department in which the change of service occurs, giving priority to the balanced staff concept elements in the following order: necessary qualifications to teach such area and grade level, race, experience, and sex.
B.	Assignment of Teachers
A certified teacher,* classified as an ESRP, assigned to a vacancy at the beginning of the fall semester shall be issued a contract within thirty (30) days after reorganization retroactive to the first day in the vacancy.
A certified teacher,* classified as an ESRP, assigned to a position which remains a legitimate vacancy between the period of January 1, through ten (10) days after reorganization will be given a contract retroactive to the first day in the vacancy.
Except during organization/reorganization, a certificated teacher, classified as an ESRP, retained for twenty (20) school days in a vacancy shall be tendered a contract retroactive to the first day in the vacancy.
C.	Promotion Policies Affecting A.A.O
Each Assistant Attendance Officer who submits evidence to the Office of Personnel of having earned a B.A. degree and who successfully completes the regular personnel interviewing process shall be placed on the Attendance Agent eligibility list.
Certificated is interpreted to mean a teacher holding a provisional, permanent, continuing, or life certificate.
30 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05)
2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 30
D.	Seniority
Seniority in the Detroit Public School System means total accumulated contract service and/or other permanent assignment service in this bargaining unit in any of the Detroit Public Schools since the most recent date of appointment (See Form 4301). Seniority also accrues while the employee is on sabbatical leave, professional service leave, and approved military service leave. Seniority does not accrue while on any other kind of leave.
Total accumulated seniority in this bargaining unit dating from most recent appointment to contract status for teachers or permanent assignment service for other employees in this bargaining unit shall be carried from one job classification to another when a transfer in job classification occurs, e.g. school social worker to teacher.
Building representatives shall be considered by reason of their position to have top seniority for purposes of transfer and assignment of duties (Super-Seniority).
Administrators who left the DFT bargaining unit and without a break in Detroit service thereafter returned to it, shall be accorded the seniority previously accrued while a member of the DFT bargaining unit as provided above, but shall not be accorded any seniority credit for the period outside the bargaining unit. Salary and fringe benefits shall be commensurate with their job classification and seniority.
Teacher service for full-time (1028 hours annually), certified adult education teachers will be carried over when reassigned to another regular job classification within the bargaining unit.
Seniority for teachers newly assigned to a building shall apply only after reorganization in the school.
Assistant Attendance Officer — Seniority
A.A.O.'s appointed to regular positions in the unit shall be considered probationary employees for the first sixty (60) calendar days. When an employee has satisfactorily completed the probationary period, he shall be entered on the seniority list of the unit and shall rank, for seniority purposes, from the effective date of his/her appointment. E. Transfer of Teachers
Subject to the Balanced Staff Concept, a teacher's system-wide seniority status shall govern when a reduction in teacher service makes it necessary to transfer teachers. The teachers to be transferred, within the department affected, will be determined by seniority.
If two teachers have the same amount of seniority, Detroit substitute teaching service will be added. This rule of seniority does not apply when a teacher freely requests or consents to a transfer or has been rated unsatisfactory.
Probationary teachers are not protected from transfer due to reduction in teacher service.
Qualified bilingual teachers who have full endorsement will be protected from reduction in service transfer if they are serving bilingual students and using their second language in the process.
DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 31
2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 31
When released service transfer is about to occur, the building representative and the involved teachers will be informed. Upon request, the basis for determination of such transfers will be given to the building representative and the teachers involved.
A teacher carries seniority only in the areas in which he/she is currently teaching. A teacher may not avoid a transfer by requesting a change in teaching-service department at the time when a transfer is under consideration because of released school service.
Teachers released from a specially funded program(s) shall be considered
part of the department to which they were previously assigned in that same school if the specially funded program(s) assignment involved direct contact with children in a teacher/pupil relationship.
Necessary transfers will follow Contract provisions.
If the specially funded program did not involve direct contact with children in a teacher/pupil relationship, the released teacher shall be placed in the same or similar position as that held before assignment to the special program as openings occur in that or another work location. The released teacher in this instance may not "bump" another teacher. Contract teachers must be given one week's notice before forced transfer due to lowered enrollment, except during reorganization; in the fall semester not later than the fourth Wednesday, and in the second semester during the first ten school days. Seniority rights will be respected consistent with the Balanced Staff Concept established by the District and supported by the Union.
Contract teachers shall receive at least a week's notice before they are transferred from one regular assignment to another regular assignment, unless such transfer is at the teacher's own request. Effective the 1997- 98 school year, only ESRP's, STS, LTS, LLI's in vacancies will receive two (2) days notice prior to being released except that vocationally certificated
ESRP's and Day Trade teachers shall be given at least 30 school days' notice before their assignment is closed out or they are transferred. The following represents the school district's policy for when schools merge, close, or reorganize. All reasonable efforts shall be made to reassign or assign staff in the following situations as early as possible after the end of the school year.
1.	Schools Which Merge
When one school merges totally with another, teachers in the two schools shall be merged. If excess teachers exist, the reduction of staff shall be made in inverse order of seniority using system-wide seniority in the bargaining unit by department, i.e. homeroom, science, math.
2.	Schools Which Close
If the students are permitted to select which school to attend, the District Personnel Office shall assign the teachers to other schools. 32 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 32 3. Schools Which Close Temporarily The teachers shall follow the students.
4. One or More Classes in a School are Relocated
The teachers shall follow the students. When a school is closed outside of the open transfer period, and teachers from the closed school have not yet been assigned by the District, a teacher who submits a transfer request, and who is selected by a principal with a legitimate vacancy for which the teacher is certified, shall be transferred to the school for which the teacher has been requested in accordance with Article XII. E.
When a teacher is appointed, transferred, or assigned to a position for which he/she is certificated and which he/she has agreed to assume, his/her seniority is in effect in that assignment, except at the beginning of the semester prior to organization-reorganization as stated previously.
If a contract teacher is transferred due to a reduction in teacher service and there is no vacancy citywide, he/she shall accept assignment as a contract-teacher-at-large (at regular salary and benefits) until an opening for which he/she is qualified occurs.
Placement of contract-teachers-at-large has priority over a newly hired
teacher, ES, ESV, RES and ESRP, and over a laid-off teacher with less seniority.
A contract-teacher-at-large may accept a temporary assignment of up to one year outside his/her regular subject area and upon written request retain seniority in his/her original field.
A teacher forced to transfer due to reduction in teacher service shall be given more than one choice of school whenever available. Following such forced transfer, subsequent voluntary transfer shall not be precluded by a minimum time requirement.
Effective June 1, 2000, the District shall establish an open transfer period from April 1-July 31.
During this open transfer period, members who wish to transfer may do so without seeking their release from their current principal.
Teachers who wish to change the location of their teaching or the kind of assignment they have, may apply for a transfer by filing Personnel Form 4039, Request for Transfer. The usual procedure is to submit the transfer form to the principal; however, it may be sent directly to the Office of Personnel as a confidential document without any signature except that of the teacher.
The request must be renewed annually if the individual wishes to have the request continue to be considered. Transfer requests are listed by the Office of Personnel in the order of receipt and area of specialization.
DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 33
2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 33
Transfer requests will be reviewed regularly by the Office of Administrative/ Instructional Personnel. The Office of Administrative/Instructional Personnel will make a "good faith" effort to honor transfer requests by the beginning of the first semester of the school year.
Before a teacher is transferred into a school, the SBMC will interview all qualified candidates who have met all necessary academic requirements for the vacancy and have expressed their interest in transferring in writing. The SBMC will make its recommendation to the principal regarding its selection after the final interview is conducted.
The decision of the principal following the recommendation of the SBMC as to acceptances shall be final.
Teachers requesting transfers that are not honored shall be notified in writing when the Transfer Request Module, of the proposed personnel/ payroll automated system, is implemented.
Transfer pools including filing and renewal dates shall be maintained and made available to the Union upon request. If a repeated transfer request has not been honored within three years, upon request the teacher shall be notified in writing as to the reason.
A teacher who has been forced to transfer due to reduced teacher service shall have priority to return to his/her school if a vacancy occurs for which he/she is qualified, consistent with the Balanced Staff Concept. The priority to return to his/her school shall be limited to a period of two (2) years.
Transfer requests to return must be submitted at the time of release due to reduced teacher service and annually, thereafter. In the event that a return is offered and refused, the District will no longer be obligated in this regard.
When a position is to be filled by transfer, the Office of Personnel will check its list of transfer requests against the requirements for the position. The position will be offered to those meeting the
requirements according to the Balanced Staff Concept, place on the transfer list, and seniority.
Transfers because of a reduction in teacher service shall be in accord with the Seniority and Transfer sections.
Transfers in response to the teacher's own request shall be in accord with the Seniority and Transfer sections.
There are times when the services of a teacher may be needed more in some other school than the one in which he/she is teaching. In such cases, teachers may be requested to change their locations for the best interests of the school system.
The District and the Union will develop procedures for unusual staffing requirements.
In the event that a grievance is filed on a proposed transfer, the Union may move directly to the procedure outlined in Article XXIII, D, 2, and the time allowed at each of the steps shall be reduced to no longer than one week at each step.
34 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 34 DFT members who are temporarily unable to perform essential functions at their regular worksite due to documented medical conditions that have been validated by the Medical Unit, shall be temporarily assigned by Administrative/Instructional Personnel to other worksites.
After medical validation, the teacher shall be reassigned to another worksite within twenty-four (24) hours. In the event the teacher is not reassigned within the twenty-four (24) hour period, all such waiting period absences will not be charged to the teacher's illness bank and the teacher's regular gross earnings shall be maintained. Teachers shall be returned to their regular assignments as soon as the temporary situations are alleviated. Any medical condition that exceeds ninety (90) days will be processed consistent with Article XII. Personnel Assignments, Section E. Transfers of Teachers, paragraphs 9 and 11.
Temporary assignments will not negate the corrective discipline process. Temporary assignments will not negate Article XIII, Section E., 1., Competence: Assistance and Reporting. The rating process would stop during the temporary reassignment, and would resume when the teacher is returned to his/her school. A temporary assignment shall be recognized as emergency absences from the teacher's regular worksite.
Every effort shall be made to place the affected teacher at a level comparable to their regular assignment.
It is expressly agreed that the foregoing language in this Article is intended to clarify existing seniority and transfer policies and is not otherwise motivated.
F. Transfer Review Board
A transfer review board consisting of equal numbers of representatives of the District and the Union will at monthly meetings review selected transfers with respect to balance of staff, race, experience, and sex. If this procedure does not accomplish transfers in compliance with the Balance of Staff Concept, the parties will meet to develop a mutually agreed upon alternate procedure. G. Teacher Layoff and Recall 1. Layoff In the event that teachers are permissibly laid off, they shall be laid off in inverse order of seniority, i.e., the teacher with the least system-wide seniority shall be laid off first.
In determining layoff,* a teacher's seniority shall be credited (a) In elementary:
(1)	In pre-K through grade 6 in homeroom
(2)	In special subject area, e.g., art, music, science
(b) In secondary: In areas in which teacher was assigned during the school year preceding layoff and in areas in which a major is carried. *See Article XII, Sec. D, for provisions affecting transfer.
DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 35
2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 35
In the event of discontinuance of any regular program or of a change in elementary from special subject to homeroom of any subject area, mutually agreeable special provisions shall be worked out by the District and the Union concerning the assignment of teachers who have been teaching in the discontinued program or subject area.
No teacher shall bump another teacher except to avoid layoff. In this case the teacher bumped shall be the teacher with the least system-wide seniority in an area for which the former teacher is qualified to teach as described above in this section.
No layoff of a Detroit teacher tenured as of September 1, 1977 shall occur with less than sixty (60) calendar days' written notice before the end of the school year.
No non-tenured contract teacher and no teacher who acquires tenure after September 1, 1977 shall be laid off for bona fide economic reasons during the school year except upon sixty (60) calendar days' written notice. These provisions concerning layoff shall not prevent transfers from one teaching area or grade level to another upon request of the teacher consistent with Article VII, D, 2 or, upon teacher request to avoid layoff.
A teacher who is scheduled for layoff shall remain in the same teaching assignment until the layoff becomes effective unless the service is no longer required or he/she is replaced by a contract teacher who is not scheduled to be laid off.
District payment of health, dental, and life insurance benefits carried by regular full time employees laid off upon completion of the school year shall be continued through October 5 of that calendar year. This provision shall not apply to limited emergency substitute teachers. (See language on Class 2 Regular Emergency Substitutes.)
Laid off teachers shall be permitted to carry group insurance available to active employees provided that arrangements can be made with the insurance carriers.
If layoffs are required, members of the bargaining unit who are credentialed and apply shall be made Regular Emergency Substitutes. Such placement on the substitute list shall not serve to deny said members their recall rights nor upon recall adversely affect their status and benefits acquired before layoff including but not limited to placement on the salary schedule, sick leave bank, and other fringe benefits.
Teachers working as substitutes while they are laid off may not use the sick days accumulated as contract teachers.
2. Recall
Teachers laid off are to be recalled in the reverse order of layoff following the seniority provisions established in the sections above and placed consistent with balance of staff requirements. In the case of equal seniority, other Detroit teaching service both substitute and contract will be added.
In the event that a teacher is to be recalled from a subject area list and that list has been exhausted, the teacher with the most system-wide seniority and certification from the other subject area lists shall be offered that position.
36 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05)
2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 36
In the event a teacher is recalled to a subject area other than his/her subject area, the teacher may refuse the recall and maintain his/her position on the subject area recall list.
If a teacher is recalled to his/her subject area and he/she refuses the recall, the teacher shall be terminated without further obligation on the part of the District. However, if the teacher to be recalled is currently employed by another school district, the teacher will be allowed to complete the school year in that district and will be recalled at the beginning of the next school year.
If the recalled teacher has confirmed employment elsewhere, the teacher will be allowed up to forty-five (45) days to report to the recalled position. If the recalled teacher is ill and unable to report for work, the teacher will be recalled and placed on illness leave until the teacher is able to return to work consistent with the present leave policy.
On being recalled, a teacher shall become an ESRP (special authority)* until such time as enrollment figures are verified and the permanency of the position is verified. Such determination will take place no later than the end of the fifth week of school. When the recall has been determined to be finalized, the teacher shall, retroactive to date of recall, have restored status and benefits acquired before layoff including but not limited to placement on the salary schedule, sick leave bank, and other fringe benefits.
Teachers recalled after the fifth week of school shall be placed on contract status immediately with status and benefits restored.
If at the time of recall, the person to be recalled can provide sufficient evidence to confirm that they qualify for maternity disability leave, approved illness leave of absence, personal business maternity related leave, or maternity related right to return child care leave, they will be recalled to that position subject to the appropriate leave of absence provisions with the right to use sick days where applicable. Notification on Recall will be: a. by telephone first b. by certified or registered letter if there is no answer by phone. Position will be held for a response for 10 calendar days from date of sending letter.
If the ten (10) days expire, the person shall be reinstated for recall on his/her contacting the District WITHIN THE NEXT TEN (10) CALENDAR DAYS. Failure to respond to the written notice of recall within the ten
(10) day period will result in the individual being moved to the bottom of the recall list. The teacher will be terminated without further obligation on the part of the District if there is no response within thirty (30) days of official recall notification.
New teachers shall not be hired to fill vacancies for which laid off teachers or contract-teachers-at-large are qualified and can fill.** **Such teachers shall have all benefits and pay as would accrue under contract except for layoff notice which would be the same as ESRPs. The pay rate shall be the same as the teacher would have received if he/she had not been laid off. **See Article XV, Section H. DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 37 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 37 H. Unemployment Compensation
A contract teacher who is laid off under the provisions of this Agreement, paid unemployment compensation benefits associated with his/her regular teaching assignment during the summer immediately following the layoff, and subsequently recalled to a similar position by the Monday following the fourth Friday of the next school year, will be paid his/her annual salary rate as if the teacher had been employed the entire school year, reduced however, by the amount of the unemployment compensation he/she received during the summer immediately following the layoff.
Any such reduction of the total annual salary rate shall be prorated over the entire school year. The teacher shall receive all seniority, benefits and retirement credits without reduction as a result of the above procedure and as if the teacher had been recalled by the first day of the school year.
I.	Layoff and Recall of Other Bargaining Unit Members
In the event that members of the bargaining unit, except employees covered in Section F and H above, are permissibly laid off, they shall be laid off in inverse order of seniority in each job classification affected based on system-wide seniority, i.e., the person in the applicable job classification with the least system-wide seniority shall be laid off first. (See definition of seniority.)
A teacher who is scheduled for layoff shall remain in the same teaching assignment until the layoff becomes effective unless the service is no longer required or he/she is replaced by a contract teacher who is not scheduled to be laid off.
Recall shall be in inverse order with the person having the greatest seniority in each classification based on system-wide seniority being given first opportunity of recall to that classification.
An Assistant Attendance Officer will receive a two-week notice prior to the close-out of his/her position at a given school. In emergency situations beyond the control of the School District of the City of Detroit, except emergency weather conditions, AAO's will receive at least two (2) calendar days' notice of lay-off.
J.	Adult Education
Any adult education teacher employed 20 hours or more per week will be
provided a two-week notice prior to any layoff resulting from reduced enrollment or attendance which occurs during the school year.
The layoff of adult education teachers in primary positions shall be within their areas of certification and in inverse order of seniority accumulated in this category. In the following situations, seniority will not be applicable: a. Where verified by-weekly student attendance falls below eight resulting in the teacher being employed less than twenty hours per week and/or b. Where the teacher agrees to be employed for less than twenty hours per week.
38 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05)
2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 38
Recall of teachers laid off on the basis of seniority shall be in reverse order of layoff.
Each time it becomes necessary to close a class because verified biweekly student attendance has fallen below eight a verbal warning will be given to the teacher, followed by a written warning two weeks later. The teacher will have an additional two weeks after the written warning to achieve a minimum attendance of eight students. (The assigned teacher-in-charge will work with the teacher to improve attendance after each warning.) Teachers employed for twenty or more hours per week and not subject to (a) and/or (b) above, will be guaranteed a minimum of twenty hours continued employment for the balance of the current school semester. Teachers included in categories (a) and (b) above, would not have the right to "bump" other teachers.
A class may be terminated (closed) during the first five (5) weeks of the fall and spring semesters if it has not demonstrated proportionate growth toward an enrollment level of ten (10) students in Vocational Education, fifteen (15) students in Adult Basic Education, and eighteen (18) students in secondary.
A class may be terminated (closed) during the first two (2) weeks of the summer semester if it has not demonstrated proportionate growth toward an enrollment level of ten (10) students in Vocational Education, fifteen (15) students in Adult Basic Education, and eighteen (18) students in secondary education.
K.	Summer School and Night School Assignments
All teachers regularly assigned to classroom teaching during the school year shall have an opportunity to teach in summer school and night school assignments before other certificated persons are assigned.
Non-teaching teachers shall be eligible for assignment only when regular classroom teachers are not available.
Counselors will be eligible for summer school and evening school teaching positions and shall have priority for night school and summer counseling positions before other certificated persons are assigned.
In the event summer assignments in the area of attendance are available, Assistant Attendance Officers who are regularly assigned to a school or work location shall have preference.
Summer school assignments shall be rotated on a three year basis whenever there are sufficient teachers available who are qualified to teach the particular subject for which a summer school teacher is
needed.
Summer school and evening school job opportunity notices will be made available through the Office of Personnel upon personal visit but will not be available upon telephone calls. Article XXIV, Information, also applies to this provision. (See Section M below for details.) DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 39

Persons other than unit members may be utilized in after-school programs.
Night school procedures shall be posted at least twice a year.
M.	Procedures for Assignment of Summer School Teacher Personnel In accord with Article XII, Section I, the following guidelines will govern the assignment of teachers for the summer school sessions:
1.	The rotation of teaching staff members will be achieved by releasing teachers who have served three (3) or more consecutive years in summer school. A teacher will not be rotated unless a fully qualified teacher is available to replace him/her.
2.	Where it becomes necessary to rotate teachers, the following rules will apply, provided a balanced staff is maintained:
a.	Within a department the teacher with the greatest number of consecutive years of summer school service will be released first. The next to be released will be the one with the next highest number of years of service in summer school.
b.	Where two individuals within a department have the same length of summer school service, the individual with the greater system seniority will be retained.
3.	Teachers who are released because of the rotation policy must reapply in order to be considered for employment in future years.
4.	In the assignment of teachers consideration will be given to building a summer school staff which will be composed of at lease one-third of the day school staff. In order to achieve this, when a vacancy occurs in a school, the first person from that school on the eligibility list will be given preference for the assignment provided he/she is fully qualified and the assignment is in accord with the Balanced Staff Concept.
Where no such teacher is available from that school, the first person so qualified on the eligibility list will be offered the assignment.
5.	Unusual circumstances which arise in relation to the rotation or replacement of staff members will be reviewed by a special summer school personnel committee. The Union will be represented on this committee.
6.	Summer School application procedures:
a.	The Office of Personnel will establish a two week period during the spring semester for the receipt of applications for summer school teaching.
b.	Teachers who apply for these positions during this time period will be given preference consistent with the present guidelines pertaining to summer school employment practices.
40 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05)
2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 40
c.	Teachers who apply subsequent to the posted closing date will be considered for employment in order of receipt of application only after the list provided for in paragraph b. has been exhausted.
N. Procedure for Assignment of Non-Public Site Teacher Personnel
All assignments of teachers to specially funded positions at non-public sites shall be made by the Office of Personnel in accordance with regular written Office of Personnel selection and assignment procedures.
If a position at a non-public site is maintained from one school year to the next, the teacher who satisfactorily occupied that position the first year shall be reassigned to it for the following year.
Where necessary cuts or reduction of programs result in layoffs, teachers shall be laid off in inverse order of seniority accumulated in this category, i.e., the person with the least seniority in non-public sites shall be laid off first.
Any non-public site teacher will be provided in two-week notice prior to any layoff resulting from reduction in programs. Recall shall be in reverse order with the teacher certificated for the position and having the greatest seniority in non-public sites being given first opportunity of recall.
XIII. RECORDS AND FILES; REMOVAL OF REPRIMANDS; SPECIAL COMPLAINTS; TENURE; COMPETENCE; RATING AND DISCIPLINARY ACTION; DISCHARGE OR DISCIPLINE; EVALUATION; RESIDENCY
A.	Records and Files
Personnel records shall continue to be confidential and carefully guarded in the interest of the individual employee.

apart of any other file or record which is utilized in the promotion process; nor shall it be used in any recommendations for job placement.
No official report nor any derogatory statement about a teacher shall be filed by an administrator or supervisor unless the teacher is sent a dated copy at the same time. The teacher shall have the right to submit a response to the report or statement. Such a response shall be attached to and filed with the report or statement in the teacher's official personnel file.

The teacher will be notified in advance in writing of the purpose of a meeting with an administrator in cases where an unsatisfactory rating and/or disciplinary action — including official reprimand — is contemplated, and shall be entitled to have Union representation. G. Discharge or Discipline No employee shall be discharged or disciplined unjustly. DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 45 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 45 XIV. SUBSTITUTES During the 2002-2003 school year, no change in the substitute classification system will be made, except to provide job codes for retirees working as substitutes. The Certified/Certified Rate salary schedule will be maintained through 2002-2003.
However, during the 2002-2003 school year, the substitute roster will be reviewed for: • Accuracy of contact information
•	Credentials (compliance with permit requirements defined by theDepartment of Education)
•	Work history (compliance with five (5) day commitment)
•	Continued interest in working
•	Areas of interest (e.g. Elementary, Special Education)
The SAMS/Sub-finder Program will be piloted during the 2002-2003 school year and will be fully implemented during the 2003-2004 school year.
Substitutes regularly working five (5) days per week during the 2001-2002 school year in the job code 9000 will be reclassified as 9160 substitutes for the 2002-2003 school year. The salary schedule will be the same as for 9000, however, they will receive employee-only medical insurance as well as sick days. Substitutes will be re-classified to 9000 if they fail to maintain a five-day per week work schedule. A. ES Progression to ESRP; ESRP Progression to Contract Any substitute assigned to a verified and authorized vacant position shall be paid at the applicable ESRP salary rate from the first day of service in that position.
A substitute assigned to a position other than an authorized vacant position, e.g. as a result of an illness absence, a position resulting from the absence of a teacher who has a right to return to the same position, a position resulting from an absence due to Workers' Compensation, must complete twenty (20) days in that assignment before beginning to be paid at the applicable ESRP rate. Once twenty (20) days of service have been completed, ESRP pay shall be retroactive to the first day of service in that position.
Effective the 1997-98 school year, only ESRP's in vacancies will receive two (2) days notice prior to being released.
No ESRP shall be released except for (1) the assignment of a contract* teacher certificated for the position, (2) unsatisfactory service as provided on "Report on Quality of ESRP, ES or Intern Teacher *The District's standard current probationary, annual or continuing contract provided that no new conditions or provisions shall be adopted except in accord with collective bargaining agreement.
46 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 46 Service," (3) the position is closed out, or (4) implementation of the Balance of Staff Concept. An ESRP retained for 100 school days in a fulltime assignment for which he/she has a provisional, permanent, continuing, or life certificate shall be tendered a contract* dated and effective back to the original date of assignment and shall, effective such date, be treated as a contract* teacher for all purposes of this Agreement except that such teacher may be transferred at the end of the semester, and except that an ESRP retained for 100 days or more in an illness position will not be tendered a contract as long as that position is being held for the disabled teacher, except no ESRP will be appointed to contract status if a certified laid off teacher is available for the position. (This does not change the present transfer policy.) The time spent in an illness absence shall be counted toward the 100 days if the illness absence becomes a vacancy, except that such teacher shall not have priority over a laid off teacher for that position but shall be placed on a ranking list according to the effective date the position became a vacancy or the date the teacher on a right-to- return child care leave returns to that position.
An ESRP who is released after having served 100 days in an illness position on one-year child care leave will be given priority for reassignment to a vacant position both during the school year and at the beginning of the new semester but shall not have priority over a laid off teacher.
An ESRP who has served 100 days in an illness position or one-year child care leave and who is reassigned as an emergency substitute to a vacant position in September will be tendered a contract if the position remains vacant following the fourth Wednesday enrollment count but shall not have priority over a laid off teacher.
An ESRP who has served 100 days in an illness position or one-year child
care leave and is reassigned to a vacant position any time during the school year after the fourth Wednesday will be tendered a contract at the time the vacant position is confirmed but shall not have priority over a laid off teacher.
B. Beginning with the 2003-2004 school year, Appendix A. Emergency Substitutes (Delete Class 1 and 2) and Appendix A. Emergency Substitutes (Delete Class 3 & 4), there will be two (2) classifications of Emergency Substitutes (ES).
Long-Term Substitutes (LTS)
Selected to work in any school five (5) days per week will be selected based on the following prioritized order:
•	15 semester hours of professional education as defined by Michigan Department of Education
•	Less than 15 but more than 6 semester hours
•	Fewer than 6 semester hours and enrolled in an approved plan of work. Refusing an assignment will result in reclassification to STS. Benefits will be maintained through the summer provided the LTS remains eligible for LTS status as indicated previously in this paragraph.
*The District's standard current probationary, annual or continuing contract provided that no new conditions or provisions shall be adopted except in accord with collective bargaining agreement.
DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 47
2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 47
Short-Term Substitutes (STS)
A STS shall be defined as a substitute with at least a Bachelors degree who is assigned on an as-needed basis to one or more schools.
The District reserves the right to move substitutes from STS to LTS class based on need and qualifications. Based on need and qualifications, some LTSs may be reclassed to STS. The parties will meet prior to January 1, 2003 to discuss reclassification procedures.
A needs assessment will take place following the 4th Wednesday student count in September and February and at the end of the school year. Laid off contract teachers are to be offered a LTS assignment in the reverse order of layoff, following the seniority provisions in Article XII, Section F, 1 and 2. Acceptance or refusal of an assignment shall not affect the contract teacher's placement on the recall list. C. Provision of Substitutes
In the event of a regular classroom teacher's absence on a scheduled instruction day, the District shall continue to provide all available substitutes.
If all available substitutes have been called and there still are vacancies in the school, the class shall be covered in accord with the emergency plan developed by the principal in consultation with the School Union Committee. Emergency plans shall involve all certified personnel, including administrators, in teaching or supervision of pupils.
Hourly employees or otherwise non-certified instructional support personnel within the bargaining unit shall not be used to provide substitute coverage or supervise students when adequate substitute service is not available. The parties will meet to discuss liability issues.
D.	Accumulation of Sick Leave — ESRP's, RES's, ES Class I
ESRP's shall accumulate sick leave on the basis of one day per twenty (20) days worked. Days accumulated shall be carried over from one ESRP assignment to the next if: (a) the break in ESRP service is of twenty (20) or fewer school days duration; OR (b) if the teacher is available and willing to serve in any school in the system as assigned, at least
three days per week.
Effective the 1994-1995 school year, all RES's and ES Class I's assigned to a building as a five (5) day substitute, or committed to a five (5) day availability for substitute service, shall receive two (2) sick days the first semester of the school year, and an additional two sick days the second semester of the school year.
Individuals who begin their employment with the district as an RES or ES Class I at any time after the second pay period of a new semester, will have their sick days prorated on a full day basis — one (1) day in the fall or one (1) day in the spring.
ESRP's, ES Class I's and RES's may use earned sick leave days as needed regardless of which of the three (3) substitute classifications they possess. Unused sick days may be banked up to a limit of one hundred (100). Provisions for utilization of sick leave shall be the same as those of contract teachers.
(Also see insurance provision and Appendices.)
48 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 48 The sick bank accumulated during services as ESRP, ES Class I or RES shall be carried over to contract assignment.
E.	Distribution of Substitutes
To supplement the District's prior efforts to provide equal educational opportunities to Detroit Public School children, the District and the Union will work toward the equitable distribution of ESRP's in all areas of the city.
Up to three additional attendance agents shall continue to function as relief attendance agents servicing area attendance centers as needed. A list of available substitute registered nurses shall be maintained by the School District of the City of Detroit.
A registered nurse substitute shall be provided when the registered nurse in a school is absent on a scheduled class day and a registered nurse is available.
F.	Resource Teachers and Other Substitutes
Resource teachers are contract substitutes. In utilizing resource teachers and other substitutes, present practices and procedures shall be continually reviewed and improved. G. Student Teachers Student teachers may be used as substitutes for their sponsoring teachers only in accordance with provisions made by the State Board of Education.
This provision shall not limit the right of a student teacher to substitute if the student teacher is otherwise qualified to substitute by Special Permit issued by the State Board of Education.
H. Substitute Calls
The substitute office will give priority to fully certified persons who have expressly agreed to serve in any school in the Detroit Public School System in filling requests for substitutes before 7:15 a.m. XV. LIMITED LICENSE TO INSTRUCT
The parties agree to amend the Letter of Understanding signed June 6, 2001 regarding Limited License Instructor (LLI).

The District upon written request may grant leave of absence for a period not to exceed one year, subject to renewal at the will of the District. Leave of absence for physical or mental disability without request may be granted for a period not to exceed one year. No leave of absence shall serve to terminate continuing tenure previously acquired. When it is necessary to be absent, the teacher should notify the school office or the person designated at the time established by the school. The school office should be informed of an expected absence early enough to be able to have the substitute teacher arrive before the opening of the DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 51 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 51 school day. The absent teacher should notify the school by 2:30 p.m. of the day preceding his/her return so that the substitute may be released in time for another assignment.
Employees able to anticipate non-illness absence chargeable to Sick Leave must make application in advance on Personnel Form 4132, Request for Approved Absence with Pay.
Form 4043, Request for Leave of Absence or Extension of Leave, is to be submitted by an employee who wishes an approved absence, without pay, for periods of more than four weeks (20 working days), with the exception of Sabbatical Leaves and absence for Exchange Teaching. Types of Leaves are as follows: Illness or disability (see also Statement of Policy for Maternity, military, study, personal business, and government or professional service. A leave of absence for study, personal business, or government or professional service is not granted
during the first year following appointment to a position.
1.	Illness. An employee may be granted a leave of absence for prolonged illness subsequent to the termination of his/her sick leave bank. An extension of illness leave beyond one year must be accompanied by Form 431, Physician's Certificate, filled out by the employee's physician.
Any further extension may be granted only upon recommendation of the District Medical Examiner.
Return from illness leave can be effected as soon as approval of the employee's doctor and the District Medical Examiner is secured. (Form 431, Physician's Certificate, may be obtained from the school office or from the Office of Personnel and completed by the employee's doctor.) In general, the position will be held one year pending return.
2.	Military. A teacher entering any of the armed services of the United States — including the Red Cross and the Merchant Marine — will be granted a leave without pay when enrolled and assigned to active duty. If he/she applies for reinstatement with the District within 90 days after his/her separation from the armed service, and if he/she is still qualified and competent, he/she will be reinstated in his/her former position (or like position) in the department where he/she was serving when the leave was granted. A photostatic copy of his/her military record must be filed with the Office of Personnel. He/she will return at the salary rate which he/she would have attained had he/she not been on leave.
Pension credit is given for approved military service, but annuity deposits must be made by the employee.
3.	Study. Beginning with the 1975-76 school year, teachers who are granted leave for study shall return at the completion of that leave at a salary level in accordance with service credit earned at the time the leave was granted. On his/her return, he/she should file an official college transcript showing that he/she has completed at least ten semester hours of credit each semester, or ten quarter hours each quarter (except during the summer) in a university or college accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools or equivalent agencies. Retirement credit is not allowable during such leaves.
4.	Maternity. See Statement of Policy for Maternity, Appendix.
52 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 52
5.	Personal Business. Leave of absence for personal business shall be limited to one year and no leaves shall be granted, other than Sabbatical Leaves, to District employees for the purpose of engaging in similar employment elsewhere, with the exception of leaves for teaching in foreign lands under U.S. Government auspices.
6.	Government Service. A teacher may be granted a leave of absence for elected or appointed service with the government. Such a leave shall be renewable annually upon written request of the teacher. Neither seniority, experience, nor retirement credit shall accrue on such leave. 7. Professional Service. Teachers wishing to work for labor organizations or unions may be granted a leave of absence for elected or appointed service with the Detroit Federation of Teachers, the Michigan Federation of Teachers, the American Federation of Teachers, or the AFLCIO, only. Such a leave shall be without pay and shall be renewable annually upon written request of the employee. The teacher's seniority and experience credit shall accrue. Retirement credit for such service shall be granted as provided by law.
8. Jury Duty. A teacher who serves on jury duty will be granted leave of
absence. The teacher will be reimbursed for the difference between jury duty pay and his/her District salary for the days served.
When the teacher is excused from jury duty for a half day or more, he/she must notify his/her administrator immediately and report to his/her school or work location for a suitable assignment. Reimbursements will be granted after submitting Request for Approved Absence with pay (Form 4132) and official proof of the number of days served to the Office of Personnel. Teachers, when summoned to jury duty, should respond to such summons as directed. Classroom teachers should request to be excused from jury duty, or to serve their jury duty at a time other than during the school year. Letters to support such request may be obtained from the Office of Personnel. The effective date of leave is the day following the last day for which the employee is paid. The maximum allowance for all purposes (except professional service) shall be three consecutive years. Requests warranting special consideration beyond the limitations indicated may be referred to a reviewing committee for recommendation. Leaves of absence, with the exception of illness leaves, should begin and end at natural breaks such as vacation period, report card marking or end of semester. Employees returning from leave are expected to remain in District employment for at least one year.
An employee may request one to four working days without pay for personal business. No special form is required but he/she should first have the approval of his/her principal. Form 4132, Request for Approved Absence without Pay, is submitted by an employee requesting approval of absence for a period of one week (5 working days) to a maximum of four weeks. DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 53 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 53 Employees wishing release for one or more of the last three days before the end of the spring semester in June, in order to attend an accredited summer school session or to depart for an accredited summer tour, must submit Form 4117, Request for Early Dismissal, to the Office of Personnel. Conditions for considering approval are: a. College credit must be earned, b. Employees leaving early for one of the above purposes must submit transcripts of their credits earned not later than October 1 to the Personnel Records Department.
When an employee is absent due to personal business without pay on the day before and the day following a holiday, he/she loses pay for all three days; the preceding day, the holiday, and the day following. However, if the employee is absent either before or after the holiday, but not both, he/she would lose pay only for the day of his/her absence. A. Personal Business Leave Days The present provisions allowing five days per year for specified non-illness emergency absence shall continue in effect, along with a policy permitting two of these five days to be used for personal business which does not fall into presently designated categories but which cannot be conducted at any time not in conflict with the normal school working day. These days may not be used to extend a holiday. B. Sick Leave 1. Sick leave for 39-week teachers, hired before July 1, 1997, shall
accumulate in a single bank at the rate of fifteen (15) days per year with a limit of 200 days.
Sick leave for regular 39-week teachers, hired after June 30, 1997, shall accumulate in a single bank at the rate of one (1) day per month in their first year of employment and one and one-fifth (1.20) days per month until the four (4) year probation period is over. Starting in the fifth (5th) year, the employees will earn one and one-half (1.50) days per month each year thereafter with a limit of 200 days. Days earned shall be credited on the first day of each month beginning with September.
Regular hourly rated employees shall accumulate sick leave at the rate of one hour for every twenty-five hours worked.
With the implementation of the new automated payroll system, in January, 1994, hourly-rated employees will be provided a biweekly sick bank account on their pay stubs for the hours they have accumulated. Until January 1, 1994, an annual statement of such bank balance will be provided to each hourly-rated employee.
This sick leave provision shall apply in the same fashion as sick leave provisions apply to regular classroom teachers. When an employee's sick leave bank has reached the current allowable maximum as set forth in this Agreement there shall be established a "Catastrophe Bank" into which all days over the maximum shall be placed. When an employee has used all days accumulated in his/her sick bank for an illness/disability extending more than six months he/she may 54 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 54 the draw from the "Catastrophe Bank" to the extend he/she has made contribution to said bank. (The Employer may require medical evidence of the illness/disability.) If a teacher is unable to work as a result of a compensable injury, the teacher may utilize "Catastrophe Bank" sick leave days to maintain regular gross earnings without affecting the teacher's regular sick leave bank. Teachers will be provided an annual update on the number of days in their catastrophic bank.
2.	Teachers in their first year of employment may, with a promissory note, borrow up to five (5) additional sick days for extended illness.* These days will be repaid on a monthly basis during the next school year.
Teachers, hired before July 1, 1997, who have exhausted their bank may, in the case of extended illness,* with a promissory note, borrow up to ten (10) days. These days will be deducted at the beginning of the following school year.
3.	Teachers, hired after June 30, 1997, who are in their second or more year of employment and, who have exhausted their sick bank may, in the case of extended illness,* with a promissory note, borrow up to ten (10) additional days. These days will be repaid on a monthly basis during the next school year.
4.	Any teacher who terminates his/her employment shall repay the school system the amount owed for sick leave days advanced under this policy. 5. Assault Related Absences Employee absences resulting from school-related assault shall not be charged against sick leave, although the employee's regular gross earnings shall be maintained. The maintenance of regular gross earnings, termed "assault pay," is subject to the following provisions:
1.	The Report of Industrial Injury shall be filed with the Principal within five (5) business days of the incident giving rise to the claim
or no later than five (5) work days after the claimant first sought medical treatment for the claimed injury.
2.	The employee must file for Workers' Compensation benefits when eligible, no later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date given rise to the assault claim.
3.	When the employee presents medical documentation that he/she is unable to return to work then, or for the foreseeable future and is seeking benefits under this article, an eligible employee will be notified by the School District of the City of Detroit that he/she must file no later than five (5) business days for MPSERS retirement (regular or disability).
*Extended illness shall be interpreted to mean illness requiring use of consecutive days during or following hospitalization or home confinement for serious illness or accident requiring a doctor's care.
DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 55
2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 55
4.	When the employee presents medical documentation that he/she is unable to return to work then, or for the foreseeable future, and is seeking benefits under this article, an eligible employee will be notified by the School District of the City of Detroit that he/she must file no later than five (5) business days for social security benefits (normal, early or disability).
5.	Failure of an employee to apply for such benefits, within the time limits, shall disqualify the employee from receiving further benefits under this section.
6.	Failure of a teacher to notify the School District of the City of Detroit of the result of applying for these benefits, acceptance or denial, within five (5) business days from the date the result was received by the employee shall also result in immediate disqualification from further receipt of assault pay.
7.	Negligent injury caused to a teacher in a school resulting from the negligence of a pupil will be treated as an assault under this section. Offset
If the weekly Workers' Compensation and/or Social Security disability benefits are awarded or paid voluntarily by the employer, said amounts shall be deducted from an employee's assault pay.
Benefit Termination or Limitation
1.	If retirement is granted through MPSERS (regular or disability), entitlement to assault pay shall terminate even if the employee continues to receive weekly Workers' Compensation benefits.
2.	If the employee rejects the report of the specialist (See XV E) and pursues a Workers' Compensation claim, any recovery shall be Workers' Compensation benefits only. The employee shall not receive assault pay benefits.
6.	Members of the bargaining unit who are the unfortunate victims of such occurrences as robbery or assault, while in school or engaging in school related activities, assignments, or duties regardless of time or place shall have released time with pay for court appearances and any other necessary appearances to prepare the criminal case.
7.	The sick leave bank shall not be charged for necessary absences up to five days resulting from the following childhood diseases: chickenpox, conjunctivitis, measles, mumps, diphtheria, whooping cough, impetigo. The statement of a licensed physician shall be required as proof of the cause of such absence.
8.	Sick leave provisions are designed exclusively for absences caused by illness, injury, or as otherwise outlined in this Agreement. The District will investigate suspected instances of abuse of sick leave.
The parties agree the District may implement a schedule of discipline based upon suspected abuse of the sick bank by any unit member subject to the just cause provision.
56 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 56 9. Upon retirement with a retirement allowance in accordance with the qualifications established by the Michigan Public School Employees' Retirement System — School District of the City of Detroit, an employee will be paid an amount not to exceed one-half his/her unused sick leave days, with a maximum allowance of 35 days' pay.
The estate of a teacher who dies during the term of this Agreement shall receive terminal pay calculated on same basis as if he/she had retired. C. Illness Absence — Medical Examinations An employee not able to return to work following eight (8) consecutive days of absence for personal illness must have a medical examination by the District's medical examiner. The medical examination shall be restricted to the employee's stated reason(s) for the illness absence. If procedures are followed, delays in scheduling the medical examination shall not be charged to the employee's sick bank.
After 8 consecutive work days of sick leave, a teacher must furnish a statement from his/her physician on Form 431, Release Pay Check: Physician's Certificate, in order to secure his/her next pay check. In cases involving surgery, bone fractures, heart, thyroid, and nervous disorders, the employee must have the approval of the District Medical Examiner before he/she may return to duty.
A further check is required on employees with continued illness absence extending beyond the second consecutive pay period. Information about the condition of the employee is obtained either from the principal (or in a non-school department, from the department head) or by a visit from the administrative nurse. Information may also be obtained on a Form 431 completed by the employee's physician. Employees who remain on extended sick leave may be asked to have a medical examination by the District Medical Examiner during the period they are absent after continued absence beyond two consecutive pay periods.
Such examinations are required when sufficient evidence of continued illness is not obtainable by other means.
If convalescence outside of town is recommended by one's own physician and approved in advance by the District Medical Examiner, such absence may be charged to sick leave.
In absences involving compensation under the State of Michigan Compensation Law, charges to sick leave allowances are made only to the extent necessary to maintain the employee's regular bi-weekly gross earnings.
The Office of Personnel may require a medical examination by the District Medical Examiner for an employee at any time when the maintenance of minimum health standards in a school or department is in question.

IMPROVEMENT OF FACILITIES Adequate lunchroom, restroom and lavatory facilities exclusively for teacher use shall be made available in all schools. All high schools shall have workrooms of sufficient size to accommodate an assigned desk for each teacher.
A systematic program is being developed to the end that existing school buildings be upgraded in these areas as rapidly as funds and conditions permit.

When such facilities are not available in a given school, the affected employee shall discuss the problem with the principal and thereafter, if necessary, with his/her supervisor, who in turn will discuss the matter with the CEO or his/her designee. The principal who cannot provide such facilities should have the opportunity to provide an explanation to the CEO or his/her designee who thereafter will make a decision as to how the service is to be provided.
The principal, department head, health/physical education teachers and the Union representative will explore the possibility of designating one classroom to be used primarily for health classes in their school and implement same wherever possible.

Teachers will be expected to provide normal care of instructional school equipment. However, they shall not be required to do major repair or replacement work on equipment or property, b. Personal Property Loss
During the term of this Agreement a fund in the amount of $10,000 shall be established from which individual teachers may be reimbursed for approved claims in an amount not to exceed $100 for personal property loss due to theft, burning, or wilful or malicious damage.

recognize and agree that a teacher has a moral obligation to reimburse the fund if the teacher also actually collects for the same loss from an insurance carrier.
Claimants must provide the proper District office with a copy of the Theft and Damage Report filed with the school and/or the report number filed with the Detroit Police Department. It shall also be the duty of the claimant to provide the District with purchase information which will verify the purchase of the article (s) involved.

Employees may select either Option five (5) or six (6) but not both in the same year.
D.	Statement of Policy for Maternity
The intent of this District Statement of Policy is to establish personnel practices and conditions concerning maternity. Absences from work which are associated with pregnancy, childbirth, and child care shall be subject to the respective regular District provisions as applicable for approved illness absence, Leave of Absence for illness (without pay because sick bank is exhausted), approved absence without pay, or Leave of Absence for Personal Business (except as specifically otherwise provided in this Statement of Policy).
A teacher who takes a one-year leave of absence for personal business for the care of a newborn or newly adopted child who so requests shall return to his/her position at the expiration of the leave. This written request must be made by the end of the fourth week after delivery of the newborn or in the case of an adopted child, before the teacher's leave begins. Since continuing to work, disability absence, and return to work are predicated on medical conditions, the failure of a pregnant employee to give required notice and submit the required medical evaluations and/or certifications from her physician shall be cause, at the discretion of the District, after 10 days notice, to place the employee on Leave of Absence for Personal Business.

b.	In order to provide for maximum continuity of instruction, the employee is expected to inform her administrator in writing of the tentative dates of leaving and returning as soon as possible after her condition is confirmed. Notification of tentative days shall be given in writing no later than the end of the fourth month of pregnancy. Tentative dates may be revised.
c.	An employee may continue work in her current assignment provided that
the employee shall submit Form 4043, Medical Office Physician Certificate — Maternity (Only) from her personal physician which shall certify the anticipated date of delivery; and that she is able to work in her current assignment; and further, provided that she is able to, and continues to fulfill all conditions and requirements of employment in her current assignment and demonstrates ability to conduct her regular duties and activities on the job.
2.	Requirements for Approved Illness Absence for Disability (with pay), or Leave of Absence for Illness (without pay because sick bank is exhausted):
96 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 96 a. The date of leaving work because of disability shall be determined by the employee and her physician provided that it is certified by the employee's personal physician and confirmed by the District Medical Examiner that the employee is unable to work.
b.	During the period of absence because of disability associated with pregnancy and/or childbirth, the employee is entitled to approved illness absence with pay to the extent of her sick leave bank subject to all provisions for illness absence, provided that disability to work is certified by her personal physician and confirmed by the District Medical Examiner.
c.	An employee shall not move from any unpaid Leave of Absence status to paid disability absence status.
d.	An employee shall not move from a disability absence to an approved absence without pay except that the employee may request an approved absence without pay within the last four (4) weeks preceding the end of a semester.
3.	Requirements for Leave of Absence for Personal Business Without Pay: An employee shall upon request be granted Leave of Absence for Personal Business for absences which are not disability absences but are related to the preparation for childbirth and/or the care of a newborn or newly adopted child. Such Leave of Absence is subject to the regular provisions for Leave of Absence for Personal Business except that the instructional employee shall specify a Leave of more than four (4) weeks to end at the change of a semester which falls within twenty-four (24) months of the date of the beginning of the Leave.

b.	The decision of the District Medical Examiner is binding except that if an employee is not satisfied with the decision of the District Medical Examiner, as to his/her ability or disability for work, the employee may appeal the decision under the following conditions: DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 97 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 97

1.	Empowerment/School-based Management (a-i)
The School District of the City of Detroit and the Detroit Federation of Teachers agree to work toward restructuring our school district so that local schools have greater autonomy in the educational decision-making process. The District and DFT agree to work together toward the goal of empowerment of 45 schools during the 1992-93 school year. To achieve that goal, the District and the Union will jointly establish guidelines for the development of school-based management programs in schools where administrators and teachers agree to participate. School-based planning teams at each location will have Union representation including the Union representative.
a.	Schools desiring to participate in the empowerment projects must obtain a secret ballot vote of approval from at least 75% of the instructional staff.
b.	Empowered schools may seek waivers of District policy, contractual language, and state or federal guidelines in order to implement programs that meet school level needs. A joint District/ Union committee, with equal representation will be established to receive and come to consensus on waiver requests of District policy, contractual language and state or federal guidelines. The joint committee will make recommendations regarding policy changes to the District and requests for waivers of contractual language to the DFT. Waivers granted by the DFT Executive Board will be for one year at a time.
c.	During the pilot phase of the empowered school projects, transfer requests of instructional staff who do not wish to participate will be expedited. These staff persons will be given top priority for transfers. Staff persons who request transfers from empowered schools will participate in the projects until such transfers are granted. This language does not replace Article XII — Personal Assignments in the Agreement between the District and the DFT but is operative during the pilot phase of empowered schools.
d.	Procedures for ongoing evaluation and improvement will be developed j ointly.
e.	An empowered school may agree to modify only the following provisions of the 1992-94 DFT/SDCD Collective Bargaining Agreement of District policies pertaining to the educational process in their own school: 1.

This notification (in 2 or 3) will be made no less than three (3) weeks before a vote is taken. The proposal shall detail the precise deviation from the Contract requested, the relation of the proposal to the educational plan of the empowered school, and why the deviation is necessary. To be approved, at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the regular full-time DFT members assigned to the school must vote in the affirmative. Voting shall be conducted by the DFT Building Representative and the Union Committee in the empowered school, using procedures consistent with DFT policy.
Voting shall be by secret ballot.
A representative of the DFT office shall be available to observe the voting if requested by the DFT Building Representative.
A representative of the LSEC may also be present g. A vote to waive a specific section of the Contract as listed in Section I may only be held once a semester, h. There shall be no threats, acts of intimidation or retaliation against bargaining unit members in connection with their position on empowerment issues. Any violation of this provision shall be subject to the contractual grievance procedure, initiated at Step 2. If no resolution is reached within 10 days, the grievance shall be submitted by the Union to expedited arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association, i. Waivers will be in effect for one (1) calendar year. 2. Career Opportunity The District and the Union agree to identify and structure levels of added responsibility to provide career opportunities for teachers within an overall framework that emphasize and assure continued classroom teaching responsibilities. A joint union/management committee will be identified not later than September 30, 1989 to develop the program. The com-100 DFT/SDCD Agreement (7/1/02-6/30/05) 2003-02349 8/6/04 12:12 PM Page 100 mittee shall provide recommendations not later than March, 1990. Such additional opportunities shall be implemented not later than the 1990-91 school year.
3.	Teacher Mentor Program
The union/management jointly developed mentor program (resultant from 1985-86 negotiations) will be piloted in at least three schools per area during the 1989-90 school year. Based on evaluation data, revisions and modifications will be made at the end of 1989-90 school year for full
implementation during the 1990-91 school year.
4.	Peer Review and Support
During the 1989-90 school year, the District and the DFT agree to develop a process of Peer Review and Support. The process must involve teachers in improving the performance of marginal or potential unsatisfactory teachers. A Peer Review and Support process will be developed and presented for implementation no later than June, 1990.
5.	In-service/Orientation for First-Year Teachers
During the first year of employment, newly-hired teachers will receive forty (40) hours of training (in-service/orientation). These staff development activities will be planned by a Union/District committee, with the Union naming its own representatives.
Compensation to Union representatives on the In-service/Orientation Planning Committee will be at the teachers workshop rate if planning is done outside of regular work hours.
These staff development activities will be provided outside of the regular school days. Compensation to teacher participants will be at the prevailing workshop rate.

between
The School District of the City of Detroit and The Detroit Federation of Teachers
It is the goal of the District to reduce K-3 class size to seventeen (17) .
To accomplish this, a comprehensive implementation study will be commissioned and a report thereon issued no later than March 1, 2000. The objective of the study will be to identify strategies to reduce class
size in grades K-3. The study will include a cost and facility analysis. The Detroit Federation of Teachers will be asked to participate in this implementation study.
Due to current facility and resource limitations, all K-3 classes can not be reduced to seventeen (17) immediately. Based on a preliminary study, forty-four (44) elementary schools were identified as having a sufficient number of available classrooms to accommodate a reduction in class size ranging from twenty-five (25) to seventeen (17) students. The District will implement class size reduction in a minimum of twenty-two (50%) of these elementary schools during the 2000-2001 school year. The District shall implement class size reductions in the remaining twenty-two (22) schools during the 2001-2002 school year.
In the interim, assistance inclusive of but not limited to the following shall be provided to address K-3 class size contingent upon available personnel and allocation of funds.
•	Teacher service shall be allocated to schools who can accommodate K-3 class size below thirty (30) with initial emphasis on grade 1.
•	Teachers of K-3 classes with class size of thirty (30) to thirty-four (34) students shall be assigned either a full time aide, or ed tech.
•	Teachers of K-3 classes with class size in excess of thirty-four students shall be assigned a full time aide, educational technician, or substitute teacher.
