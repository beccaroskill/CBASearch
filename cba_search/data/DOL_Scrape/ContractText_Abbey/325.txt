THE BOEING COMPANY and the
INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE & AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS OF AMERICA (UAW)
Effective June 22, 1999
Expiration Dale: May 14, 2003

FOREWORD
During the 1999 negotiations, the United Aerospace Workers' and The Boeing Company discussed the ever increasing challenges in the Aerospace and Defense marketplace and evaluated the experience with employee involvement team efforts during the previous agreement. There is mutual recognition by both parties that the challenges in the marketplace will continue requiring fundamental changes in the workplace. As a result, the parties agreed to take steps jointly which will significantly increase and expand implementation of employee involvement programs focused on enhancing employee productivity, resulting in improved job security prospects for all employees.
The parties recognize that the success of any business is dependent on the full commitment and involvement of its employees, and that successful organizations understand that people want to be involved in decisions that affect them, care about their jobs, are concerned about what customers expect, care about each other, take pride in themselves and in their contributions, want to fully utilize their skills and abilities, and share in the success of their efforts.

In the event there are not sufficient eamings remaining, deductions shall be made from the employee's paycheck in the first pay period in which sufficient eamings remain; however, in the event there are insufficient eamings in each pay period up to the next regular pay period for dues deductions, the pending deduction efforts will cease.

(i) Proprietary Work—The term “Proprietary Work” means that work which, by its unique nature and strict “need-to-know” criteria, requires, for exposure to and/or participation in, an access, that is in addition to or in lieu of a security clearance.
2. MEASUREMENT OF SENIORITY

The seniority of employees with the same seniority date will be determined by the alphabetical order of their names (surname first, then given name, then middle initial) with tile employee whose name appears nearer the beginning of the alphabet having greater seniority. Employee's names for this purpose will be established as their name on the Company's records as of the effective date of the Agreement. New employees will have their names established as their name on the Company's records as of their hire date.

(b)	Probationary Period
(1)	All employees are on probation for a period of eighty-four (84) days from their most recent date of hire (first date worked). They shall not have seniority status during this period. At the end of the eighty-four (84) day probationary period, an employee's seniority shall be retroactive to his most recent date of hire or entry (reentry for employees who transferred out of the area unit before the end of the probationary period) into the area unit, whichever occurs later. All probationary employees shall be considered as temporary employees.
(2)	If a probationary employee is Laid off and is subsequently rehired by the Company within six (6) months of his original date of hire into the same classification from which he was laid off or into a classification in the divisional pool, he will complete his probationary period when he has been on the pay-

date of hire or entry into the area unit prior to the layoff which	6
interrupted his probationary period.	7
(3)	If a probationary employee is laid off and is subse- 8 quently rehired by the Company within six (6) months of his 9 original date of hire into a different classification than that from	10
which he was laid off, the employee will be on probation for a 11 period of eighty-four (84) days from his date of rehire. However, 12 upon completion of such eighty-four (84) day probationary 13 period, the employee's seniority shall be retroactive to his date of	14
hire or entry into the area unit prior to the layoff which inter-	15
rupted his probationary period.	16

of this Section 5(c) into the same classification in the same department for successive periods between seniority movement nor will the same employees be loaned from the same classification in the same department on two (2) successive periods unless the Company can demonstrate that there was a compelling reason for such loans. It is not the intent of the Company to use the loan-out provision of this Section 5(c) to limit the recall, upgrade or promotion rights of employees by loaning employees into the same classification for successive periods. It is also not the intent of the Company to avoid the transfer, downgrade or layoff of individual employees by loaning such employees in successive periods. It is also not the intent of the Company to loan employees and by such loans cause other employees to become excess.
(d)	Both the Company and the Union at McAlester recognize that situations may develop where there are no work assignments available to keep employees at work between seniority movement dates. When such situations develop, the following provisions, will apply:
(1)	If the employee is excess on his current assignment but obviously has sufficient seniority to remain at work in his classification, he will be loaned to another assignment and a less senior employee placed on temporary layoff in accordance with the procedures of Section 3 of this Article or if possible handled in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(d)(2) or (3) below.
(2)	If the employee is excess on his current assignment and obviously does not have enough seniority to remain at work and would be placed on regular layoff without option at the time of the next seniority movement, he will be placed on regular layoff immediately.
(3)	If the employee is excess on his current assignment and obviously does not have enough seniority to remain in his current classification and it is possible to determine what the employee's options will be as of the next seniority movement, he will be provided those options at once. If he elects layoff he will be immediately placed on regular layoff as indicated in Section 5(d)(2) above. If he elects to remain at work and there is no assignment to which he can be loaned, he will be placed on temporary layoff in accordance with the procedures of Section 3 of this article with instructions to report to work on the Monday following the next seniority movement.
(4)	If the employee is excess on his current assignment and it is impossible to apply Section 5(d)(1), (2) or (3) above,

and there is no assignment to which he can be loaned, the em- 3 ployee will be placed on temporary layoff. Such employees will 4 be contacted and processed in accordance with Section 5(d)(1),	5
(2)	or (3) above, as soon as it is possible to determine his rights 6 at the time of the next seniority movement.	7
(e)	Employees will not be laid off between regular senior- 8 ity movements, except that employees who	9
(1)	Return from formal leave of absence; or	10
(2)	Return from off-site assignments; or	11
(3)	Lose the seniority status provided by Section 15 or 12 16 hereof and would be laid off without option at the time of the 13 next seniority movement may be laid off without option at the 14 time of such occurrence.	15
(f)	It is the intent of the Company to apply the loan-out >6 provisions of Section 5(c) hereof to employees who, unless there 12 is a subsequent change in the work requirements of their de- 18 partment, will be excess in their classification in their depart- >9 meat at the time of the next seniority movement. In instances 20 where employees who will clearly not be excess in their classifi- 21 cation in their department at the time of the next seniority 22 movement are loaned out, such actions must be in accordance 23 with the provisions of Section 12 hereof and the Company will 24 be liable for violations of such provisions.	25
(g)	When work operations are being reduced in volume or	26
phased out, the Company shall not be obligated to displace an	27
employee at the time of a seniority movement if such employee's	28
current assignment will be completed before the next scheduled	29
seniority movement. (Similarly, the Company may retain an	30
employee on his assignment in order to familiarize his replace-	31
ment if there is no lead in the group who is qualified and avail-	32
able to provide such familiarization. When such familiarization	33
period is completed, he will be laid off in accordance with Sec-	34
tion 5(e) above or downgraded in accordance with Section 4.	35
The Company representative assigned to seniority problems will	36
notify the Wage/Seniority Coordinator when an employee is	37
retained in accordance with the provisions of this Section	38
5(g).) The parenthetical phrase does not apply to McAlester. 39
(h)	If the Company faces an immediate reduction in the	40
work force at any division as a result of an occurrence such as a	41
contract cancellation, a stop-work decision or a change in sched-	42
ule which occurs between scheduled seniority movements, the	43

The Supervisor or Transfer Section, as applicable, will sign and date the bid and return a copy to the employee. The original will be forwarded to Personnel for processing. During the succeeding ten (10) working days the Company will determine the most senior employee who bid and is qualified to fill the vacancy in accordance with the following priorities:

(ii)	Other jobs will be filled in the following order: First Priority—Employees in lower classifications in normal line of progression to the classification in which the vacancy arises.
Second Priority—Other employees.
Note: Normal lines of progression are set forth in Exhibit L.
(d)	An employee must accept the first vacancy for a job for which he has bid and which meets his specifications as to shift, department and location. If more than one classification for which the employee has bid becomes available to him at the same time, he will select the classification he will accept. When an employee is placed in a classification as a result of a bid, all of his remaining active bids will immediately become void and he will be ineligible to bid during the next bidding period unless he is downgraded or laid off, in which case he will immediately become eligible to bid. If an employee, after he has bid, receives a job with the same or a higher maximum rate than that of a job for which he bid, his bid will be canceled. If an employee who has bid is placed on layoff, his bids will remain active until the end of the quarter. When an employee is reinstated from layoff at a division other than his home division or suspends his recall rights, all of his currently active bids become void. If an employee who has bid goes on formal leave of absence, his bids will be suspended while he is on leave, but will be reactivated for future openings if he returns to work before the end of the quarter. An employee may not bid until he has one (l)year seniority except in his family group (McAlester uses an alpha code group) in which case the provisions of this Section 8(d) apply.

(h)	Voluntary Removals
(1)	An employee may voluntarily remove himself from his classification and exercise his seniority to remain at work as if he were excess in his classification. However, such employee must have enough seniority to remain at work in a classification to which he has a seniority right and such employee cannot voluntarily place himself on layoff (at McAlester only it may not result in the layoff of any employee).
(2)	When an employee exercises his right to voluntarily remove himself, he loses all seniority rights to the classification from which he is voluntarily removing himself. If he is at work on downgrade in such classification, he will retain upgrade rights to higher classifications but will no longer have a right to the classification from which he removed himself unless he is subsequently reinstated in his higher classification and again becomes excess.
(3)	Initiation of voluntary removal by an employee will preclude him from bidding for the job from which he voluntarily removed himself for the duration of the quarterly bid period in which the removal occurs plus the next full quarterly bid period, except at Local 1519 and the MP&TD unit wherein the employee must wait four (4) months.
(4)	Before action is taken on a request for voluntary removal, the Wage/Seniority Coordinator will be notified of the impending action.
(i)	Shift Transfers
(1)	Requests for shift transfer shall be filed in writing on forms supplied by the Company. Employees with an active request for shift transfer will be transferred in order of their seniority to the shift of their choice to fill vacancies within their classifications within their departments (except that where such vacancies are to be filled by promotion or hire, they will be filled on the shift designated by the Company, and the employees filling the vacancies will not be subject to displacement under Section 10(i)(3) hereof for three (3) months.) The parenthetical phrase does not apply to Local 1519 or McAlester.
(2)	If an employee has an active request for shift transfer on file with the Company and an employee with less seniority exercises his seniority in accordance with Section 4 hereof to displace an employee in his classification and department on the shift of his choice, such employee will be transferred and the less senior employee will replace him.

The transfer shall take place on the next seniority	3

such as those in which the employee to be displaced is proba-	6
tionary, new on the job, or performing critical work. Disputes	7
regarding the critical nature of the work will be referred to the	8
Labor Relations Manager and the Chairperson of the Bargaining	9
Committee, In no event shall the transfer be delayed more than	10
90 days without agreement by the parties.	11
(3)	When an employee has had a request for shift	12
transfer on file with the Company for no longer than three	13
(3) months without being transferred to the shift of his choice, he	14
will be transferred to displace the least senior employee in his	15
classification in his department on the shift of his choice pro*	16
vided he has more seniority than such least senior employee. If	17
at the time of an employee's eligibility for transfer under this	18
Section 10(i)(3) there is no less senior employee in his classifi-	19
cation in his department on the shift of his choice, the em-	20

where there is a less senior employee who filled a vacancy by	22
promotion or hire in accordance with Section 10(i)( 1) hereof, the	23
employee's request for shift transfer will remain valid until such	24
less senior employee is subject to displacement.) The parentheti-	25

EXCLUDING MP&TD AND McALESTER	20
(a)	A lead's classification will be based on the highest level 21 of the highest occupation (as identified by job code series), that 22 is indicative of the primary function of the group he is leading. 23 Where there are two (2) or more such occupations in the same 24 lead group, the lead’s classification will be based on the occupa- 25 tion within the group in which there are the largest number of 26 employees. However, the classification of current leads will not 27 be changed as a result of the application in this Section 20(a). If, 28 in filling a lead-vacancy in accordance with Section 20(f) or 29 (g) below, it is determined that two (2) or more lead classifica-	30
tions would be equally appropriate for the group, all appropriate	31
lead classifications will be .given equal consideration in filling 32 the vacancy.	33
(b)	Once a lead's classification has been established in ac- 34 cordance with Section 20(a) above, he will not be considered 35 misclassified as long as there are any employees in his group in 36 the occupation on which his lead classification is based.	37
(c)	When two (2) or more lead groups within a department 38 are combined, the lead with the greatest seniority will normally 39 be retained to lead the remaining group provided he has the 40 ability to perform the work.	.	41
(d)	When an excess of leads exists in a classification in a 42 department or agreed group of departments, the Company will 43 excess the least senior lead in the classification in the department 44 or mutually agreed group of departments unless such lead has 45 been classified as a stabilizing employee in accordance with the 46

(l)To the classification on which his lead classification is based, or
(2)	To the classification which is the basis for his lead rate if he has previously held such classification or by mutual agreement between the parties. (At the Tulsa division an excess lead will be offered return to a lead classification in the department or mutually agreed group of departments which he has previously held for at least sixty (60) days since November 17, 1974, if this will result in a lesser reduction in pay than provided in Section 20(d)(1) and (2) above.)
(e)	An employee downgraded or laid off from a lead classification since November 17, 1974, will retain recall or upgrade rights to such classification at the division where he was downgraded or laid off, with the limitation provided in Section 17(g) hereof if he is on layoff.
(f)	If a vacancy occurs in a lead classification from which employees are on downgrade or layoff, such vacancy will be filled in accordance with the following:
First Priority—Employees who were downgraded or laid off from the classification in the department or mutually agreed group of departments where the opening occurs will be recalled or upgraded in order of seniority.
Second Priority—Employees who were downgraded or laid off from the classification in the division where the opening occurs will be recalled or upgraded in order of seniority.
(g)	If a vacancy occurs in a lead classification from which no employees are on downgrade or layoff at the division involved, the Company will post such vacancy for three (3) days at the regular posting locations throughout the division. The Company will select the successful bidder from among the five (5) most senior qualified bidders based on the following priorities:
(1)	First Priority will be among employees of the department or mutually agreed group of departments in which the vacancy exists and in the occupation on which the lead classification is based.
(2)	Second Priority will be from among other employees at work at the division classified in the occupation on which the lead classification is based.
(3)	Third Priority will be other employees at work at

If the list of qualified bidders is exhausted before the 5 end of the three (3) month period, the Company will re-post the 6 classification if additional vacancies occur.	7
(h)	The Company may temporarily classify an employee as	8
"acting” lead. This provision will apply only in those instances	9
where there is no vacancy but a lead is needed on a short-term 10 basis (not to exceed ninety (90) days), such as filling, in for a	U
lead who is on vacation, on leave of absence or temporarily	12
assigned outside of the area unit. At the completion of the as- 13 signment, the employee temporarily classified as lead will return 14 to his former classification. The parties agree that an employee’s 15 performance while classified as an "acting” lead will not be M referenced in written grievances or dispositions nor will it be 12 used by either party in the arbitration procedure.	1 $
(1)	If no one is at work in the department or mutually 19 agreed group of departments on downgrade from the lead classi- 20 fication which will be filled on an "acting” basis, the “acting” 21 lead will normally be selected from the more senior employees 22 in the lead group which will be led. The selection may be made 23 from the department or mutually agreed group of departments if 24 the Company and Union have agreed to this broader basis for 25 selection at the division involved.	26
(2)	If the “acting” lead will be moving from group to 27 group to cover a series of lead vacation periods, the “acting” 28 lead will be selected from within the department or mutually 29 agreed group of departments containing the lead groups.	30
(3)	If employees are at work in the department or mu-	31
tually agreed group of departments on downgrade from the lead	32
classification to be filled on an “acting” basis, “acting” leads will	33
be selected in accordance with Section 20(h)(1) or (2) above	34
unless the parties reach mutual agreement that the most senior	35
employee in the department or mutually agreed group of de- 36 partments on downgrade from the lead classification will be 37 temporarily classified as an “acting” lead.	38
(i)	LOCAL 1519	39
(1)	A lead's classification will be based on the highest 40 occupation that is indicative of the primary function of the group 41 he is leading. Where there are two (2) or more such occupations 42 in the same lead group, the lead's classification will be based on 43 the occupation within the group in which there are the largest 44 number of employees. However, the classification of current 45 leads will not be changed as a result of the application of this 46

(e)	The authority of the Arbitrator shall be limited to a de- 2 termination of into which of the existing labor grades or family 8 groups the new or revised classification shall be placed. The 9 matter shall be submitted to the Arbitrator by the Union in ac-cordance with the procedures of Article VI, Section 3, within	H

designated by the Company, such change shall be consistent	16
with existing wage schedules and may be retroactive to the date of installation by the Company.	18
(g)	In the event the Union contends the Company has vio- 19 lated the Agreement (1) on the ground that a new or revised job, 20 established by the Company pursuant to Section 2(a) above, is 21 not necessary because the job requirements are adequately or 22 specifically described in an existing job description or (2) on the 23 ground that new or substantially changed requirements are not 24 adequately or specifically described in an existing job descrip- 25 tion and the Company has failed to prepare a new or revised job 26 description, the Wage/Seniority Coordinator (Bargaining Chair- 27 person at McAlester) within thirty (30) days of receipt of notifi- 28 cation of the establishment of the new job classification, in the 29 case of subsection 2(g)(1) above, or within thirty (30) days after 30 requesting the Company in writing to establish a new or revised 31 job classification, in the case of this subsection 2(g)(2) may raise 32 the problem in accordance with the provisions of Article V, 33 Section 10.

3,	(a) Where work assignments involving new operations are
not adequately or specifically described in an existing job description and until the Company has established a new job description in accordance with Section 2(a) hereof, such work assignments shall be appraised and accordingly classified as belonging to the most appropriate existing job description, or in the event there is no appropriate existing job description, the Company may install a new job title and rate range, by giving due consideration to the nature of the work as well as the level of difficulty. The Company shall establish a new job description for such new work operations within four (4) months unless such period is extended by mutual agreement of the parties.
(b)	The Company shall notify the Chairperson of the Bargaining Committee of the originating division, the Local Union and the National Aerospace Department of the departments in which the new operations, referred to in Section 3(a) above, are being performed and the names and the classifications of the personnel assigned. The four- (4) month period in Section 3(a) above shall commence as of the date of such notification.
(c)	In the event additional employees are assigned to the work operations referred to in Section 3(a) above, subsequent to the original staffing by the Company, such openings will be filled in accordance with the provisions of Article XI, Section 8.
4.	(a) The Company and the Union agree that all employees shall be properly classified in accordance with the work they are actually performing and the job descriptions. Upon his request, the employee may review the job description for his classification.
All reasonable and practical steps will be taken to provide supervision with job descriptions, to the extent necessary to fulfill this provision, so that such employee requests will not be unnecessarily delayed.
(b) Any change in an employee's classification will be effective not later than the first day of the second pay period following the date the employee signs the change of status notice when such signature is required.

5.	Job descriptions are used for the purpose of distinguishing 3 one job classification from another, as clearly and definitively as 4 possible, in order that employees may be properly classified in	5
accordance with the provisions of Sections 4 and 8 hereof.	6
Therefore, to give effect to this, job descriptions will be applied 2 in accordance with the following:	8
(a)	Inasmuch as job descriptions can only be definitive and 9 illustrative of the job requirements as established, the job de-scription shall be interpreted and applied in its entirety as a	11
composite picture of the job requirements. An employee shall	12
not be required to perform all of the work operations described 13 in a job description in order to be eligible for classification there 14 under. An employee shall not be eligible for classification under 13 a job description by reason of performing isolated or singular 16 duties that are incidental to his job but which are described in 1? another job description.	18
(b)	An employee must regularly and consistently perform 19 work operations which are an integral part of and representative 20 of his normal assignments and the requirements of the classifi- 21 cation as the latter are determined in accordance with Section 2	22
and other subsections herein.	23
(c)	An employee normally performs some of the work of 24 higher rated jobs and some of the work of lower rated jobs when 25 required. The normal duties of an employee may include some 26 of the work of related jobs in the same labor grade when re- 27 quired. The normal duties of an employee may include assis- 28 tance to others.	29
(d)	An employee is required to perform the work opera- 30 tions and duties described in or appraised as being covered by a 31 job description under that degree or amount of guidance or in- 32 struction which is considered usual and normal in order to qual- 33 ify for classification thereunder.	34
(e)	When a work operation or function is described in the 35 same manner in more than one grade of an occupation or in 36 different occupations, such work operation or function shall be 37 considered and classified after a manner defined in paragraphs 38 (a) and (f) and supplemented by other paragraphs of this Section 39 5. Such work operations and functions, when described in the 40 same manner in more than one grade of an occupation or more 41 than one occupation, are not distinguishing elements or determi- 42 nants of level of difficulty as between those grades of the occu- 43 pation or those different occupations but are only stated for 44 descriptive purposes or because they are such an integral and 45 necessary part of the job that their omission would be undesir- 46

able from the standpoint of completeness.
(f)	Job classification titles are assigned for identification purposes only. Occupational summaries in a job description are included solely for the purpose of distinguishing one occupation from another, and neither the job title nor occupational summary shall be considered a basis for classification or application of the job description.
(g)	A job description shall not be construed so as to restrict in any manner the rights of the Company to assign work to employees or to grant or concede an employee or group of employees any right to refuse to perform assigned work for the reason that such work is not described specifically in the job description of his job classification or is described in another job description. Further, whenever a job description defines the operation to be performed or the machine to be operated in the singular number, the use of the singular number shall not be interpreted as limiting or restricting the description to call for the performance of a single operation or the operation of a single machine, nor shall the use of the singular number be construed to affirm that the rates of pay are based upon the performance of a single operation or the operation of a single machine.
6.	(a) The parties, recognizing the desirability of clear, ex-
plicit and accurate job descriptions and their proper application, the necessity for and the mutual benefits resulting from proper classification of employees into new, revised or existing job classifications and the necessity for proper resolution of related disagreements, hereby agree to establish a committee of three (3) members representing each party who shall meet on a quarterly basis, unless extended by mutual agreement, and whose functions shall be:
(1)	To review the adequacy and applicability of job descriptions;
(2)	To resolve disputes arising under Article XVI, Section 7(b);
(3)	To review the parties application of the decision of the National Labor Relations Board Case No. 2I-UC-10 and resolve problems resulting therefrom; and

(1)	The Company recognizes the Union as the exclu-	14
sive bargaining representative of those production and mainte-	15
nance employees referred to in Article I hereof. The Company	16
further recognizes that one of the Union's legitimate functions is	17
to safeguard through the processes of collective bargaining and	18
by other legal means, maximum work opportunities for employ-	19
ees it represents,	20
(2)	The Company agrees that it will not be its policy to	21
assign production or maintenance work operations of a type or	22
scope heretofore normally performed by employees represented	23
by the Union to un-represented employees or to discontinue	24
assignment of such work operations to employees represented by	25
the Union solely because of improved technology or new meth-	26
ods of performing such work operations except	27
(i)	By mutual agreement; or	28
(ii)	Where the nature or type of such new work 29 operations is such that its performance by other employees is	30
directly related to their primary duties and only incidental or	31
collateral to such duties or is more characteristic of such primary 32 duties than it is of duties determinative of their classification 33 normally performed by employees represented by the Union. 34
(3)	The Union recognizes that, in the highly competi- 35 five industries in which the Company competes, it is necessary 36 for the Company to design, develop and improve products, pro- 37 spective products and production methods and processes as a 38 prerequisite to successfully acquiring contracts or orders which 39 provide work opportunities for production and maintenance 40 employees. The Union further recognizes the necessity for hav- 41 ing such work operations performed by professional or other 42 excluded employees with the maximum flexibility of operation 43 and freedom from limitations. The Union agrees that it will be 44 its policy to cooperate fully with the Company in the latter's 45 efforts in this respect and to explain this Statement of Intent to 46

(4)	Any questions or disputes concerning the substance, application or alleged departure from this Statement of Intent shall be handled by the normal grievance procedure through all the steps prior to arbitration.
(5)	If the dispute remains unresolved, it may be appealed to the Director of the National Aerospace Department for the Union and to the Vice President, Human Resources for the Company. Those individuals will meet as soon as schedules permit to attempt to resolve the issues. If they do not resolve the dispute, it may be appealed to mediation. At their meeting, the Union Director of the National Aerospace Department and the Company Vice President, Human Resources will define the question or questions to be mediated. If the issue is not resolved by mediation, the mediator will provide an advisory opinion. Unresolved disputes involving clerical employees only, may be appealed to Arbitration without objection on the part of the Company. Additionally, on or after June 1 1, 1978, disputes which arise that allege that during the thirty (30) days prior to the date of filing, the Company did in fact discontinue assignment of specific work operations of a type or scope regularly performed by production and maintenance employees represented by the Union and concurrently reassigned the work operations to un represented Company employees, may be appealed to Arbitration without objection on the part of the Company. The Arbitrator will be limited in his authority to fact-finding as to whether or not this aforementioned reassignment did occur and/or was in violation of the spirit and intent of Section 7(b)(2)(ii) of this Article. If the Arbitrator finds that violation did occur, the Vice President, Human Resources and the Director of the National Aerospace Department, shall agree on an appropriate remedy.
8.	The parties agree that incumbent employees in those classifications which are eliminated, revised or are no longer appropriate because of the establishment of a new or revised classification as a result of this Agreement or in accordance with Section 2, will be reclassified in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 and this section.
(a)	All such employees will be reclassified to such new or revised job classifications within fifteen (15) days of the date of establishment of such job classification.

provisions of Article XI, Section 8.	9
(c)	When a new job classification is established involving 10 new operations, employees who have been normally performing 11 the new operations during the thirty (30) day period, or a period I2 mutually agreed to by the parties, prior to the date of the estab- *3 lishment of the new job classification shall be reclassified to 14 such job classification.	,	15

classification at the same point in cents per hour from the maxi-	19
mum as they would have held in their former classification on 2$ the effective date of reclassification. Progress to the maximum 2 J of the rate range in these instances will be in accordance with the 22 provisions of Section 9(c) of this Article except that progression 22 schedules shall not be interrupted in such cases of reclassifica- 24 tion to job classifications within the same labor grade.	2$
(e)	No employee reclassified as a result of the provisions of 2$ this Section 8 shall thereby suffer a reduction in individual base 22 rate, and such employees whose individual base rate is above the 2$ maximum of the rate range for the new or revised job classifica- 2$ tion shall receive applicable cost-of-living allowances, annual 30 wage supplements and general wage increases.	31

9.	(a) An employee reclassified to a higher rated job classifi-
cation, other than in accordance with the provisions of Article XVI, Section 8, shall receive an increase in the amount necessary to attain the minimum of the new rate range or at least thirty cents (30<) per hour, whichever is greater. However, in no event shall any such increase result in an employee being placed at a rate in excess of the maximum of the rate range.
(b)	An employee who is on layoff or at work on downgrade and who is recalled or as a result of a job bid, receives a transfer to a classification in the same or lower labor grade as the highest classification to which he has recall rights, will be placed at the maximum of the rate range of such classification or at the rate established by the relative position he held in his highest classification, whichever is lower.
(c)	Employees shall be hired or transferred into a job classification at a rate within the rate range for the job classification. Every employee who is retained by the Company for a period of twenty-six (26) full weeks in a particular job classification at a rate under the maximum and who meets the knowledge and skill requirement mutually established by the Company and the Union shall have his wages increased in accordance with the following: Employees in Labor Grades 1 through 7 will have their wages increased at the rate of thirty cents ($0.30) per hour at the end of each successive twenty-six (26) full weeks of employment in that job classification until paid the maximum of the rate range. Employees in Labor Grades 8 through 11 will have their wages increased at the rate of forty cents ($0.40) per hour at the end of each successive twenty-six (26) full weeks in that job classification until reaching the maximum of the rate range. Employees in Labor Grades 12 and higher and grades 4 through 1 in the MP&TD unit will have their wages increased at the rate of fifty cents ($0.50) per hour at the end of each successive twenty-six (26) full weeks in that job classification until reaching the maximum of the rate range. However, in those cases where an employee is receiving fifty-five cents (55e5) an hour, or less than the maximum of the rate range for his job classification, his last twenty-six (26) week automatic progression increase will be to the maximum of the appropriate rate range.

The 26-week automatic progression cycle will not be interrupted when an employee is placed on open transfer and reclassified to an equal or lower labor grade as a result of a workforce reduction and the exercising of the employee's seniority to remain at work. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the Company from advancing employees within their rate ranges more rapidly on the basis of merit or improvement in workmanship.
When an employee, who is on open transfer as above, is being reclassified to a classification having a lower rate range maximum, and the employee's rate is below the maximum of the new lower classification, the employee will be reclassified with no reduction in rate and automatic progression will not be interrupted. However, if such across-the-board rate placement is within fifteen cents (15 cents) or less from the maximum, the employee will be given such fifteen cents (15 cents) or lesser amount to the maximum of the rate range upon reclassification to the new lower classification.
An employee who is placed on layoff or downgrade, due to being placed on open transfer associated with a reduction of workforce, will retain the number of weeks accumulated toward such employee's next automatic progression increase and, upon being recalled from that downgrade or layoff to the same classification held immediately prior to that downgrade or layoff, will be credited with such retained weeks toward the next twenty-six (26) week automatic progression,
(d)	Employees in newly combined classifications and who are at the maximum of their hourly base rate immediately prior to the effective date of this agreement will begin automatic progression effective July 31, 1999.
(e)	Employees in classifications which are subject to wage inequity adjustments and who are at the maximum of the hourly base rate immediately prior to the effective date of this agreement will begin automatic progression effective June 26, 1999,

2.	SPECIAL HOURS AND EXTRA WORK
(a)	Extra work in periods of overtime operations shall be equalized among the employees in the group engaged in similar work as far as practical. In accordance with the foregoing., supervision will establish and may reestablish overtime groups in the manner they deem appropriate to the work operation. When established or reestablished, the composition of the group will be reduced to writing; the employees involved and the appropriate Union representative will be notified. Supervision will, upon request, discuss the reason for the establishment of such overtime group with the appropriate Union representative.
(b)	Employees required to work special hours di special shifts shall, whenever possible, be given twenty-four (24) hours notice in advance of the special or overtime work. In the event an employee has a justifiable reason for refusing assignment of such special or overtime hours he shall make his refusal and the reason known to his Supervisor at the time the Supervisor schedules the work and, in such instances, will not be disciplined, If an employee is not given such twenty-four (24) hour notice, when it was possible for the Company to do so, the working of such overtime shall be voluntary.
(c)	The employee overtime record for each overtime group will be openly displayed in the department (in the area rather than in the department at Edwards and Santa Susana Field Laboratories) in such a manner that the employees involved may check their standing.
(d)	Overtime hours will be entered on the employee’s overtime record on the basis of paid hours; overtime hours charged, but not worked, will be entered on the same basis as if worked; an hour worked at time and one-half will be recorded as one and one-half (1-1/2) hours and an hour worked at double time will be recorded as two (2) hours. Instructions regarding the

maintenance and administration of the overtime record (Form 3 130-J-10) have been agreed to by the parties and is attached 4 hereto as Exhibit 0. The provisions of such instructions shall be 5 applicable to employees represented by the Union for the term of 6 this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions thereof. 7
(e)	Overtime averaging for groups and shifts will be ac- 8 complished in the following manner:	9
(I)	When there is more than one overtime group on the same shift and department and classification(s), the average 11 overtime hours of each such group shall be established and an 12 average of the averages of all such overtime groups will be 13 established. Such average wilt be used as the average written 14 overtime hours for each of the overtime groups involved in 15 establishing such an average.	16
(2)	Average overtime hours established for each com- 17 parable group (or groups) on each shift of a department will be 18 recorded for each employee on the appropriate Form 130-J-10.	19
(3)	When there is no comparable overtime group on a 20 shift in a department, the average hours established for that shift 21 will be the highest average of the other shifts on the effective 22 date of this procedure.	23
(f)	When it becomes necessary to augment an overtime 24 group with employees outside the group (except for McAlester), 25 the following procedure will govern the selection of such em- 26 ployees:	27
First—Employees from another overtime group in the 28 same department, classification and shift and who are among 29 those low on overtime within their own group, will be asked to 30 work.	31
Second—In the event there are no employees available 32 in the same classification and shift in the department in which 33 the need arises, the selection shall be from some other depart- 34 ment within the same classification and shift and shall be from 35 among employees who are low on overtime within the group 36 from which the employees are selected.	37
Third—In the event there are no employees available 38 as described above, the selection shall be made from other clas- 39 sifications within the originating department on the same shift 40 and shall be from among employees who are low on overtime 41 within the group from which the employees are selected.	42
Fourth—In the event the above outlined sources are 43 exhausted, the Company shall select from among other available 44 employees.	45

Groups moving bargaining unit departments may be supplemented by bargaining unit employees in the department or departments being moved and the selection shall be from among employees who are low on overtime. The movement of non-bargaining unit departments may be supplemented from other bargaining unit employees who are low on overtime.
(g)	In those instances when it becomes necessary for employees to be assigned overtime during any of the negotiated holidays or the weekends occurring in conjunction with such Monday or Friday holidays, supervision will solicit volunteers with the ability to perform the work from the overtime group, classification, and shift involved. Lacking a sufficient number of volunteers to meet the overtime requirements, supervision will assign overtime in accordance with the provisions of Article XVII, Section 2, drawing from the overtime group involved. Still lacking sufficient employees, additionally required overtime will be assigned under provisions of Section 2(f) of Article XVII.
(h)	It is understood by the parties that assigning overtime work as stated above does not constitute a violation regarding equalizing overtime as provided in Article XVII, 2(a).
(i)	The scheduling of overtime for holidays and connected weekends by the use of volunteers will not apply to seven (7) day operations and/or rotating shifts.

Second—In the event that the above source is exhausted, the Company shall select from among other available employees who are among those low in overtime in selected classifications.
In all cases, the selection will be predicated on the employee’s ability to perform the work.

SELECTED SKILLS PROGRAM
ARTICLE XXVI
SELECTED SKILLS PROGRAM (EXCLUDES LOCAL 1519, MP&TD AND McALESTER)
1.	A Selected Skills Program, together with a Selected Joint Apprentice Committee Agreement providing, as set forth herein, an apprenticeship training program and amendments to Article XVI, Wages and Article XVII, Hours and Special Pay Provisions in their application to such Program and Agreement may be implemented by mutual agreement of the parties.
2.	The following classifications are among those Selected Skills classifications being considered for apprenticeship. For purposes of Selected Skills treatment, only certain lower level classifications (if any) related to each of the Selected Skills classifications will be identified for the crediting of time toward becoming a journeyman as noted below:
3.	JOURNEYMAN STATUS
An employee will be ajoumeyman when he has worked a total of eight (8) years in one of the Selected Skills classifications. An employee will be given credit toward journeyman status for time worked in the appropriate identified related classification whenever he is properly classified in the Selected Skills classification.
4.	APPRENTICE PROGRAMS
(a)	When the Company and the Union mutually agree there is a need for apprentice-type shop training in identified Selected Skills classification(s), the Company will develop apprenticeship training programs to meet those needs. The total training period will be determined by the skills required and will be reviewed by the Joint Apprenticeship Committee.
(b)	The Company agrees to pay the full tuition-registration charges in connection with the related training of an apprentice that is on course.
5.	RATIO OF APPRENTICES TO JOURNEYMEN
(a) The number of new apprentices who may be placed on course shall be determined on the basis of the number of journeymen actively at work in the Selected Skills classification to which the apprentice will be assigned, except that the electronic classifications may be combined, where necessary, by action of
148
ARTICLE XXVI	SELECTED SKILLS PROGRAM 1
2 the Joint Apprentice Committee. The ratio of apprentices on 3 course to journeymen may be up to one apprentice to ten	4
(10) journeymen unless such ratio is changed by mutual agree-	5
ment.	6
(b) The Company may retain a maximum of one apprentice 2 in each classification in each division until all of the employees	8
not actively working in the Selected Skills classification are	9
recalled to the classification in the division. Once all such em-	10
ployees holding recall rights at the division have been recalled,	11
then the ratio of apprentices placed on course may be increased. *2 In the event of layoff of journeymen after this occurs, the ratio of 13 one apprentice to ten (10) journeymen in the division will apply. 14
6. APPRENTICESHIP ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS 16
In order to be eligible for consideration for apprenticeship, 1 7 all applicants must be seniority employees and must meet eligi-bility requirements. Eligibility requirements of applicants in- 1$ eluding experience, education, types of tests and qualifying 20 grades will be determined by the Joint Apprentice Committee. 21 An apprentice applicant point evaluation system will be devel- 22 oped and utilized by the Company for selection of applicants for 23 this program. Final approval of the applicant will be the respon- 24 sibility of the Joint Apprentice Committee. Applicants from 25 outside the Company may be considered for apprenticeship if 26 there is a lack of eligible seniority employees.	27

EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT	31
32
During the negotiations, the United Aerospace Workers' 33 and The Boeing Company discussed the ever-increasing chai- 34 lenges in the global marketplace and examined prior experience 35 with employee involvement efforts. There is mutual recognition 36 by both parties that the challenges in the marketplace will con- 37 tinue requiring fundamental changes in the workplace and that 38 we need to jointly take steps to significantly increase and expand 39 implementation of effective employee involvement efforts. 40
This is firmly based on the belief that the success of Boe- 42 ing businesses in the challenging global marketplace is fully 43 dependent on its employees. Also, that all employees want to be 44 involved in decisions that affect them, care about their jobs, 45 what customers expect, care about each other, take pride in 46

the continuous training, education, development and learning of 28 its employees. This was recognized in the 1990 UAW-Rockwell 29 (now Boeing) Aerospace Workers’ Contract Agreement which 30 created a joint UAW-Rockwell (now Boeing) Employee In- 31 volvement Training Organization. It was established to provide 32 employees a diverse range of opportunities for technical and 33 high performance union/management, team-based training 34
The parties pledge to provide the resources necessary to 36 assure that employees receive training and development oppor- 37 trinities in order to produce a highly motivated, capable 38 workforce that continuously improves its own and Boeing's 39 ability to succeed in an increasing competitive global market- 40 place.	41

•	Provide individual and group training, retraining and developmental opportunities to upgrade/sharpen present job skills and abilities of employees which can lead to greater job security, personal development, improved performance and effective employee involvement efforts.
•	See ways for arranging, and in some cases providing, for training, retraining and development assistance for employees displaced by new technologies, new production techniques and shifts in customer product preference.
■	Provide local business training support for implementing employee involvement efforts.
•	Provide opportunities for the training and the exchange of ideas and innovations with respect to employee development and training needs within the framework of job requirements and union/management relations.
•	Support local business initiatives dedicated to the expansion of developmental activities for employees which would include continuous improvement in quality, training, high performance union/management team-based training and basic literacy training.
SUMMARY
While change is difficult, we jointly understand that in the current, highly competitive, constantly changing global marketplace in which we are engaged, we must continue to change to create a workplace so that our customers are continuously delivered the highest quality and best value product and services while serving the interest of employees by protecting job security and employee wages. We cannot afford to let obstacles stand in our way of successfully implementing employee involvement efforts which assist us in this endeavor.
Employee involvement is our jointly designed effort to transform our respective roles, satisfy our customers better than any competitor, and ensure our mutual success. The parties recognize that this continuing historic endeavor depends upon the ability of employees and the Company to grow and prosper.
The provisions of this article apply only to those teams mutually agreed to by the union and management.

ARTICLE XXVIII
PROPRIETARY WORK
During the course of the 1990 and subsequent labor negotiations, the parties discussed, in great detail, the many issues and opportunities associated with jointly addressing work which requires unique security clearance and/or special access herein referred to as “proprietary.” The agreements and understandings reached reflect the mutual efforts and commitment of the parties to develop methods of staffing and operating proprietary programs responsive to customer and employee needs, and to enhance the Company's competitive position at locations covered by the Master Agreement. The agreements set forth herein are based on the open exchange of ideas and information available for discussion, and a spirit of joint issue resolution during the negotiation meetings.
1.	DEFINITIONS
(a)	Proprietary Work—That work which, by its unique nature and strict “need-to-know” criteria, requires, for exposure to and/or participation in, an access, that is addition to or in lieu of a security clearance,
(b)Area Unit—As defined in Article I of the Master Agreement.
(c)	Billets—A fixed number of openings, mandated by customers, that limit the number of individuals who will be permitted access to:
(1)	Any particular proprietary activity, and/or
(2)	Limit the number of individuals that can have access to a proprietary activity at any given time.
Access to some proprietary activities is further restricted by customers who mandate that once an individual has filled a billet and has been accessed to an activity, such billet may not be later used in the event such individual is deaccessed from that activity. Thus, there may be a specific number of billets for any given activity identified to a specific individual, which remains with that individual, and cannot be transferred to another individual regardless of any attrition which may occur throughout the duration of that activity.
(d)	Qualifying Requirements for Proprietary Work—Employment eligibility for Proprietary Work requires that an employee must have the ability to perform the work and hold the

appropriate security clearance and/or special access to the proprietary work.
(e)	Candidate Pool—A group of employees who have agreed to participate in proprietary work.
(f)	Immediate Vacancy—Job openings which were unanticipated and must be filled prior to the time required to clear employees for the Candidate Pool.
(g)	Anticipated Vacancy—Job openings which, based on known schedules and funding, can reasonably be forecast by classification far enough in advance for interested employees to obtain a security clearance and be placed in a Candidate Pool.
2,	CANDIDATE POOL
(a)	In order that employees have the choice of participating or not participating in proprietary work, the Company will offer employees, in seniority order, who are properly classified to perform the work, or should the work be of a nature that there are no employees that are properly classified, the Company and the Union will mutually agree upon the classification(s), first in the Division where the vacancies exist and then in that Division's area unit, the opportunity to fill anticipated vacancies for proprietary work. Subsequently, by mutual agreement, employees in the proper classification(s), or agreed upon classification(s), in other area units will be offered the same opportunity. Barring mutual agreement, on the area unit, the offer will be made to employees in the proper classification(s), or agreed upon classi-fication(s), in all area units in the local Union in seniority order. Should a requirement still exist, employees in the proper classi-fication(s), or agreed upon classification(s), in seniority order from other Locals within the same geographical area, and subsequently from Locals outside the geographical area, will be afforded the same opportunity.
(b)	Employees who agree to participate in proprietary work may, at any time, change their choice and decline to participate. Employees who declined to participate may, at any time, change their choice and accept future opportunities when a staffing need exits. (Reference Proprietary Work Option Form).

presence of any individual who does not possess the appropriate security clearance, access authorization and need-to-know, a member of the Proprietary Security Staff will be present to counsel the employee, Union representative and/or any other participant who does not meet the above defined criteria and to protect all parties to the meeting from inadvertently committing a breach of security. The intent of requiring a representative from Security to be present is to protect all parties from and to make every effort to prevent an accidental unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information. The Security Representative shall maintain complete confidentiality and shall not disclose the information discussed during the meeting unless it involves a breach of security or a violation of the law.
5.	GENERAL PROVISIONS
(a)	Employees on proprietary work may retain regular bargaining unit classifications or, upon mutual agreement, may be reclassified in a unique proprietary job classification. In those instances where it is appropriate that an employee on proprietary work have his classification changed in order that an employee be properly classified or compensated, a change in classification will be processed. Should the reclassification result in a reduction in compensation, the employee will have the option to exercise his seniority in the last classification held in the area unit prior to the proprietary work. Such reclassification will not constitute a vacancy in the employee's home plant or facility for purposes of job posting and bidding or recall. Such classification will be applicable only for the duration of that proprietary work.
(b)	When an employee is downgraded without option to exercise his seniority within the proprietary work, is excessed or loses his access from the proprietary work, or returns from that proprietary work, he will exercise his seniority in the last classification he held in the area unit prior to the proprietary work as if he never left.
(c)	An employee may voluntarily remove himself from proprietary work and exercise his seniority in the area unit from which he transferred prior to the proprietary work, as if he never left, except that transfers between locals will be treated in accordance with the existing provisions in the Master Agreement.
(d)	Authorized entry into proprietary work is on a limited and strict security need-to-know basis; therefore, an employee without the appropriate security clearance and/or access cannot displace an employee on proprietary work.
(e)	Joint Briefing
162
ARTICLE XXVill	PROPRIETARY WORK 1
2
Proprietary work requires unique qualifying criteria, 3 working conditions and special security requirements necessary 4 to perform work in a proprietary area.or location. As a result, the 5 Union and Company will jointly present a comprehensive in- & formational briefing to employees considering an opportunity to	7
work in a proprietary area or location before the employee is	8
asked to accept a proprietary work assignment or position. The	9
briefing will be given jointly by Company and Union represen-	10
tatives and will include:	11
-	Proprietary opportunities	12
-	Definition of proprietary work	13
-	Working conditions
-	Qualifying criteria	1 $
-	Availability to perform proprietary work	16
-	Rights of employees	1 7
-	Summary	18
A jointly prepared standardized written statement (Pro- 19 prietary Work Option Form) will be given to employees for 20 signature acknowledging that they received the above referenced 21 briefing and that they accept or decline the opportunity to par- 22 ticipate in proprietary work.	23
24 6. PROPRIETARY COMMITTEE	25
In recognition of the unique and evolving nature of this 26 type of work, the parties recognized the need to create a mecha- 27 nism to address the new, unforeseen and unanticipated issues 28 which might arise or to reevaluate issues previously addressed. 29 The parties, therefore, agree that a joint standing Proprietary 30 Committee shall remain empowered to address issues relative to 31 the application or implementation of this Article. The Committee 32 shall be comprised of the Bargaining Unit Chairperson, the 33 senior Labor Relations representative at each Division repre- 34 sented in the Master Agreement, the President of each local 35 Union and a representative from Boeing's Corporate Labor Re- 36 lations Department, the Director of the National Aerospace 37 Department, the Regional Director, the Corporate Vice Presi- 38 dent-Security, or their designees. Other members may be added 39 as needed to address specific or local interest issues. Co- 40 chairpersons shall be selected by the committee members. The 41 committee shall meet as needed by mutual agreement of the co- 42 chairpersons.	43

EXHIBIT C
JOB BIDDING INFORMATION
A. There are three separate kinds of posting for which some of the bidding rules are different.
1.	Regular Quarterly Posting
(a)	Jobs in which there may be vacancies in the next three months are posted in the regular quarterly posting. The fact that a job is posted does not mean that there will be vacancies in that job or that all vacancies in the job will be filled by bidders.
(b)	Use the light GREEN Bid Form (Form 137-C) to bid for jobs on the regular quarterly posting list.
(c)	If you are at work at any time during the five-day posting period, you must submit your bid-during that period.
(d)	If you are on layoff with recall rights you may bid for jobs posted during the regular quarterly posting. However, if you are a Los Angeles area unit employee this right is restricted to your home division.
(e)	If you are absent all five days when the jobs are posted during the regular quarterly posting period, or are downgraded immediately after the posting period, you may submit your bid(s) during the next ten working days either through (a) your supervisor, (b) the Union, or (c) the Transfer Section of Personnel. Your department office, the Wage/Seniority Coordinator, Bargaining Committee Chairman and the local Union office will have a list of the jobs which were posted. In no case may you submit more than three bids under the quarterly posting procedure. However, this limit does not apply to special or lead postings.
(f)	Do not bid for more than three jobs during the regular quarterly posting. If you put in more than three bids all of your bids will be void.
(g)	If you receive a job for which you have bid, all of your other bids, except those for lead, will be

2.	Special Posting
(a)	Bids for jobs which are specially posted are ■ good until bids submitted during the next regular quarterly posting become effective. The job need not be posted again during the remainder of this bidding quarter.
(b)	If you are on layoff with recall rights, you may bid for jobs which are specially posted. However, if you are a Los Angeles area unit employee, this right is restricted to your home division.
(c)	Use the PINK Special Bid Form (Form 137-C-2) to bid for jobs on the special posting list.
(d)	You may bid only during the five days during which jobs are posted.
(e)	If you receive a job for which you have bid, all of your other bids, except those for lead, will be canceled, and you cannot bid again until a complete regular quarterly posting period has passed.
3.	Lead Posting
(a)	A bid for a lead job will remain in effect for three months or until the list of qualified bidders is exhausted, whichever comes first.
(b)	Use the YELLOW Lead Bid Form (Form 137-D) to bid for lead jobs.
(c)	Submit your bid only during the three-day period in which the lead job is posted.
The following rules apply to all bidding:
I.	' Bid only for jobs for which you believe you are qualified. Do not bid for a job in your own classifica-■ tion
2.	Obtain bid forms from your department office or if you are on layoff, from the Transfer Section
3.	Use a separate form for each job bid.
4.	PRINT your bid in ink.
5.	All of the information required on the bid form must be complete and correct. (Your Social Security number is on the back of your ID card.) The information on the bid form provides the Company with informa-

tion which is the basis for determining your qualifi- -cations.	4
6.	You may add an extra page to your bid form if you	5
wish to give the Company more information than	6
there is room for on the bid form	7
7.	Show on the bid form which departments, shifts and $ locations you will NOT accept, if any. A job for 9 which you bid MUST be accepted if it meets your specifications as to department, shift and location. 11
8.	Give your completed bid form to your supervisor. He	12
will assist you to ensure the form is properly com-	13
pleted and legible. If you are on layoff, submit your , 14 bid to the Transfer Section.	15
9.	Bid only for jobs that are posted.	16
10.	You cannot bid if you are on formal leave of absence.	17
11.	You may not bid until you have one (1) year senior-	18
ity, except in your family group. However, you can- 19 not be placed on a bid job until your probationary 20 period is complete.	21
12.	Do not bid for a classification to which you have 22 seniority recall rights.	23
13.	Job descriptions are available in your department of- 24 flee or if you are on layoff, the Transfer Section. 25
14.	If, after you have bid, you receive a job with the same 26 or a higher maximum rate than that of a job for which 27 , you have bid, your bid for that job will be canceled. 28
15.	You cannot cancel a bid once it has been made, ex- 29 cept by mutual agreement between the Company and 30 the Union.	31
16.	You will be notified of the status of a job bid only. 32 under the following two conditions:	33
(a)	The bid does not meet contractual provisions, or 34
is in error and cannot be processed.	35
(b)	You have been determined not to be qualified 36 for an opening in the job you bid for and a less 3 7 senior employee is placed on the job.	38
17.	Lists of employees transferring to jobs for which they 39 bid will be posted regularly.	40

GLOSSARY—UNIFORM JOB DESCRIPTIONS
a job description does not imply a restricted level of difficulty unless such intention is clearly and specifically indicated.
DRAW, DEEP
Means the relation of depth of draw to its other dimensions is such that it is distinguished from moderate or shallow draws by custom.
DRAW, DRAWING
Means the forming of sheet metal or other material by pressing it into a die while at the same time retarding movement of the metal into the die by mechanical holding as with draw rings.
EXPERIMENTAL PARTS
Are parts which are intended for use on experimental or developmental products. These are usually produced singly or in small lots, using standard tooling, improvised tooling, or newly constructed production tooling. The use thereof in a job description does not imply a restricted level of difficulty unless such intention is clearly and specifically indicated.
EXPERIMENTAL WORK, DEVELOPMENTAL WORK (DOES) ■
Means to experiment with the process or operation (assembly and/or fabrication) in order to develop new or improved methods, or means to build or make new assemblies and installations where exercise of a thorough knowledge of the shop theory involved is necessary and further is a recognizably difficult assignment which is characterized by requiring ingenuity (skill in devising) and originality (creative in doing) to accomplish the assignment satisfactorily. It does not include work done by a usual or established manner, process or operation on a part even when such part will later be used on an experimental or prototype product.
FABRICATES COMPLETELY
Means to perform all necessary fabrication operations required to produce a finished article ready for use in an assembly.
218
EXHIBIT J GLOSSARY—UNIFORM JOB DESCRIPTIONS 1
2
FABRICATION, FABRICATES	3
Means work operations on raw materials and. partially 4 manufactured parts which increase its or their value and 5 utility.	6
7
LAYOUT (NT LAYS OUT t V)	8
Means the actual marking of location and/or reference	9
points and lines on the material, part, tool or assembly	10
worked on. Layout in itself does not imply a high level of	11
difficulty or skill since it can be a simple work operation	12
such as measuring a length on a piece of lumber and	13
marking a line or point at which it is to be sawed, marking	14
lines on pavement with a chalk line preparatory to painting	15
or scribing around a furnished template laid on flat stock.	16
On the other hand, layout can be a difficult work operation	17
which requires much skill, knowledge and experience to	18
make the necessary computations, part setup, precise	19
measurements and markings, and interpretation of complex	20
blueprints such as on a complex die or casting requiring	21
layout to establish locations for coordinated hold patterns,	22
compound angles and/or irregular contours.	23
24
LAYOUT OF PART	25
Means the marking of points and lines which will deter- 26 mine the exact nature and dimensions of the part after ma- 27 chining or fabrication operations have been performed. 28 Layout of this nature is an integral and necessary' step in 29 die fabrication of the part.	3 0
LAYOUT, PROGRESSIVE	32
Is the layout for a machining or other fabrication operation 33 which is continued (or completed) after the fabrication op- 34 eration has been performed. Progressive layout is often 35 necessary when initial machining operations would remove 36 scribed reference marks for subsequent operations, or is 37 advantageous when the machining operation produces a 38 good reference plane or point for further layout operations. 39 40
LAYOUT OF REFERENCE LINES AND POINTS 41 Means the marking of points and lines to aid or guide the 42 workman in performing a given operation. It often indi- 43 cates points and lines from which precision measurements 44 will be taken although the points and lines themselves need 45 not have been located exactly. Layout of this nature is of- 46

3	ten optional rather than necessary as the purpose can be to
4	reduce the number of measurements, limit gross errors, or
5	to permit working to closer than specified tolerances.
6
7	PICKUP WORK. PICKUP
8	Means the performance out of usual or normal sequence
9	work operations which have been omitted by intention or
10	of necessity (as part shortage or rushed schedule) or by
11	oversight (as failure to drill a hole, make a cutout or install
12	a part). Pickup work does not of itself establish a high or
13	higher level of difficulty since work done out of sequence
14	is very often of the same difficulty or within the same level
15	of difficulty as when done in sequence. Therefore, the level
16	of difficulty intended is to be determined from the com-
17	posite job description and compared with the actual pickup
18	work in question.
19
20	REPAIR
21	Means to restore a part or assembly to its original state or 22	utility after it has	been	damaged	by	accident or by wear. It
23	does not have the	same	meaning	as	'rework'.
24
25	REWORK
26	Means to undo and then do over work previously accom-27 plished (normally by others) in order to correct errors or 28 make it conform to changed specifications. Rework can be 29	simple or difficult according to its nature and variety,
30	therefore, the level of difficulty intended is to be deter-
31	mined from the composite job description (see repair).
32
33	SETUP (N), SETS UP (V)
34	Is a broad term which becomes specific only according to
35	its usage and application to machines and/or operations
36	concerned. It includes the various necessary physical work
37	operations or steps (other than layout) which must be ac-
38	complished before actual fabrication can proceed. Setup of
39	a machine might include securing material to machine bed
40	at the proper angle for cutting, selecting, aligning and set-
41	ting cutting tool, setting speeds and feeds, adjusting cool-
42	ant flow, or perhaps oiling the machine itself. In most
43	assembly operations, setup (e.g., positioning parts, obtain-
44	ing parts) is so closely intermingled with fitting and joining
45	together that setup is not customarily designated as such.
46
220
EXHIBIT J	GLOSSARY—UNIFORM JOB DESCRIPTIONS 1
2
This is generally true of operations where machine opera- 3 tion is not the primary job factor.	4
TEND	6
Means that an automatic or almost automatic function is 1 taking place which requires little or no direct control by the	8
worker. To 'tend' a machine -would include watching its	9
operation after the setup has been made (usually by others),	10
periodically checking work produced, starting and stop- 11 ping, loading material in machine, removing finished part, 12 making minor adjustments to machine which do not in- 13 volve extensive knowledge of setup, and notifying proper 14 personnel when machine or part trouble develops.	15
16
TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE	17
Training refers to time to acquire skill through instruction, 18 demonstration and controlled or practice operation. Expe- 19 rience refers to time to acquire skill through actual per- 20 formance of the work itself or of pertinent elements of 21 closely related work. Training does not include schooling 22 or formal training in reading, writing and simple arithme- 23 tic, since this is basic for all aircraft occupations. More ad- 24 vanced formal training which would substitute directly for	25
job techniques normally acquired by actual experience on	26
the job, such as shop algebra, shop geometry, shop trigo- 27 nometry, blueprint reading, lofting practice and technical 28 trade knowledge can be counted as equivalent training and 29 experience in the case of an individual worker.	30
31
3.	INFORMATION SOURCES	32
33
AS DIRECTED	34
Means that some determinations connected with the work 35 operation described are usually and normally made by oth- 36 ers and are given or made known to the worker directly 37 concerned with the assignment. Use of this term does not 38 mean that the details and determinations involved need be 39 repeated each time an identical or vety similar work as- 40 signment is made or work operations performed, nor, does 41 it preclude use of independent judgment by the worker. 42
AS REQUIRED	44
Means that the work operation function or job duty is usu- 45 ally and normally performed after or as a direct result of an 46

order, work assignment or request from recognized supervisory personnel and/or has been used in some instances to mean an occasional or incidental job requirement. The intended meaning is evident from the nature of the job duty described.
ASSEMBLY AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS Books, manuals, or individual sheets which denote and illustrate, in sequence, operations required for the assembly and installation of such items as components, harnesses, sub-units and units. Includes such items as break-out illustrations of items being assembled, step-by-step operations and related plug and wire charts.
ASSISTS
Means that the assistance given can be for the accomplishment of work of a higher level of difficulty than that defined in the lower classified worker’s job description without affecting the assisting worker's job classification. The worker assisted is held responsible for the satisfactoiy completion of such work assignment. The assisting worker is not expected to work wholly independently but rather cooperatively and, further, is entitled to and should receive the guidance and instruction considered usual and normal under these circumstances.
BLUEPRINTS, DETAIL
Are any class of blueprints which give necessary detailed information for fabricating one or more parts.
BLUEPRINTS, DETAIL ASSEMBLY
Are blueprints which provide information for assembling parts together with the necessary information for making some or all of the individual parts.
BLUEPRINTS. MAJOR ASSEMBLY AND INSTALLATION
Are blueprints which provide information for the installation and/or assembly of fabricated and accessory parts into the airplane during final assembly, and for the construction of such major assemblies as fuselage, wing, empennage, and engine control stand.

Represents the actual size of wire harness and indicates pin	10
locations, routing of wires, terminal points, wire cut-off	11
points, location of plugs, terminals and ties. Template is	12
laid over the board and pins are located by marking	13
through the template.	14
15
MANUFACTURING OUTLINE SHEETS	16
These sheets or cards furnish all or some of the following 17 information: the order or sequence in which operations are 18 to be performed, the tools to be used, the production tool- 19 ing available and its tooling identification number, ma- 20 chine feeds and speeds and special manufacturing 21 instructions, if any. This refers to operation sequence 22 sheets, process sheets, operational sheets or cards, manu- 23 factoring operation cards, and other written information 24 furnished the operator of the same nature and for the same 25 use and purpose.	26

OPERATIONS
CALIBRATION
Comparison between two instruments or devices, one of which is a company standard of a known accuracy, to detect, correlate and adjust any variation in accuracy of instrument or device being compared.
CHECK. FUNCTIONAL, AEROSPACE VEHICLES Means to determine or ascertain whether a component, sub-unit, unit or portion of a system performs the function for which it is intended. Examples: landing gear system, surface control system, fuel system, checking lines for leaks, power plant system, transmitting, receiving and inter-communication system. Check includes diagnosing malfunctions and initiating corrective action.
CHECK. OPERATIONAL, AEROSPACE VEHICLES Means making a complete check of an entire completed independent system and always takes place on a completely assembled aerospace vehicle such as an airplane or missile to determine whether the system or systems perform to operating requirements. Examples would include the complete fire control system, inertial navigation system, hydraulic and surface control system, power plant and fuel supply systems. Checks include diagnosing malfunctions and initiating corrective action,
CHECK, VISUAL
Means detecting with the naked eye, or with such aids as mirrors, obvious defects and imperfections. The use thereof implies sufficient knowledge and familiarity on the part of the worker to make the required identification. Such check would uncover incomplete assembly (missing parts or operations), visible surface cracks, badly driven rivets, and similar conditions.
WORKING INSTRUMENTS. TEST EQUIPMENT
All instruments or devices which are calibrated to company standards and are used for making measurements or controlling processes related to a product.
226
EXHIBIT J	GLOSSARY—UNIFORM JOB DESCRIPTIONS
COMPANY STANDARDS
a.	Reference Standards: All instruments or devices within the company which are used as primary standards of reference and which are calibrated or checked by direct reference to the National Bureau of Standards.
b.	Transfer Standards: All instruments or devices used to transfer measurements from reference standards to working standards, or which are used in lieu of reference standards to avoid wear or deterioration.
c,	Working Standards: AU instruments or devices used to calibrate working instruments and which are in turn calibrated by reference standards or by transfer standards.
5.	TOLERANCES AND DIMENSIONS
COORDINATED TOLERANCES. COORDINATED DIMENSIONS
These expressions are used only when exacting tolerances are implied, i.e., exacting tolerances are to be associated always with 'coordinated dimensions’, 'coordinated tolerances' unless modified expressly. It should be understood that the mere location of a point by two or more reference dimensions does not in itself mean that the dimensions themselves are coordinated. An example of truly coordinated dimensions is shown in the following: the precision dimension between two holes must be held , while at the same time the precision dimensions locating each of the holes must also be held with respect to another reference point or line.

TOLERANCES, CLOSE
Means those tolerances which require the worker's close attention and requires directed effort during setup and/or operation to hold, but which are within the normal capacity of the machine. Also, means those tolerances which require a fairly skillful use of hand tools and/or assembly techniques to hold. This term expresses a level of difficulty required to obtain or hold the tolerance rather than a preciseness of linear, angular or other measurement.
TOLERANCES, EXACTING
Means those tolerances which, to obtain or hold, require extra careful attention and the application of much job knowledge on the part of a skilled workman, whether on machine or hand operations. These tolerances would be difficult, if not impossible, for a semi-skilled or unskilled workman to hold consistently with good output. This term expresses a level of difficulty required to obtain or hold the tolerance rather than a preciseness of linear, angular or other measurement.
TOLERANCES, MODERATE
Means those tolerances which, to obtain or hold, require only ordinary care and skill on the part of the worker. Also, means those tolerances which are wholly or almost wholly held by jigs, tools, molds, dies and other tooling and, no matter how critical or precise, are largely beyond the control of the worker in the normal performance of the job. This term expresses a level of difficulty required to obtain or hold the tolerance rather than a preciseness of linear, angular or other measurement.

6.	TOOLING AND SHAPES
ADAPT TOOLING
Means to modify, alter or change famished tooling to ac- ■ commodate a specific need without altering the basic design.
ANGLE' COMPOUND
Means the angle between the two non-coinciding sides of two oblique angles which are in different planes and have a vertex and one side in common. Making a compound angle usually presents a coordinating tolerance problem since it results from the holding within tolerances of two adjoining component angles. As an example:
ASSEMBLY JIGS
Are those jigs which facilitate holding and aligning a set of parts for fabrication or assembly operations.
CONTOUR
Means a curved surface having a radii of different lengths, all of which lie in parallel planes or the same plane, such planes being perpendicular to the curved surface, or means a curved line having radii of different lengths, all of which are in the same plane. The surface of a cone or section thereon, a typical airfoil surface, the curved edge of a profiled plate and the curved layout line guiding the making of a router block are examples. Contour surfaces composed of sections of cylinders and edges whose profile is a section

HAND TOOLS
These include hand tools normally used by the workman in the performance of the occupation, such as files, rasps, deburring tools, chisels, saws, hand drills, screw drivers, pliers, wrenches, hammers, mallets and punches.
HAND TOOLS, MACHINISTS'
No definite distinction is implied by prefixing 'machinists’ to hand tools'. Use of this or other trade names as carpenters', instrument makers', electricians' and masons' does not imply a strict limitation on hand tools used; e.g., wire cutters (electricians’) might be used by a mason laying wire reinforced brick or tin snips (sheet metal workers') by a carpenter to cut a square of sheet metal to cover a knot hole.
HOLDING FIXTURES
Refers to tooling designed to hold the work so that machining, installation, assembly or layout operations are facilitated.

A.	There are two kinds of posting for which some of the bidding rules are different.
1.	Regular Quarterly Posting
(a)	Jobs in which there may be vacancies in the next three months are posted in the regular quarterly posting. The fact that a job is posted does not mean that there will be vacancies in that job or that all vacancies in the job will be filled by bidders.
(b)	Use the light GREEN Bid Form (Form I37-C) to bid for jobs on the regular quarterly posting list.
(c)	If you are at work at any time during the five-day posting period, you must submit your bid during that period.
(d)	If you are on layoff with recall rights you may bid for jobs posted during the regular quarterly posting.
(e)	If you are absent all five days when the jobs are posted during the regular quarterly posting period, or are downgraded immediately after the posting period, you may submit your bid(s) during the next ten working days to the Personnel Department. Your Personnel Department will have a list of the jobs which were posted. In no case may you submit more than three bids under the quarterly posting procedure. However, this limit does not apply to special postings.
(f)	Do not bid for mote than three jobs during the regular quarterly posting. If you put in more than three bids all of your bids will be void.
(g)	If you receive a job for which you have bid, all of your other bids will be canceled, and you cannot bid again until a complete regular quarterly posting period has passed.
2.	Special Posting
(a)	Bids for jobs which are specially posted are good until bids submitted during the next regular quarterly posting become effective. The job need not be posted again during the remainder of this bidding quarter.
(b)	If you are on layoff with recall rights, you may bid for jobs which are specially posted.
(c)	Use the PINK Special Bid Form (Form 137-C-2) to bid for jobs on the special posting list.

Subject: Recognition - Successorship - Neutrality	11
12
Dear Mr, Wyse:	13
14
During negotiations resulting in the 1996 Master Agreement, the 15 parties discussed the issues of recognition, successorship, and 16 neutrality. The Union expressed concern regarding these issues 17 and the potential effect on their bargaining unit.	18
19
Both parties recognized the close, mature working relationship 20 between the Company's Aerospace Businesses and the Union 21 that has developed over many years. The parties emphasized 22
their success in resolving past recognition, successorship, neu- 23 trality and other issues of concern based on this sound relation- 24 ship.	25
26
The parties agree that should recognition, successorship or neu- 27 trality issues arise during the prescribed term of this Agreement, 28 the Aerospace & Defense Vice President, Human Resources and 29 the Secretary-Treasurer and Director, National Aerospace De- 30 partment of the Union, or their designated representatives, will 31 meet to discuss and mutually resolve the issues.

16
17	Dear Mr. Souza:
18
19	During 1981 contract negotiations, the parties agreed to revised 20 language in Article XIII—Safety. The Union expressed concern 21 that the added duties and responsibilities covered under Article 22 XII, Section 5, could adversely impact the assigned existing lull-23 time Bargaining Committeemen's workload. The parties, there-24 fore, agreed that if the Union believes that such adverse impact 25 is occurring, the President of UAW Local 887 and the Com-26 pany’s Director of Labor Relations or their designated represen-27 tative, will meet and mutually agree to resolution of the issue.

MEMORANDUM OF INTENT ON DRUG POLICY
During the negotiations resulting in the 1990 Aerospace Master Agreement, the parties discussed the issue of a drug free workplace in general and drug testing in particular. Both parties fully support the need to maintain a drug free workplace, to identify employees who are using illegal drugs and to assist those employees to obtain treatment. To that end the parties previously developed the Rockwell (now Boeing)-UAW Joint Substance Abuse Recovery Program which is intended to help employees to find effective counseling and rehabilitation programs. The Company has also put an Anti-Drug Program into effect.
The parties further discussed the impact of the Federal Government's recently promulgated or soon to be promulgated initiatives. These include the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, drug-free workforce regulations from the Department of Defense, the Department of Transportation and other agencies.
It was agreed that should legislation, regulations or court decisions require that the Company’s Anti-Drug Program be changed, the parties would meet to review the program and make any necessary or appropriate changes. The Company must comply with the law and the requirements of federal agencies for which it is a contractor.

Subject: Equalization of Overtime
Dear Mr. Wyse:
In discussions between the parties in regard to Article XVII, Section 2(a):
“Extra work in periods of overtime operations shall be equalized among the employees in the group engaged in similar work as far as practical,"
The parties agree that the original intent of this language was very clearly understood to indicate to Management that every reasonable attempt should be made to equalize the overtime within the group.
Ongoing disputes involving equalization of overtime shall be referred directly to the Director of Labor Relations and the Chairman of the Bargaining Committee for resolution.

Subject: Department Grouping—Leads	11
12
Dear Mr. Wyse:	13
14
Article XI, Section 20(d) refers to lead rights "in a department or 15 agreed group of departments." During negotiations for a 1981	16
Master Agreement, the parties agreed to the following regarding 17 the grouping of departments for the purpose of exercising lead 18 seniority:	19
20
1.	Representatives of the Company and the Union will meet 21 at each Division, at the request of either party to agree 22 upon departments that will be grouped. Appropriate de- 23 partmental groupings will be based on the following crite- 24 ria:	25
a.	Grouped departments will be involved in the same 26 program/project; and	27
b.	Grouped departments will be engaged in the same 28 function, i.e., Assembly, Test, Flight Hardware, 29 Ground Support Equipment, Production and Experi- 30 mental are all separate functions for this purpose. 31
2.	Entire departments will be grouped. Parts of departments 32 will not be grouped with other departments or parts of de- 33 partments.	34
3.	If the parties are unable to mutually agree on the grouping 35 of departments, the dispute will be subject to the problem 36 solving, grievance and arbitration procedures.	37

Dear Mr. Wyse:	15
16
It is understood by the parties that employees who have been 17 . transferred out of the bargaining unit will be permitted to be 18 returned to the bargaining unit for any reason, at the option of	19
management. This option will be available for these affected	20
employees for the first twelve month period following their 21 transfer out of the bargaining unit. This option may be exercised	22
only once per employee, except in the case of a contract cancel-	23
lation. In no event may the option be exercised more than once.	24
The twelve month period is the total amount of time out of the	25
unit (one or two occasions). Subsequent to the twelve month 26 period, the prevailing contract language in Article XI, Section 27 11(d) will apply.	28

Subject: Benefit Representation
Dear Mr. Wyse:
During the 1984 negotiations, the parties expressed a sincere mutual interest in improving the administration and utilization of planned benefits.
To further accomplish this improvement the parties agree that the Union may select and assign (at the option of the local plant or facility) a bargaining committeeman or wage/seniority coordinator, under existing representation provisions to fulfill this need. An exception will be at SSFL, Local 1519 and at McAlester, Local 1558, where the Union may select and assign this to any in-plant elected representative under existing representation provisions. At Tulsa, Local 952, the Union has appointed the Local Union President to fulfill these duties on a two day per week basis.
The parties agree that accomplishment of these improvements to the administration and utilization of planned benefits requires experienced and trained individuals in employee benefits.
In recognition of this need, the parties further agree to provide orientation and training to those the union may select for this activity.
Very truly yours,

employees. Routine operation of the Sodium Pump Test Facility, for scheduled electromagnetic pump tests, requires only one (1) bargaining unit employee per crew because of the relative simplicity of the system and testing program. Crew complements for future programs will be based on similar considerations. On this basis, the use of the eight (8) hour rotating shift will be discontinued unless this agreement becomes invalid because of some law or legislative statute.
8)	The normal work day for employees assigned to the alternating shift shall be twelve (12) hours. The normal workweek shall be in accordance with the alternating shift schedule “1” (attached). The regular start times for the day shift and night shift shall be as follows:
Day Shift:	7:00 a.m. through 8:00 a.m.
Night Shift: 7:00 p.m. through 8:00 p.m.

9)	Extra work in periods of overtime operations shall be in accordance with Article XVII, Section 2 of the parties agreement except as noted. The order of overtime assignment shall be:
First:	Employees in the on duty UAW group.

Third:	Employees from another UAW overtime group
in the same department in the same occupation, assigned to the opposite twelve (12) hour alternating shift.
Fourth: Employees from another UAW overtime group in the same department in same occupation on another shift, assigned to the opposite twelve (12) hour alternating shift.
Fifth:	Employees from another UAW overtime group
in the department on the same shift or rotating shift.

9
10)	Extra work in periods of overtime, i.e., more than twelve 10 (12) hours per day or more than forty (40) hours per week, 11 shall be paid at the appropriate overtime premium rate of 12 time and one-half or double time (except as noted herein). 13 14
11)	If a holiday occurs on a scheduled workday, as defined in 15 item 14, double time will be paid for all hours worked in 16 addition to the normal eight (8) hours holiday pay. When 17 the holiday occurs on a scheduled workday, the eight (8) 18 hours of straight time holiday pay shall be included when 19 calculating eligibility for premium pay, at time and one- 20 half, over forty (40) straight time hours per week.	21
22
12)	If a holiday occurs on a scheduled day off, eight (8) hours 23 holiday pay will be paid to such employee under the provi- 24 sions for holiday pay of the Master Agreement. Holiday 25 hours paid at straight time on a scheduled day off shall not 26 be used to calculate premium pay eligibility for hours 27 worked over forty (40) straight time hours per week.	28
29
13)	Employees working the twelve (12) hour alternating shift 30 operations will not be paid overtime for Saturday or Sun- 31 day work when the Saturday or Sunday is a working day of 32 their scheduled week, unless the hours worked exceed 33 those of a normal work week shift (twelve (12) hours per 34 day) or forty (40) straight time hours per scheduled work 35 week. Such employees are to receive time and one-half for 36 hours worked on shifts starting on their first, third or fifth 37 regular day off and double time for hours worked on shifts 38 starting on their second, fourth or sixth regular day off or 39 on any of their negotiated holidays other than Sunday. The 40 Company will continue its present practice with respect to 41 the assignment of a minimum of employees to such shifts, 42 except when additional employees are required as a result 43 of changed circumstances, applicable laws or regulations 44 (Federal, State or Local), insurance requirements and/or 45 requests from government agencies.	46

Subject: Pay for Union Representatives - Negotiations
Dear Mr. Wyse:
I propose the following:
For the negotiations activity scheduled to commence on or about this date, the Company will compensate union representatives participating in these negotiations as follows:
•	Those representatives who are normally considered 'full-timers' and normally paid by the Company, i.e., bargaining committeemen, and wage/seniority coordinators, the Company will pay five days per week, eight hours per day, providing they are not replaced by other union representatives at their division during these negotiations.
•	For those representatives who are not normally considered 'full-timers' but are normally paid by the Company when engaged in productive work on Company premises, ue., certain Local Union officers, the Company will pay three days per week, eight hours per day.
If the Union agrees with the above, please advise and I will make sure that the divisions are instructed accordingly.

Subject: Grievances - Reinstatement of	12
13
Dear Mr. Wyse:	14
15
During the negotiations of the 1981 Aerospace Master Agree-. 16 ment, the parties acknowledged the desirability of ensuring 17 prompt, fair and final resolution of employee grievances. The 18 parties also recognized that the maintenance of a stable effective 19 and dependable grievance procedure is necessary to implement 20 the foregoing principle to which they both subscribe. Accord- 21 ingly, the parties view any attempt to' reinstate a grievance prop- 22 erly disposed of as contrary to the purpose for which the 23 grievance procedure was established and violative of the funda- 24 mental principles of collective bargaining.	25
26
However, in those instances where the International Union, 27 UAW, by either its Executive Board, Public Review Board, or 28 ’ Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee has reviewed the 29 disposition of a grievance and found that such disposition was 30 improperly effected by the Union or a Union representative 31 involved, the Director—National Aerospace Department of the 32 International Union may inform the Company’s Aerospace and 33 Defense Vice President, Human Resources in writing that such. 34 grievance is reinstated in the grievance procedure at the step at 35. which the original disposition of the grievance occurred.	36
37
It is agreed, however, that the Company will not be liable for any claims arising out of the grievance that either are already barred under the provisions of the aforementioned Aerospace Master Agreement at the time of the reinstatement of the grievance or that relate to the period between the time of the original disposition and the time of the reinstatement as provided herein. It is further agreed that the reinstatement of any such grievance shall be conditioned upon the prior agreement of the Union and

$ the employee or employees involved that none of them will Mr.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a decision of the arbitrator on j $ any grievance shall continue to be final and binding on the Un-I $ ion and its members, the employee or employees involved and 12 the Company and such grievance shall not be subject to rein-18 statement.

Dear Mr. Wyse:	-	14
15
During the 1993 negotiations, the Union raised concerns about 16 the Company subcontracting work that UAW-represented em- 17 ployees normally perform.	18
19
The Company hereby assures the Union it has no plans to 20 change its policy of performing work with its own employees, 21 provided it has die manpower, skills, equipment and facilities to 22 do so.	23
24
Except where time and circumstances prevent it, local manage- 25 ment will hold advance discussion with the Chairperson of the 26 Bargaining Committee prior to subcontracting maintenance 27 work on-site, or subcontracting off-site, work that is currently 28 being performed by UAW-represented employees.	29
. 30
When meeting with the Union, management will review its plans 31 or prospects for letting a particular contract. It is the intent of the 32 parties that these discussions will take place during the planning 33 of the work which is subject to subcontracting. Management will 34 also describe the nature, scope and approximate dates of the 35 work to be performed and the reason (e.g., equipment, man- 36 power, etc.) why management is contemplating contracting out 37 the work. Local management is expected to afford the Chairper- 38 son of the Bargaining Committee the opportunity to comment on 39 management's plans and give appropriate weight to those com- 40 ments in light of all attendant circumstances.	41
42
The parties recognize that certain engineering prototypes and 43 first article units may continue to be performed at Master 44 Agreement locations for a product which is to be built at other 45 locations.	46

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
SKILLS DEMONSTRATION EXERCISES
In order to provide a fair, consistent and objective means for an employee to demonstrate whether or not they have the basic knowledge and skill required for entry into a particular job classification, the Union recognizes the Company’s right to administer skills demonstration exercises to candidates for certain job vacancies. Such skills demonstration exercises will be jointly reviewed/developed by the Company and the Union.
In order to effect such review and development, the Chairperson of the Bargaining Committee at the division involved will designate one (1) bargaining unit employee to participate in such reviews/development. If the employee selected by the Union is not releasable/available, the Company may require another selection. The Director of Labor Relations at the division involved will designate one (1) non-bargaining unit employee to participate in such review(s).
When determined necessary, the employees designated will be afforded reasonable time to jointly meet with/question Company representatives and a selected employee(s) in the classification involved, at the division involved.
Disputes involving the content of any demonstration exercise will be referred to the Chairperson of the Bargaining Committee and Director of Labor Relations for resolution. If the dispute regarding the demonstration exercise cannot be resolved, the Company may unilaterally install the demonstration exercise, and the Union will have the right to grieve the content of the demonstration exercise only when a specific denial to place an employee in a job classification occurs.
Skills demonstration exercises may be used, for classifications in labor grade 6 and above, in situations where a candidate does not have an established seniority right to a job classification. Such situations will include: posting and bidding; preferential reinstatement; promotion as a non-bidder including intra and interdivision transfers not in classification, and transfers to an "available job" at time of excess. An employee who has been promoted or transferred into another classification in another family

group, who subsequently returns to his former classification within a period of ninety (90) days, will not be required to take a skills demonstration exercise, except at Tulsa, where individuals possessing a "previous held" right will not be required to take a skills demonstration exercise.
Skills demonstration exercises for a particular classification may consist of written examinations, practical exercises, or a combination of both.
The parties agree that preserving the confidentiality and integrity of the demonstration exercises is of the utmost importance; consequently, the Company will not provide copies of any written questions, blueprints or projects to the Union for their retention.
The parties recognize that demonstration exercises should be based on the job description for the classification; however, where work performed by a particular job classification differs from division to division, those differences should be reflected in the content of the demonstration exercises. Demonstration exercises may thus differ from division to division.
Disputes regarding the interdivisional consistency of demonstration exercises may be referred to the Secretary-treasurer & Director of the UAW National Aerospace Department and the Corporate Director of Labor Relations, or their designated representatives, for resolution. These parties may review any and all demonstration exercises, at their discretion.

OFF-SITE ASSIGNMENT OF BARGAINING UNIT EMPLOYEES (ALL AREA UNITS)
1.	Occasionally it is necessary for the Company to assign bargaining unit employees to off-site locations within the United States where they perform work which is similar in nature to the work performed within the plants or facilities of the employee's home area unit. When such assignments are made on a shortterm basis (for twelve consecutive months or less), bargaining unit employees will not be considered as transferred out of their home area unit and will be continued on dues check off with their dues submitted to the Local representing their home area unit. The twelve consecutive month period will be extended if the employee's off-site assignment is extended on a short-term basis to permit the completion of the work.
2.	When such assignments are necessary, the Company will make the assignments to qualified employees. In instances where a qualified employee given the assignment indicates he is unable or unwilling to accept the assignment, the Company will assign the work to the least senior qualified employee. The Company will expect the employee to accept an off-site work assignment when work is assigned on this latter basis, unless there are serious extenuating circumstances which preclude his acceptance of such assignment. (By mutual agreement between the parties, this procedure for making off-site assignments may be modified to provide for the assignment of more senior employees who may wish to accept the assignment. Where a number of employees in a classification in a department arc determined by the Company to be qualified for an off-site assignment, the assignment will be given to the most senior of such qualified employees who indicates a willingness to accept the assignment.)
(a) If the off-site assignment is not assigned to the most senior employee in the classification in a department, who has indicated a willingness to accept such assignment, the Division Manager of Labor Relations will advise the Chairperson of the Bargaining Committee of the reasons for the decision,
3.	Normal seniority rules applicable to bargaining unit employees at work in the plants or facilities of the area unit do not apply to employees on off-site assignments. If an employee, prior to being placed on an off-site assignment, had an active
282
1 2 request for Shift Transfer or Job Bid on file, the effect of such 3 application and/or bid will be considered in relation to his sen* 4 iority when he returns from his off-site assignment.	5
6
4.	Employees on off-site assignment will normally retain 7 regular bargaining unit classifications. In those instances where 8 it is appropriate that an employee on off-site assignment have his 9 classification changed in order that the employee be properly 10 classified and/or compensated, a change in classification will be 11 processed. Such reclassification will not constitute a vacancy at 12 the employee's home plant or facility for purposes of job posting 13 and bidding or recall. Such change in classification will be ap- 14 plicable only for the duration of the off-site assignment. When 15 an employee returns from an off-site assignment, he will exer- 16 cise his seniority in the last classification he held in the area unit 17 prior to transfer to the off-site assignment.	18
19
5.	An employee on off-site assignment who has a problem 20 may contact the Chairman of the Bargaining Committee at his 21 home plant or facility. The Chairperson of the Bargaining Com- 22 mittee and the Director of Labor Relations at his home plant or 23 facility will resolve any questions regarding the application of 24 time limits to problems raised by employees on off-site assign- 25 ment.	26
27
6.	The above provisions will be applied as they were during 28 the terms of the previous Agreements.	29

Dear Mr. Wyse:	15
16
During the 1993 negotiations of the Master Agreement, the	17
parties discussed the seniority rights of certain UAW- 18 represented employees who have been transferred to other Divi- 19 sions as a result of business reorganizations. The circumstances 20 for each situation are different and the following confirms our 21 understanding of the seniority rights of those employees af- 22 fected:	23
24
1.	Certain Receiving and In-Plant Trucking employees at Seal 25 Beach were transferred from the Space Systems Division 26 (Downey/Seal Beach) to the Information Systems Center 27 (ISC). The parties agree that the affected employees will 28 continue to be considered part of the Space Systems Divi- 29 sion (Downey/Seal Beach seniority unit) and will continue 30 to exercise all seniority rights in that unit.	31
32
2.	Certain employees in at the Space Systems Division 33 (Downey/Seal Beach) were transferred to Corporate Office 34 (Seal Beach). The parties agree that the affected employees 35 will continue to be considered pan of Space Systems Divi- 36 sion (Downey/Seal Beach) seniority unit and will continue 37 to exercise all seniority rights in that unit.	38
39
3.	Certain employees at the North American Aircraft facilities 40 (now North American Aircraft Division) at the Palmdale 41 Airport, Palmdale, California and at Edwards Air Force 42 Base, California will be transferred to the North American 43 Aircraft Modification Division (a newly created division). 44 The parties agree that all affected employees at both Divi- 45 sions will nevertheless be considered as belonging to one 46

Subject: Deleted Job Classifications—Reinstatement	, j
12
Dear Mr. Wyse:	13
14
During the course of the 1978 and subsequent negotiations, the parties expressed a desire to eliminate from the classifications structure those occupations and/or classifications which either (1) have no application in the predictable future, or (2) are not or jg have not been populated for a substantial period of time and, like	। 9
(1) above, have no apparent application in the predictable future. 20
The Company and the Union have recognized during these ne- 22 gotiations that although such classifications as referred to above 23 have no application in the predictable future, the possibility does 24 remain that, as a result of new programs or substantially changed 25 work operations, some or all of these classifications may be 26 needed in the future.	27
28
In recognition of our mutual objective to eliminate unused clas- 29 sifications and allow for the possibility of future use of these 3Q classifications, we have reached an understanding that the Com- 3 j pany shall have the right to reinstate such deleted classifications 32 during the term of the new agreement and will reinstate such 33 deleted classifications at the request of the Union through the 34 Wage Committee established under Article XVI, Section 6.	35
36
If the above is in accordance with your understanding, please 37 indicate your agreement by signing this letter in the space pro- 3g vided below.	39

Very truly yours,	4j

Dear Mr. Wyse:
During discussions for the 1990 Aerospace Master Agreement negotiations, the Union indicated a continuing desire to assist the Company in locating bargaining unit employees for whom the company is holding unclaimed wages in the form of payroll checks which have been returned to the Company as undeliverable.
The Company agreed to continue to provide the names, and other pertinent information in connection with the undeliverable checks, to a Union representative designed by the appropriate financial officer of the Union at each division/location covered under the Aerospace Master Agreement.
This information shall be provided no less frequently than quarterly on a schedule to be mutually determined by division/location Labor Relations Managers and the designated Union Representative.
Very truly yours,

Subject: Problem/Grievance/Settlement Procedure
Dear Mr. Wyse:
This is to confirm the understanding reached during the 1993 Master Agreement Negotiations relative to the new prob-lem/grievance/settlement procedure.
The parties agree that this new procedure will be effective on September 6, 1993. Problems/grievances filed prior to September 6, 1993 will be processed in accordance with the provisions of the Master Agreement that was effective July 7, 1990.
It is also agreed that grievances in the system prior to negotiations will remain to be considered on their own individual merits.

SENIORITY SUBCOMMITTEE 1981 NEGOTIATIONS
I
In addition to contract language changes agreed to during the course of negotiations, the parties reviewed the documents concerning seniority and agreement was reached to incorporate some in the Contract and/or Seniority-at-a-Glance, and to eliminate others. Unless specifically agreed to the contrary in writing, practices established coincident with the understandings which were eliminated will continue to be followed.
During discussions of Article XI, Section 16, the Stabilizing Employee provision, the Company renewed its commitment made in 1971 negotiations to continue in its effort to qualify more senior employees in those situations where a stabilizing employee is being held out of line of seniority in accordance with Section 16, Additionally, the Company reaffirmed that the provisions of Section 16 will apply on a division-wide basis. In regard to Special Posting under Section 8, the Union was assured that absent unusual circumstances, vacancies resulting in the Special Posting will be filled.
Also in Section 8, Posting and Bidding, the Company committed to adequately inform bypassed employees as to why they are not qualified.
In addition to the above, the parties discussed Article XI, Section 12, regarding loan outs. No change was made in the language and the parties agreed to apply it in the same manner as intended in the 1971 negotiations.
Also, the parties agreed that subsequent to action taken by the Wage Committee, representatives from both parties will meet to discuss the seniority ramifications of the Wage Committee's actions. Appropriate steps will be taken to resolve any seniority problems resultant from such Wage Committee's actions. Additionally, the parties will meet to complete the revision of the

TEAM MEMBER TRAINING PRINCIPLES
Core concept training for team members will be done on company time.
Certain other team member training will be optional and will be offered on a time shared basis (some time paid, some personal).
Some courses, non-mandatory, will be available, through community colleges or other delivery systems. If it is agreed that the training is appropriate for the employee and the business at that time, tuition will be reimbursed by the business.
302
MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
It is the joint recommendation of the 1996 Negotiation Committee on Classification Combination that the newly agreed upon classifications be implemented the first Saturday following ratification of a new Agreement. Attached is a listing of the newly combined classifications and other agreements.
It is also recognized that a considerable amount of continuing joint effort will be required to define, for each new classification, the skill elements and levels required to accommodate the progression of employees through newly expanded rate ranges. Therefore, we recommend the following:
1.	Automatic Progression
Employees who are incumbents (including those on layoff or downgrade) of the newly combined classifications on the Saturday following ratification and whose base rate falls below the maximum of the new classification (and who are not currently in an automatic progression cycle) will begin a new progression cycle on that date (or upon recall) in accordance with current contract language.
2.	Knowledge Progression
Newly combined classifications have been identified in both the 1993 and 1996 negotiations which reduce the overall number of classifications and encompass broader ranges of skills. The Joint Committee also continues to recognize that in order to help employees become proficient, the skill and knowledge requirements which are the building blocks of each job need to be agreed upon. Another requirement is the joint determination of the skill elements currently possessed by each employee. Comparison of these two sets of information will indicate the training needs for each employee.
Upon satisfying the knowledge and skill requirements for each jointly identified higher skill level within the combined classification, the employee would qualify for advancement in pay in accordiance with a system yet to be developed. The parties are not able, at this time, to imple-

ment a "Knowledge Progression" system, but may reconsider in the future. Therefore, this data will be preserved.
In developing this system, and after the parties jointly agree to the skill and knowledge elements of each classification and the availability of appropriate training to satisfy those requirements, it is agreed that if an employee either fails to participate in the training or participates, but in either case is not able to demonstrate that he/she possesses the skills required for the next higher level of a classification, his or per pay will not advance beyond the level for the skills and knowledge they do possess or, in the case of incumbents, not above the level for which they are already being paid due to the continuation of their previous base rate.
Technical Training Principles Applicable to New (Combined) Classifications
(a)	The Union and the Company will jointly agree on training needed in order for employees to meet their new job requirements and in order to progress to the top rates of their classification.
(b)	Some, but not ail of the needed training has been accomplished or will be accomplished by previous or future work experience, on the job instruction, by familiarization, and by other on-the-job techniques.
(c)	Mandatory training (required for the employee to do his job) will be company paid.
(d)	Other technical training will be optional and may be offered on a time shared basis (some time paid, some unpaid).
(e)	Some courses, non-mandatoiy, will be available, through community colleges or other delivery systems. If it is agreed that the training is appropriate for the employee and the business at that time, tuition will be reimbursed by the business.
(f)	Human Resources and Union Representatives at each location shall work with Operations and Financial

4.	Seniority	8
9
The combination of classifications is not intended to di- 10 rectly cause employees to be laid off due to skill deficien- 11 cies. Nor are the combinations intended to eliminate any 12 employee's existing seniority rights.	13
14
In the event of layoff, employees within the newly com- 15 bined classifications will be laid off in combined seniority 16 order.	17
18
There will be no immediate seniority movement of em- 19 ployees upon ratification of the new Agreement as a direct 20 result of job combinations or other contract changes. Any 21 seniority out-of-line conditions resulting from such 22 changes will be corrected through the normal layoff and 23 recall process.	24
25
In those combined classifications that include Selected 26 Skills classifications, the following provisions will apply: 27 28
(a)	Where a combination includes two or more Selected 29 Skills classifications, all employees in the combina- 30 tion will be governed by date-of-hire seniority. 31 32
(b)	Where a combination includes only one Selected 33 Skills classification, the Selected Skills employees 34 and those in Related Lower Level classifications will 35 retain and be governed by their current Selected 36 Skills date-of-entry seniority. Other employees in- 37 eluded in such combinations following the 1993 ne- 38 gotiations were assigned will receive a new Selected 39 Skills date-of-entry seniority date of October 2, 40 1993.	41
42
(c)	Because of special circumstances, employees in the 43 four combined classifications "Electronic Techni-	44
cian-Metrology," "Flight Operations Chief Electri- 45 clan," "Physical Technician-Metrology" and	46

"Electronic Technician” are governed by date-of-hire seniority. In addition, those employees in the combined "Tooling Builder-Wood" classification are governed by their current Selected Skills date-of-entry seniority date.
A seniority traceability chart has been developed to record the changes in job codes, family groups, etc. for future reference in determining employee seniority rights.
Continuing Joint Effort
In order to accomplish the significant amount of joint effort remaining to be completed after the parties leave negotiations, it is recommended that this committee be chartered to continue this work and to deal with related issues as they arise.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
MEDIATION PROCEDURE
During the 1996 negotiations, the parties agreed to amend article V, Section 16 so as to allow, by mutual agreement, mediation of grievances.
The primary effort of the mediator is to assist the parties in settling grievances in a mutually satisfactory fashion. In attempting to achieve a settlement, the mediator is free to use all of the techniques customarily associated with mediation, including private conferences with one party. If settlement is not possible, the mediator may provide the parties with an immediate opinion, based upon the Master Agreement, as to how the mediator believes the grievance would be decided if it were arbitrated. This opinion shall not be final and binding, but shall be advisory only. The opinion, if offered, is to be delivered orally and is to be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the mediator's opinion. The advisory opinion shall be used as a basis for further settlement discussions or for withdrawal or granting of the grievance. If the matter is arbitrated, the mediator shall not serve as the arbitrator and nothing said or done by the parties or the mediator during the mediation can be used by any party during arbitration. Neither attorneys nor court reporters shall be allowed to he present at the mediation proceeding.
Mediators selected to participate in these proceedings shall have had experience as arbitrators. The parties shall mutually select a panel of four mediators in California and Oklahoma. The parties may add to this panel or make substitutions by mutual agreement. If the parties are unable to reach agreement with regard to any member of the initial panel, the parties shall ask the American Arbitration Association to provide them with a list of seven (7) arbitrators who are locally based in the California or Oklahoma areas, who are members of the National Academy of Arbitrators, and who have had mediation experience. From the list of seven (7), each party shall have the right to strike in order until there remains the number necessary to fill the panel. The party to strike first shall be determined by lot.
308
1
2
Mediators selected shall be available for hearings in a reasonable 3 period of time. The mediation sessions shall be held at a mutu-	4
ally agreed location, and each party shall bear one-half of the	5
fees and expenses of the mediator.	6

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
OFF-SITE ASSIGNMENT—TULSA
It is the intent of die Company to provide more senior employees, who have indicated a willingness to accept, the opportunity for off-site assignments, taking into consideration the needs of the division and the off-site location as well as customer requirements.
Without relinquishing its right to assign the employee(s) who the Company determines are qualified to perform the assignment, the Company will, when a number of employees in a classification in a department are determined by the Company to have essentially the same qualifications to perform the assignment, assign the most senior of such qualified employee(s) who has indicated a willingness to accept.
In the event that an off-site assignment is not made to the most senior employee in a classification in a department, who has indicated a willingness to accept such assignment, the Division Manager of Labor Relations will advise the Chairman of the Bargaining Committee of the reasons for the decision.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING JANITORIAL CLASSIFICATIONS
During the 1996 and 1999 negotiations, the parties discussed the issue of the excessive cost for janitorial service. The Company and the Union explored a number of actions that could reduce those costs. These discussions resulted in an agreement to create two additional lower paid janitor classifications, and to depopulate the pre-existing classification over time without adversely affecting incumbents or employees currently on layoff with recall rights to the pre-existing Janitor classification. To achieve this cost reduction, the parties agreed that the following actions will be effective as noted below:
1.	Re-title the pre-existing Janitor classification to “Janitor A” Job Code 5263, Labor Grade 2, and transfer into it all incumbent employees, effective June 25, 1996.
2.	This new Janitor A classification was placed in its own unique family group (998). The purpose of this action was to preclude downgrades to the Janitor A classification during seniority moves (except as identified in paragraph 6 below). The current pay and benefits of each employee were not affected and incumbents retained rights to auto progression and wage increases. Seniority rights to higher rated classifications were also retained by incumbent Janitors who were on downgrade upon transfer into the new Janitor A classification.
3.	Effective June 25, 1996, a new classification was established which is now titled “Janitor B” Job Code 5264, in Labor Grade SI, rate range $8.08 minimum to $14.00 maximum per hour, and in its own unique family group (999). Effective June 19, 1999 the 3 per cent General Wage Increase (GW1) and $.74 COLA fold-in will apply to the incumbent employees and to the rate range minimum and maximum. The new rate range, effective June 19, 1999, will be $9.06 to $15.16. The 3 per cent GWI of June 2001 will also be applied to the incumbents and the rate range minimum and maximum.

4.	Effective June 22, 1999 a second new classification Job Code 5265 “Janitor C” will be established in Labor Grade S2. The classification shall be placed in Family Group 999. New hires and preferential reinstatements on and after June 22, 1999 will be placed into the Janitor C classification. The rate range shall remain at $8.08 to $14.00 for the life of the Agreement. No employee in this classification can have a base hourly wage rate in excess of the maximum of the rate range ($14.00). Any employee who reaches the maximum of the rate range by automatic progressions or receiving a GWI will thereafter receive all future GWI’s, or portions thereof, generated under this Agreement in the form of an annual wage supplement (Lump Sum). The normal practice of folding COLA float and General Wage Increases into the individual hourly base rate and the minimum and maximum of the rate range will not apply. Future COLA payments will remain as a “float” above the hourly base rate.
5.	It is the intent of the parties to allow the Janitor A classification to depopulate through all forms of natural attrition, such as retirement, death, resignation, and all other types of employment termination, as well as reclassification to other jobs via seniority upgrade, post & bid, promotion, etc. Once an employee leaves the Janitor A classification, he or she will no longer have downgrade rights back to that classification; their rights will be limited to only that family group to which the employee was promoted, upgraded or recalled. Employees who are laid off from the Janitor A classification after the effective date of the new Master Agreement will continue to have recall rights back to that classification.
6.	Employees on layoff with seniority rights to the preexisting Janitor classification will have recall rights to the new Janitor A classification. Additionally, those current active employees at Santa Susana Field Laboratory (Local 1519) who currently have prior held rights to the Janitor classification will have downgrade rights to the new Janitor A classification on a one time only basis. Current employees on the active payroll in Local 887, Family Groups 43 through 47, will also be granted a one-time option to the new Janitor A classification on a one time only basis.
312

7.	In the event of a reduction in work force no Janitor A will	3
be placed on layoff as long as the L.G. S1 Janitor B or L.G.	4
S2 Janitor C classification is populated at the division in 5 which the reduction occurs. Employees laid off from the 6 L.G. SI Janitor B or L.G. S2 Janitor C classifications, and	7
who have only held that classification, will retain only re-	8
call rights to that classification.	9
10
8.	The parties agree that once the Janitor A classification is depopulated, it will be removed from the contract. No j3 other employees will have downgrade or recall rights to the j4 L.G. SI Janitor B or L.G. S2 Janitor C classifications.
9.	Employees in all three Janitor classifications will continue [7 to receive all annual wage supplements as negotiated by the parties.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING Thursday, June 17,1999
During the 1999 negotiations, the parties met and discussed issues concerning the Master Machinist classification at the Company’s Anaheim facility.
The parties have agreed that a Skills Demonstration Exercise would be jointly developed and administered to all incumbents. Those passing the exercise would remain in the Master Machinist classification, all others would return to the classification held immediately prior to the Master Machinist. Those employees who are returned to their prior held classification will not retain a seniority right to the Master Machinist, but may pursue seniority rights within their family group and in accordance with the provisions of Article XI. The pay for the returned employee is to be "red-circled” and they will receive any V&SL payments, general wage increase or lump sum bonus as if the reclassification did not occur, in accordance with the provisions of Article XVI, Section 8. The provisions of Article XVI, Section 8 will also apply to a “red-circled” employee who leaves their downgrade classification.
Incumbents that do not pass the skills demonstration exercise may repeat the skills demonstration exercise for the Master Machinist classification, but no more often than twice a year and provided that additional training has been acquired. Those “red-circled” employees who successfully pass the skills demonstration exercise will be placed in the Master Machinist classification no later than the second pay period following their successful completion of the exercise. The Company will provide those “red-circled” employees who do not pass the skills demonstration exercise a second time with a written summary of their individual skill areas needing improvement and suggestions for training. All future candidates for the Master Machinist classification will be required to pass the Skills Demonstration Exercise.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
GROW THE BUSINESS/ALTERNATE WORK SCHEDULE
The Company and the Union have a mutual interest in “Growing the Business” and both parties recognize that on occasion this can be best accomplished through an Alternate Work Schedule.
Growing the Business is defined as securing new work or increasing production requirements of existing business which would increase the plant, unit or department population, or maintain the plant unit or department population at its current level at the time of implementation. Alternate Work Schedule is defined as consisting of shifts of longer duration then those specified in the Collective Bargaining Agreement during work weeks of less than five full consecutive days, as set forth in the agreement for a total work week of 40 hours.
Any matter relating to Alternate Work Schedule will be subject to mutual agreement between the International Union, UAW, the National Aerospace Department, Region 5 UAW, the Bargaining Unit of the Local Union impacted and the Company. It is further understood that prior to implementation of the Alternate Work Schedule it must be ratified by the Local Union, Unit of the Local Union or Department within a Unit of the Local Union that is impacted by the change in schedule.
