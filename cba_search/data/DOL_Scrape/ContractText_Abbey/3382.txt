4.1	Definitions. Except as provided in Section 4.7 below, the following definitions shall apply for payment purposes:
a.	"Regular college year" shall mean Fall, Winter and Spring Quarters as defined in the District instructional calendar and shall exclude Summer Quarter.
b.	"Full-time faculty" are those who are assigned 100% of a full normal weekly workload in their discipline, division, or department for a minimum of eight (8) weeks, or for a shorter period when the assignment equals that of a full quarterly load, in a quarter during the regular college year. Faculty in this category are paid according to the full-time salary schedule except during Summer Quarter. Payment for Summer Quarter where such assignments are supplemental for full-time faculty shall be governed by Section 4.7 below. The salary schedule is set forth in Appendix A of this Agreement.
c.	"Part-time faculty" are those who do not meet the criteria for full-time faculty. Faculty in this category are paid in accordance with Appendix B or pro-rata part-time.
d.	"Pro-rata part-time faculty" are those who are assigned more than two-thirds (2/3) but less than 100% of the normal weekly workload of their discipline, division, or department for a minimum of eight (8) weeks in a quarter during the regular college year. Faculty in this category are paid according to the full-time salary schedule prorated at the percentage of a full-time load they are assigned, except during Summer Quarter. (For Summer Quarter, see Article 4.7.e.)
e.	"Lecturers" are faculty with outstanding knowledge or skills who may be hired for a limited, specialized purpose on either a full-time or part-time basis. This classification is intended to provide for unusual circumstances and to accommodate unique skills. Normally, the number of Lecturer appointments in any one year shall not exceed two percent (2%) of the total full-time faculty. Any such appointment that is full-time, however, shall be subject to the tenure provisions of statute and this Agreement.
4.2	Faculty Appointments. As provided by statute and as defined in Section 7.1 of this Agreement, full-time faculty shall be offered a tenured or probationary faculty appointment. Also, a full-time faculty non-tenure-track employment contract may be issued pursuant to the
5
terms described in Section 4.3 below. If applicable, a special faculty appointment as defined by RCW 28B.50.851 (2)(b) shall be issued.
Faculty in each of the categories of full-time appointments will be provided a written contract that will set forth the length of term of employment with the District, including whether the employment is tenured, probationary, special contract, or of specific duration as outlined in Section 4.3 below. The Employment Notice and Service Record Change (EN&SRC) or other similar document may be used thereafter to give notice of changed terms of a continuous tenured or probationary appointment.
4.3	Full-Time Non-Tenure-Track Faculty Appointments.
a.	Scope: There are two categories of full-time non-tenure track faculty appointments:
1.	Intermittent: Faculty may be appointed to intermittent full-time non-tenure track positions under the terms described in section 4.3d and 4.3e below. These appointments are meant to serve limited program needs including the following:
a.	Recurring program needs that do not constitute an ongoing full-time position.
b.	Unplanned-for program needs created by unexpected resignations, retirements, etc.
c.	New program needs when the success of the program is not predictable.
2.	Leave Replacement: Faculty may be appointed to replace a tenured faculty member on approved leave for the duration of the leave under the terms described in section e below. (See also 5.12)
This section does not pertain to faculty whose positions are nontenurable under RCW 28B.50.851 (2)(b).
b.	Contracts: All faculty hired or appointed to a full-time non-tenure track position will be given a contract specifying the terms and duration of their appointment before the end of the first week of their employment. Copies of these contracts will be forwarded to the SCCFT.
c.	Hiring: Full-time tenured faculty will have the opportunity to be significantly involved in the selection of faculty for Intermittent or Leave Replacement positions.
d.	Duration of Intermittent Appointments:
6
1.	One-quarter appointments: An individual may be given a one-quarter, full-time, non-tenure track appointment once during a regular college year.
2.	Two- or three-quarter appointments: An individual may be given a two- or three-quarter, full-time, non-tenure track faculty appointment during a regular college year. A one-quarter appointment as described above may also be extended to two or three consecutive quarters within the same regular college year. If a faculty member is given a two- or three-quarter appointment, the individual will not be rehired full-time except on a probationary appointment, i.e., tenure track, until two full regular college years have elapsed following the expiration of the year of the appointment.
e.	Extension of Non-Tenure Track Appointments: Faculty employed under either an intermittent or a leave replacement appointment who continue uninterrupted full-time service beyond the periods specified above will be given a probationary appointment, and the District will count for tenure track purposes only this most recent period of continuous full-time employment. If an individual is hired to a tenure-track position or inadvertently reappointed to a nontenure track position before the times indicated in section 4.3d above have elapsed, and the full-time service has not been continuous, he or she will be given a probationary appointment but the previous service will not be counted fortenure track purposes.
f.	Summer: Neither employment nor non-employment by faculty during Summer Quarter shall be considered in any way with respect to the provisions of this Article.
g.	Evaluation: Faculty on intermittent or leave replacement appointments will conduct anonymous student evaluations each quarter, the results of which will be submitted to their unit administrator. For appointments for more than one quarter, additional evaluation may begin during the first quarter. If a second quarter appointment was unanticipated, additional evaluations may commence at the beginning of the second quarter. Additional evaluation will include observation by the unit administrator. At the request of the unit administrator, a peer observation may also be conducted.
h.	Retroactivity: The provisions of this section will take effect Fall Quarter 1997 and will not be retroactive to Non-Tenure Track appointments made before that date, which will be governed by the provisions of the Agreement under which they were made.
4.4	Initial Placement. All new faculty will be evaluated for initial placement on their salary schedule within thirty (30) days of the
7
beginning of their faculty appointment. Permanent placement will be contingent upon submission of required records and documentary evidence within ninety (90) days of employment. Thereafter, any changes made in salary placement as the result of records or documentation submitted after the permanent evaluation will not be retroactive.
Initial salary schedule placement is set forth in Appendices A and B of this Agreement.
4.5	Movement on the Salary Schedule. Provisions for movement on the full-time salary schedule are set forth in Appendix A of this Agreement; provisions for movement on the part-time salary schedule are set forth in Appendix B of this Agreement.
4.6	Faculty Program Coordinators.
a.	Purpose: Faculty coordinators perform specific tasks for a particular administrative unit that are related to the maintenance of quality instruction and program integrity.
b.	Duties: The unit administrator, in consultation with the affected unit program faculty, will develop a written description of those tasks and related responsibilities for each faculty coordinator position in his/her unit. Each description will be distributed to faculty in the appropriate administrative unit before the faculty coordinator selection is made. A copy of the description will also be sent to the Vice President for Instruction and the SCCFT President. Faculty coordinators do not make administrative personnel decisions. e.g„ disciplining, hiring, or terminating. Also, the role of faculty coordinators does not include summative faculty evaluation.
The unit administrator should review the faculty coordinator job description annually in consultation with the affected unit program faculty, including the faculty coordinator. Nothing above shall preclude the faculty coordinator or any affected faculty member from requesting a job description review as the need may arise. Any adjustments made in the faculty coordinator job description affecting costs must be pre-approved by the Vice President for Instruction.
c.	Selection: Full-time faculty will have the opportunity to provide input to the unit administrator regarding the selection of faculty coordinators for their administrative unit. Part-time faculty may be selected as faculty coordinators. The unit administrator’s recommendation will be sent to the campus president (or designee) via the appropriate vice president for final selection.
8
Faculty coordinator appointments are made on an annual (or shorter-term) basis.
d.	Compensation:
1.	Reassigned time: The full-time student contact hour work load as defined in Article 11, Section 3, may be reduced, i.e., faculty may be reassigned to coordinator tasks, The percentage of reassigned time will be as follows:
Average number of hours per week Percent of reassigned time
10	25%
13	33%
20	50%
26	65%
30	75%
A percentage of reassigned time that falls between these amounts shall be calculated so as to be consistent with the calculation of these amounts.
2.	Stipends: The faculty coordinator and unit administrator can negotiate a higher stipend if the duties require more than 88 hours per quarter.
Average number of hours per quarter	Stipend
22	$550
44	$1,100
66	$1,650
88	$2,200
4.7	Summer School. Assignments will be based upon the following conditions: (Seattle Vocational Institute summer school is covered in Appendix G.1 and G.3 in the Agreement.)
a.	Length: Summer school will not exceed forty (40) instructional days in length.
b.	Appointments: Summer school appointments will depend upon enrollment and upon the judgment and decision of appropriate College administration. Low enrollments may result in the cancellation of courses or programs and the subsequent termination of the related faculty appointments. (For course cancellation criteria, see Section 11.6 below.)
c.	Assignments: Summer school assignments will be rotated equitably among all regularly contracted full-time faculty and
9
Priority Hire (PH) faculty members who wish assignments and who are qualified for positions available. So that all faculty within the division are aware of summer assignments, it will be the responsibility of the unit administrator to inform each eligible faculty member of the opportunities and potential arrangements. The method of rotating will be determined cooperatively between the unit administrator and faculty of the division. The unit administrator will work cooperatively with the faculty, if that division/department faculty wish to be involved, and other administrators in developing summer school programs.
d.	Full-time faculty with split assignments: Full-time faculty with split assignments in two (2) or more divisions/departments shall be eligible for rotation only in the division/department where they have the major portion of their workload.
e.	Summer school shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Appendix B.
ARTICLE 5	- FRINGE BENEFITS
This article defines the fringe benefits for which faculty are eligible as part of their employment with Seattle Community College District.
5.1	Definitions and Eligibility. Unless specifically stated to the contrary, for purposes of this Article the term "full-time" shall mean those faculty paid from the basic full-time salary schedule and who are employed on an annual contract. Full-time faculty are eligible for all fringe benefits.
"Part-time" shall mean all faculty not included as full-time. Part-time faculty are eligible for all benefits in this Article, unless stated otherwise.
5.2	Leave for Illness, Injury, Bereavement and Emergency This type of leave is intended to be used in those instances when faculty may find it necessary to be absent from assigned duties because of illness, emergency, bereavement, or injury. Whenever possible, faculty will furnish advance notice to the appropriate unit administrator of the necessity to take leave in this category. Such leaves are governed by the following provisions:
a.	Full-time faculty under contract for at least three (3) quarters will receive twelve (12) days leave commencing the first day upon which work is performed. Such leave entitlement may be accumulated after the first three-quarter period of employment at the rate of one (1) day for each calendar month. Such leave shall
10
be compensable for any month during which one (1) or more contractual days of service are performed including full- or part-time Summer Quarter assignments for full-time faculty; other days are non-compensable.
b.	Part-time faculty will be eligible to accrue and to take illness, injury, bereavement, and emergency leave on a pro-rated basis, to be calculated by the following formula:
1 day per month x % of assigned workload
Such leave will be effective Fall Quarter, 2003.
The part-time faculty member must work a minimum of one (1) quarter in four (4) quarters (excluding summer) to maintain previously accrued compensable and non-compensable leave under this section.
c.	In the event a faculty member is contracted to assume assignments for any quarter and becomes ill prior to commencing such assignment, such faculty member shall be eligible to use any accrued sick leave benefits, provided the illness is verified in writing with a statement from a health care provider. A "health care provider” is as defined by the federal and state family and medical leave laws.
d.	Such leave may be taken at any time subject to the following conditions and in compliance with the approval procedures set forth:
1.	The District reserves the right to request reasonable proof from a health care provider in the event of leaves for illness or injury which exceeds five (5) days.
2.	Bereavement leave, up to a maximum of five (5) days per bereavement, shall be granted in the event of a death in the faculty member's immediate family. Leave time to pay last respects to a very close deceased friend may be granted fora partial day without loss of pay.
3.	Emergency leave (not covered by Section 5.4 below) and not to exceed two (2) days per year, shall be granted in the event a faculty member must meet legal, personal or business obligations which unexpectedly arise and cannot be fulfilled outside of the normally posted schedule. Such leave shall exclude attendance at state legislative meetings, lobbying, Association or Union activities or business, fund raising, or
11
other activities of a political nature; leaves for the purpose of seeking prospective employment with another employer, and leaves for holiday or recreational purposes or for gainful employment or self-employment.
e.	Transferability
1.	Part-time faculty may transfer compensable sick leave balances from another Washington State public community and/or technical college, any state agency, and educational service district, or any other institution of higher education (as defined in RCW 28.b.10.016) when SCCD becomes the sole employer for their part-time employment. Part-time faculty must petition to transfer their sick leave balance anytime after the second consecutive quarter in which SCCD has been their sole employer.
2.	Part-time faculty hired into a full-time position with SCCD may petition to transfer their compensable sick leave balances from other institutions as defined in 5.2e above anytime following the day of full-time employment. Sick leave balances accrued from other Washington State institutions as defined above after the day of full-time employment cannot be transferred to SCCD.
3.	Compensable and non-compensable sick leave earned within the SCCD will be carried forward as earned for part-time faculty hired into a full-time position with SCCD. Upon change from part-time to full-time faculty status, accumulated noncompensable sick leave will be carried forward as noncompensable sick leave.
5.3	Attendance Incentive Program. In January of the year following any year in which a minimum of sixty (60) days of illness, injury, bereavement, and emergency leave is accrued in accordance with Section 5.2 above, any eligible employee upon written request may receive remuneration for unused illness, injury, bereavement, and emergency leave accumulated in the previous year at a rate equal to one day’s current monetary compensation of the employee for each four (4) full days of such accrued leave in excess of sixty (60) days.
At the time of retirement from state service or at death, an eligible employee shall receive remuneration at a rate equal to one (1) day's current monetary compensation of the employee for each four (4) full days of such accrued leave. Deposit of such monetary compensation into a VEBA (Voluntary Employee Benefit Association) trust account to be used for medical expenses has been authorized by the State Legislature
12
and the District's Board of Trustees. Procedures for administration of VEBA accounts will be addressed by the Agreement Management Committee.
Illness, injury, bereavement, and emergency leave for which compensation has been received shall be deducted from such accrued leave at the rate of four (4) days for each one (1) day’s pay.
Payments received for unused illness, injury, bereavement, and emergency leave shall not be included for the purpose of computing a retirement allowance under any public retirement system. Payment under this section shall be only for those days defined as “compensable” in Section 5.2 above.
For purposes of leave calculations and compensation in this section, accumulated illness, injury, bereavement, and emergency leave days taken will be first deducted from accumulated compensable days, and the sixty (60) day minimum accrual must be for compensable days.
Consistent with the law, eligibility requirements for retirement buyout of accrued compensable leave shall be as follows:
a.	30 years of full-time service, or
b.	60 years of age and 5 years service, or
c.	55 years of age and 20 years service.
5,4	Personal Leave. This leave is intended to be used for reasons of a personal nature; however, such leave shall not be used for holiday or recreational purposes or for gainful employment or self-employment. A faculty member should notify the unit administrator at the earliest possible time of intent to take personal leave (consistent with Article 6.8).
a.	Full-time faculty who have been employed for at least three (3) quarters will receive three (3) non-accumulative days per instructional year commencing the first day upon which work is performed.
b.	Part-time faculty will receive up to a maximum of one day prorated per academic quarter as their personal leave day. The percentage of assigned workload will be used to calculate prorated benefits for part-time faculty as defined in Article 5.2 above.
5.5	Jury Duty Leave. Leave of absence for jury duty, to serve as a witness at trials, or to exercise other civil duties, may be granted to faculty. In such cases a salary adjustment shall be made to deduct any amount
13
received for such civil duty, less expenses, from that faculty member's salary check so that there is neither a financial gain nor loss.
5.6	Government Service Leave. Leaves of absence will be granted to faculty for military purposes and for service in such federally sponsored organizations as the Peace Corps. Applicable benefits under this Agreement will accrue to leaves granted for such purposes, provided that the faculty granted such leave will indicate a desire to return to the College within ninety (90) days of his or her severance from the above service. The granting of such leave does not confer on part-time faculty a vested right to continued employment, nor to an expectation of such employment. PH faculty will not lose PH status by virtue of such leave, nor shall the taking of such leave be deemed an interruption in service for purposes of determining continued eligibility for placement on the PH list.
5.7	Accident Leave. In the case of accidents which occur to faculty during the working hours and/or while they are carrying out professional responsibilities, the District agrees to maintain maximum allowable coverage under current provisions of workmen's compensation legislation. The District further agrees to review each such accident case on an individual basis with the possibility of providing an uninterrupted salary for the faculty involved. The District shall provide necessary information and forms to the faculty who is filing a claim under the Workers' Compensation Act.
5,8	Parental and Family Leave.
a.	Faculty will be entitled to take a leave of absence without pay for childbirth or adoption for a reasonable length of time and subsequently return to their positions under the same uniform terms and conditions as any other employee. A reasonable period of leave in this context will be interpreted as a maximum of three (3) consecutive instructional quarters, excluding Summer quarter. An employee will not be required to leave work at the expiration of any arbitrary time period during pregnancy.
b.	Part-time faculty members on the PH list shall be eligible for parental leave in accordance with the conditions and in compliance as set forth in this section. Accordingly, the taking of parental leave in such cases shall not be deemed an interruption in service for purposes of determining continued eligibility for placement on the PH list.
c.	Part-time faculty members not on the PH list who have worked six quarters shall be eligible for leave as set forth in this section for a
14
period not to extend beyond the end of the quarter in which the leave is requested.
To be entitled to parental leave under this section, employees will inform their unit administrators one (1) quarter in advance of the intention to take parental leave and the estimated time of return to work.
Disabilities caused by or corollary to pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, childbirth, and recovery from the above, are temporary disabilities for work-related purposes and will be treated as such in conjunction with health insurance, disability insurance, and sick leave policies. Policies and practices involving matters such as extension of leave time, the accrual of such benefits and privileges such as seniority, retirement, pension rights, and payment under District health or sick leave plans will be applied to disability due to pregnancy or childbirth on the same terms and conditions as applied to other temporary disabilities.
Pursuant to the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, full-time faculty who have worked for the District during the twelve-month period preceding the request for leave and who are otherwise eligible under the Act shall be eligible for up to twelve (12) workweeks of non-paid leave for a serious personal illness, the birth or adoption of a child, or to care for a spouse, parent or child with a serious health condition as required by the Act. During leave taken under these provisions, the District shall continue to provide the faculty member with medical and dental benefits. Faculty will be reinstated to their positions and other benefits upon return from leave. Requests for Family Leave should be made through the unit administrator to the Human Resources department.
5,9	Leave of Absence Without Pay. Leave of absence without pay may be granted for all or part of an instructional year to tenured faculty. Previously accrued benefits will be retained in cases of such leave. Arrangements for this leave will be made through the unit administrator and the appropriate vice president to the campus vice chancellor/ president. Requests for such leave will be made a minimum of thirty (30) days before the quarter in which leave is to commence, if approved.
Faculty who meet eligibility requirements at the time when granted an official leave of absence without pay will retain membership in appropriate retirement programs; however, contributions to tax-deferred annuities will be suspended during such leave. Such faculty may retain medical/dental and life insurance benefits by paying applicable contributions in full. In such cases, faculty must submit an application and payment directly to the Health Care Authority. (The benefits office will supply the necessary forms
15
and instructions.) Long Term Disability insurance is excluded, although it can be reinstated when the employee returns to the active payroll. Seniority accumulated prior to the leave will be retained.
5.10	Professional Leaves. There shall be three (3) types of professional leave for tenured faculty: Sabbatical Leave, Retraining Leave, and Retum-to-lndustry Leave. Tenured faculty having completed three (3) or more years of full-time employment with the District (including, if applicable, full-time summer employment) shall be eligible for Sabbatical (Educational) Leave. Tenured faculty who cannot be effectively assigned because of program change, reduction, or termination may request funds for Retraining Leave. Tenured faculty who have completed three (3) or more years of full-time employment with the District (including, if applicable, full-time summer employment) shall be eligible for Retum-to-lndustry Leave.
Compensation for professional leave shall be based upon the length of the leave as follows:
Leave Length	% Compensation
1	quarter	100%
2	quarters	80%
3	quarters	60%
In any event, pursuant to applicable law the number of individual faculty members to be on leave in any year shall not exceed 4% of the total number of full-time equivalent faculty for any twelve month period.
The application of the above shall not result in reimbursement exceeding the average of the highest quartile of a rank order of salaries of all full-time teaching faculty holding academic year contracts.
Further provided, with respect to return-to-industry leave and consistent with the above restrictions, the Seattle Community College District will guarantee that the faculty member will suffer no loss in salary or fringe benefits (insurance and retirement contribution) during the period of leave in which the faculty member is gainfully employed in an approved industry.
Requests for Professional Leave will be submitted by the first Friday of December of Fall Quarter, through regular administrative channels to the appropriate instructional vice president. Such requests shall be evaluated by the Professional Leave Committee, which shall make recommendations to the appropriate campus vice chancellor/president. The final decision on awarding of professional leaves will be made by the
16
District Chancellor. Notification to those selected will be made fourteen calendar days prior to the end of Winter Quarter.
Upon approval of such leaves, contractual agreements will be executed between the District and the faculty specifying the length and conditions of the leave.
The applicant's plans for Professional Leave and the demonstrated resources and ability to carry them out will be major factors in evaluating requests for Professional Leave.
Up to three (3) consecutive quarters of Professional Leave may be granted to eligible faculty members. Recipients of Professional Leave must agree in writing to return to the District following completion of the leave and serve in their faculty appointments for a period commensurate with the amount of leave so granted. If the recipient fails to return as agreed, he or she will refund all pay received during the leave period. (Extensions may be mutually agreed upon by the District and the recipient.) The refund requirement of this paragraph, however, shall not apply to individuals whose positions have been eliminated in accordance with Article 8. Recipients of Professional Leave shall accrue full seniority and experience credit for salary movement for the period during which they are on leave.
With regard to Retraining Leave, the District agrees, within enrollment and fiscal limitations, to provide a suitable assignment to faculty when they return. In the event a suitable assignment cannot be made, the faculty will not be expected to repay salary paid to them during the leave.
The recipient of a Professional Leave may request additional leave without pay beyond the professional leave period. Approval for any additional leave period must be obtained at least one (1) quarter prior to the scheduled return from the appropriate unit administrator, vice president, and the campus vice chancellor/president. The campus vice chancellor/president will stipulate the terms upon which additional leave may be granted.
Recipients of Professional Leave will submit a written report and/or evaluation concerning their Professional Leave activities to the Professional Leave Committee and the appropriate unit administrator within one (1) quarter after returning from such leave. One (1) copy of this report will be forwarded by the Committee to each campus library for cataloging and circulation. Recipients failing to file such report, acceptable to the Committee on the basis of its consistency with the recipient's proposal, within the stipulated period, shall refund fifty percent (50%) of the pay received to the District. Such refunded monies shall be made available for other Professional Leaves.
17
An individual awarded Professional Leave will network in the District during the period of leave.
5.11	Replacements for Personnel on Leave. Depending on the length of faculty leave, it may be necessary to hire either a substitute for periods of less than 20% of the course contact hours, or a replacement for a period beyond 20% of the course contact hours (for period of thirty (30) days or more). In either case, new faculty shall be informed of the estimated length of their assignments and the employment category (part-time, full-time probationary faculty appointment, full-time special faculty appointment, or full-time non-tenure track as per Section 4.3).
5.12	Status Upon Return From Leave. When a leave recipient returns to the District (excluding individuals whose positions have been eliminated in accordance with Article 8), he or she shall be placed at the same or similar position on the salary schedule at a salary no less than the one received prior to the beginning of the leave. In all cases involving leave with pay, seniority shall have accumulated during the time of leave.
5.13	Insurance Programs. The District agrees to make available group medical, dental, life, and other appropriate insurance programs consistent with the rules and regulations of the Public Employees Benefits Board or its successor(s) and as funded by the Legislature. [Determination of benefit eligibility is based on quarterly workload. Part-time faculty are eligible for Life/AD&D, Medical/Dental Insurance, Basic Long Term Disability Insurance, and Optional Long Term Disability Insurance benefits if they are employed at fifty percent (50%) of a full-time load or more and are rehired in the second quarter at fifty percent (50%) or more of a full-time load. In such cases, eligibility begins in the second quarter. Once enrolled, the faculty member is eligible to continue the insurance, but does not receive the employer's contribution in any quarter in which the faculty member does not work at least haff of a full-time load. However, such continuation may not be for longer than four (4) consecutive quarters in which a faculty member does not work at least half of a full-time load for one (1) quarter.
For purposes of the preceding paragraph, simultaneous employment as a part-time faculty member at other Washington State public institutions of higher education shall county towards the fifty percent (50%) eligibility criteria. The part-time faculty member shall be required to notify the District Benefits Office of such employment.
5.14	Parking. Parking fees shall be assessed in accordance with the fee
18
schedule adopted and approved by the Board of Trustees. Should capital improvements or Transportation Management Program (TMP) requirements necessitate an increase in parking fees, the SCCFT shall be involved in a committee composed of all constituencies for the purpose of reviewing the fee structure prior to final adoption by the Board. Full-time faculty and PH faculty members who are scheduled to work at or above 50% of a full-time load may pay for annual parking permits through payroll deductions.
5.15	Retirement Program Options. The District shall make available retirement options as provided by statute and will make contributions to Tl AA/CREF at the appropriate rate; WSTRS will be funded by the State at rates established under separate allotments to that system.
5.16	Special Retirement Privileges.
a.	Full and part-time faculty members meeting the following criteria shall be eligible for special privileges upon retirement from SCCD: 1) 25 years of service as a district faculty member, or 2) 15 years of service and having reached age 60.
b.	Special privileges shall include the following:
1.	special identification card;
2.	library privileges;
3.	attendance at graduation, with special recognition for emeritus faculty;
4.	free parking while participating in college events, if space is available;
5.	use of facilities on request and space available basis;
6.	half-price admission for designated college activities;
7.	internet connection/account, if available through the District's internet service provider at no additional cost to the District, with the faculty member being responsible for arranging and handling all account issues, including costs;
8.	enrollment in classes at senior citizen tuition rate and conditions;
9.	access to PE facilities at 50% of regular faculty rate.
ARTICLE 6 - PERSONNEL POLICIES
6.	1 Personnel Files. Only one (1) personnel file for each faculty member shall be maintained by the District, and that file shall be located at the District headquarters. No other personnel file shall be maintained by any officer or administrator of the District. This paragraph, however, shall not preclude the maintenance of all lawful
19
payroll records by the business office nor maintenance of other essential records by appropriate personnel for the operation of the District.
Only the Human Resource office staff, the individual faculty member, the immediate unit administrator, the appropriate vice president, the campus vice chancellor/president, and the District Chancellor shall have access to the file. All parties having access to the file shall exercise great care to protect the confidentiality of materials in the file. Faculty may review the contents of their own personnel file by appointment with the District Human Resources office. Upon the faculty member's request, a representative of the SCCFT may be present when the file is being reviewed.
Information may be placed in the personnel file only after a copy has been provided to the faculty member and only after opportunity of at least one (1) week has been provided to sign and date the material and to attach any written response or other documents to it. The faculty member's signature shall be deemed only an acknowledgment that he or she has seen the material and has been provided such opportunity to respond. The signature shall not signify that the faculty member necessarily agrees with the content of the material. Placement of information in the personnel file must be timely.
Except in extraordinary, emergency situations, no action may be taken against a faculty member unless such action is based on materials that have been placed properly in the personnel file.
Faculty shall be given a copy of any employment notice (EN&SRC) affecting their employment status.
At any time upon mutual agreement between the District and the faculty member, any document will be removed immediately from the District personnel file.
6.	2 Complaints. Faculty members will be notified by the District in writing within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt at any administrative level of any substantive complaint from any source regarding their performance. If the administrative level is not that of the faculty member's unit administrator, simultaneous written notification shall be made to that administrator. Following such notification, the unit administrator shall schedule a timely meeting with the faculty member to discuss the complaint informally and, if possible, to resolve it. Such meeting shall normally take place during the faculty member's assignment period.
If disciplinary action is deemed appropriate by the unit administrator, he or she shall proceed in accordance with Section 6.3 below, provided, however, that any documents associated with the discipline
20
shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.1 above regarding personnel files.
No complaint shall result in disciplinary action unless the complaint is reduced to writing, signed, and dated by the complainant.
Nothing in this section shall be construed as taking the place of normal evaluation procedures as set forth below, nor as taking the place of dismissal procedures as set forth in Article 8 of this Agreement. Nor shall this section be deemed to provide the only basis for discipline.
The faculty member shall have the right to SCCFT representation in implementation of this section.
6.	3 Discipline. Discipline shall be only for just cause and shall be progressive as applied to the specific facts of the case involved. Disciplinary documents and all materials upon which discipline is based shall be treated in accordance with Section 6.1 above. The faculty member shall have the right to SCCFT representation in any disciplinary proceeding, including investigatory interviews with the employee.
6.	4 Health and Safety. The District in cooperation with the SCCFT shall provide a safe and healthful environment in compliance with applicable federal and state laws as well as related District policy. The District and the SCCFT will promote a positive climate for ensuring such compliance.
a.	The District agrees that no faculty member should work, or be directed to work, in a manner or condition that does not at least comply with minimum accepted safety practices or standards as established by applicable law.
A faculty member who has reason to believe that an unsafe working condition exists may report the condition, in writing to the unit administrator and/or an appropriate supervisor. Upon receipt of the written report, the administrator shall investigate and provide a written response to the faculty member within three business days. The written response will indicate whether or not an unsafe working condition exists and, if so, the proposed remedy.
b.	The District agrees to create and maintain College Safety committees in accordance with applicable law. The committees shall have access to information about health and safety complaints and shall have the ability to investigate and evaluate such complaints.
In accordance with applicable law, the District will provide the safety
21
committees and the SCCFT with timely notification of any College or District-wide decisions that have a potential impact on safe working conditions.
c.	The District will, within budgetary considerations, provide proper desks, chairs, and other equipment to maintain ergonomically appropriate faculty office spaces. Training will be offered in the proper use of equipment.
6.	5 Selection of Faculty. Full-time tenured faculty will have the opportunity to be significantly involved in the selection of new full-time faculty, and except in cases of emergency, part-time faculty employed in the regular programs, in their appropriate disciplines or teaching area.
a.	Full-time tenured faculty will have the opportunity to be significantly involved in the development of the advertised job description qualifications. Except under unusual circumstances, a new full-time faculty position shall be advertised for at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the date the position is to be filled. Only the campus vice chancellor/president or the District Chancellor may, after consultation with the SCCFT President, waive this requirement.
b.	College administrators, with the assistance of the District Human Resources Office, shall arrange a review of the applicants' qualifications, credentials and other pertinent materials by a candidate selection committee comprised of three (3) faculty (selected by the tenured faculty of the division) and the unit administrator. The appropriate affirmative action officer will be an ex-officio member of the candidate selection committee. Interviews of at least five (5) qualified applicants will be held by the candidate selection committee. The committee may interview fewer than five (5) applicants if acceptable to the appropriate vice president. If the committee cannot interview at least five (5) applicants and the vice-president does not concur with the number of applicants the committee has selected to interview, the position will be re-advertised for at least thirty (30) days unless a shorter period of time is mutually agreed to between the committee and the appropriate vice president. Additionally, qualified candidates who are on the part-time priority-hiring list of the appropriate campus unit and who apply for the position will be interviewed.
c.	Based on the candidate selection committee's review of the applicants’ qualifications and interviews, the committee will recommend three (3) candidates but may recommend additional candidates. If the committee cannot recommend three (3) candidates and the vice president does not concur with a
22
recommendation of at least two (2), the position will be readvertised for at least thirty (30) days unless a shorter period of time is mutually agreed to between the committee and the appropriate vice president. The candidateswill be recommended by the candidate selection committee via the unit administrator to the appropriate vice president who shall forward his or her recommendations and those submitted by the committee to the campus vice chancellor/president for the final selection.
d.	If the campus vice chancellor/president does not select any of the recommended candidates, he or she shall meet with the appropriate faculty for discussion of the matter and review of selection criteria, after which the selection process will be repeated.
e.	Current tenured full-time faculty shall have first priority for new or vacant full-time faculty positions occurring within the District, Such vacancies or new positions will be publicized within the District for thirty (30) days. If, within that thirty (30) day period, any current faculty applies for the position and is determined by the selection committee to be qualified, that person will be appointed. When two (2) or more current faculty are qualified, the most senior will be selected. If a faculty member applies after that thirty (30) day period then that person will be considered on the same basis as other applicants. Nothing herein shall be construed to restrict opportunities for full-time faculty from teaching part-time assignments in excess of a full load. Consistent with budgetary and fiscal restraints, every effort shall be made to continue part-time employment opportunities for full-time faculty.
f.	Nothing herein shall preclude any division/department which wishes to do so from developing a list of qualified available candidates to be considered for quarterly positions or on an as-needed basis as part-time faculty.

6,9	Academic Freedom and Faculty Rights.
a.	A Statement of Academic Freedom and Faculty Rights
This institution is based on the illimitable freedom of the human mind. Here, we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate error so long as reason is left free to combat it.
To achieve this end, academic freedom is viewed as the freedom of speech guaranteed to all citizens by the First Amendment. Free inquiry and free discourse shall not be abridged, whether directly or indirectly, by statute or community pressure.
We reaffirm our support of academic freedom because of a sense of obligation to the community which needs our services and because of our professional responsibility for free inquiry.
Academic freedom implies not only the unconditional freedom of discussion in the classroom, but also the absence of restriction upon the faculty's teaching method. Every faculty is presumed competent and responsible until specific evidence is brought forward to the contrary. No suspicion concerning either the judgment or the goodwill of the faculty should find any place in our administrative regulations or customary procedures.
b.	Academic Freedoms and Faculty Rights
1.	Classroom Freedom: No restraints other than those required by the nature of the curriculum shall be placed on academic
25
employees regarding the content of their teaching or conduct of their classes.
2.	Library Collection: There shall be no censorship of library collections.
3.	Constitutional Freedom: Academic employees' rights as citizens shall not be diminished or alienated as a condition of employment or retention.
4.	Freedom of Association: No academic employee shall be required to join or refrain from joining any organization as a condition of employment or retention.
5.	Freedom of Petition and Silence: Individual academic employees and organizations shall not be denied the right to state or refuse to state their views before any legislative, administrative or faculty body.
6.	Right to Organize: There shall be no abridgement of the right to organize with others to protect group interests, or to join existing unions or other organizations for such purposes.
7.	Additional Rights: Additional rights of faculty concerning tenure, a grievance procedure, and personnel records are described in detail in the basic sections of this Agreement.
6.10	Evaluation of Faculty and Programs.

2.	Administrative Evaluation: Once every three years there will be an administrative evaluation of each faculty member’s professional obligations, as well as these related matters as appropriate: provision of course information, maintenance of office hours, conducting student evaluations, and involvement in division activities. The Vice President for Instruction or his/her designee will review concerns from either the faculty member or the unit administrator about the outcome of the evaluation process.

The performance review committee will review and evaluate the faculty member’s performance, using a variety of means for assessment, which may include student evaluation and classroom observation. As required, the committee will recommend methods for improvement and for monitoring the process and correction of the faculty member's performance. The committee will provide the vice president with quarterly reports on the progress of the review and will submit a final report not later than one year from the start of the review process. This report will indicate either satisfactory completion of the process, a need for extension, or a finding of no resolution.
To select two faculty members for the review committee, the faculty member and the unit administrator shall each prepare a list of three names, from which the two committee members shall be selected by mutual agreement. If no agreement is reached, the college vice president for the SCCFT and the appropriate vice president will each choose one member from the two lists.

The criteria must be reviewed and discussed by the tenure review committee and may be revised to fit the needs of an individual probationer by the agreement of the committee.
b.	The tenure review committee will be responsible for furnishing the probationer with appropriate performance criteria and objectives in written form, to include the methods of performance evaluation to be used.

Observed areas needing improvement should be put in writing and discussed in conference as soon as possible. A professional improvement plan intended to address these areas must be developed and reviewed by the committee.

d.	Upon formal recommendation of the review committee and with the written consent of the probationary faculty member, the appointing authority may extend its probationary period for one, two, or three quarters, excluding Summer Quarter, beyond the maximum probationary period established herein. No such extension shall be made, however, unless the review committee's recommendation is based on its belief that the probationary faculty member needs additional time to complete satisfactorily a professional improvement plan already in progress and in the committee's further belief that the probationary faculty member will complete the plan satisfactorily. At the conclusion of any such extension, the appointing authority may award tenure unless the probationary faculty member has, in the judgment of the committee, failed to complete the professional improvement plan satisfactorily.
e.	Copies of all tenure review committee reports and recommendations for any probationary year will be furnished to the probationer in a timely fashion (see 7.4 above) and also forwarded to the campus president via the appropriate vice-president through regular administrative channels. In addition, the Tenure Review Committee's recommendations for such probationary year will be discussed in conference with the probationer and the basis for the Committee's recommendation explained to the probationer.

Consistent with the Affirmative Action Plan of the District, part-time faculty who have been employed at an average of 50% time or more for nine (9) of the last twelve (12) quarters (excluding Summer Quarter), and who have received satisfactory evaluations which will include student and administrative evaluations and may include peer observations, shall be placed upon a department/division priority employment list. Evaluation guidelines have been developed by the Agreement Management Committee (see Letter of Understanding, P. 108).
b.	Such priority shall be consistent with previous percentage workload assignments up to and including 2/3 load and shall provide a right of first refusal for any divisional/departmental assignments on their qualifying list with the exception of Summer Quarter assignments or assignments required to maintain a fullload for full-time faculty. This consistent workload assignment is guaranteed for the following quarter (except Summer Quarter) unless the PH faculty member is notified in writing no later than 30 calendar days prior to the end of the current quarter (except Fall Quarter, for which the faculty will be notified by the last day of Summer Quarter). In order to maintain a guaranteed load, the unit administrator may assign the PH faculty member, if qualified, courses not on his/her qualifying list and/or non-teaching duties.
The qualifying list shall include courses taught within the twelve (12) quarter qualifying period and can be modified as follows: any course taught two times subsequent to establishment of the original qualifying list may be added to the list by the unit administrator; courses may be deleted from the list by review with the unit administrator based on evaluations. Faculty in this category may be offered a course not on their qualifying list without that course being automatically added to their list. PH faculty will be informed about the division/department scheduling process and may provide input to that process. In the event that priority claims within a division exceed assignments available within that division, the priority shall be based upon the total contact hours taught within the division; the individual with the highest number having the greatest priority.
c.	The establishment of a priority-hiring list does not confer on part-time faculty a vested right to continued employment or to renewal
40
of employment, nor to an expectation of such employment. However, in the event the District elects to hire part-time faculty in any given quarter, a part-time faculty member on such a list shall have the right of first refusal to carry out assignments for which he or she qualifies under this section.
d.	1. Part-time faculty may be removed from the priority list in the event of unsatisfactory evaluation. Removal shall be initiated by a letter from the appropriate vice president to the faculty member informing him or her of unsatisfactory performance. This letter shall detail the reason or reasons and shall set the time and date for an informal meeting between the affected individual, the unit administrator, and the vice president. This meeting shall be held within ten (10) working days of receipt of the above-referenced letter. The part-time faculty member will be given the opportunity at this meeting to present oral and written materials and to discuss in detail the question of performance.
2.	The vice president shall issue in writing his or her decision to the affected member within ten (10) working days of the meeting. The affected part-time faculty member shall be deemed to have accepted this decision unless written notice of appeal is received by the applicable campus vice-chancellor/president within ten (10) working days from receipt of the vice president's decision.
3.	The vice chancellor/president shall set the date for an informal hearing within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of the appeal. The vice chancellor/president shall conduct such informal hearing in accordance with the provisions of RCW 34.05 as now or hereafter amended. At this hearing both the affected part-time faculty member and the vice president or designee shall be given opportunity to present oral and written materials regarding the part-time faculty member's performance. The vice chancellor/president’s decision, which is final for all purposes and is not grievable nor arbitrable, shall be issued within ten (10) working days of completion of the hearing process. The effective date of removal from the part-time hiring employment list shall be eleven (11) working days after receipt of the vice president’s decision or upon the vice chancellor/president’s decision if appealed to the vice chancellor/president.
e.	Individuals who have not taught for four (4) continuous quarters (excluding summer) or have given notice of resignation shall be dropped from the part-time priority hiring list and accumulated hours will be forfeited. It will be necessary to re-establish eligibility by meeting the 50% average assignment for nine (9) of the next
41
twelve (12) quarters and with satisfactory evaluations as in 10.7a. (See 10.7b on previous page.)
The District shall update and publish the priority hiring list quarterly for each division and department and for counseling and the library. Copies of such lists shall be forwarded to the SCCFT President.
10.8	Anonymous Student Evaluations. Part-time faculty not on the priority hiring list provided for in Section 10.7 above shall conduct anonymous student evaluations each quarter and shall provide the results to the unit administrator. Part-time faculty on the priority-hiring list will conduct quarterly student evaluations. One anonymous evaluation each year will be supervised by the administration and the results given to the Unit Administrator as well as the faculty member.
10.9	Availability for Student Consultation. Part-time faculty members shall be expected to be available for student consultation (on an appointment basis) in addition to classroom contact hours.
ARTICLE 11	- OPERATIONAL POLICIES
11.1	Instructional Year
a.	There will be 171 work days in the contract work year for 2003-04 and 172 work days beginning Fall quarter, 2004-05, including 165 instructional days (or their equivalent).
b.	The 165 instructional days (or their equivalent) shall be scheduled in accordance with the instructional year calendar (Appendix C).
c.	The non-instructional days will consist of work as follows:
1.	One such day, shall be used at the discretion of the District chancellor.
2.	Utilization of three of these days will be determined by the unit administrator in conjunction with the unit faculty. Such work might include (on either a group or individual basis) course and curriculum development, laboratory maintenance, routine preventive shop maintenance, review and/or preparation of audio-visual instructional aids, etc.
3.	Faculty will work with their unit administrator, and document upon request, the use of two additional non-instructional days during the 2003-04 contract year, and an additional third non-
42
instructional day beginning Fall quarter, 2004 for activities such as: curriculum and textbook review; writing recommendations; graduation attendance; student-group advising; school, community, industry liaison; program review; Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) meetings; review and/or preparation of audio-visual aids; technology upgrades; professional development activities; web development and maintenance; community building; email maintenance; meeting preparation; and other tasks.
d.	Counselor and librarian assignments may include workdays that are outside the normal instructional year calendar provided such assignments are between the second Monday of September and through Friday of the week following the last day of instruction for Spring Quarter. Such assignments will be made on an equitable rotation basis among the qualified individuals and in such instances compensatory time off shall be at a time convenient to the individual.
Assignments outside the period described above shall require concurrence of the individual faculty member. Such assignments shall be paid on a prorata basis unless there is mutual agreement between the unit administrator and the individual regarding compensatory time during the regular instructional year.
e.	Individual negotiations shall take place between administrator and counselor prior to change of assignment from day to night duties or one campus to another involving more than 1/4 time.
f.	Upon mutual agreement between the individual and the unit administrator, full-time tenured faculty members may substitute Summer Quarter for a customary Fall, Winter, or Spring Quarter. In such instances, employment will be guaranteed for the Summer Quarter regardless of enrollment. Pay for such purposes shall be based upon the applicable rate during the quarter for which Summer is being substituted.
11.2	Instructional Day. Without prior approval of the faculty, no faculty can be assigned contact hours to exceed a contiguous period (span) of seven (7) hours, including meal and travel times.
The daily assignment span may be increased where it can be satisfactorily demonstrated to the parties to this Agreement that the extension of the limit is beyond the control of the administration.
"Satisfactorily demonstrated” shall mean that courses necessary to maintain a full load are not available within the span, and that mutual agreement has not been reached regarding alternate non-instructional
43
assignments or annualization, provided that the quarterly load was determined according to Section 11.3 below.
Nothing in this section is to be construed that: (a) the teaching span must be seven (7) hours in length, or (b) faculty are expected to be on campus for this entire span if their professional duties require their presence elsewhere.
11.3	Weekly Workload. Based on, but not limited to, individual faculty capabilities, considerations of student needs, facilities, budget, state guidelines and long-range plans, the unit administrator, in conjunction with the unit faculty who choose to be involved, shall cooperatively develop schedules of student load, class size, and all other matters relevant to classroom instruction.
The weekly workload shall consist of assignment of student contact hours for each faculty. With the concurrence of the individual faculty, maximum weekly contact hours may be averaged on an annual basis. Maximum weekly contact hours are not to be construed as a required total hourly assignment. In order to provide an equitable basis among various disciplines of the College, the following limits are established:
a.
Type of Instruction
General Lecture (except no faculty shall be assigned more than three (3) composition classes within the 15-hour workload). This includes instruction in ESL classes numbered 090 and higher.
Contact Hours 15
b.	Laboratories:
1.	Science, physical education, art, music and 15-18 (a) drama
2.	Business and Commerce, Health/Medical, 18-20 Home and Family Education, mixed lecture and lab

c.	Trade and Industrial occupation and shops 25(b)
d.	Special Programs (eg., ABE & ESL; this 20
excludes ESL classes numbered 090 and higher.
See a. above)
e.	Clinical Assignments	25-30
f.	Counselors, Librarians, Catalogers and non- 30
teaching personnel
44
Notes:
(a)	Any combination not to exceed eighteen (18), provided, however, not more than twelve (12) lecture credits may be assigned without the concurrence of the faculty member.
(b)	Vocational faculty in block instructional programs shall receive a minimum of a 15-minute break per day which is a part of the twenty-five (25) contact hour load.
11.4	Office Hours. In addition to the contact hours mentioned above, full-time faculty in the general lecture category shall average five (5) office hours per week at a time convenient to the faculty and the students. Faculty with contact load assignments of more than fifteen (15) but less than twenty (20) hours per week shall maintain an average number of office hours which is the difference between their teaching workload assignments and twenty (20). Faculty with twenty (20) and more contact hour assignments may consider their office hours as included in their teaching load.
These hours must be posted by each faculty member's office, convenient for student viewing.
11.5	Travel Reimbursement. Faculty who, in the course of carrying out their assigned obligations to the District, must travel from their principal location are first urged to make use of any available College-owned vehicles for such travel. If such use is neither practical nor possible, faculty may use their private automobile and will be reimbursed at the statutory rate per mile from the site of primary work assignment. Reimbursement shall include round-trip costs if the assignment requires faculty to return to their usual work place on the same day, or it may include additional one-way mileage which is required to fulfill duties at a secondary location.
11.6	Course Cancellation.
a. The following factors will be considered in determining whether classes in certificate or degree programs will be canceled. It shall be the responsibility of the administration to evaluate these general factors in arriving at a class cancellation decision.
♦	Established state student/faculty ratios
•	Status of FTE generation on a campus-wide basis for certificate/degree programs
♦	Status of FTE generation on a district-wide basis for certificate/degree programs
•	Status of assigned FTE, district-wide, annualized (including projections of applicable, e.g., Fall, Winter)
45
♦	Effect on morale of students and faculty
•	Budgetary implications
•	Feasibility of offering new sections of already-filled or nearly-filled courses
b.	In applying the above, additional evaluation shall be given to ensure:
1.	That strong consideration be given to the continuation of
a.	required courses,
b.	sequential courses, and
c.	infrequently offered courses.
2.	That a balanced, in-depth, convenient schedule of offerings be maintained to the extent possible.
3.	That full-time faculty whose classes are canceled will be reassigned to another class to make up that portion of their contractual load. Alternate non-instructional duties may be assigned upon mutual agreement between the faculty member and the unit administrator.
4.	That classes taught by part-time faculty and extra classes taught by contract faculty (those classes taught in addition to an assigned workload/contract assigned workload) which are canceled shall result in no remuneration or pay or assignment to the faculty whose class is canceled other than for those class hours met prior to cancellation (except as provided in Article 10.4).
5.	That the earliest possible communication with affected faculty is made relative to the potential or actual need to cancel a class.
c.	Following judicious analysis and consideration of the above factors and the recommendations made by faculty through their administrative unit, the administration will determine which classes will be canceled.
ARTICLE 12	- POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
12.1	General. The Board subscribes to the concept that those affected by Board policies will have a voice in the development of policies. Accordingly, the District agrees that faculty will serve in a nonvoting capacity on the Board of Trustees. One faculty representative will be elected by the faculty and will serve for a minimum of one year,
46
receiving salary credits at the same rate as for joint committees. The faculty representative will be eligible to attend all meetings of the Board except when the Board determines that private discussion on a sensitive matter is desirable.

g.	Committee minutes, recommendations and reports of District-wide joint committees will be sent to the District chancellor and the SCCFT concurrently. The District chancellor shall report to the committee the disposition of any recommendation.
Minutes of campus joint committee meetings shall be forwarded to the appropriate campus SCCFT Senate President.
12.3	Budget Development.
a.	Budgeting will include the participation of all budgetary units and all appropriate members of the College community. Budgeting process guidelines will be based upon generally accepted College and University Budgeting/Accounting Principles and not in conflict with Office of Financial Management and State Board for Community College Education requirements.
b.	The District chancellor will provide for an annual meeting with members of the College community to present the annual initial budget prior to its submission to the Board of Trustees. As soon as the working budget for all campuses and the District Office is approved by the District chancellor's cabinet, it will be transmitted to the SCCFT.
The Chancellor's Cabinet shall meet at least quarterly with the SCCFT president, the campus SCCFT Senate Presidents and the SCCFT vice president for part-time faculty to review District budgetary matters. Opportunity for timely input regarding major District budgetary matters shall be provided prior to determination.
c.	The SCCFT will be provided with a copy of the approved initial annual budget.

12.4	Performing Arts. The District will continue to fund a performing arts allocation for each year of this agreement at the level of $5,000 for each campus.
12.5	Hold Harmless Clause. The Board agrees that any participation by the faculty in policy formulations, budget development, budget execution, hiring and tenure granting, and removal is purely advisory and therefore will hold the faculty individually and collectively harmless from any criticism, litigation or loss of previous compensation alleging misfeasance or malfeasance.
ARTICLE 13	- CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT
The purpose of this Article is to provide the funds and procedures necessary to implement curriculum development grants in the District.
13.1	Curriculum Approval/Review Process. Newly developed and adapted courses will go through the campus curriculum approval process. For credit-bearing courses meeting degree requirements, the process shall include input from campus program unit faculty and appropriate administrators, in consultation with appropriate advisory groups. Academic, accreditation, statutory, licensure, and specific contractual requirements and the need for continuity and coordination of course content within and between departments of the college shall be factors of consideration in such determination and development.
13.2	Curriculum Projects. It is the expressed intent of the Board and the SCCFT to involve a maximum number of faculty in the planning and development of innovative and exemplary programs, techniques, and materials, especially as they relate to the improvement of instruction. Accordingly, the District shall budget an amount of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) for each instructional year of this Agreement to be used for faculty-initiated curriculum projects. In addition, the District shall budget an amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each instructional year of this Agreement to be used for curriculum projects initiated by part-time faculty and for part-time-faculty professional development. Such funds shall be administered by the Curriculum Grants Committee.
13.3	Award of Curriculum Grants. The Curriculum Grants Committee will establish procedures for awarding curriculum grants. The committee will also review, judge, and make recommendations for awards to the District chancellor or the chancellor's designee. Final approval and award of curriculum grants will be made by the District chancellor. Notification will be made by the end of Spring Quarter.
49
Upon approval of each project, a contractual agreement will be executed between the District and participating faculty. The contract will provide for a return of funds or a withholding of funds if the project is not finished by the completion date; however, if a project cannot be completed because of extenuating circumstances, an appeal may be made to the appropriate committee. Recommendations of the committee will be forwarded to the District chancellor for appropriate action.
Curriculum development funds may be used only for allocations to faculty and to cover associated supportive personnel and supply costs. Monies not expended by June 30 of each year will remain in the Curriculum Development Fund.
13.4	Ownership of Instructional Materials.

The District and individual faculty shall negotiate a development contract describing compensation and ownership conditions before development work begins. The right to retain, release, sell, lease, copyright, or loan the material for other purposes is subject to negotiation between the District and the faculty which will result in an individual written agreement prior to use. Instructional material not created under grants, stipends, or other District funds nor with the use of institutional resources such as staff support or specialized equipment or software (this does not include faculty office computers) from the District and/or College by faculty for courses offered in the District remain the property of the faculty. This section is subject to applicable statutes as now or hereafter amended.
ARTICLE 14	■■ PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
The Board and the SCCFT are dedicated to the maintenance and improvement of a comprehensive community college as defined by the State of Washington's Community College Act enacted in 1967 and as thereafter amended. Essential to this end is the development of a competent, student-oriented, secure and dedicated faculty who are uniquely qualified to meet the challenge of the Seattle metropolitan area. Accordingly, the following provisions regarding professional development are established.
14.1	Faculty Education Programs and In-Service Education. In order to provide an improved educational environment in the District, faculty both individually and collectively are encouraged to participate in on-going

51
documentation of completion are transcripts, grade sheets, receipts, dated program notes or agenda, lecture notes, salary/wage statements for employment, certificates of completion, annotated bibliography of publications, etc.
Approval of documentation and completion of the Professional and Educational Development Report Form with the attached documentation of completion must be obtained from the appropriate unit administrator. If approval is granted, the unit administrator will sign, date, and transmit such documents to the District Human Resources office for recording with a copy to the faculty member. Any advancement on the salary schedule caused by this action will be effective as provided in Appendix A of this Agreement. If approval is not granted by the unit administrator, appeal of the decision may be made to the appropriate vice president. The final decision will be made by the vice president. If the vice president grants approval and there are enough credits (banked and newly documented) for a step movement, the new step shall be effective as of July 1 of the following year. Approval of the Professional and Educational Development Report Form and the computation of the salary credits documented on this form shall be assumed if the faculty member is not informed otherwise by the appropriate unit administrator by September 1.
The standards for computing salary credits as addressed in this section are set forth in Appendix A.

ARTICLE 15	- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
15.1	Purpose of Procedure and Definition of Grievance. It is the declared objective of the Board and the SCCFT to encourage the prompt resolution of all grievances. Accordingly, the following grievance procedure is established to provide an orderly and expeditious procedure for this resolution.
A grievance is defined as a complaint concerning any condition, action, or lack of action on the part of the District that the SCCFT or a current or former faculty member believes to be a violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of this Agreement. This Grievance Procedure shall not apply to any matter on which the Board is without authority to act.
15.2	Consolidation of Grievances. When two (2) or more grievances
54
involving the same alleged violation have been submitted, the District and the SCCFT may agree to consolidate them for processing.
15.3	Individual Filing. A faculty member shall have the right to present a grievance to the District and to have such a grievance adjusted without intervention of the SCCFT as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and provided further that the SCCFT has been given opportunity to be present at such adjustment and to make the views of the SCCFT known.
Any grievance covered by this section shall be presented in writing to the appropriate administrator within the time limits specified in Section 15.4 below. The administrator shall notify the SCCFT in writing within five (5) calendar days of the receipt of the grievance, which shall then be treated as a Level One grievance in accordance with Section 15.7 below. Service of the Level One answer shall be to the grievant, with a copy provided to the SCCFT.
Special Note: Level One, as described in 15.7 below, shall be the only level for such grievances unless the SCCFT finds the adjustment is not consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in which case the SCCFT may itself file the grievance at Level Two. If the District does not answer the grievance at Level One, however, the individual grievant may file at Level Two. Under no circumstances may an individual grievant take the grievance to arbitration: as provided below, arbitration is a step to be pursued at the sole discretion of the SCCFT.
15.4	Timeliness and Requests for Information. Grievances shall be processed as rapidly as possible. Time limits expressed herein (Article 15) may be extended by mutual agreement. A grievance to be timely must be filed in writing not more than thirty (30) calendar days after the aggrieved's cognizance of the facts upon which the grievance is based. The level of filing shall be in accordance with Section 15.6 below.
In calculating calendar days as used in this Article, those days that fall between the end of finals week in any of the four quarters and the beginning of the next quarter shall be excluded.
All data, records and information necessary to the processing of a grievance shall be made available to the grievant and to other appropriate parties in a timely and expeditious manner.
15.5	Failure to File an Answer. Failure atanystepofthis procedure to communicate the decision of a grievance within the specified time limits shall mean that the grievant may deem the grievance denied and may therefore appeal it to the next step (except as otherwise provided in this Article). Failure at any step of this procedure to appeal a
55
grievance to the next step shall be deemed acceptance of the decision rendered at that step.
15.6	Filing to be at Lowest Possible Level. In all cases, a grievance shall be filed at the lowest level of administrative organization having authority to resolve the grievance. If requested to do so by the SCCFT (or in cases of filings made in accordance with Section 15.3 above, by the grievant), the campus vice chancellor/president or District chancellor shall specify who has such authority.
15.7	Levels of the Grievance Procedure. Grievances shall be handled in the following manner:
Level One: If the grievance cannot be adjusted informally, it shall be reduced to writing, dated, and signed by the grievant and the SCCFT representative. The written grievance shall state the facts upon which it is based, the applicable provision(s) of this Agreement, and the remedy sought. Receipt of the grievance shall be acknowledged in writing by the administrator who shall answer the grievance in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days of its submission by serving the answer on the SCCFT representative. The representative shall acknowledge service by signing and dating the District's copy. If the answer does not grant the remedy requested, the administrator shall include the reason(s).
Note: If requested by either the grievant. the SCCFT, or the District, at least one (1) meeting shall be held to discuss the grievance at a given level prior to the rendering of an answer at that level. Such a meeting shall be mandatory in cases governed by Section 15.3.
Level Two: If no settlement is reached at Level One, the written grievance may be submitted to the District Chancellor or designee by the SCCFT. Receipt of the grievance shall be acknowledged in writing. The grievance must be filed within fifteen (15) calendar days after the Level One answer is received.

Calculation: Step quarterly rate x quarterly percent of full-time x 726.68% (parity factor) = quarterly pay. Percent of full-time is based on weekly workload as a portion of a full-time weekly workload in accordance with Article 11.3. The contact hours must agree with hours listed in the District course master.
b.	Librarians and counselors will be paid atthe appropriate parity factor (B.5a & b) established for a 30-hour workload except when they are assigned to teach a class or workshop, in which case they will be paid according to the established workload as determined in Article 11,3.b.
c.	The method of compensation for faculty who are substituting in any one continuous assignment for faculty on leave will be based on the hourly part-time faculty salary rate (B1B), multiplied by the number of contact hours up to a period equal to 20% of the course contact hours. For periods of replacement beyond 20% of the course contact hours, compensation will be based on the quarterly rate multiplied by the parity factor multiplied by the percent of full-time workload. Substitute or replacement hours for periods of less than eight weeks, or for a shorter period when the assignment equals that of a full quarterly load (see 4.1.b), for any one continuous assignment do not apply toward pro-rata pay.
d.	The method of salary reduction for faculty who are on non-paid leave will be based on the part-time hourly salary rate (schedule B.1B) multiplied by the number of contact hours up to a period equal to 20% of the course(s) contact hours. For periods of absence beyond 20% of the course(s) contact hours, reduction in pay will be based on the quarterly rate multiplied by the parity factor multiplied by the percent of full-time workload.
Salary Calculation Method
% Full-time x Parity factor" x Quarterly salary"* = Quarterly Salary
** Quarterly salary = 330 hours x hourly rate at current step
*" Parity factor is based on program workload:
(15, 18, 20 hour/week programs parity factor = 76.68%) (25 hour/week programs parity factor = 85.55%) (30 hour/week programs parity factor = 102.22%)
67
B.8 Professional Improvement Recognition for Part-Time Faculty On the Highest Salary Step

APPENDIX E
DISTRICT PERSONNEL POLICY RELATING TO SPECIAL CONTRACT FACULTY MEMBERS EMPLOYED IN ALL SPECIAL PROGRAMS
E.1 Scope. Grant and contract faculty are those hired in special contract programs which are funded with restricted funds. Examples of such programs include, but are not limited to, CETA programs, the Deaf Program, etc.
E.2 Salary Placement of Special Contract Faculty Members. All special contract faculty shall be placed in the existing salary schedule within thirty (30) days of their employment as provided in the collective bargaining agreement with the SCCFT and in accordance with the following principles:
a.	Full-time faculty are defined as those who are assigned more than two-thirds (2/3rds) of the normal weekly workload in their discipline, division or department for a minimum of eight (8) weeks. Faculty in this category are paid according to the full-time salary schedule prorated from a range of 67-100% (Appendix A).
b.	Faculty who do not meet the criteria in 2.a above are part-time. Faculty in this category are paid according to the part-time hourly schedule (Appendix B).
c.	Such placement will be observed throughout their employment and as long as the program is operated by the District or any of its sub-units. Special contract faculty members are automatically members of the collective bargaining unit during their period of employment.
E.3 Progression on the Salary Schedule. Progression on the salary schedules will be the same for special contract faculty as for regular faculty and in accordance with the currently negotiated collective bargaining agreement.
E.4 Fringe Benefits for Special Contract Faculty. Special contract faculty are eligible for fringe benefits in accordance with the basic Agreement with the SCCFT if their continuing employment status covers a minimum period of six (6) months or more. Those faculty who are employed under special contracts of less than six (6) months' duration do not gualify for coverage.
In the case of part-time special contract faculty, fringe benefits will accrue as for other part-time faculty described in the basic Agreement with the SCCFT.
80
The fact that the budget provisions of a special contract contain funds for fringe benefits does not imply that all those employed under the contract automatically become eligible for all fringe benefits offered by the District to continuing employees.
E.5 Curtailment or Termination of Special Programs. In the event a special program is curtailed or terminated, either for reasons of educational policy or lack of funds from the financing source, all special contract faculty will be notified by the campus president.
In any such curtailment or termination, tenured faculty shall have the rights set forth in RCW 28B.50.850 through 869.
E.6 Seniority. For all such purposes as relevant, seniority of special contract faculty members shall be calculated in their respective special program. Special contract employees shall not be placed on any District-wide seniority list.
E.7 Notification of Special Contract Faculty. All special contract faculty shall be notified of their status at the time of their employment and their personnel records shall be so marked.
81
APPENDIX F
COMMUNITY AND CONTRACT SERVICE SALARY PLANS
F.1 Community Service Courses
a.	Courses to be Offered: Courses to be offered are those non-credit/non-graded self-support courses and activities which are conducted by the SCCD system for members of the community not directly related to the fulfillment of requirements for a state approved degree, state approved certificate or state approved diploma.
Courses to be excluded from this program are those coded by institutional intent as 11,21,22 and 23, i.e., Academic Transfer, Academic Basic Education, Academic General Education, Occupational Preparatory, Occupational Supplementary, Non-Wage Earning Occupational, and Intensive English Programs (see Appendix H).
b.	Tuition and Class Fees: Student tuition and fees for community service courses will be established by the president or his/her designee at each campus.
c.	Faculty Salary: Compensation for instructing community service classes will be negotiated as follows: (1) a minimum of $18 per contact hour, or (2) a minimum of 45 percent of the actual student tuition collected (excluding special fees) instead of an hourly rate. A rate mutually agreeable to the college and the instructor may exceed these rates.
The appropriate administrator must inform the instructor as to which method will be used and the rate of compensation prior to the first class session. The method or rate of compensation may be changed after the first class session only if it is mutually agreeable to the college and the instructor.
Final determination of quarterly pay for the percent-of-student-tuition method of compensation will be deferred until revenue generated by a course (student fees and tuition less withdrawal refunds) is accurately determined. Payment then would normally be in two installments.
d.	Annual Review: There will be an annual review of the community service/leisure-time program and copies of the review will be
82
provided to the SCCFT no later than November 1 each year.
F.2 Contract Service Courses.
a.	Contract service courses are those supported through negotiated contracts with organizations such as business, industry, government or private agencies for customized training.
b.	If the contract service course is the same as a regular credit course in the district course master file, the instructor will be paid from the part-time salary schedule in accordance with provisions of Appendix B. If the contract service course is not a regular credit course, the salary for any services provided in connection with the course is to be negotiated (based on the instructor’s qualifications and the outside contract specifications) and agreed upon between the college and the instructor.
c.	Prior to the commencement of the contracted services the instructor will be informed of the contract provisions, method of salary compensation, and salary payment dates. If requested on an individual basis, the instructor will be supplied this information in writing prior to commencement of the contract services.
83

So that all faculty within the division are aware of summer assignments, it will be the responsibility of the unit administrator to inform each eligible faculty member of the opportunities and potential arrangements. The method of rotating will be determined cooperatively between the unit administrator and faculty of the division. The unit administrator will work cooperatively with the faculty, if that division/department faculty wish to be involved, and other administrators in developing summer school programs.

In the articles that do apply, full-time or tenured faculty shall be interpreted as core faculty.
Intensive English faculty are those hired to instruct in student-funded English-as-a Second Language programs.
H.2 Contract Year. For 2003-2004, the contract year will consist of 199 calendar days, or the equivalent, at least 6 of which will be non-instructional. For 2004-2005 and thereafter, the contract year will consist of 200 calendar days, or the equivalent, at least 7 of which will be non-instructional.

The weekly workload shall consist of assignment of student contact hours for each faculty. With the concurrence of the individual faculty, maximum weekly contact hours may be averaged on an annual basis. Maximum weekly contact hours are not to be construed as a required total hourly assignment.
In Summer Quarter, the weekly workload for CORE faculty will be 18.75 contact hours.
Summer contractual workload for CORE faculty will be calculated by multiplying the 49 calendar days, or equivalent, by 75%. the summer workload:

H.4 Salary Placement of Intensive English Faculty Members. All Intensive English faculty shall be placed in the Intensive English salary schedule within thirty (30) days of their employment and in accordance with the following principles.
a.	Core faculty are defined as those who are assigned 76% or more of the normal weekly workload, for a minimum of eight weeks. Faculty in this category are paid according to the core salary schedule prorated from a range of 76-100%.
b.	Hours taught in this program will not be used for calculation of weekly workload for pro-rata pay in other programs, nor will hours taught in other programs apply to this program.
c.	Faculty who do not meet the criteria for core faculty are part-time. Faculty in this category are paid according to the part-time salary schedule. Part-time faculty will be eligible for priority hiring within this program based on Article 10.7.
d.	Such placement will be observed throughout their employment and as long as the program is operated by the District or any of its sub-units. Intensive English faculty members are automatically members of the collective bargaining unit during their period of employment.
89
H.5 Contract. Core faculty will be employed under a yearly contract and will be provided a written contract describing the terms and conditions of their employment with the District. Core faculty will perform the professional obligations of full-time faculty.
Core faculty employment does not confer a vested right to continued employment. However, if enrollment allows, the core faculty member who is in his/her fourth or subsequent year of continuous employment as a full-time core faculty member will be tendered a new contract unless there is cause.
Core faculty, upon appointment to an administrative position, except that of District chief administrative officer, will retain their core faculty status within their specific program. If a core faculty position becomes available in the program, such faculty will have the right of first refusal for the position.
a.	If the contract is to be non-renewed for the following year, the

		• This does not reflect equity adjustments of July 1,2003. Salary adjustments will be posted in the Public Folders_Human Resources.				
Eligible core faculty will advance one step as of July 1,2003.
b.	Calculation of CORE salary for contract year.
1.	Placement on Schedule A.1 will compensate Core faculty for 165 instructional days at 100% workload, or the equivalent, and six (6) non-instructional days in 2003-2004 and seven (7) non-instructional days in 2004-2005 and thereafter.
2.	The 165 instructional days will be calculated as follows:
Fall Quarter - 47 days
Winter Quarter - 48 days
* Part-time faculty at Step 5 who have accumulated the equivalent of one year full time experience will advance to Step 6 on July 1, 2003.
Part-time Pay Calculation: Calculation for part-time pay is based on the quarterly rate (according to step placement) multiplied by the quarterly percent of full-time multiplied by the parity factor multiplied by the ten-week quarter length adjustment.
Calculation: Quarterly Rate (Column C) x Parity Factor (see Column D) x per cent of workload x 89.1% (quarter-length adjustment) = quarterly pay. Percent of full-time is based on weekly workloads as a portion of a full-time weekly workload in accordance with Appendix
91
92
H.3.
d.	Part-time non-instructional rate - $12.00 per hour.
e.	All new core faculty will be placed on Step 2 of the full time salary Schedule (see Appendix A.1).
f.	Advancement on the core salary schedule will occur upon the completion of one year equivalent teaching at 100% workload.
g.	Depending on the length of faculty leave, it may be necessary to hire either a substitute for periods of less than 20% of the course contact hours, or a replacement, for a period beyond 20% of the course contact hours. In either case, new faculty shall be informed of the estimated length of their assignments and the employment category (part-time, full-time probationary faculty appointment, full-time special faculty appointment, or full-time non-tenure track as per Section 4.3).
The method of compensation for faculty who are substituting in any one continuous assignment for faculty on leave will be at the appropriate hourly rate according to the faculty member’s step placement multiplied by the number of contact hours up to a period equal to 20% of the course contact hours. For periods of replacement beyond 20% of the course contact hours, compensation will be based on the quarterly rate multiplied by the parity factor (78.78%) multiplied by the percent of full-time workload multiplied by the quarter-length adjustment (89.1%). Substitute or replacement hours for periods of less than eight weeks for any one continuous assignment do not apply toward pro-rata pay.
h.	Following placement on the Intensive English Program part-time salary schedule, one step advancement will be provided upon the completion of 91 % of FTEF required (700 contact hours) for step movement in the Intensive English Programs within the District.
i.	Initial placement of new part-time faculty will be the equivalent of Step 3 of the part-time salary schedule in Appendix B.1A (see H.6.c).
j.	When the Legislature appropriates an increase to the full-time salary schedule in Appendix A, the core salary schedule will be increased by the same percentage and effective at the same time.
k.	When the Legislature appropriates an increase to the part-time
93
salary schedule in Appendix B, the part-time salary schedule will be increased by the same percentage and effective at the same time.
H.7 Fringe Benefits. Intensive English core faculty are eligible for fringe benefits in accordance with Article 5 in the Agreement from the date of their employment as noted in H.1.
Percentage of full-time calculation for determination of benefit eligibility will be based upon actual Intensive English quarters (10 weeks), not the regular college quarter duration.
In the case of part-time Intensive English faculty, fringe benefits will accrue as for other part time faculty as described in the basic Agreement with the SCCFT.
H.8 Curtailment or Termination of Intensive English Programs. In the event the Intensive English program is curtailed or terminated, either for reasons of educational policy or lack of funds from tuition revenues, all Intensive English faculty will be notified by the Campus President or designee.
If core faculty are to be affected by program termination or curtailment, the SCCFT will be consulted and provided with the factual basis for the decision. After consultation, the faculty will receive notification thirty (30) working days prior to the termination date. All such faculty will have recall rights if the positions are reopened within twenty-four (24) calendar months.
H.9 Faculty Evaluation. Core faculty will conduct quarterly student evaluations. One anonymous evaluation each year will be supervised by the administration and the results given to the unit administrator as well as the faculty member. Part-time faculty evaluations will follow the basic agreement with the SCCFT (Sections 10.7 and 10.8).
H. 10 Seniority. For all such purposes as relevant, seniority of Intensive English faculty members shall be calculated in this specific program. Intensive English faculty shall not be placed on any Districtwide seniority list.

APPENDIX I
DISTANCE LEARNING COURSES
1.1 Scope. Distance learning courses are those in which instruction and instructional materials are delivered to the student with a minimum of or no direct classroom contact. The following categories and definitions shall apply:
a.	Correspondence Study: Courses taught in an independent study mode through printed materials with the dominant mode of contact between instructor and student being U.S. mail and telephone. Communication may be supplemented by e-mail. The instructor of record does not need to be available for student contact at a scheduled time. Instruction may be supplemented by audiotape or videotape. No online component shall be required of the instructor. Open rather than quarterly enrollment.
b.	Provisional Telecourse: A course taught with licensed broadcast video and producer-printed material whose enrollment has not reached the threshold for Regular Telecourses (see section 1.10 below). The instructor does not need to be available for student contact at a scheduled time. The dominant mode of contact between instructor and student will be U.S. mail and telephone. No online component shall be required of the instructor. Quarterly enrollment.
c.	Regular Telecourse: A course taught with licensed broadcast video and printed material that may be supplemented with additional assignments created by the instructor. The instructor will be available to students at scheduled times; however, the dominant mode of contact between instructor and student will be U.S. mail, telephone, or electronic mail. No onsite scheduled office hours shall be required of the instructor. No online component shall be required of the instructor. Quarterly enrollment.
d.	Online Course: A course with materials presented primarily online. An Online Course has no direct onsite classroom contact or a maximum of three hours of such contact. The instructor will be available to students at scheduled times. No onsite scheduled office hours shall be required of the instructor. Primary mode of contact between instructor and student will be online. Online classes will have a maximum required enrollment of 25 students per section.
e.	Interactive Electronic Course: A course taught synchronously at different sites connected by electronic media through which students and instructor can communicate. Responsibilities of the
95
instructor will be the same as for courses taught in a regular classroom.
1.2	Curriculum Development Compensation. The faculty and Administration may individually negotiate a stipend of a minimum of $1,000 to develop or $600 to revise distance learning instructional materials, including workbooks or instructional packets, syllabi, course descriptions/outlines, and other materials as agreed upon. Ownership of instructional materials is described in Article 13.4.
1.3	Professional Development. If it becomes necessary for a full-time or part-time priority-hiring-list faculty member to teach an Online Course in order to meet a full-time load requirement or a part-time priority-hiring-list assignment, the District will provide professional development in conducting Online Courses on the first assignment of such a course.
1,4	Curriculum Review. Adaptation of a course from one category to another (e.g., from Correspondence to Online or from classroombased to distance modes) should be undertaken only after agreement for such development has been made with the appropriate administrators. Distance learning courses are subject to the same curriculum review as regular classes in the discipline and may be subject to additional reviews as criteria for distance learning are developed.
1.5	Integration of Distance Learning Appendix with other Agreement Provisions. Contract provisions for RegularTelecourses (1.1 ,c) Online Courses (1.1 .d), and Interactive Electronic Courses (1.1 .e) shall be the same as those for all other courses. Contract provisions for Correspondence Study (1.1 .a) and Provisional Telecourses (1.1 b) shall be the same except for the provisions described in the following sections.
1.6	Faculty Salary. Instructors responsible for the students enrolled in Correspondence Study or in a Provisional Telecourse shall be paid at the base rate of $21.36 per quarterly credit hour for each student enrolled in the course up to 35 enrollees. One half of the per-student fee will be calculated based on tenth-day equivalent enrollment and paid at the next pay period. The remainder of the per-student fees shall be calculated based on the number of students enrolled on the day following the last day students may withdraw with a refund, and this amount will be paid at the end of the quarter. When the Legislature appropriates an increase to the part-time faculty salary, the base rate for distance learning will be increased by the same percentage.
1.7	Salary Credits for Movement on the Part-Time Salary Schedule. Experience credits for instructors of record for Correspondence Study or Provisional Telecourses shall be calculated at the rate of one-fifth of
96
an hour per quarterly credit hour for each student enrolled as of the tenth day. To calculate the earned experience credits, use the following formula:
one-fifth x number of credit hours x number of students
e.g.. 1/5x5 credit hours x 10 students = 10 experience hours earned
1.8	Workload.
a.	Correspondence Study: Workload shall not be calculated as in Article 11.3 for purposes of eligibility for pro-rata pay or tenure. No individual instructor shall enroll more than 35 students per quarter in this mode of study. Enrollment will be tracked per student rather than per section.
b.	Provisional Telecourses: Workload shall not be calculated as in Article 11.3 for purposes of eligibility for pro-rata pay or tenure; however the following limits will be observed:
1.	Full-time instructor may have one Provisional Telecourse overload
2.	Enrollment shall not exceed 35 students per class.
3.	Part-time instructors with a 50% to 66 2/3% load in regular classes may be assigned no more than two Provisional Telecourses.
4.	Part-time instructors with a 25% but less than 50% load in regular classes may be assigned no more than three Provisional Telecourses.
5.	Part-time instructors with less than 25% of regular classes may be assigned no more than four Provisional Telecourses.
1.9	Priority Hire. Credit toward eligibility for the priority-hiring list will not accrue when teaching Correspondence Study or Provisional Telecourses.
1.10	Movement of a Course from Provisional to Regular Telecourse Category. A course designated as Provisional shall move to the Regular Telecourse category when it has achieved a minimum enrollment of 22 students at the tenth day for three out of four quarters. By joint agreement of the administrator and the faculty member, the course can be run as a provisional course after meeting the
97
requirements to move to regular status. The SCCFT shall be informed of any such agreement. When a course first moves to the Regular Telecourse category, instructors who have developed and taught the Provisional Telecourse shall receive a developmental cost reimbursement of $1,000.
1,11	District Distance Learning Committee. The District and SCCFT share a mutual interest in providing the highest quality learning opportunities to the widest possible range of students. The District and SCCFT seek to provide leadership and innovation in meeting the distance education needs of students from diverse populations consistent with the mission of the District.
The District Distance Learning Committee (see Article 12) will consist of four faculty and four administrators, including the Chair. The chair of the committee will be the Vice Chancellor for Distance Learning or designee. This appointment should not be construed as precedent setting for the selection of chairs of other joint committees.
The committee will plan, evaluate, review, and communicate Distance Learning issues and provide input on relevant policies.
Committee minutes, recommendations and reports of the DDLC will be sent to the District Chancellor and the SCCFT.
98
APPENDIX J
NEGOTIATIONS PROCEDURES
These procedures will govern collective bargaining negotiations between the Seattle Community College District and the Seattle Community College Federation of Teachers.
J.1 Negotiating Teams.
a.	Chief Negotiator: Chief negotiators shall be appointed by each party, and shall be the principal speakers for their respective constituents, both in and out of formal negotiations sessions. It is desirable that each party utilize the services of a professional negotiator, not an attorney, to act as chief negotiator; however, each party shall be free to select its own negotiator to minimize the costs for services.
b.	Team Composition: Each party shall limit the size of its team to five (5) members including legal advisors or professional negotiators.
J.2 Meetings.
a.	Scheduling: The chief negotiator of either party may request a meeting of the two teams at any time subject to the mutual convenience of all team members of both sides. It is agreed that meetings shall be held on a timely and regular basis.
b.	Location: Meetings will be held at a location which is mutually satisfactory.
c.	Notification: Each chief negotiator will be responsible for notifying all team members in advance of the time and place of the meeting.
J.3 Meeting Procedures.
a.	Agenda: The agenda for the first session shall be agreed to by the two chief negotiators in advance, and the agenda for each subsequent meeting shall be agreed to at the conclusion of the current session.
b.	Caucuses: The chief negotiator of either party may declare a caucus at any time to allow either or both teams to discuss matters related to the meeting. Teams are encouraged to keep caucuses brief.
c.	Termination of Meetings: Either chief negotiator may terminate any meeting at any time.
99
d.	Cancellations of Meetings: Under unusual circumstances, it may be necessary to cancel scheduled meetings. In such cases the chief negotiators shall be responsible for notifying their respective teams. Cancellations of meetings should be kept to a minimum.
e.	Conduct in Meetings: Each side will treat the other with respect and courtesy.
J.4 Communications.
a.	Master File: The District Office shall be responsible for maintaining a master file of all communication relevant to negotiations.
b.	Transmittal of Documents: Only the chief negotiators shall transmit inter-team documents to the other, and this shall be done either in a formal meeting or via mail after the approval of the other has been obtained. Members of both teams will receive a copy of all documents.
c.	Public Announcements: During the course of negotiations there shall be only joint releases to the news media. This does not, however, restrict the right of each side to communicate with its own constituency. Each side will, however, use prudent judgment in its communication so that progress of the negotiations is not jeopardized.
d.	Proposals/Counter proposals: Every proposal advanced by one party shall be done via its chief negotiator and must be responded to, either with an acceptance, with a request to study the materials, with a counterproposal, or with a rejection by the other chief negotiator. Reasonable reading and study time shall be allowed for team members between the submission of proposals and their discussion.
e.	Communication of Concern: Either party may request a meeting to communicate its concern on a matter. These meetings may be for the purpose of exchanging information rather than for the conduct of negotiations.
f.	Acceptance of Items: Any item which is mutually agreed to in a negotiations session shall be initialed by the two chief negotiators at that time and shall not be subject to renegotiation except in the event that subsequent developments of information deem it advisable to both parties. Those initialed documents will become part of the master file. In case editorial/grammatical changes are directed by the teams, the revised copies shall be presented at the next negotiations session and shall be similarly initialed.
100
J.5 Ratification Procedures.
a.	Tentative Agreement: When an agreement has been developed through negotiations, the chief negotiator of each party shall indicate tentative acceptance to their respective constituency. When tentative agreement is signified by the chief negotiator, all members of that negotiations team are bound to concur with said recommendation for ratification.
b.	Ratification: The teams shall present the document to their respective parties for approval.
J.6 Mediation Procedures.
a.	Impasse: In the event that an agreement cannot be reached, either chief negotiator may declare an impasse. This is a critical step and should be taken only after all avenues to a solution have been explored. The declaration of an impasse will immediately set the mediation procedures into operation.
b.	Mediation: Mediation shall be conducted under the auspices and rules of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or by another mediation service which is mutually acceptable. Costs connected with the mediation shall be shared equally by both parties.
101
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
DEVELOPMENT OF EVALUATION GUIDELINES
This letter of understanding is between the Seattle Community College District VI (District) and the Seattle Community Colleges Federation of Teachers (SCCFT) and relates to the development of evaluation guidelines of part-time faculty seeking priority hiring status per Article 10.7a of the January 1, 2000 - December 31, 2002 SCCFT Faculty Agreement:
Consistent with the Affirmative Action Plan of the District, part-time faculty who have been employed at an average of 50% time or more for nine (9) of the last twelve (12) quarter (excluding summer quarter). and who have received satisfactory evaluations which will include student and administrative evaluations and may include peer observations, shall be placed upon a department/division priority employment list. Evaluation guidelines will be developed by the Agreement/Management Committee.
Role of Administrator
We underscore the distinction between faculty peer observation and administrative evaluation of part-time faculty. Administrative evaluation will be conducted by the unit administrator (usually the associate dean of a division), and should include classroom observation, written evaluation based upon previously determined criteria, discussion with the faculty member, and response and signature of the faculty member verifying knowledge of the evaluation's contents. The signature does not confer a faculty member's agreement with its contents. After review of the evaluation, if the administrator feels that the faculty member's evaluation is unsatisfactory, an improvement plan may be devised that includes peer observation and mentoring by faculty colleagues.
Timeline
It is the intent of the SCCD administration to conduct evaluations of non-priority faculty as early as possible in a faculty member’s employment by an SCCD instructional unit. Administrative evaluation will occur before the beginning of the seventh quarter within the nine (9) out of (12) quarter sequence outlined in Article 10.7a.
Whether it be administrative evaluation or peer observation, both the evaluator/observer and the faculty member will set the date(s) of the observation and any follow-up meetings. The unit administrator reserves the right to conduct more than one administrative evaluation per quarter. However, if more than two evaluations are conducted within the quarter, a written explanation will be provided to the faculty
102
member.
Criteria
Each department should determine specific criteria to be met by part-time faculty. Establishment of these criteria should include input from full and part-time faculty and the unit administrator. These criteria will be provided by the unit administrator to each new part-time faculty hired.
This letter of understanding shall remain in effect until the end of the January 1, 2003 - June 30, 2006 District VI and SCCFT Faculty Agreement.
103
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
LAB/LECTURE MIX
To allow part-time faculty assigned a lab/lecture mix the opportunity to also accept a lecture class, the SCCFT and Administration agree to raise the workload eligibility for pro-rata pay from 67% to 78% under the following conditions:
-	The workload for the lab/lecture course mix shall not exceed 18 contact hours.
-	The workload for the lecture course shall not exceed 15 contact hours.
104
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
ONE-ON-ONE MUSIC LESSONS
To meet the learning needs of music students who wish to receive college credit for one-on-one music lessons, the SCCD and the SCCFT agree to the following conditions of employment:
1.	Individual music lesson instructors will be paid $200 per quarter, per credit for one '/i hour lesson per week, or the amount currently in effect as of Spring quarter 2002 (whichever is greater) with the addition of benefits, subject to the Agreement, except as in item 2, below.
2.	Faculty workload, for benefit purposes will be calculated as a function of instructional hours, on a 30 hour workload base, (e.g: 20 students at 1 /2 hour per week, per student = 10 hrs. per week = 10/30 = .33333. Alternatively, 10 students at 1 hr per week, per student = 10 hrs. per week = 10/30 = .33333 workload.) Workload will apply toward benefits, but not toward the pro-rata threshold. For movement on the part-time salary schedule, each credit equals to 2.75 hours.
105
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
PART-TIME LIBRARIANS
According to the Seattle Community College District/Seattle Community Colleges Federation of Teachers Agreement, compensation for part-time librarians and counselors will be based on a 30 hour workload except when they are assigned to teach a class, in which case they will be paid according to the established workload as determined in Article 11.3 (Appendix B.7.b).
Part-time librarians may be called upon to do workshops and classroom lectures sporadically throughout the quarter. The workshops are equivalent in instructional duties to lecture courses and thus, in accordance with Appendix B.7.C, should be paid based on a 15 hour workload. However, issuing a new ENSRC for each new workshop assignment is quite burdensome for personnel, and results in frequent, but small stipends for faculty.
Part-time librarian workshop hours can be tracked on an hourly time sheet for the quarter.
Librarians and counselors will be paid at the appropriate parity factor (B.5a & b) established for a 30-hour workload except when they are assigned to teach a class or workshop, in which case they will be paid according to the established workload as determined in Article 11.3, on a 15 hour workload. Payment will be made at the end of each quarter.
