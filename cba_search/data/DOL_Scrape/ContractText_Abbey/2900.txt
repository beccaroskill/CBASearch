C.	Procedures for Union representatives to schedule meetings with employees to discuss grievances are detailed in Article 21, Section 2.G. A Union representative may wish to meet with an employee to discuss issues other than a grievance, such as a term or condition of employment which would be a subject for consultation or discussion with Management. In such an instance, the Union representative will follow the same process as outlined in Article 21 Section 2.G. In situations
11
where the Union representative is not on duty and the employee is on a rest or meal break, the Union representative shall notify a supervisor at the work site that he is there to visit an employee only if the employee is working or located at a worksite or break room that is in an area that has restricted access by the public. Should the meeting occur in an area frequented by other employees (such as a break or lunch room), the area must remain open to same.

1.	Union meetings
2.	Union training classes/seminars
3.	Attendance at Union conventions
4.	Preparation for contract negotiations with the City
5.	Contract negotiations with the City
FPSU representatives who are either officials or stewards as defined by this Article and are recognized by the Employer may be granted time off by Departmental Management to conduct business in connection with FPSU - St. Petersburg Unit. Time off for FPSU business will be without loss of straight time pay by using available pool time provided the following:
A.	A written request for the use of pool time, using the Pool Time Request form contained within this Article, is submitted through the employee's supervisor to the Section or division manager at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance of the time off, or shorter notice in the case of unforeseen circumstances. The Pool Time Request Form will be accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation (e.g., announcement of Union convention with dates and location, description of course time, location and content).
12
B.	Sufficient staffing is available to properly carry out the work of the Department/Section during the absence of the FPSU representative(s) as determined by the appropriate manager.
C.	Approval by the appropriate manager is received in advance of the use of pool time. The manager shall, prior to approval, take into account staffing problems, possible emergency situations, possible overtime obligations and pool time use conflicts with vacation time schedules. In all cases, the goal of providing efficient and superior service to the community is of paramount importance.
D.	No more than five (5) Union representatives and stewards shall be off at any one time. Each individual representative and steward shall not use more than ten (10) hours of pool time per month, and no more than a total of forty (40) hours of pool time shall be used by the Union per month. An exception will be made to these limits once a year for each Union officer and Union steward to attend a seminar or conference for up to forty (40) hours. Union representatives and stewards who are on pool time agree to remain off City premises unless the pool time is being used for contract negotiations with the City; failure to do so will result in the loss of pool time privileges for those individuals who violate this provision.
The Employer retains the right to restrict time off for FPSU business when insufficient notice is given or an emergency condition exists and such time off from work would create a hazard to the public. The Employer may also call employees on pool time back to work when emergency conditions exist.
Employees covered by this agreement may donate, on the donation form contained in this Article, a minimum of two (2) hours of their annual leave time, but cannot donate illness hours toward the pool time account. Hours will be converted to dollars as will the hours utilized by the FPSU representatives, so that the running balance of the account at any given time will be a dollar and cents amount. Donations can be processed anytime during the term of this agreement.
Charges against the FPSU pool time account, as provided in this Article, shall only be made when approved by the President of the FPSU or the President of the FPSU St. Petersburg Unit prior to the employees utilizing requested pool time. Whenever the pool time account has been depleted, the time off may be without pay or annual leave may be used. When an officer or steward is absent from work and being covered by pool time, he or she shall continue to accrue benefits such as annual leave and illness leave. However, such hours will not count towards the computation of overtime.
For the purposes of this Article, annual leave time requests have priority over requests for the use of the FPSU pool time.
FPSU representatives using pool time shall not be on duty and shall not be eligible, during the time of utilization, for Workers' Compensation benefits.
13
Unused time (i.e., dollars) in the FPSU pool time account will be carried into the next fiscal year.
Section 7.	The Union, as representative of the employees covered by this agreement, shall have the right to present its views to Management on matters of concern either orally or in writing.
Section 8.	Authorized and recognized International Union representatives will be granted access to work areas during regular working hours to carry out the functions which come within the scope of their responsibilities on matters relating to this labor agreement. Requests for access must be received by the Division of Labor Relations at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance. Visits may be temporarily deferred so as not to interfere with work operations or maintenance of service to the community. City work hours shall not be used by employees or Union representatives to conduct Union organized meetings for the promotion of Union affairs.
Section 9.	The Employer will not negotiate individually with employees covered by this agreement concerning matters that are within the prerogative of this collective bargaining agreement. Informal discussions between an employee and supervisor, which are of a personal nature or concern problems personal to the employee, do not normally fall into this category.

ARTICLE 6
CHECKOFF
Section 1.	Employees covered by this agreement may request on a prescribed form the authorization for payroll deductions for the purpose of paying Union dues, COPE donations, and uniform assessments. The Employer is expressly prohibited from any involvement in the collection of fines, penalties or special assessments and shall not honor any requests of this nature other than for Union dues, COPE donations, and uniform assessments. The Union expressly agrees not to solicit COPE donations on City property.
Authorizations currently on file shall remain in full force and effect for the term of this Contract unless revoked by an employee with thirty (30) days written notice to the Employer and the Union.
Section 2.	The Union will initially notify the Employer as to the amount of dues or uniform assessments to be deducted from a member's salary on a weekly basis. This notice must state the weekly amount in dollars and cents. Such notification will be certified to the Employer in writing over the signature of an authorized officer of the Union at least thirty (30) calendar days in advance of the effective date. Changes in membership dues will be similarly certified to the Employer and shall be done at least thirty (30) calendar days in advance of the effective date of such change.
Deductions for Union dues, COPE donations, and uniform assessments will be honored providing an authorization form for such deduction is properly executed and on file with the Employer.
Section 3.	Dues shall be deducted each applicable pay period and the funds deducted shall be remitted to the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union within thirty (30) days. The Union agrees to reimburse the Employer for the cost of processing any change in membership dues at the rate of sixty dollars ($60.00) which shall be made in the month such change in membership dues takes effect. A change in membership dues shall not require an additional dues deduction authorization form.
Section 4.	The Union will indemnify, defend, and hold the City harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits, or other forms of liability that shall arise out of, or by payroll deduction of Union dues or COPE donations. The FPSU agrees that in case of error, proper adjustment, if any, will be made by the FPSU with the affected employee, assuming that those funds in dispute have been transmitted to the FPSU.
Section 5.	In any applicable pay period in which there is insufficient pay to cover all other duly authorized deductions, Union dues or uniform assessments will not be deducted from an employee's pay. However, the appropriate deductions for two (2) or more applicable pay periods shall be made at the earliest time per City payroll procedures. The Union will pay the City twenty-five cents ($.25) for each additional deduction necessary to make up omitted deductions.
18
Section 6.	The Union shall remit to the City fifty dollars ($50.00) per month for payroll deduction of FPSU Union dues.
Section 7.	The Employer shall not be required to honor any authorizations for deductions that are delivered to the Labor Relations Office later than two (2) weeks prior to the deduction effectivity.

Section 1.	Strike Definition
"Strike" means the concerted failure to report for duty, the concerted absence of employees from their positions, the concerted stoppage of work, the concerted use of illness leave, the concerted submission of resignations, picketing in furtherance of a work stoppage, the concerted abstinence in whole or in part of any group of employees from the full and faithful performance of their duties of employment with the City of St. Petersburg, the Employer, for the purpose of inducing, influencing, condoning or coercing a change in the terms and conditions of employment or the rights, privileges, or obligations of their employment or participating in a deliberate and concerted course of conduct which adversely affects the services of the Employer, the concerted failure to report for work after the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement.
Section 2.	Strikes Prohibited
Employees covered by this agreement, the Union or its officers, agents and representatives, agree that Section 447.505, of the Florida Public Employees Collective Bargaining Statute prohibits them individually or collectively as public employees or the Union from participation in a strike against the City of St. Petersburg, the Employer, by instigating or supporting in any manner, a strike. Any violation of this Section shall subject the violator(s) to the penalties as provided for by this agreement, law, and the rules and regulations of the Employer.

Employees shall not be entitled to any benefits or wages whatsoever while they are engaged in any strike activities, or other interruptions of work. Any employee discharged in accordance with this Article or applicable provisions of the State of Florida Public Employees Collective Bargaining Statute shall, if appointed, reappointed, employed or reemployed by the City, serve a six (6) month probationary period following the reappointment or re-employment, and the compensation may in no event exceed that received immediately prior to the time of the violation, and the compensation may not be increased for one (1) year.
22
ARTICLE 8
BULLETIN BOARDS
Section 1.	The Employer agrees to provide bulletin boards or bulletin board space for use by FPSU up to a maximum of forty-five (45).
Section 2.	Bulletin boards or bulletin board space shall be large enough to accommodate up to four (4) notices 8 1/2" x 14" at each authorized location.
Section 3.	Union bulletin boards may be used for posting Union notices but restricted to:
A.	Notices of Union recreational and social affairs.
B.	Notices of Union elections and results of such elections.
C.	Notices of Union appointments and other official Union business.
D.	Notices of Union meetings.
E.	Any other information, including any notices containing any information other than purpose, date, time and place, may be posted on such designated areas only upon the approval of the Labor Relations Office.
Section 4.	All notices shall be on official FPSU letterhead stationary and signed by a duly recognized Union official.
Section 5.	Any other material, other than that listed in Section 3. of this Article, not on file with the Labor Relations Office may be removed by any member of Supervision. Should removal occur, the Labor Relations Office will notify the Union.
Section 6.	All costs incidental to preparing Union materials will be borne by the Union. The Union is responsible for posting and removing approved material on its bulletin boards and for maintaining such bulletin boards in an orderly condition.
Section 7.	In the event that additional permanent areas of work are placed in service requiring approximately twenty (20) employees, the Employer agrees to provide bulletin board space of the same size as described in Section 2. of this Article.
ARTICLE 9
BASIC WORK WEEK AND OVERTIME
Section 1.	The basic work week for all full-time employees covered by this labor agreement shall consist of forty (40) hours unless otherwise specified or scheduled by Management to meet particular requirements of individual Departments, Divisions or Sections of a Department.
23
Individual Departmental Management shall establish the basic work week and hours of work best suited to meet the needs of the Department and provide superior service to the community. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed as a guarantee or limitation of the number of hours to be worked per week.
Section 2. The basic work week of forty (40) hours for full-time employees shall be from Monday through Friday of each week unless specified or scheduled by Management to meet particular requirements of individual Departments, Divisions or Sections of a Department. When Management deems it necessary, work schedules may be established other than the basic Monday through Friday schedule, provided that the basic work week of forty (40) hours is scheduled within five (5) days. In this connection if a major segment of either Bargaining Unit is affected, Management will notify the Union as far in advance as possible.
Section 3. All authorized and approved work performed in excess of forty (40) hours in any one work week shall be considered as overtime and shall be paid at the overtime rate of one and one-half (1 ^) times the employee's regular hourly rate of pay, as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act. No employee shall suffer any reduction in his normal, scheduled hours of work to preclude the payment of overtime. Employees represented by these Bargaining Units shall be permitted to accrue and utilize compensatory time in lieu of being paid for overtime hours worked with the approval of their supervisor. Employees will not be forced to accept compensatory time in lieu of being paid overtime. If an employee is scheduled to work overtime, he may, with the approval of his supervisor, take time off on an hour-for-hour basis during the week in which overtime hours would otherwise have been worked. If the time is not taken off in that same work week, compensatory time will accrue at time and one-half for each hour worked over forty (40) hours (i.e. 1 ^ hours for each hour worked over forty (40) hours). Accrued compensatory time should be taken no later than three (3) months after it is earned. Accrued compensatory time balances may not exceed forty (40) hours. Compensatory time that exceeds forty (40) hours or has been banked more than three (3) months from the date of accrual shall be paid out to the employee in his next regular pay period. Compensatory time off should be requested in advance of the time to be taken off work.
Section 4.	For purposes of overtime computation, annual leave, illness leave, bereavement leave, jury duty, annual military leave and other absences from duty on active pay status shall not be considered as time worked, with the exception that holiday hours shall count towards the computation of overtime.
Section 5.	Employees shall be required to work overtime when assigned unless excused by
supervision. In the event any employee in the Unit is assigned to work approved overtime, he will not be required to use annual leave nor be placed in a "leave without pay" status during the basic work week in order to compensate or offset the overtime hours worked or to be worked.
An employee desiring to be excused from overtime work assignments for good and sufficient reasons shall submit, in writing, a request to his immediate supervisor. The written request, if approved, shall remain in force until rescinded in writing by the employee to his immediate supervisor or until it becomes required and necessary to assign and schedule this employee to overtime work.
24
At the time overtime work is required and necessary, the work shall be performed by employees who have not requested, in writing, to be excused from such assignment.
In the event overtime work is required and the Department, Division or Section cannot schedule the required numbers of employees, then those employees who have approved requests on file excusing them from overtime work shall be assigned and required to work such overtime.
Section 6.	Overtime work will be distributed equitably among full-time employees in their particular job classification, in their organization units (i.e., major shop areas, department, shift, Section, etc.), as far as the character of the work permits. Although temporary imbalances in the distribution of overtime may occur, nothing in this Section shall be construed as alleviating the continuing intent of Departmental Management to distribute overtime fairly and equitably over an extended period of time. Departmental Management will maintain overtime records and will make such information available to a Union representative.
Section 7.	When an employee is assigned to work overtime, as distinguished from a call
back, in excess of five (5) hours before or after his regular shift hours, his immediate supervisor will schedule a paid lunch period during the overtime assignment unless the employee's overtime work assignment requires his constant attention or availability or, at the employee's option, he does not desire a lunch period.
Section 8.	This Section 8. applies exclusively to the Blue Collar Collective Bargaining Unit only. The terms within this Section are not applicable to any members of the White Collar Collective Bargaining Unit by intent or practice. It is not the intention of the City to have supervisory or managerial employees perform Blue Collar Bargaining Unit work. Bargaining Unit work will not be assigned to the aforementioned employees except for the following:
A.	Emergency situations where regular employees are not immediately available for assignment and where the assignment would not extend past a reasonable period of time.
B.	Training, instruction, testing, or demonstration of current or new work projects, systems, or equipment.
However, none of the aforementioned acts shall be used to deprive an employee from working his normal weekly schedule.
Section 9.	Call Back
Call back pay is provided to compensate full-time employees required to return to work after completing a regularly assigned shift. Eligibility for call back pay is as follows:
A.	Any employee who is off duty and is required to return to work on an unscheduled basis shall be eligible for call back pay.
25
B.	Any employee required to return to work three (3) hours or less prior to his regularly scheduled starting time shall be paid for the actual time worked plus one (1) hour inconvenience pay.
C.	Any employee who is on duty and is instructed and assigned to return to work shall be ineligible for call back pay but may be eligible for compensation at the overtime rate of pay.
D.	Any employee required to continue working after completion of his regular scheduled shift shall be ineligible for call back pay but may be eligible for compensation at the overtime rate of pay.
E.	An employee who is contacted during his off-duty hours and is offered and accepts voluntary overtime is not eligible for call back pay but may be eligible for compensation at the overtime rate of pay.
F.	Any employee eligible for call back pay shall be paid for the actual hours worked, plus one (1) hour bonus for the call back inconvenience. A minimum guarantee of four (4) hours pay which will include the one (1) hour inconvenience bonus shall be paid. The maximum any employee may receive the call back inconvenience pay is twice in a twenty-four (24) hour period. If the employee is called back to work more than two (2) times in a twenty-four (24) hour period he shall be paid at his applicable rate from the time of notice to the time the employee returns home. All hours worked on a call back shall be counted toward computing the weekly overtime.
G.	When an employee is contacted at home and is able to address a work-related problem by phone or via computer from home, he shall not be paid in accordance with Paragraph F. above. Instead, he will receive payment for actual time worked, subject to a minimum of one (1) hour. Departments will be responsible for determining the reasonableness of time claimed, particularly in situations where the employee was not logged on to the computer system for the entire time he was working on the problem, in cases where a computer was used. An employee who is contacted off-duty and required to report to a City work site to address a problem via computer or an employee contacted off-duty who has to return home in order to address a problem via computer will receive call-back pay in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph F.
Section 10.	Standby Time
A.	In order to provide coverage for services during off-duty hours, it may be necessary to assign and schedule employees to standby duty. A standby duty assignment is made by a supervisor who requires an employee to be available for work due to an urgent situation on his off duty time which may include nights, weekends, or holidays. Employees shall be required to be on standby duty when assigned unless excused by supervision.
26
B.	Employees assigned to standby duty by their supervisor are guaranteed standby pay of two (2) hours pay at their regular straight time hourly rate for each eight (8) hour increment of standby time assigned and scheduled. Standby time shall not count as hours worked for the purpose of computing overtime pay.
C.	Employees while on standby duty when called to work will, in addition to the standby pay of two (2) hours for each eight (8) hours assigned, be paid for the actual time worked with a minimum guarantee of one (1) hour's pay for each call to work. For pay purposes, actual time worked starts at the time of notice and ends when he returns home. In the event any employee who is on standby duty fails to respond to a call to work, he will forfeit the standby pay and may be subject to possible disciplinary measures as provided in the Code of Conduct Rules.
D.	Employees shall not be assigned to standby duty if excused in advance by Management. In the event Management cannot schedule the required number of employees for standby duty then employees shall be assigned by Management.
Section 11.	The Employer agrees that the present Departmental policies concerning rest periods and meal periods shall be continued for employees covered by this labor agreement. In this connection, employees will normally have a scheduled paid or non-paid lunch period.
Nothing in this Section shall prohibit an employee from taking his unpaid lunch period away from his work location.
In the event an employee is required by Management to forego a scheduled non-paid lunch period, and the lunch period is not rescheduled later in the shift, the missed lunch period shall be added to the hours worked for the week for the determination of overtime to be paid.
The provisions of this Section pertaining to missed lunch periods shall not apply to employees who are normally paid for their lunch period and/or assigned to a continuous shift of work or are on a task assignment basis.
Section 12.	Nothing contained in this agreement shall be interpreted as requiring a duplication or a pyramiding of premium payments involving the same hours worked.
ARTICLE 10
SENIORITY, LAYOFF AND RECALL
Section 1.	Basis of Seniority
A.	Probationary Periods
1.	All newly hired full-time employees except those covered by special probationary periods shall be placed on probation for the first six (6) months
27
in the classification. In the event the employee accepts another position before his initial probationary period is satisfactorily completed, his initial probationary period begins at the time he starts working in the new position. All employees on probationary status shall be eligible for membership in the Union, and shall be entitled to the benefits outlined in this agreement except that the City may, at its sole discretion, terminate any employee during his initial probationary period. Any employee terminated during his initial probationary period shall be informed of the reason for his termination at the time he is notified. Employees serving an initial probationary period are ineligible to file appeals or grievances.
Special Probationary Periods
Employees in classifications for which special licenses or certificates are required which take longer than six (6) months to obtain shall have as their probationary period the same time as is required by the applicable local, state, or federal regulation or as is established by the City to obtain the certificate or license. Employees in this category of special probationary periods shall be eligible for membership in the Union and shall be entitled to all benefits in this agreement as any other regular initial probationary employee. After the completion of the first nine (9) months of the special probationary period, full-time employees may file grievances and appeals on matters concerning the interpretation and application of this labor agreement except in cases involving demotions and discharge for just cause.
Examples:	Water and Water Reclamation Plant Operator I, Emergency
Complaint Writer Trainee, or other Classifications for which licenses or certificates may be required in the future as requirements become known.
Employees affected by this special probationary period shall be advised of the requirement by their supervisor and the Department shall advise the Union.
2.	Employees transferred between Departments in the same classification will serve a three (3) month probationary period. However, if the transfer is due to a layoff, no probationary period will be served, although a Department may still conduct a performance evaluation after the first three (3) months if it so chooses.
3.	Any classified employee promoted to a new classification shall serve a six (6) month probationary period or special probationary period if applicable. At any time during this special or six (6) month probationary period, if Management or the employee determines that the employee is unable to perform the job or he does not obtain the required license or certification, the employee shall be returned to his previous classification provided a position is available, or employees in the Blue Collar Bargaining Unit may bump back to
28
a Maintenance Worker I position, provided the employee is able to do the essential functions of the job. In the event the employee bumps back to a Maintenance Worker I position, the employee will be placed on the eligibility list for his previously held classification for nine (9) months.
4.	Any classified employee demoted to a new classification shall serve a six (6) month probationary period or special probationary period if applicable. If the employee is demoted to a classification previously held in that Department for which the probationary period had been completed, then no probationary period will be served.
5.	Cumulative absences of thirty (30) calendar days or more, any suspensions from scheduled work, and time spent on light duty when the work performed on light duty does not encompass a significant part of the employee’s regular job duties shall be added to a probationary period.
6.	The probationary period may be extended up to a maximum of three (3) additional months by the Department Director at his discretion. In this connection, Departmental Management will inform the probationary employee of the reasons for the extension.
B.	City Seniority
1.	City seniority is understood to mean an employee's most recent date of employment or re-employment. Seniority will continue to accrue during all types of leave except for Leave of Absence Without Pay of more than thirty (30) consecutive calendar days which shall cause this date to be adjusted for an equivalent amount of time. Leaves of Absence Without Pay for periods of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less shall not cause the City seniority date to be adjusted.
2.	City seniority shall be used for purposes of computing vacations, service awards and other matters based on length of service.
3.	City seniority for the purposes of layoff and recall shall be defined as in Section B.1. above except that only full-time employment in a classified status in any classification shall be counted in calculating length of City service.
C.	Classification Seniority
1.	Classification seniority shall be understood to mean length of time in classification. After successful completion of the probationary period, length of time in classification reverts to date of entry, transfer or promotion to present classification. Seniority will continue to accrue during all types of leave except for Leave of Absence Without Pay of more than thirty (30) consecutive calendar days which shall cause this date to be adjusted for an
29
equivalent amount of time. Leaves of Absence Without Pay for periods of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less shall not cause the classification seniority date to be adjusted.
2.	Classification seniority as defined above in C.1. shall be used for all matters based on seniority except for layoff and recall.
3.	Classification seniority for the purposes of layoff and recall shall be defined as in Section C.1. above except that only full-time employment in a classified status in a classification covered by this labor agreement shall be counted in calculating length of service.
D.	Seniority Date Adjustment Exceptions
1.	Union Leave
A classified full-time employee returning from a Union Leave of Absence for a period not having exceeded twelve (12) months shall be reinstated in his former job and without loss of seniority.
2.	Illness Leave
Full-time employees having a minimum of five (5) years of City seniority shall suffer no loss of either City or classification seniority if on a Leave of Absence Without Pay for illness for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months.
E.	Loss of Seniority
Employees shall lose their seniority as a result of the following:
1.	Resignation
2.	Retirement
3.	Termination for cause
4.	Layoff exceeding twelve (12) months
5.	Failure to report to the Human Resources Department intention of returning to work within fourteen (14) calendar days of return receipt verification of certified mail of the recall offer notice.
6.	Failure to return from Military Leave within the time limits prescribed by law.
F.	Seniority List
The seniority list of these Bargaining Units shall be made available to the Union during the months of October, February and June. Such listing shall include the
30
payroll number, classification number, name, adjusted employment date, and adjusted classification seniority date for each employee in the Bargaining Units.
Section 2.	Layoff Procedure
A.	Notification
Management will notify the Union in advance of a pending layoff action affecting employees covered by this agreement.
B.	Order of Layoff
1.	When it becomes necessary to lay off employees in any classification covered by this agreement, the following shall apply:
•	Temporary employees
•	Initial probationary employees
•	Classified employees
a.	Classified employees will be laid off in the inverse order of their length of time in their classification. In the event two (2) or more employees affected have the exact same amount of service in the classification, the employee with the most consecutive years of City seniority will be deemed to be the senior employee. In the event two (2) or more employees affected have the exact same amount of City seniority, the employee with the lowest identification number will be deemed to be the senior employee.
b.	Temporary and initial probationary employees will be laid off first in any affected classification and shall not have recall rights. In addition, employees in a trainee or apprentice classification will be laid off before any employees in the classification to which the trainee is promoted upon completion of the trainee program will be laid off (example: all Water Reclamation Plant Operator I’s would be laid off before any Water Reclamation Plant Operator II’s were laid off). Unless the trainee or apprentice has previously held another City position and has the seniority to be placed in that classification, the trainee will have no recall rights.
c.	Promotional probationary employees having more than six (6) months service shall be returned to the classification from which promoted and placed on that seniority list in line with their classification seniority, except that employees cannot return to trainee and/or apprentice classifications.
31
2.	Return to the Bargaining Unit
a.	Employees returning to a Bargaining Unit within the prescribed probationary period shall retain all former classification seniority plus the time spent in probationary status.
b.	Employees returning to a Bargaining Unit as a result of demotion, layoff or transfer shall retain all classification seniority earned as a member of the unit for purposes of layoff.
c.	Employees returning to a Bargaining Unit shall slot in to their appropriate position on the seniority list in accordance with classification seniority and be considered for layoff under the terms of this Article.
C.	Classified Employees
1.	a. Classified employee who loses his position as a result of a layoff in any classification other than Maintenance Worker I shall have the right to a lower classification in his job progression ladder or any job in his Bargaining Unit he has previously held (except apprentice and trainee classifications) and for which he has completed the probationary period provided he has sufficient seniority in that classification series or previously held position.
b.	Employees who are affected by a layoff and have the right to a lower classification in their job progression ladder shall have their seniority from the laid off classification in a classification series added to their lower classification seniority for determination of holding in the lower classification in the series.
EXAMPLE:	Employee "A" is in the Tree Trimmer job progression
ladder, he was promoted up through the ranks and has seniority in each classification and is now classified as a Tree Trimmer Leadworker. Employee "A" has two (2) years as a Tree Trimmer Leadworker, three (3) years as a Tree Trimmer II and two (2) years as a Tree Trimmer I.
Employee "A" is caught in a layoff and is removed from the Tree Trimmer Leadworker classification in accordance with the procedure described in Section 2.B.
Since he is eligible to be placed in the Tree Trimmer II classification, he is so placed and now has five (5) years of seniority (add Lead and II time) to determine if he stays as a II or not.
32
Assume he cannot hold (he is the least senior employee even with five (5) years seniority and is to be laid off from the II classification).
Since he is eligible to be placed in the Tree Trimmer I classification, he is so placed and now has seven (7) years of seniority (add Lead, II and I time) to determine if he stays as a Tree Trimmer I.
c.	Employees who are affected by a layoff and have the right to another classification previously held will retain that position based on classification seniority.

ARTICLE 11
JURY DUTY
Section 1.	In the event full-time employees are summoned for jury duty, they shall receive straight time pay for the hours required to be absent from their currently scheduled work hours due to such jury duty. Employees who perform jury duty for only a portion of their regular scheduled workday are expected to report to work when excused or released by the court.
Section 2.	Employees called for jury duty shall promptly notify their immediate supervisor
so that arrangements may be made for their absence from work.
Section 3.	Full-time employees on jury duty while on scheduled vacation shall be allowed jury duty pay for that time served provided satisfactory evidence of the time served on such duty is presented to the Department Director.
Section 4.	In the event a holiday occurs during the period of an employee's jury duty, fulltime employees shall receive pay for such holiday.
Section 5.	The employees shall provide the Department Director with proof of jury duty service before compensation is approved, to include a signed statement from the Court Clerk noting each day spent on jury duty. In the event an employee participates on a jury which is sequestered, and he is unable to provide his Department Director with proof of jury duty service, a telephone call by the employee to the appropriate Department-designated representative will suffice until such time as the employee can provide the necessary documentation. When fulltime employee serves on jury duty for an entire workweek and is unable to provide the department with the appropriate documentation until the following scheduled workday, he will still be compensated for his hours of jury duty.
ARTICLE 12
BEREAVEMENT LEAVE
Section 1.	Full-time employees covered by this agreement will be granted time off with pay at their straight time hourly rate, not to exceed three (3) of their scheduled working days, if needed, to attend the funeral and/or to attend to related affairs in the event of a death in the employee's immediate family. Up to three (3) days may be taken prior to and including the date of the funeral or immediately following, but all days taken for bereavement leave must be taken within the seven (7) consecutive calendar days surrounding the date of the funeral. Full-time employees will be granted time off with pay for their regularly scheduled work hours not to exceed seven (7) consecutive calendar days if the funeral is held outside the State of Florida and is attended by the employee. Otherwise, three (3) days off with pay will be granted in the event an employee is not attending the funeral but is involved in making funeral arrangements or handling the deceased's affairs.
38
Section 2.	The employee's immediate family shall be defined as the employee's spouse, father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, father-in-law, mother-in-law, grandparents, great grandparents, stepparents, stepchildren, grandchildren, and spouse's grandparents.
Section 3.	Bereavement leave shall not be charged to annual or illness leave.
Section 4.	Should an employee require additional time other than provided in Section 1. of
this Article, he may request the additional time from the Department Director, or his designee. Upon approval by the Department Director, or his designee, any additional time used shall be charged to annual leave if the employee has hours accrued that can be charged.
Section 5.	The employee may be requested at the discretion of the Department to provide the Department Director with proof of death in his immediate family as defined in Section 2. of this Article before compensation is approved.
ARTICLE 13
MILITARY LEAVE
Section 1.	Employees covered by this agreement who are commissioned reserve officers or reserve enlisted personnel in the United States military, members of the Florida State National Guard, the Coast Guard, or Naval Reserve, shall be granted a leave of absence from their respective duties in accordance with the terms of Florida Statutes Chapter 115 and applicable federal law during such instances when they are ordered to military service or field training. Accordingly, employees who are called to perform active military service shall be granted a leave of absence for such service and the first thirty (30) calendar days of any such leave will be without loss of pay and without loss of seniority. Employees who are ordered to field training in an active or inactive duty training status shall be granted a leave of absence for such service and shall suffer no loss of pay or seniority for a period not to exceed seventeen (17) working days in any one (1) fiscal year. All other provisions of Florida Statutes Sections 115.07 and 250.48 shall also apply.
Section 2.	The employee who is commissioned for duty shall be required to submit an order or statement from the appropriate military commander as evidence of any such duty. Such order or statement must accompany the formal request for military leave at least two (2) weeks in advance provided it is not a recall to emergency duty.
Section 3.	Employees who are members of the Armed Forces Reserve or Florida National Guard shall be excused from work to attend inactive duty training drills as required. Evidence of membership in the applicable organization shall be provided to the Department by the employee. Requests for such absences from work can be made by the employee either orally or in writing. The submission of the applicable Reserve or National Guard training schedule will satisfy this requirement. The Department shall excuse the employee from work.
Section 4.	Occasions may occur when an employee who is a reservist in the military or a member of the National Guard may be called to active duty. When the Governor of the State of
39
Florida so orders for National Guard members or the Mayor or his designee chooses to exercise the discretion given him by state law for military reservists, the employee's military pay may be supplemented by an amount determined
ARTICLE 14
LEAVE WITHOUT PAY
Section 1.	Full-time employees may request Leave of Absence Without Pay. Such requests require the approval of both the Department Director or his designee, and, if the request is for a period of time which exceeds thirty (30) calendar days, the Human Resources Director. In cases where the leave period exceeds twelve (12) months, the action will not be final until the Mayor or his designee also approves. A written authorization memorandum covering the employee's absence and the consent of the Human Resources Director is necessary only if the leave exceeds thirty (30) calendar days with the memorandum to be dated from the first day of Leave Without Pay.
Section 2.	The decision to grant Leave Without Pay (Leave of Absence) is a matter of administrative discretion except that requested leave which is covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 shall be granted for eligible employees. Part-time employees may be eligible for leave without pay which is protected under the Family and Medical Leave Act, if otherwise eligible. Any leave granted in accordance with the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act counts towards the twelve (12) weeks of leave per year that must be granted (the “year” is defined as a “rolling” twelve-month period, which is the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the latest FMLA request). It will be incumbent upon the Department Director to weigh each request and determine each case on its own merits. If the request for Leave Without Pay is denied, the reason for denial shall be given in writing within three (3) working days, if possible, but no longer than five (5) working days from the date of the request.
Section 3.	An employee granted a Leave of Absence must keep his Department informed, every three (3) months, of his current activity (school, medical, military, etc.). In addition, he must keep his Department advised of his current address at all times. Also, an employee who is out due to the illness of a spouse, parent, or one of his children who requires his care as verified by a physician or health care provider as defined by the Family and Medical Leave Act shall have said illness supported and confirmed by a medical certificate.
Section 4.	An employee, while on an authorized Leave of Absence, who obtains either parttime or full employment elsewhere is required to notify his Department in writing within three (3) calendar days of accepting such employment.
Section 5.	Failure to comply with Sections 3. and 4. above may result in the employee being dropped from Leave of Absence status in which case he must return to duty or be dismissed.
Section 6.	An employee granted a Leave of Absence shall be returned to his former classification if the leave is less than ninety (90) days unless the Employer's or the employee's circumstances have so changed as to make it impossible or unreasonable to do so. If said leave
40
was taken under the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act, the employee shall be restored to his former position or an equivalent position.
An employee granted a Leave of Absence and who wishes to return before the leave period has expired, shall be required to give the Department Director at least two (2) weeks notice.
An employee granted a Leave of Absence in excess of ninety (90) days will be permitted to return to work provided there is an opening. In each case, the City shall make a reasonable effort to return the employee to his former position or a similar position of the same classification in another Department. If no opening exists, the employee shall be placed on the eligibility register for the classification he held for a period of nine (9) months.
Section 7.	Employees returning from a Leave Without Pay, provided there is an opening, shall return to the job classification and rate of pay held at the time of going on leave and, in addition, shall receive any negotiated increase that may be applicable to employees in these Bargaining Units. Employees returning from a leave covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act shall be reinstated to their former position or an equivalent position.
Section 8.	Failure to return to work at the expiration of approved leave shall be considered as absence without leave and grounds for dismissal.
Section 9.	Leave of Absence Without Pay for more than thirty (30) consecutive calendar days shall cause the City and classification anniversary date to be adjusted for an equivalent amount of time.
Section 10.	An employee who takes a leave of absence must use all of his accrued annual leave prior to being on a leave without pay status except that an employee may, upon request, reserve up to forty (40) hours of his annual leave, provided the leave is covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act. No illness leave, annual leave, holidays or any type of seniority will be earned by an employee for the time that the employee is on Leave Without Pay; however, any accrued illness leave will remain credited to the employee's account.
Section 11.	Group life and health insurance coverage may be continued for a maximum period of six (6) months while on authorized Leave of Absence, provided premium payments are kept current.
1.	A maximum delinquency period of two (2) months will be enforced for payment of premiums. If a monthly premium is delinquent and payment is not made by cash or payroll deduction from the next applicable pay period, coverage will be canceled as of the beginning of the delinquent period. If coverage is canceled, the employee will be notified in writing.
2.	Where the employee will be out of town during an approved leave exceeding thirty (30) days, payment arrangements must be made in advance so that premiums are kept current.
41
3.	If any coverage is canceled during an approved Leave of Absence, and the employee returns for active duty, coverage may be applied for and received upon proof of insurability.
Section 12.	Leave of Absence Without Pay (Employee's Illness)
In addition to the provisions of Sections 1. through 11., the following shall also apply for leaves without pay taken due to the illness of the employee:
1.	The maximum period group life and health insurance coverage may be continued shall be twelve (12) months.
2.	Seniority preservation shall be as follows:
Employees having a minimum of five (5) years of City seniority shall suffer no loss of either City or classification seniority if on a Leave of Absence Without Pay for the employee's illness for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months.
3.	All Leaves of Absence Without Pay for illness shall be supported and confirmed by a medical certificate executed by a physician or health care provider as defined by the Family and Medical Leave Act.
4.	Extensions of Leaves of Absence Without Pay in excess of the time provided for in #2. of this Section shall cause the individual's accrual of seniority to cease.
5.	An employee shall be terminated when on a Leave of Absence due to illness for any period in excess of authorized Leave of Absence unless written approval for an extension has been granted.
6.	Initial probationary employees without seniority may be granted a Leave of Absence Without Pay for their own illness not to exceed thirty (30) days. Such Leave of Absence shall not be extended. The employee's probationary period shall be extended to allow for leave granted by the Employer.
7.	An employee who requests a leave of absence for his own illness shall use all of his accrued annual and illness leave before being on leave without pay status, except that an employee may, upon request, reserve up to forty (40) hours of his annual leave provided the leave is covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act.
Section 13.	Union Leave of Absence
A classified employee granted a Leave Without Pay to accept a full-time Union position shall not have to advise his Department of his activity every three (3) months.
A classified employee returning from a Union Leave of Absence, for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months, shall be reinstated in his former job and without loss of seniority.
42
ARTICLE 15
ANNUAL LEAVE
Section 1.	Purpose of Annual Leave
The purpose of annual leave is to provide employees with the opportunity to be absent from work due to valid reasons without loss of pay or benefits.
Section 2.	Types of Annual Leave
A.	Vacation Leave (Rest and relaxation)
B.	Personal Leave (Paid absence from work)
-	Illness or injury of spouse or dependent children
-	Court appearances of a personal nature
-	Funerals of friends or relatives, other than those covered in the Bereavement Leave article
-	Nationally recognized religious holidays associated with employee's religious faith
-	Other justifiable reasons not covered above
C.	Emergency Leave - Provides, subject to the approval by the Department Director or his designee, unscheduled leave requested on short notice because of a critical situation which could not have been foreseen or prevented by the employee.
Section 3.	Annual Leave Accrual Rate
Employees shall earn and accrue annual leave based on the following schedule:
Total Annual Leave Hours
Years of Service	Accrued Per year per 2080 Pay Hours
Employment through 5 years	120 hrs
Beginning 6th year of employment	128 hrs
Beginning 7th year of employment	136 hrs
Beginning 8th year of employment	144 hrs
Beginning 9th year of employment	152 hrs
Beginning 10th year of employment	160 hrs
Beginning 12th year of employment	168 hrs
Beginning 13th year of employment	176 hrs
Beginning 14th year of employment	184 hrs
Beginning 18th year of employment	192 hrs
Beginning 20th year of employment	200 hrs
Regular part-time employees begin accruing hours on a prorated basis after the first six (6) months of employment.
43
Section 4.	General Provisions (Annual Leave Program)
A.	The maximum number of annual leave hours which may be accrued shall be twice the employee's yearly rate of accrual.
B.	Requests for annual leave shall be made in advance of use. In emergency cases, the Department Director may waive this requirement. Certain requests for annual leave may qualify and be covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993. If said leave is covered by this Act, it will be applied to the twelve (12) weeks per year of leave which must be granted to eligible employees by the City. (The “year” is defined as a “rolling” twelve-month period, which is the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the latest FMLA request.) In no event will the employee's annual leave account be reduced below forty (40) hours unless requested otherwise by the employee.
C.	An employee incapacitated and unable to work shall notify his immediate supervisor before his scheduled reporting time as designated by the Department, stating the nature of his illness and expected period of absence. Reporting procedures for employees unable to work, and for the usage of short term illnesses, shall be determined by the operational procedures and directives of the Department concerned. This procedure shall be followed for each day the employee is unable to work, unless prior approval is given by the Department. In the event that the employee is unable to call due to personal illness and can, in fact, substantiate that he was sick before returning to work, the absence without authorization will be removed from his record and the employee shall receive annual leave with pay if he has hours in his annual leave account that can be applied.
D.	Paid annual leave may not be taken during the initial six (6) months of employment or re-employment except for documented medical reasons related to the employee's own health, for the funeral of an individual not included in the bereavement leave policy, or other documented family emergencies.
E.	Employees may not request nor will they be paid for annual leave for hours not earned and accrued.
F.	Employees shall not be granted paid annual leave in excess of their accumulated leave account hours.
G.	The nature of an employee's job and the operational requirements of a Department, Division or Section may cause the Director to limit the scheduling of annual leave for vacation purposes during certain periods of the year. Based on operational requirements and when practical and in the best interests of the City, the Director may require the use of annual leave for vacation purposes in amounts of forty (40) or more hours. When a written request for annual leave (40 hours or more) is denied, the employee will be notified in writing.
44
Section 5.	Advance Pay
Employees may request advance pay prior to going on annual leave providing the leave request is forty (40) or more hours. This shall be strictly at the employee's option. Requests shall be honored when submitted at least two (2) weeks in advance of going on annual leave.
Section 6.	Pay Off of Account
Upon separation from City employment, employees shall be entitled to compensation for all earned, but unused hours to their credit, at their basic straight time hourly rate, on the effective date of separation. This provision does not apply to employees having less than six (6) months full-time service.
Section 7.	Illness
Employees granted annual leave due to their own medical conditions shall comply with the provisions relating to medical absences as provided in Article 16, Illness Leave. Those provisions will apply as though fully rewritten herein, and shall apply to paid leave under illness leave and annual leave interchangeably.
ARTICLE 16
ILLNESS LEAVE
Section 1.	Purpose
The purpose of the illness leave program is to provide full-time employees with basic salary during periods of illness in which they are medically incapacitated and temporarily unable to perform their job assignments.
Section 2.	Accrual Rate
Employees covered by this agreement shall accrue four (4) hours of illness leave for each eighty (80) regularly scheduled work hours on active pay status, with a maximum accrual of 1500 hours. Those employees who have illness leave balances above this maximum accrual as of the effective date of this agreement will retain their accrued balances but will not continue to accrue illness leave hours until their leave balances fall below the established maximum accrued hours.
Section 3.	Notification of Illness
A.	An employee medically incapacitated to the extent that he is unable to work shall personally notify his immediate supervisor or other approved Departmental representative at such time before the scheduled reporting time as designated by the Department, giving the reason for the requested illness leave and the expected duration of the absence. Occasionally, circumstances may prevent an employee from personally notifying the Department of an absence, in which case notification may be made by another person. If an employee is not able to notify,
45
and can substantiate this to the satisfaction of the Department Director, illness leave shall be authorized by the Department Director. In the event that the employee is unable to call due to personal illness and can, in fact, substantiate that he was sick before returning to work, the absence without authorization will be removed from his record and the employee shall receive illness leave with pay if he has hours in his account that can be applied.
B.	Employees shall follow Department notification and absence request procedures for each day the employee is unable to work. These procedures will be waived by the Department in the event the illness report reflects a specific period of time. Failure to properly report absences may cause an employee to be charged with an absence without leave.
C.	Certain requests for illness leave may qualify and be covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993. If such leave is covered by this Act, it will be applied to the twelve (12) weeks per year of leave which must be granted to eligible employees by the City (the “year” is defined as a “rolling” twelve-month period, which is the twelve-months immediately preceding the latest FMLA request). In cases involving leave protected by FMLA, the medical health care provider’s verification of the employee’s illness/injury must be provided utilizing the Certification of Health Care Provider Form.
Section 4.	Approvals
A.	Upon receiving proper notification from an employee requesting permission to be absent from work for illness reasons and prior to receiving the employee's physician's report, the Department may grant tentative approval to the employee to be absent for medical reasons pending further investigation. The Department may send home an employee who is too ill to work or would cause an unhealthy working condition if he/she came into contact with other employees.
B.	Illness leave shall be paid by the actual hours and tenths of hours used. An employee shall not be compensated for illness hours in excess of the amount of such leave accumulated to his credit.
Section 5.	Physician's Report (Illness/Injury Report)
Unless the Department Director specifically waives the requirement, an employee requesting illness leave for an absence of more than three (3) days shall be required to submit an illness/injury report (see form at end of this Article). The illness/injury report will not be accepted by Department Management unless it has been properly and completely filled out.
Only statements on forms signed by physicians as defined in the Florida Workers’ Compensation Law, Florida Statutes Chapter 440, shall be accepted for illness leave benefits.
46
Section 6.	Illness Recuperation
A.	Employees granted illness leave for medical reasons shall assist in promoting their recuperation by remaining at either their residence or another location approved in advance by the Department Director or his designee, and the attending physician. An employee authorized to be absent from work for illness reasons shall not engage in any recreational or work activities except upon receiving prior approval from his physician or the Department Director or his designee. In cases where the Department Director, or designee, has concerns that illness leave is questionable or being abused, permission to recuperate elsewhere other than the employee’s residence and/or to engage in recreational or work activities must be granted by both the employee’s attending physician and the Department Director, or designee. Abuse of illness leave privileges shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action.
B.	Other places of recuperation shall be permitted under the following conditions:
1.	Pre-authorization by a physician must be in writing with specifics.
2.	Pre-authorization must be on file with the employee's immediate supervisor and is to include the employee's address and phone number, if applicable, where the employee is recuperating.
C.	Employees recuperating from an illness in which there was no involvement with doctors or hospitals may request, through Department Management, another place of recuperation. Approval will be required in advance and the employee's address and phone number where the employee is recuperating are to be a part of the request.
D.	If, and whenever, illness leave may appear to be abused, the employee claiming/requesting such leave may be required to furnish the illness/injury report of a physician to support the necessity for such absence. The City reserves the right in all cases of illness, or reported illness, to require the employee to furnish this report. Abuse of illness leave privileges shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action.
E.	Department Management will use discretion in determining whether or not a visit is required to verify an employee's illness and a report made of the reasons for absence from duty.
F.	Should an employee be absent, claiming illness and fail to comply with the provisions of this Article, such employee shall then be charged with "illness leave without pay" and may be subject to discipline.
4 7
Section 7.	Workers' Compensation
An employee sustaining a Workers' Compensation covered lost-time injury may request the Department Director to apply any illness leave or annual leave hours in his account in order to obtain full basic take-home pay (as defined in Article 23, Section 8.D. in this agreement) while absent from duty from injury. In no case shall the amount of Workers' Compensation and the amount of illness or annual leave be more than the employee's base pay for that period. If light duty, as described below, is offered to an employee receiving Workers' Compensation benefits and the injury is covered by FMLA, the employee may decline the light duty, but will not receive any further Workers' Compensation salary replacement monies. The employee could use annual leave or illness leave, if eligible (see also Article 23, Section 6.G. and Section 7.G).
Section 8.	Light Duty
Many slight injuries and sickness may prohibit the performance of regularly assigned duties; however, there may be other duties that such employees may be able to perform without aggravating such injuries or sickness. Provided the physician states that 'light duty' work is acceptable and light duty is available as determined by the Department Director or his designee, the employee may, at Management's option, report to his supervisor for assignment within the Department. The Department may assign such duties as the health and condition permit of the involved employees only in cases where bona-fide work is available. The parties agree that light duty work is temporary in nature and is in no way to be construed as an alternative form of employment for an employee who is either permanently or on a long term basis unable to perform the essential functions of his job.
Section 9.	Pay Off Provision
During the term of this agreement, upon separation of employment for reasons of either normal or disability retirement, or the death of an employee who would otherwise be eligible for normal retirement, or upon removal of the employee due to a layoff, employees or their survivors shall be entitled to receive a payment of twenty-five percent (25%) of the unused accrued illness leave hours credited to their account, up to a maximum of three hundred seventy-five (375) hours. This payment shall be determined based on the employee’s basic straight time hourly rate at the time of retirement, death, or layoff.
Section 10.	Miscellaneous Provisions
A.	An employee making a Departmental transfer will retain any illness leave to his credit.
B.	Employees may not use illness leave for sickness or injury sustained while engaged in outside employment.

Section 2.
A.	A holiday must be taken as time off on the day observed as the holiday or paid on the same day that it is observed. Operations permitting, an employee shall receive a duty day off with pay for each of the listed holidays. In the case where a specific day off with pay is not given to observe a holiday, the holiday benefit shall continue to be eight (8) hours.
B.	A holiday is a day off with pay. This means that an employee works a day less than his regular number of work days in a week and he still receives his full forty (40) hours for pay for the week.
Example: Regular 40 Hour, 5 Day Work Week
Employee works four (4) full days and gets one (1) full day off to observe the holiday. He receives forty (40) hours for pay. Holiday pay is the difference between hours worked and forty (40) hours. If he is on a schedule of five (5) days of eight (8) hours each, he would have worked thirty-two (32) hours and gotten eight (8) hours holiday pay (40 hours total). If he does not get the specified day off and works five (5) full days in the week, then he receives eight (8) hours of holiday time in addition to his full five (5) days worked time (total of 48 hours), plus premium pay for the eight (8) hours over forty, since holiday hours count towards the computation of overtime.
Example: 40 hour, 4 Day Work Week
Employee works three (3) full days and gets the day off to observe the holiday. He receives forty (40) hours for pay. Holiday time is the difference between hours worked and forty (40) hours. If he is on a schedule of four (4) days of ten (10) hours each, he would have worked thirty (30) hours and gotten ten (10) hours holiday pay (40 hours total). If he is on a schedule of two (2) days of eight (8)
50
hours and two (2) days of twelve (12) hours, then his holiday time would be either eight (8) or twelve (12) hours, depending upon which three (3) days of his schedule were worked and which day the holiday fell on. If he does not get the specific day off and works four (4) full days in the week, then he receives eight (8) hours of holiday time in addition to his full four (4) days worked time (total of 48 hours) plus premium pay for the eight (8) hours over forty (40).
Other Odd Work Week Schedules
The same logic as described above shall be applied. Either the employee gets the day off with pay to observe the holiday (and receives full week's normal pay) or the employee works his full week and gets eight (8) hours of holiday time added to his pay, plus any premium pay for which he is eligible.
C.	If an employee is given a duty day off to observe a holiday but he is required to work part of the day due to operational requirements, then he shall receive holiday time for the day plus pay for the time actually worked, as well as any overtime premium for which he is eligible.
Example: 4 Days of 10 Hours Each Schedule
Employee given Thursday (10 hour work day) off for holiday. He works on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday per his regular schedule of ten (10) hours each day. He then has to come in and work four (4) hours on Thursday. He shall be paid for the thirty-four (34) hours worked, the ten (10) hours of holiday time for Thursday (total of 44 hours), and overtime premium pay for four (4) hours.
Section 3.	Employees on annual leave, annual military leave, jury duty, illness leave, bereavement leave and other absences from duty but on active pay status on the day the holiday is observed must use the holiday on the same day that it is earned.
Section 4.	An employee must be on active pay status or work his normal schedule of hours,
either on the regularly scheduled working day immediately prior to a holiday or the regularly scheduled working day immediately following a holiday, in order to qualify for the holiday time.
Section 5.	Employees who are scheduled and required by their supervisor to work on the day observed as a holiday must work that day to be eligible to receive holiday pay. An employee who is scheduled to work on the day observed as a holiday and reports sick will be charged with the holiday for that day. Section 4. of this Article will not apply to employees scheduled and required to work on the day observed as the holiday.
Section 6.	When a holiday falls on a Saturday, the preceding Friday shall be designated a substitute holiday and observed as the official holiday for that year. When a holiday falls on a Sunday, the following Monday shall be designated a substitute holiday and observed as the official holiday.
51
Section 7.	The Mayor or his designee will determine which departments or operations will be closed in observance of the holiday.
Section 8.	Employees assigned and scheduled to work on a holiday, and who in fact do work, shall receive their usual day's pay, eight (8) hours pay for the holiday, and any overtime premium pay for which they are eligible.
Section 9.	The current practice of permitting employees who must work the holiday to elect to store the eight (8) hours of holiday time which is in place for employees in the Police Department will continue. The use of stored holiday time may be granted at the discretion of Department Management. Stored holiday time earned but not used during the fiscal year shall be paid in the last pay period of the fiscal year or prior to an employee’s transfer or promotion to a classification which is not eligible for this banking of holiday hours provision. These hours shall be paid at the employee’s straight-time hourly rate of pay.

PAY
Section 1.	Labor Grades and Classification Assignments
A.	Classifications covered by this labor agreement shall be assigned labor grades as shown in Appendix "A" (Blue Collar Bargaining Unit) and Appendix "C" (White Collar Bargaining Unit) of this Article.
B.	Labor grade ranges covered by this labor agreement for the Blue Collar Bargaining Unit are shown in Appendix "B" of this Article.
Labor grade ranges covered by this labor agreement for the White Collar Bargaining Unit are shown in Appendix "D" of this Article.
Section 2.	General Wage Increase
A.	Employees covered by this agreement shall receive a two and one-half percent (2.5%) general wage increase for FY '09, a two and one-half percent (2.5%) general wage increase for FY '10, and a two and one-half percent (2.5%) general wage increase for FY '11. The increases shall be effective on the payroll period beginning dates show below.
B.	The appropriate pay period start dates are as follows:
PAYROLL GROUP
Fiscal Year	A	B	D
2009	9/22/08	9/29/08	9/29/08

2011	9/20/10	9/27/10	9/27/10
52
Section 3.	Progression in the Pay Plan
A.	Progression of employees in the Blue Collar Unit from their current step to the next higher step in the appropriate labor grade for their classification shall be automatic, except for the labor grades 350, 360, and 370 and will become effective at the beginning of the pay period in which the employee's anniversary date of classification falls. Employees in the labor grades 350, 360, and 370 will be eligible for pay adjustment/merit increases as defined in paragraph "B" below.
B.	Employees in the White Collar Unit and employees in Blue Collar labor grades 350, 360, and 370 are eligible for a pay adjustment/merit increase of three percent (3%) after each year in classification, contingent upon the employee receiving a satisfactory performance evaluation, which is defined as an evaluation with an overall rating score of "3.0", with no more than one factor rating below "3.0". The employee is eligible to receive this increase on his classification anniversary date until such time as he reaches the maximum pay rate established for his classification. In the event a three percent (3%) increase would put the employee’s pay beyond the maximum pay rate for his classification, he shall only be eligible for an increase which would place him at the maximum. If an employee does not receive a satisfactory performance evaluation, he shall not receive an increase at that time but shall be informed in what performance areas he needs to improve and given ninety (90) days to improve. Another performance evaluation shall be done at the end of the ninety (90) days and if the employee has corrected his deficiencies, i.e. he has improved his performance and achieved a satisfactory rating, then the three percent (3%) increase shall be given at that time, although there will be no retroactive effective date.
For employees who have provided exceptional performance during the year, the Department Manager may recommend an increase in accordance with Human Resources and Budget Department guidelines of greater than three percent (3%) but no higher than five percent (5%) for approval by the Human Resources Director or his designee.
Section 4.	Promotional Increase
A.	Employees in the Blue Collar Unit who are in step pay plans and who are promoted shall receive an increase of five percent (5%) above their current rate or the entrance pay step of the classification to which promoted, whichever is greater. If the five percent (5%) promotional increase is applied and results in a wage rate between pay steps, the higher step shall be used for placement in the labor grade. In no case, shall an employee be granted a rate that is above the maximum step for his assigned classification.
B.	Employees in either Bargaining Unit who are in pay band ranges and who are promoted to a higher paying classification shall receive a promotional pay increase of at least five percent (5%) or the entry pay rate of the classification to which promoted, whichever is greater. If the employee is within three (3) to six
53
(6) months of qualifying for his annual merit increase before being promoted, he can at the discretion of the Department Director, receive up to an additional two percent (2%) merit increase. If the employee has less than three (3) months before qualifying for the annual merit increase, he can receive up to an additional three percent (3%) merit increase.
Section 5.	Incentive Pay - Shift Differential
A.	Employees who work a continuous shift of at least eight (8) hours starting between 1:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. shall be eligible and paid shift differential of eighty cents ($.80) per hour for the hours worked on the shift. Day shift employees who are scheduled to work beyond their regular scheduled working hours shall be ineligible to receive the shift differential.
B.	Police Department Communication Center employees who work a continuous shift beginning between the hours of 1:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. (evening shift) shall receive a shift differential rate of ninety cents ($.90) per hour for all hours worked. Police Department Communication Center employees who work a continuous shift beginning between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. (night shift), shall receive one dollar and ten cents ($1.10) per hour for all hours worked.
If an employee is scheduled to work a shift which would qualify him for shift differential but uses annual leave, illness leave, bereavement leave or other leaves which continue the employee on active pay status for a portion of the shift, shift differential will be paid for the hours of the shift actually worked.
Section 6.	Inclement Weather Pay
A.	If it is raining when employees (except those on task basis) arrive at check-in location and are unable to perform their duties due to the inclement weather, they are to remain in the Department for a maximum of two (2) hours. Then, if the Department Director feels that the rain is likely to continue for a longer period of time, the employees will be excused for the remainder of the day. They will receive pay for three (3) hours that day with the additional hour being considered a bonus.
B.	Should the rain begin after the employees have started to work and the Department Director feels work must be stopped pending cessation of rain, then employees may be kept up to two (2) hours waiting time at the Department Director's discretion and then, if he feels it will not stop, employees will be excused for the remainder of the day and be paid for time worked, any waiting time, plus a one (1) hour bonus.
C.	Any bonus time authorized by the Department Director shall be paid at the employee's straight time hourly rate.
54
D.	Total time paid will be a minimum guarantee of three (3) hours with a maximum not to exceed the normal hours scheduled for that day.
E.	The provisions of this Section do not apply to overtime hours.
Section 7.	Acting Supervisor
A.	A full-time employee who is selected and assigned to serve as an Acting Supervisor for a minimum of one (1) shift shall be compensated at the same hourly rate of pay he would receive if he were actually promoted.
B.	All acting assignments shall be offered on the basis of qualifications for such assignment in the judgment of Departmental Management.
Section 8.	Communications Center Training Pay
Employees in the Police Communications Center in the classification of Emergency Complaint Writer (ECW) who are assigned to train Emergency Complaint Writer Trainees participating in the Center’s training program shall, while actively involved in training new employees (i.e., conducting classroom training or on-the-job training, or completing documentation for either) receive incentive pay of sixty cents ($.60) per hour. Likewise, Emergency Radio Dispatchers (ERD) who are assigned to train newly promoted or hired ERD’s, while actively involved in training these employees shall receive incentive pay of sixty cents ($.60) per hour.
For the purpose of receiving this incentive pay, holidays not worked, annual leave, illness leave, bereavement leave, jury duty leave, military leave and all other absences from duty shall not be considered as eligible hours worked.
Section 9.	Miscellaneous
It is agreed that classifications represented by the FPSU that are no longer utilized and have been deleted from Appendices "A" and "C" shall be reinstated at the equivalent labor grade upon reactivation of the classification in the future.

ARTICLE 19
SAFETY AND HEALTH
Section 1.	Departmental Management will make every reasonable effort to provide and maintain safe working conditions. To this end, the Union will cooperate and encourage the employees to work in a safe manner. Also Management will receive and consider written recommendations with respect to unsafe conditions or other safety ideas from any employee or the Union. Within thirty (30) days of receipt, Departmental Management shall give a written reply to the employee/Union regarding the disposition of their recommendation.
Section 2.	Departmental Management will provide proper and necessary safety equipment and devices for employees engaged in work where such special equipment and devices are necessary. Such equipment and devices where provided, must be used. Employees who fail to utilize provided equipment or devices will be subject to disciplinary measures. All safety equipment shall be kept in proper working order.
Section 3.	Management of the various Departments hereby agrees to continue individual Departmental policies of providing uniforms, foul weather gear, bump hats or safety helmets, work gloves, safety equipment and periodic replacement items where customary.
Section 4.	In the event an employee leaves the employ of his Department, he shall return all uniforms and safety equipment to the Department.
Section 5.	Employees purchasing industrial safety lenses with safety frames or safety shoes will be reimbursed as set forth in Section 6. of this Article for that purchase upon presentation of proof of purchase and a memorandum from the Department Director indicating that the item was required in the performance of the employee’s duties to maintain proper safety standards.
Section 6.
A.	The parties agree that the purpose of the safety glasses and safety shoe program is to encourage the use of industrial safety lenses and safety shoes for the protection of employees and to prevent serious injuries and in this connection, appropriate federal and state standards shall apply to these items (ANSI and OSHA).
B.	Employees will be reimbursed for the cost of industrial safety lenses with safety frames up to one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00). Reimbursement for industrial safety lenses with frames may be approved no more frequently than once every two (2) years, although reimbursement for single vision lenses up to seventy-five dollars ($75.00) or reimbursement for bifocal or “no line” lenses up to one hundred dollars ($100.00) may be approved no more frequently than once a year.
C.	Employees will be reimbursed for the cost of safety shoes up to eighty-five dollars ($85.00). Reimbursement for safety shoes may be approved no more frequently than twice a year, unless the employee elects to exercise the benefit
63
once a year, which would allow him to be reimbursed for the cost of safety shoes once a year up to one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
D.	For the purposes of this Section, a year is defined as the Employer's Fiscal Year.
ARTICLE 20
DISCIPLINARY ACTION
Section 1.	All employees are subject to the Rules and Regulations of the Personnel Management System except where this agreement takes precedence. However, it is understood by the parties that employees are specifically subject to the Personnel Management System Code of Conduct and Disciplinary Measures. The City agrees not to change the Code of Conduct without first giving the Union President written notice and an opportunity to consult and bargain the impact of said change and/or provide input for the City's consideration. The City further agrees that it will not modify a Code of Conduct rule that is interpreted by an arbitrator during the term of this agreement, without first negotiating said rule change with the Union.
Section 2.	For the purpose of this Article, the parties agree that disciplinary matters are of utmost concern and classified employees shall be afforded the opportunity of rapid, fair and equitable appeal procedures. In this connection, classified employees shall have the option of utilizing the Personnel Management System Appeal Procedure or the negotiated grievance procedure (in this labor agreement), but such employee cannot use both the Personnel Management System Appeal Procedure and the negotiated procedure.
Section 3.	Normally grievances are filed at the first step in either procedure; however, in disciplinary appeals from an involuntary demotion, dismissal or suspension in excess of eighty (80) consecutive work hours, the procedure outlined in Section 4. of this Article shall be utilized.
Section 4.	Disciplinary matters as referenced in Section 3. shall be appealed through one of the two available procedures at the option of the employee. The options available to the employee are:
A.	The direct appeal as provided in the Rules and Regulations of the Personnel Management System must be submitted or filed with the Civil Service Board within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date on which the employee was notified of Management's action. Direct appeals to the Board may be initiated with the Secretary of the Civil Service Board, (the Human Resources Director or his designee), by submitting a letter requesting an appeal hearing addressed to the Civil Service Board, P.O. Box 2842, Municipal Services Center, St. Petersburg, Florida 33731, or by appearing in person at the Labor Relations Office and requesting a Civil Service Board Appeal Hearing.
Decisions of the Civil Service Board concerning involuntary demotions, dismissals, or suspension in excess of eighty (80) consecutive work hours shall be
64
final and binding on the Mayor to implement within the period of ten (10) calendar days.
B.	The negotiated grievance appeal procedure shall be submitted or filed at the Step 3 level within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date on which the employee was notified of management's action. The Step 3 level of the grievance procedure is to be submitted to the Labor Relations office, and if not settled at this step, the appeal may be submitted to arbitration.
The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the aggrieved employee or the Union and the Employer to implement within the period of fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the Arbitrator's award.
Section 5.	In imposing progressive discipline on a current charge, or when considering termination, the supervisor will not take into consideration any prior infractions of the City or Departmental Rules and Regulations which occurred more than eighteen (18) months previously, assuming the supervisor has been aware of past infractions. Past infractions about which the supervisor was previously unaware, if of a Group III category, may result in discipline.
Section 6.	In any disciplinary appeals, the employee may seek Union assistance if he so chooses.
The aggrieved employee and the Union representative shall not suffer a loss of pay in the processing of grievances through either the Civil Service Board or Step 3 hearings. No loss of pay means that the employee will be paid as if he were at work for his normal schedule of hours. For example, if a grievance hearing begins at 3:00 p.m. and ends at 4:00 p.m., and the employee's normal schedule is 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. with one half hour for lunch, the employee will receive eight (8) hours of pay for the day. The Union representative will be coded as being on leave as shown on the time out slip contained in Article 5. of this labor agreement.
If a grievance is pursued beyond the Civil Service Board or Step 3, each side shall be responsible for any expenses incurred and both the Union representative, if applicable, and the aggrieved employee shall be on leave without pay status or may use annual leave for the time spent in preparation for or attending the hearing.
Section 7.	The appropriate Department Director shall forward a copy of any written disciplinary action within seven (7) calendar days to the appropriate Union representative. The employee shall be advised by the supervisor issuing the disciplinary notice of his appeal rights.
Section 8.	Chronic Offender
A.	Disciplinary actions taken against an employee include any disciplinary measures that result in an Employee Notice being issued.
B.	A chronic offender is described as an employee who has received several disciplinary actions and by his total behavior shows himself to be irresponsible and unsatisfactory for continued employment with the City.
65
C.	As a general guide, a chronic offender has on record any three (3) or more offenses of the same type (i.e., work or attendance-related offenses) or four (4) offenses, regardless of type, which have resulted in disciplinary action within an eighteen month interval.
D.	Management will review each chronic offender case to determine appropriate disciplinary action in terms of modifying termination if additional effort for correction is warranted by the individual employee's quality or quantity of work. Where an employee has made corrections in a specific area, the Department shall not terminate an employee on a totally unrelated charge that on its own merits would not warrant termination.
ARTICLE 21
GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
Section 1.	Discipline
A.	All employees are subject to the Rules and Regulations of the Personnel Management System except where this agreement differs; in those cases, the agreement governs. Employees are specifically subject to the Personnel Management System Code of Conduct and Disciplinary Measures which the City agrees not to change without first giving the Union President written notice and/or bargain the impact of said change and provide input for the City's consideration.
B.	In imposing progressive discipline on a current charge, the supervisor will not take into consideration any prior infractions of the City or departmental rules and regulations which occurred more than eighteen (18) months previously. In a situation where an incident occurred longer than eighteen months ago but has just become known by supervision, disciplinary action may be pursued if the incident involved the commission by the employee of a Group III level offense. An employee's entire personnel file may be considered in cases involving termination for a Group III level offense.
Section 2.	General
A.	The purpose of this Article is to establish machinery for the fair, expeditious, and orderly processing of grievances and is to be used only for the settlement of disputes between the Employer and employee, or group of employees, involving the interpretation or application of this labor agreement. All classified employees of this unit shall have the option of utilizing the Grievance and Appeal Procedure contained in the Rules and Regulations of the Personnel Management System or the grievance procedure established under this Article if the dispute or grievance involves the interpretation or application of this labor agreement, but such employee cannot use both. Part-time employees who are represented by this
66
Union may, after the first six (6) months of initial employment, grieve non-disciplinary issues only.
The Union shall be ineligible to file a general or class action grievance on matters that have already been filed by individual employees with or without the assistance of the Union.
B.	An employee covered by this agreement shall have the right to be represented, or refrain from exercising the right to be represented, in the determination of grievances arising under the terms and conditions of employment covered by this agreement. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent any employee from presenting at any time his own grievances which allege violation of a specific Article and Section of this agreement and having such grievances adjusted without the intervention or assistance of a Union representative. Adjustment of grievances shall not be inconsistent with the terms of this labor agreement.
When presenting his own grievance, the employee shall bear the full cost of time lost from work for an arbitration hearing, expense of his own counsel, preparation, presentation and the fees, services or other costs of an arbitrator, costs of transcripts, meeting/hearing room or other facility or any other appeal.
A grievance may be submitted by the Union, as the exclusive representative of employees covered by this agreement, as a general or class grievance. A Union general or class grievance shall be initially submitted by the Union President at Step 3 with the Labor Relations Division within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of occurrence. A grievance regarding the concerns of one (1) employee or disciplinary action involving one (1) employee will not be considered a class grievance.
Any Employer grievance will be filed by the Labor Relations Division with the Union President at Step 3.
C.	A grievance not submitted within the time limits as prescribed for every step shall be considered untimely and deemed null and void. A grievance not appealed to the next step within the time limits established by this grievance procedure shall be considered settled on the basis of the last answer provided by Management. A grievance not answered within the time limits prescribed for the appropriate Management representative at each step shall entitle the employee or the Union to advance the grievance to the next step. The time limits prescribed herein may be extended for good and sufficient reason by mutual agreement of the Union and Management. If the time limits are extended, the appropriate Management representative and the Union Representative and/or grievant will be so advised.
D.	The requirements in Steps 1 through 3 for written grievances and answers shall not preclude the aggrieved employee, the Union, and appropriate Management representatives from orally discussing and resolving the grievance. Oral
6 7
discussions up through Step 3 shall not cause the aggrieved employee and the Union representative to suffer any loss of pay and shall normally be held during regular working hours.
E.	In advancing grievances, the employee and/or the Union representative may call a reasonable number of witnesses to offer testimony from direct knowledge only. Employees shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Article 23, Section 11., while serving as witnesses, and shall be excused to testify during working hours provided such absence from their places of work in no way interrupts, delays, or otherwise interferes with proper and effective service to the community.
F.	The Union steward or Union representative shall be allowed reasonable time off without loss of pay during his regular shift hours in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 for investigating, presenting, and appealing grievances up to and including Step 3 of this procedure. The performance of this function by the Union steward or representative shall in no way interrupt the normal functioning of the Department. The Employer and the Union agree that maintenance of superior service and adherence to schedules are compelling commitments which may at times create delays and necessitate postponements. The Union agrees to guard against the use of excessive time for grievance activities which are authorized by this Article.
G.	Stewards or Union representatives shall provide advance notice to supervision to allow planning arrangements to enable the steward or Union representative time off for grievance investigative activity.
Prior to leaving their assigned work site to conduct grievance investigative activities, stewards and representatives shall obtain written permission from their immediate supervisor utilizing the Time Out Slip provided by Management. The steward or Union representative will contact the supervisor of the employee to be visited prior to contacting the individual employee. In the event the supervisor denies permission to contact the employee at that time, the supervisor shall set forth in writing on the Time Out Slip the reason for the denial and advise him as to when he can reasonably expect to contact the employee. When the supervisor summons the employee in response to the request, the supervisor will designate an area for conducting the meeting. Upon returning to his work site, the steward or Union representative will notify his supervisor of his return and turn in his completed Time Out Slip.
H.	For an employee submitting an initial grievance and appealing his grievance up through the various steps, the time described in this Article shall be the normal City business days and hours of operation, Monday through Friday.
I.	Employees will follow all written and verbal directives, even if such directives are allegedly in conflict with the provisions of this agreement. Compliance with such
68
directives will not in any way prejudice the employee's right to file a grievance within the time limits contained herein nor shall compliance affect the ultimate resolution of the grievance. No employee or group of employees may refuse to follow directions pending the outcome of a grievance.
J.	When grievances are granted resulting in the reduction of a suspension and providing an award for lost wages, said payment to the employee shall be made as soon as possible, but accomplished within fifteen (15) days, unless there are extenuating circumstances requiring an extension of time. In this event the employee will be notified and informed as to the reason for the additional time.
Section 3.	Grievance Procedure
A. Normally grievances are filed at the first step in the formal grievance procedure. However, in disciplinary appeals from an involuntary demotion, dismissal or suspension in excess of eighty (80) consecutive work hours, the grievance appeal may be filed directly to the Civil Service Board or under the negotiated procedure, to Step 3 of the Labor Relations step, within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date the employee was notified of management's action.
INFORMAL STEP
Within ten (10) working days of the occurrence of the matter from which the grievance arose, the aggrieved employee may, with or without Union representation, initiate a verbal grievance with his immediate supervisor having proper jurisdiction. Within two (2) working days, the immediate supervisor will verbally notify the employee of his decision.
FORMAL PROCEDURE
STEP 1
If the grievance is not resolved at the Informal Step, or if the employee elects to forego the informal step, the aggrieved employee may, within ten (10) working days of the matter from which the grievance arose, submit a written grievance on the prescribed form to his Manager. If the employee, Manager, and Union representative, if applicable, mutually agree in writing to waive Step 1, the grievance may be filed at Step 2. The ten (10) work day time frame would then apply to the filing of the Step 2 grievance.
The written grievance at this step, and at all steps thereafter, shall contain the following information:
1.	A statement of the grievance including date of occurrence, and details, and facts upon which the grievance is based.
2.	The Article and Section of the labor agreement alleged to have been violated.
69
3.	The action, remedy or solution requested by the employee.
4.	Signature of aggrieved employee, and Union representative, if applicable.
5.	Date submitted.
Grievances submitted which do not contain the above information may be considered incomplete and may be returned to the employee for corrections and resubmission, said resubmission to be within two (2) working days from the day the grievance is returned.
The manager shall within five (5) working days of receipt of the grievance meet with the grievant and/or the Union representative, if applicable, to discuss and seek a solution to the grievance. Within five (5) working days, the Division Manager shall give his answer in writing to the grievant and the Union representative as the case may be.
The written response at this step, and all steps thereafter, shall contain the following information:
1.	An affirmation or denial of the facts upon which the grievance is based.
2.	An analysis of the alleged violation of the agreement.
3.	The remedy or solution, if any, to be made.
4.	Signature of the appropriate Management representative.
STEP 2
If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the aggrieved employee may submit a written appeal to the Department Director, or his designee, within five (5) working days after receipt of the Division Manager's answer.
Within five (5) working days after receipt of the written appeal, the Department Director or his designee will meet with the aggrieved employee to discuss and seek a solution to the grievance. Within three (3) working days after the meeting, the Department Director or his designee shall give his written decision to the grievant.
STEP 3
If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2, the aggrieved employee may submit a written appeal to the Labor Relations Office within three (3) working days after the Department Director's or his designee's written answer. [See paragraph A. above for appeals eligible to be filed directly to Step 3.] The Labor Relations Manager or his designee shall meet with the aggrieved employee, Departmental Management, and Union representatives, if applicable, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of receipt of the written appeal to discuss and seek a resolution of the grievance. Within fifteen (15) calendar days after this meeting, the Labor
70
Relations Manager or his designee shall give his written recommendation to resolve the grievance to the grievant and a copy to the Union representative, if applicable. A grievance response postmarked within the fifteen (15) day time period shall constitute a timely response.
Section 4. Arbitration Referral
A.	If the employee grievance is not resolved at Step 3, the aggrieved employee or the Union may, within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the Step 3 written response, submit a request for arbitration to the Labor Relations Office.
B.	In general or class grievances, either the Union or the Employer may request to take the grievance to arbitration.
C.	Within ten (10) work days after the date of receipt of the arbitration request, the aggrieved employee and/or the Union representative, if applicable, and the Employer may meet for the purpose of preparing a joint arbitration agreement whereby the parties will attempt to define the issue or issues to be submitted to the arbitrator and jointly select an arbitrator.
D.	If the parties fail to mutually agree upon an arbitrator within ten (10) work days after the date of receipt of the arbitration request, a list of seven (7) qualified neutrals shall be jointly requested from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). The party requesting the arbitration shall be responsible for whatever fee may be charged at the time the list is requested; however, once an arbitrator has responded, either the losing party pays the fee for the initial list, or in the case of a split decision, both parties share the cost of the fee. Should the parties determine that the issue in dispute requires an arbitrator with special expertise, it shall be indicated in the request.
Within five (5) work days after receipt of the list, the parties shall meet and alternately cross out names on the list, and the remaining name shall be the arbitrator. If, for a Union or employee initiated Arbitration, the Union or employee fails to appear to strike names with the Employer within fifteen (15) work days from receipt of the list, the request for arbitration will be deemed to be withdrawn. A coin shall be tossed to determine who shall cross out first. If the selected arbitrator is not available within sixty (60) days, another list may be requested by the moving party and the above described procedures will be followed for selection from the list. Upon selection of the arbitrator, the parties shall jointly notify the Office of Arbitration Service (FMCS) of the selection.
If the grievant is not represented by the Union, the list of arbitrators shall be requested from the American Arbitration Association with the moving party paying whatever fees may be charged in connection with this selection process. Once a list has been obtained, the procedures detailed above shall be used for selecting an arbitrator.
71
E.	The date, time, and place of the hearing shall be established by consultation between the arbitrator and the parties concerned. The hearing on the grievance shall be informal and the rules of evidence shall not apply; however, to assure an orderly hearing, the rules of judicial procedure should be followed as closely as possible.
F.	The arbitrator shall not have the power to add to, subtract from, modify or alter the terms of the collective bargaining agreement in arriving at a decision of the issue or issues presented, and shall confine his decision solely to the interpretation or application of this agreement. The arbitrator shall not have authority to determine any other issues not submitted to him.
G.	The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the aggrieved employee or the Union and the Employer.
H.	The arbitrator's fee and expenses shall be borne by the losing party as determined and shall be so stipulated by the arbitrator. Where the Union represents the aggrieved employee in the arbitration proceeding and the arbitrator determines in favor of the Employer, the Union will be considered the losing party, and will bear the full cost of the award. In the event of a compromise or split award, the arbitrator's fee and expenses shall be borne equally by the parties to the arbitration.
The expenses in connection with attendance of participants and witnesses for either side shall be paid by the party requesting and producing such participants and witnesses.
I.	The arbitrator shall be requested to render his decision as soon as possible, but in any event, no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the hearing.
J.	In case of a grievance involving any continuing or other money claim against the Employer, no award shall be made by the arbitrator which shall allow any alleged accruals for more than one (1) pay period prior to the date when such grievance shall have been submitted in writing.
K.	Upon receipt of the arbitrator's award, corrective action, if any, will be implemented as soon as possible, but in any event no later than fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the arbitrator's award.
L.	Either party to this agreement desiring transcripts of the arbitration hearings shall be responsible for the cost of such transcripts, if available.

MATTERS APPROPRIATE FOR CONSULTATION
Section 1.	Matters appropriate for consultation between the parties include wages, hours and working conditions under the terms and conditions of this labor agreement and areas of mutual concern for the FPSU. For the purpose of this agreement, consultation is defined as a discussion of matters which are within the discretion of a Department. Consultations may be held in an effort to reach mutual understandings, receive clarification and/or information affecting employees in the various City operations that comprise Bargaining Units.
Section 2.	Consultation meetings between Union representatives and Management, shall be arranged by the Labor Relations Manager or his designated representative upon the request of either party. Consultation meetings may be called by the City consistent with confidentiality, or other legal restrictions to advise the Union of any anticipated major changes affecting the working conditions of employees in the Bargaining Units. Arrangements for any consultation meeting shall be made five (5) working days in advance whenever possible and an agenda of matters to be taken up at the meeting shall be presented in writing at the time a consultation meeting is requested. Matters taken up in consultation meetings shall be those included in the agenda and Union representatives up to a maximum of five (5) may attend any one meeting.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 1.	Pay Checks
A.	Normally, pay checks will be made available at the end of the day Thursday for employees in these Bargaining Units. The current pay period practice will be maintained for the term of this agreement. However, in the event any change
76
affecting a major segment of either Bargaining Unit is necessary, it will be a matter appropriate for consultation.

Section 5.	Promotional Appointments

In making a final selection among eligible candidates, other work-related factors may be taken into account; this includes but is not limited to such factors as current job performance, disciplinary record, prior work experience, and training. All of the above factors being equal, City seniority shall be the determining factor.

D.	In the event an employee uses all of his illness leave and annual leave accruals as per Section 8.B. of this Article, the Department shall place the employee on a leave without pay status. Such leave of absence shall be for a maximum of twelve (12) months from the first day of disability.

Section 8.	On-Duty Injury Benefit
A.	The Employer agrees to compensate employees covered by this agreement for on-duty injuries sustained by an employee while acting within the scope of their employment and not as a result of the employee's negligence as determined by the appropriate Director. Compensation shall be paid as a result of a work-related injury to an employee according to the provisions of this Article for the purpose of supplementing the wage benefit provisions of the Workers' Compensation Law of the State of Florida.
79
B.	An injury shall be determined to have been incurred while on duty only if such injury is a compensable injury under the Florida Workers' Compensation Law.

D.	The amount of on-duty injury pay shall be the amount of the employee's basic salary up to the time that Workers' Compensation wage benefits begin. When Workers' Compensation wage benefits begin, the on-duty injury pay shall be the difference between the Workers' Compensation wage benefits and the employee's current basic take home pay.
Basic take home pay is defined as basic salary after it has been reduced by normal federal withholding taxes (Social Security and income tax). Basic salary is the employee's straight time hourly rate times his basic work week hours (normally forty (40) for most employees covered by this labor agreement).
E.	In the event the disability extends beyond twenty-one (21) calendar days, the amount of on-duty injury pay paid by the Employer for the first seven (7) days shall be adjusted to equal the employee's basic salary, less the Workers' Compensation wage benefits payments.

G.	An employee granted this on-duty injury benefit shall be required to comply with the illness leave provisions of this labor agreement as pertains to substantiation of medical conditions and the performance of light duty as applicable. An employee who is released by his attending physician for light duty work who chooses not to work light duty will no longer be eligible for on-duty injury pay.
H.	In the event that the disability extends beyond twelve (12) calendar weeks, the appropriate Director may request a Workers' Compensation Supplemental Committee meeting. Upon approval of this Committee, an extension beyond twelve (12) calendar weeks may be granted not to exceed the maximum of twelve (12) months from the first scheduled work shift following the date of the injury. Until such time as the Committee meets, or if the extension is not approved by the Committee, the employee shall be allowed to utilize accumulated illness leave or annual leave to make up the difference between Workers' Compensation payments and basic salary.
8 0
I.	Illness and annual leave accruals shall continue for a maximum of twelve (12) months, if applicable, for employees who are receiving Workers' Compensation benefits due to an on-the-job injury.

All questions or concerns related to fees, benefits, service delivery, or other subjects shall be resolved between the employee-member and the respective providers, without involvement on the part of the City.
81
F.	The City agrees to share the premium expense on the same basis as defined in 'C' above for employee participation in any of the individual plans offered.

The rates paid by both the City and the employee shall be adjusted whenever increases become effective as the City is notified by the provider. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, shall be offered the option at the time of retirement of selecting coverage with a lifetime maximum benefit of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or any higher lifetime maximum benefit offered to current employees, but will be responsible for paying the entire cost of the coverage with no City contribution toward the premium cost.
H.	Effective January 1, 2010, for employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, the maximum cost for which the City will be responsible for any retiree health insurance plan coverage will be one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the City’s cost (seventy-five percent (75%) of the cost of the coverage with a lifetime maximum benefit of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000)) that is in effect on January 1, 2010, for the type of coverage elected by the retiree (single, dual, or family coverage).

4.	Time spent in court for depositions, or at an administrative hearing is the actual time required to report as stated on the subpoena or as scheduled, continuing until released by the judge or other administrative officer of the hearing.

B.	Requests for reimbursement for the loss or damage of personal property shall be submitted within three (3) working days from the date on which the loss or damage occurred.

D.	An employee shall submit a written request to his Department director, including a description of the item in question; description of the manner, place and time, if known, that the loss or damage occurred; a statement of the cost of the item; and some form of proof of ownership of the item (receipt, etc.)

Section 14.	Definition of Absence Without Permission or Leave (AWOL) for Application of Group II Level Rule
A.	The City's Personnel Management System Rules and Regulations Code of Conduct contains a Group II category rule concerning attendance related misconduct which states: "#20: Absent Without Permission or Leave (AWOL)". The parties agree the following will be the definition of AWOL in the application of this rule:
"Whenever an employee fails to call his Department in accordance with the Department's reporting requirements and fails to report for work by the time four (4) hours have elapsed from the start of his shift, the employee shall be deemed to be AWOL."
86
B.	In the event the employee is AWOL, he is subject to a possible two-day suspension, in accordance with the Code of Conduct guidelines. If the employee has annual leave accrued and wishes to use unscheduled annual leave to cover the portion of the shift he missed while AWOL, he may do so as long as he notifies his immediate supervisor before payroll has been submitted. In a case where the entire shift is missed, the Department may incorporate the missed day into a suspension, if one is given. Annual leave may not be used to offset the effect of a suspension on pay.
C.	The above referenced definition of AWOL does not preclude a Department from sending an employee home if crews have already departed for their work sites or another employee has already been assigned the employee's work for the day (e.g. a driver has been assigned to the route of an employee who has not called in late or reported for work). The employee may use accrued annual leave to prevent a loss of pay for the day or the Department may choose to count the day as part of a suspension, if one is given.
D.	The above referenced definition of AWOL is made for consistent application of the discipline for the specific Code of Conduct violation associated with that offense. This agreed to definition does not preclude a Department from issuing disciplinary action for other violations of the Code of Conduct such as tardiness or failing to follow Department rules associated with the advance notification prior to unscheduled absences.
Section 15.	Contract Modification
Provisions of this contract may be clarified, amended, or modified upon the written consent of the duly authorized representatives of the City (the Mayor or his designee) and the Union (Union President or his designee). No ratification by the legislative body or represented employees shall be required on said clarification, amendment, or modification.
Section 16.	Regular and Prompt Attendance
Employees in these Bargaining Units shall be held responsible for prompt attendance and absence/lateness reporting procedures in accordance with their current Departmental rules and regulations.

104
successor to the retirement system established by Ordinance No. 986-A, for the duration of this agreement.
ARTICLE 26
DRUG FREE WORKPLACE
Section 1.	The City and Union agree that providing a drug-free work place is not only desirable from the perspective of the Employer, but also from the perspective of the employees and citizens of St. Petersburg. Both the Employer and employees are interested in a safe and efficient work force which provides the citizens with the best service possible. The policies and procedures contained in this Article are for the purpose of achieving those goals.
Section 2.	Any employee covered by these Bargaining Units will be subject to competent medical examination if there is reasonable suspicion on the part of the employee's immediate supervisor and the Department Director, or his designee, that the employee is using or under the influence of illegal drugs or other controlled substances when taken without a prescription or without being under the care of a physician, while on duty. The City agrees to provide the Union with a list of the Directors and their Department designees.
"Reasonable suspicion" means observable signs that indicate to a reasonable person that an individual is using or under the influence of illegal or controlled substances or alcohol. Examples of observable signs are bloodshot eyes, dilated pupils, slurred speech, lack of coordination, the smell of alcohol about a person, radical mood shifts, possession of drug paraphernalia, and related behavioral patterns. In addition to the physical signs, a supervisor may observe performance problems as well. Anonymous phone calls will not constitute reasonable suspicion. Random testing is to be strictly prohibited under the terms of this Article, except that any employee of this unit who is required to have a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) as a condition of employment shall be subject to random, post-accident, return to work and follow-up alcohol/controlled substance testing under the applicable provisions of the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act as amended and mandated by federal law. Also, unannounced testing will be permitted as detailed in Section 5.
Section 3.	The procedure for drug testing will include the following:
A.	A urine sample will be taken at a medical facility licensed by the State of Florida. The sample will be sealed, and chain of custody procedures followed in transporting the sample to the testing facility. The testing will be done at the City's expense and will be conducted by a laboratory licensed by the State of Florida. The initial screening test will be the EMIT test. In the event that the first test is positive (indicates the presence of a drug), a Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry test using the initial sample will be conducted to ensure accurate results.
B.	An employee who is tested on a reasonable suspicion basis will be placed on an administrative leave-with-pay status pending the outcome of the test(s).
105
Departmental "field calendars" will not reflect an absence due to drug testing in those cases when a test is negative.
C.	If the first test result is negative, a second test will not be conducted and the employee will be returned to work. If the first test is positive and the second test is negative, the employee will be returned to work. In the event either the first or second test is negative, no disciplinary action related to drug use will be taken, and no record will be placed in an employee's file that the drug testing occurred.
D.	When an employee is suspected of using or being under the influence of drugs, as opposed to alcohol, a test will be conducted for the presence of drugs only.
Section 4.	Employees suspected of using or being under the influence of alcohol will be subject to undergoing a breathalyzer examination only. This test will be administered by qualified Police Department personnel.
Section 5.	An initial probationary employee who tests positive may be terminated at the discretion of the Department Director or designee and no appeal shall be permitted. A classified employee who informs the Director or designee that he will seek assistance for drug/alcohol use or abuse either voluntarily or prior to reasonable suspicion testing will not be disciplined for being under the influence while on duty. Successful completion of an approved rehabilitation program shall result in no disciplinary action against the employee for the first offense only. Any employee who uses this one-time option shall be subject to unannounced testing on duty for a period of one year. The City retains the right to discipline employees for other serious offenses that have been committed. The City will not pursue criminal prosecution as a routine part of its substance testing procedures.
In the event the Employee Assistance Program is no longer offered, the employee must seek, either through self-referral or recommendations of a professional counselor/doctor or counseling service, the assistance of any medical facility or agency (i.e., various hospitals offering dependency programs, PAR, Inc., or similar agency) licensed to provide a comprehensive rehabilitative program(s) for individuals with substance use problems. The rest of this Section would continue to be applicable.
An employee who is tested under the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act and tests positive for alcohol or an illegal substance, must comply with the Department of Transportation (DOT) requirement of utilizing a certified Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) for evaluation, referral, and education or treatment. The employee will be responsible for any cost necessary to comply with the evaluation and treatment regulations, if these costs are not covered by their health insurance plan.
Section 6.	In recognition of the importance of having a drug free work force worthy of the respect and trust of the public, the following shall be the policy for employees who are guilty of misconduct related to the use, possession, or sale of drugs:
106
A.	Employees who sell illegal drugs or controlled substances, either on or off duty, shall be terminated from employment.
B.	Employees who are in possession of or using illegal substances or are consuming alcohol while on duty, including meal and rest periods shall be terminated from employment unless the Department Director can document mitigating circumstances and obtain the approval of the Human Resources Director not to terminate.
C.	With the exception of Police Department employees covered in paragraph F. of this Section, all other employees who are under the influence of illegal substances or alcohol while on duty shall be disciplined in accordance with the City's Code of Conduct, (Group II offense), although other misconduct occurring at the same time may result in more severe discipline, depending upon the nature of the misconduct (an exception to discipline for being under the influence on duty is contained in Section 5.).
D.	Employees who are in possession of illegal substances or drug paraphernalia while off-duty and said possession constitutes a felony, shall be terminated from employment.
Employees who are in possession of illegal substances or drug paraphernalia while off-duty, and said possession constitutes a misdemeanor shall be disciplined (guideline: Group II offense) for the first offense and terminated for the second offense, unless a nexus exists between the employee's position and the drug possession, in which case the employee shall be terminated for the first offense.
E.	The policy contained in the City's Rules and Regulations regarding what occurs in the event an employee who is required to possess a driver's license for his position and who loses his driver's license shall apply for an employee who is driving under the influence off-duty.

Memorandum of Understanding between
The City of St. Petersburg and
The Florida Public Service Union (FPSU), SEIU: (’White Collar'Unit)
RE: Acting Supervisor Pay for employees in the Parking Enforcement Division of the Billing and Collections Department
The parties reached an understanding during the recent negotiations that there could be language clarifications that would need to be made as a result of the agreement to combine the terms and conditions for the two FPSU represented bargaining units into one contract book. It was understood that any unintentional omissions or oversights in the contract language would be corrected by the parties in a Memorandum of Understanding.
Accordingly, the parties agree there was no intent to change the provisions of the contract from the following terms contained in Article 18, Pay, Section 6, Acting Supervisor, of the prior "White Collar" collective bargaining agreement for employees in the Parking Enforcement Division of the Billing and Collections Department who are scheduled and assigned extra hours as an acting supervisor, and that these terms will continue to be part of the collective bargaining agreement between the City and the FPSU.
"A full-time employee who is required and assigned by management to serve as an acting supervisor for a minimum of one full shift of at least eight (8) hours shall be compensated for each hour worked in an acting capacity at the same hourly rate of pay he would have received if actually promoted to the supervisory classification, except that employees assigned to the Parking Enforcement Division of the Billing and Collection Department scheduled to work extra hours in addition to their normally scheduled hours of work may receive acting supervisor pay for the hours so assigned, i.e., when working these additional hours, the eight hour minimum does not have to be met."

The Public Utilities Department has need from time to time to assign an employee in a classification other than Water Reclamation Belt Press Operator to perform the duties of that classification, Because the duties of the Water Reclamation Belt Press Operator classification are somewhat unique and do not overlap with the duties and responsibilities of other classifications, the parties agree that the following shall apply whenever an employee in a lower paying classification is assigned io till in and perform the duties for at least one eight (8) hour shift:
When an employee is assigned to and does work out of class for at least one entire shift but no more than thirty (30) calendar days, such employee shall receive pay at either the minimum pay rate of the applicable range or the pay rate which will provide a five (5) percent increase in the pay rate, whichever is greater. If a five (5) percent promotional increase results in an hourly rate between pay steps, where applicable, the employee shall receive the higher Step pay.
Any assignment with a duration of longer than thirty (30) calendar days will be deemed to be subject to the temporary promotion parameters provided for in the current Rules and Regulations of the Personnel Management System for the City.
This pay provision shall become effective October 1, 2002.
