MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Local 829, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, and representatives of the County of San Mateo have met and conferred in good faith regarding wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment of employees in the representation units listed in Section 1, have exchanged freely information, opinions and proposals and have endeavored to reach agreement on all matters relating to the employment conditions and employer-employee relations of such employees.
This Memorandum of Understanding is entered into pursuant to the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (Government Code Sections 3500-3510) and has been jointly prepared by the parties.
This Memorandum of Understanding shall be presented by the Union to the employees to be covered hereby for ratification by said employees, and shall thereafter be presented to the Board of Supervisors and, if appropriate, to the Civil Service Commission as the joint recommendations of the undersigned for salary and employee benefit adjustments for the period commencing November 10, 2002 and ending November 4, 2006.
Section 1.	Recognition
Union Recognition
Local 829, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, hereinafter referred to as the "Union" or "AFSCME 829", is the recognized employee organization for the representation units listed below, certified pursuant to Resolution No. 38586, adopted by the Board of Supervisors on May 16, 1978.
(1)	Communication Dispatchers

The Union agrees that it has the duty to provide fair and non-discriminatory representation to all employees in all classes in the units for which this section is applicable regardless of whether they are members of the Union.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
1
2.1	Agency Shop
All employees employed in an AFSCME representation unit, except supervisors as defined in Section 2.4 C. below, shall as a condition of employment either:
1.	Become and remain a member of the Union.
2.	Pay to the Union an agency fee in an amount which does not exceed an amount which may be lawfully collected under applicable constitutional, statutory, and case law (e.g., Hudson v. Chicago Teachers Union, Local No. 1, AFL-CIO), which shall be less than the monthly dues paid during the duration of this Memorandum of Understanding, it being understood that it shall be the sole responsibility of the Union to determine an agency fee which meets the above criteria; or
3.	Do both of the following:
a.	Present to the Union and the Controller a written declaration that the employee is a member of a bonafide religion, body, or sect which has historically held a conscientious objection to joining or financially supporting any public employee organization as a condition of employment; and
b.	Pay a sum equal to the agency fee described above to one of three negotiated non-religious, non-labor, charitable funds that are exempt from taxation under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
2.2	Compliance
If any currently employed employee fails to authorize one of the above deductions within 30 calendar days of hire into a classification covered by this MOU, the County shall involuntarily deduct the agency fee from the employee's paycheck. The Controller shall determine the timing of such automatic deductions.
2.3	Maintenance of Membership
All employees who are members of AFSCME and who are tendering periodic dues through dues deductions from their San Mateo County biweekly paycheck and all employees who become members of AFSCME and who tender periodic dues through dues deductions of their San Mateo County biweekly paycheck shall continue to pay dues for the duration of this Memorandum of Understanding and each subsequent Memorandum of Understanding thereafter. For a period of one hundred and ten to ninety (110-90) days prior to the expiration of this Memorandum of Understanding and one hundred and ten to ninety (110-90) days prior to the expiration of any subsequent Memorandum of Understanding, any employee who is a member of AFSCME shall have the right to withdraw from the Union by discontinuing dues deduction. Said withdrawal shall be communicated by the employee during that period of time in writing to the County Controller to be delivered by certified mail and must be postmarked during the one hundred and ten to ninety (110-90) day period. An employee who is subsequently employed in a position outside of the units represented by AFSCME shall not be required to continue dues deduction.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
2
The County shall deliver revocations of membership to the Union on a biweekly basis and include verification that receipt was by certified mail. The Controller shall accept authorization for dues deductions on a biweekly basis.
2.4	Supervisory Classifications
For the purpose of this section, a supervisor or supervisory employee shall be an employee who regularly supervises the work of two or more employees and whose work customarily and regularly involves spending more than 50 percent of work time on supervisory, rather than journeyperson, activity. Classifications and positions meeting this definition are documented on a separate listing, additions to or deletions from this list during the term of this Memorandum of Understanding shall be by mutual agreement of the parties. Supervisors as defined above shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section 2.1, Agency Shop, but shall continue to be covered by Section 2.3, Maintenance of Membership.
2.5	Forfeiture of Deduction
If, after all other involuntary and insurance premium deductions are made in any pay period, the balance is not sufficient to pay the deduction of Union dues, agency fee, or charity fee required by this Section, no such deduction shall be made for the current pay period.
2.6	Reinstatement
The provisions of 2.1 above shall not apply during periods that an employee is separated from the representation unit, but shall be reinstated upon the return of the employee to the representation unit. For the purpose of this Section, the term separation includes transfer out of the representation unit, layoff, and leave of absence without pay.
2.7	Payroll Deduction
The Union may have the regular dues of its members within a representation unit deducted from employees' paychecks under procedures prescribed by the County Controller for such deductions. Dues deduction shall be made only upon signed authorization from the employee upon a form furnished by the County, and shall continue: (1) until such authorization is revoked, in writing, by the employee; or (2) until the transfer of the employee to a unit represented by another employee organization. The Employee and Public Services Department and the Controller's Office will work to provide that dues deductions are promptly terminated when an employee transfers out of union representation through a change in classification or status.
Employees may authorize dues deductions only for the organization certified as the recognized employee organization of the unit to which such employees are assigned.
Employees may voluntarily elect to have contributions deducted from their paychecks under procedures prescribed by the County Controller for the PEOPLE Fund (AFSCME). Such deductions shall be made only upon signed authorization from the employee and shall continue until such authorization is revoked in writing.
2.8	In the event that employees in a bargaining unit represented by the Union vote to rescind "Agency Shop" the provisions of Section 2.3 shall apply to dues-paying members of the Union.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
3
2.9	County Obligations
A.	Any new employees hired into a non-supervisory job class or positions covered by this Memorandum of Understanding shall be provided by the County with and shall execute an "Employee Authorization for Payroll Deduction" form selecting one of the following: 1) Union dues; 2) agency fee; or 3) if he/she qualifies, a fee equal to agency fee payable to one of three negotiated charities.
B.	All dues, service fees and PEOPLE deductions shall be transmitted to Local 829 in an expeditious manner.
C.	All transmittal checks shall be accompanied by documentation which denotes the employee's name, social security number, amount of deduction (including PEOPLE) and member or fee payer status.
D.	The County shall hand out agreed upon Union materials along with the Agency Shop forms.
2.10	Union Obligations
A.	The Union shall provide the County with a copy of the Union's "Hudson procedure" for the determination and protest of its agency fees. The Union shall provide a copy of said "Hudson procedure" to every agency fee payor covered by this Memorandum of Understanding and annually thereafter, and as a condition to any percentage change in the agency fee.
B.	Local 829 will supply the County with deduction authorization forms and/or membership applications.
C.	Annually, the Union shall provide the Director of Employee and Public Services with copies of the financial report which the Union annually files with the California Employee Relations Board, the United States Department of Labor (Form LM-2), or the Union's balance and operating statement for the prior year. Failure to file such a report within sixty (60) days after the end of its fiscal year shall result in the termination of all agency fee deductions without jeopardy to any employee, until such report is filed.
2.11	Hold Harmless
The Union shall indemnify, defend, and save the County harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits, orders, or judgments, or other forms of liability that arise out of or by reason of this union security Section, or action taken or not taken by the County under this Section. This includes, but is not limited to, the County's attorney's fees and costs.
2.12	Communications with Employees
The Union shall be allowed by a County department, in which it represents employees, use of available bulletin board space (17" by 14") for communications having to do with official organization business, such as times and places of meetings provided such use does not interfere with the needs of the department. The department involved and/or
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
4
Employee and Public Services will investigate problems that the Union identifies with respect to use of these bulletin boards.
The Union may distribute materials to employees within the unit it represents through County mail distribution channels if approved by the Employee and Public Services Director. This privilege may be revoked in the event of abuse after the Employee and Public Services Director consults with representatives of the Union.
Any representative of the Union shall give notice to the employees' department head at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance when contacting departmental employees during the duty period of employees, provided that solicitation for membership or other internal employee organization business shall be conducted only during the non-duty hours of all employees concerned. Pre-arrangement for routine contact may be made by agreement between the Union and the department head and when made shall continue until revoked.
2.13	Use of County Buildings
County buildings and other facilities may be made available for use by County employees or the Union or its representatives in accordance with such administrative procedures as may be established by the County Manager or department heads concerned.
2.14	Advance Notice
Except in cases of emergency as provided below in this subsection the Union, if affected, shall be given reasonable advance written notice of any ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation directly relating to matters within the scope of representation proposed to be adopted by the County and shall be given the opportunity to meet with the appropriate management representatives prior to adoption.
In cases of emergency when the foregoing procedure is not practical or in the best public interest, the County may adopt or put into practice immediately such measures as are required. At the earliest practicable date thereafter the Union shall be provided with the notice described in the preceding paragraph and be given an opportunity to meet with the appropriate management representatives.
2.15	When a person is hired in any classification represented by the Union, the County shall notify that person that the Union is the recognized employee organization for the employees in said classification and present that person with a copy of the current Memorandum of Understanding as well as an approved packet of information which has been supplied by the Union.
The County will provide the new employee orientation list to the unions each month. This listing shall include each employee's name, classification, and department number. Each Union shall be allowed twenty (20) minutes at the end of each new employee orientation session to speak to employees represented by the Union.
2.16	The County shall supply without cost to the Union a monthly with a data processing run of the names and classifications of all employees in the units represented by the Union. Such lists shall indicate which employees were having Union dues withheld from their pay checks as of the date the roster was prepared, the names added to or deleted from
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
5
the previous list, and whether each such change in status was by reason of leave of absence, termination or withdrawal from the Union. The lists shall be supplied without cost to the Union.
2.17	The County shall notify the Union of employees who are on a leave of absence status in excess of 28 days.
Section 3.	Union Stewards and Official Representatives
3.1	Attendance at Meetings
County employees who are official representatives or Stewards of the Union shall be given reasonable time off with pay to meet and confer or consult with management representatives or to be present at hearings where matters within the scope of representation are being considered. The use of official time for this purpose shall be reasonable and shall not interfere with the performance of County services as determined by the County. Such representatives or Stewards shall submit written requests for excused absences to the Employee and Public Services Director at least two (2) working days prior to the scheduled meeting whenever possible. Except by agreement with the Employee and Public Services Director, the number of employees excused for such purposes shall not exceed three (3) per Union, or one (1) from each of the following representation units:
Inspection and Regulation Unit
Institutional Services Unit
Licensed Vocational Nurse Unit
Parks Unit
Planning Unit
Professional Clinical Laboratory Technologist Unit
two (2) from each of the following representation units:
Health Services Unit
Plant and Equipment Maintenance Unit, and
three (3) from Human Services Unit,
whichever is greater, at any one time. If any employee's request for excused absence is not approved, such disapproval shall be subject to appeal to the County Manager whose decision shall be final.
The Union shall be allowed up to one hundred and fifty (150) hours of unpaid release time per calendar year for official representatives and stewards to conduct necessary internal union business. Requests for time shall be made to the employee's department head at least fourteen (14) days in advance.
Shop stewards working P.M. shifts shall be provided with two (2) hours of unpaid release time each month to attend Steward Council Meetings. It is acknowledged that Hospitals and Clinics administration will attempt to provide such release time, but that each instance must be considered on a case by case basis.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
6
Any denial of requested time off may be appealed to the Employee and Public Services Director whose decision shall be final.
3.2	Handling of Grievances
The Union shall designate a reasonable number of Stewards to assist in resolving grievances. The designation will depend on such circumstances as geographical locations, hours of employment, and departmental organizational structure. The Union shall notify the Employee and Public Services Director in writing of the individuals so designated. Alternates may be designated to perform Steward functions only during the absence or unavailability of the Stewards except by mutual agreement of the parties.
Stewards may be relieved from their assigned work duties by their supervisors to investigate and process grievances initiated by other employees within the same work area or representation unit. Requests for release time shall not be denied unreasonably. Stewards shall promptly report to the Union any grievances which may arise and cannot be adjusted on the job. Supervisory employees shall not represent non-supervisory employees in a grievance procedure where such activity might result in a conflict of interest. Neither a Steward nor the Union shall order any changes, and no change shall be made except with the consent of the appropriate department heads.
Whenever an employee is required to meet with a supervisor and the employee reasonably anticipates that such meeting will involve questioning leading to disciplinary action, he/she shall be entitled to have a Steward present if he/she so requests. It is not the intention of this provision to allow the presence of a Steward during the initial discussion(s) of an employee's performance evaluation.
Section 4.	No Discrimination
There shall be no discrimination because of race, creed, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age or legitimate union activities against any employee or applicant for employment by the Union or by the County or by anyone employed by the County; and to the extent prohibited by applicable state and federal law, there shall be no discrimination against any disabled person solely because of such disability unless that disability prevents the person from adequately performing the essential duties of the position.
Section 5.	Salaries
5.1	The salary ranges for all employees in the aforementioned representation units will be as set forth in the Exhibits which are attached hereto and made a part hereof. As reflected in the Exhibits, salaries shall be adjusted as follows: effective November 10, 2002, there shall be a four percent (4%) increase; effective November 09, 2003, there shall be a three percent (3%) increase; effective November 07, 2004 there shall be a three percent (3%) increase; effective November 06, 2005 there shall be a four percent (4%) increase.
The rates of pay set forth in the Exhibits represent for each classification the standard biweekly rate of pay for full-time employment. The rates of pay set forth in the Exhibits represent the total compensation due employees, except for overtime compensation and
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
7
other benefits specifically provided for by the Board of Supervisors or by this Memorandum of Understanding.
The rates of pay set forth in the Exhibits do not include reimbursement for actual and necessary expenses for traveling, subsistence, and general expenses authorized and incurred incident to County employment.
5.2	Entrance Salary
Except as herein otherwise provided, the entrance salary for a new employee entering County service shall be the minimum salary for the class to which he/she is appointed. When circumstances warrant, the Employee and Public Services Director may upon recommendation of the department head approve an entrance salary which is more than the minimum salary. The Employee and Public Services Director's decision shall be final. Such a salary may not be more than the maximum salary for the class to which that employee is appointed unless such salary is designated as a "Y" rate by the Board of Supervisors.
5.3	Salary Step Increases
Permanent and probationary employees serving in regular established positions shall be considered by the appointing authority on their salary anniversary dates for advancement to the next higher step in the salary schedule for their respective classes as follows. All increases shall be effective at the beginning of the next full pay period.
Hours of Service Necessary for Step Increases
(1)	After completion of 1040 regular hours satisfactory service in Step A of the salary schedule, and upon recommendation of the appointing authority, the employee shall be advanced to the next higher step in the salary schedule for the classification. If an employee is appointed at a step higher than the first step of the salary range for that classification, the first merit increase shall be after completion of 2080 regular hours of satisfactory service.
(2)	After the completion of 2080 regular hours satisfactory service in each of the salary steps above A,and upon recommendation of the appointing authority, the employee shall be advanced to the next higher step in the salary schedule for the classification until the top of the range is reached.
(3)	If an employee completes the 1040 or 2080 hours in the middle of a pay period, the employee shall be eligible for an increase as follows:
-- if the merit increase period is completed during the first week of a pay period the increase will be made effective with the start of the then current pay period.
-- if the merit increase period is completed during the second week of a pay period the increase will be made effective with the start of the next pay period.
(4)	If an operating department verifies in writing that an administrative or clerical error was made in failing to submit the documents needed to advance an employee to the next salary step on the first pay period when eligible, said advancement shall
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
8
be made retroactive to the first pay period when eligible. This section also applies to fully flexibly staffed promotions in which case the advancement shall be made retroactive to the first pay period when approved by the appointing authority.
Special Merit Increases
Upon recommendation of the appointing authority and approval by the Employee and Public Services Director, employees may receive special merit increases at intervals other than those specified in this Section. The Employee and Public Services Director's decision shall be final. Changes in an employee's salary because of promotion, upward reclassification, postponement of salary step increase, or special merit increase will set a new salary advancement hours balance for that employee.
Salary Step if Rejected During Probation
Employees who are rejected during the probationary period and revert to their former classification shall return to the salary advancement hours balance held in the former class unless otherwise determined by the Employee and Public Services Director. The salary advancement hours balance for an employee shall not be affected by a transfer, downward reclassification or a demotion.
General Salary Range Adjustments
Salary range adjustments for a classification will not set a new salary advancement hours balance for employees serving in that classification.
Prior Service Credits
(1)	A permanent employee accepting provisional employment in a higher or different class in the County Classified Service, and who reverts to the former classification, shall retain the salary advancement hours balance in the former class on the same basis as if there had been no such provisional appointment.
(2)	Upon recommendation of the appointing authority and approval by the Employee and Public Services Director, provisional, temporary, seasonal and extra-help employees shall be advanced to the next higher step in the salary schedule upon completion of the periods of service prescribed in this Section, provided that their service has been satisfactory. Continuous service in provisional, temporary, seasonal or extra-help capacity shall be added to service in a regular established position for the purpose of determining an employee's salary anniversary date, eligibility for salary increases, as well as vacation and sick leave accrual.
However, such service may not be added if it preceded a period of over twentyeight (28) consecutive calendar days during which the employee was not in a pay status, except when the employee is absent from his/her position by reason of an injury or disease for which he/she is entitled to and currently receiving Workers' Compensation benefits.
5.4	Salary Step When Salary Range is Revised
Whenever the salary range for a class is revised, each incumbent in a position to which the revised schedule applies shall remain at the same step as in the previous range, unless otherwise specifically provided by the Board of Supervisors.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
9
5.5	Salary Step After Promotion
When an employee is promoted from a position in one class to a position in a higher class and at the time of promotion is receiving a base salary equal to, or greater than, the minimum base rate for the higher class, that employee shall be entitled to the next step in the salary schedule of the higher class which is at least one step above the rate he/she has been receiving, except that the next step shall not exceed the maximum salary of the higher class.
5.6	Salary Step After Demotion
When an employee is demoted, whether such demotion is voluntary or otherwise, that employee's compensation shall be adjusted to the salary prescribed for the class to which demoted, and the specific rate of pay within the range shall be determined by the Employee and Public Services Director, whose decision shall be final; provided, however, that the Board of Supervisors may provide for a rate of pay higher than the maximum step of the schedule for the employee's classification, and designate such rate of pay as "Y" rate (see Section 5.8), and also provided that an employee demoted as a result of abolition of position shall be placed at the salary step in the lower classification which most closely approximates (but does not exceed) his/her salary in the higher classification.
If an employee takes a voluntary demotion to a classification previously held, the employee shall be placed at the same step in that classification which the employee held last. The employee's service time at such step shall be the same as the service time held at such step previously.
In order to further the movement from lower-level to higher-level careers, an employee taking a voluntary demotion to a classification in the higher series (e.g., clerical employee to Eligibility Worker I classification) shall be placed at the salary step in the new salary range which most closely approximates such employee's salary in the prior classification.
5.7	Reclassification of Position
An employee in a position reclassified to a lower classification shall have the right of either: (1) transferring to a vacant position in his/her present classification in the same or another department, provided the head of the department into which the transfer is proposed agrees, or (2) continuing in the same position in the lower classification at a "Y" rate of pay when the incumbent's pay is higher than the maximum step of the salary range for the lower classification.
5.8	"Y" Rate Process Upon Reclassification
When an employee is reclassified downward, he/she shall continue in his/her present salary range, with cost of living adjustments, for two years, at which point the employee's salary shall be frozen ("Y" - rated) until the salary assigned to the lower classification equals or exceeds such "Y" rate. The "Y" rate provisions of this Section shall not apply to layoffs, demotions, or other personnel actions resulting in an incumbent moving from one position to another.
5.9	Thursday Night Paychecks
The County will make biweekly paychecks available to employees who are assigned to and working a shift as defined in Section 8, on the Thursday evening prior to the regular
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
10
Friday pay day. It is understood that events may occur which may make delivery of Thursday paychecks impractical. The Union shall hold the County of San Mateo and its officers and employees including but not limited to the County Controller, harmless for failing to make available paychecks on Thursday evenings as provided above. Employees subject to wage garnishment shall not be eligible for Thursday night availability of paychecks.
5.10	Salary Step Defined
For purposes of salary administration in this contract a step is defined as 5.74%.
Section 6.	Days and Hours of Work
6.1	General
The standard work week for employees occupying full-time positions consists of forty (40) hours unless otherwise specified by the Board of Supervisors. The appointing authority shall fix the hours of work with due regard for the convenience of the public and the laws of the State and the County.
Employees occupying part-time positions shall work such hours and schedules as the Board and the appointing authority shall prescribe.
6.2	Alternate Work Week Options
The County may on a department by department, division by division or unit by unit basis offer alternate work week options. Such options may include but are not limited to 4/10 work week, 9/80 scheduling, flexible schedules and job sharing. Should a department or division agree to enter into an alternate work week agreement, the department except in cases of emergency as provided below also agrees to meet with the Union as soon as any problems with the alternate schedules are identified. Except in cases of emergency alternate schedules shall not be discontinued without such a meeting taking place. In all decisions regarding alternate work schedules the department heads decision is final.
In cases of emergency when the foregoing procedure is not practical or in the best public interest, the County may adopt or put into practice immediately such measures as required. At the earliest practicable date thereafter the Union shall be provided with the notice described in the preceding paragraph and be given an opportunity to meet with the appropriate management representative(s).
6.3	Voluntary Time Off Program
Full-time, permanent employees may request a reduction in their work hours by 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, or 20% through the Voluntary Time Off (VTO) Program as described in the County's Voluntary Time Off Policy as summarized herein. Employees may apply for the VTO Program at any time during the year. Application forms shall be made available through payroll clerks and the Benefits Office. Approved applications for enrollment received after April 1st of each year will be effective the first pay period in July of that year. Approved applications received prior to April 1st will be effective the pay period following receipt of approved applications in Employee and Public Services.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
11
Participating employees shall be considered to be in a full-time pay status and the voluntary reduction in work hours will not effect the following benefits:
-	Health Insurance Coverage
-	Dental Insurance Coverage
-	Basic Life Insurance
-	Short Term Disability
-	Pay for Work-Out-Of-Class
-	Step Increases

There will be no effect on accrual of vacation, sick leave and holidays; however, all regular or normal time taken off during the program for vacation, sick leave, holiday, or compensatory time will be compensated at the reduced hourly rate.
The following benefit areas may be impacted by VTO under the following circumstances:
Overtime: Overtime compensation will not begin until after forty (40) hours have been worked during any one work week, and voluntary time off shall not be considered as time worked when determining eligibility for overtime compensation.
Long Term Disability: Because the Long Term Disability Plan is based on the worker's salary, the reduced work hours and the corresponding reduced salary may lower the premiums and the benefits derived.
Retirement: VTO impacts years of service and the calculation of salary for retirement purposes. Workers should contact the Retirement Office for detailed information.
All applications are subject to approval by the applicant's department head. Applications which are disapproved by the department head, or which are approved for a lesser amount of time than requested will be reviewed by the County Manager and the Employee and Public Services Director whose decision is final.
Section 7.	Overtime
7.1	Authorization
All compensable overtime must be authorized by the department head or his/her designated representative in advance of being worked. If prior authorization is not feasible because of emergency conditions, a confirming authorization must be made on the next regular working day following the date on which the overtime was worked. Overtime worked must be in the job classification in which the person is regularly employed or in a classification for which the employee is authorized higher pay for work in a higher classification.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
12
7.2	Definition
Except as otherwise provided by Charter, any authorized time worked in excess of the forty (40) hour weekly work schedule shall be considered overtime and shall be compensable at the rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times the overtime worked, whether compensated by monetary payment or by the granting of compensatory time off.
Overtime resulting from required attendance at training classes or training meetings shall be compensable at the straight-time rate in an amount equal to the overtime worked unless monetary payment at a different rate is prescribed for an employee covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act. For the purpose of determining eligibility for overtime compensation, any absence with pay shall be considered as time worked. The smallest increment of working time that may be credited as overtime is six (6) minutes. Portions of six (6) minutes worked at different times shall not be added together for the purpose of crediting overtime. Overtime shall be calculated from the employee's base pay only unless monetary payment at a different rate is prescribed for an employee covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
7.3	Work Groups
The Employee and Public Services Director shall allocate all job classifications to the following described work groups for purposes of determining categories of employees to be compensated by monetary payment or by compensatory time off. The decision of the Employee and Public Services Director shall be final; provided, however, that prior to changing the work group of an existing classification covered by this Memorandum of Understanding the Employee and Public Services Director shall notify the Union of the contemplated change and if requested, discuss with the Union the reasons for the work group change.
(1)	Work Group 1: All employees covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act shall be allocated to Work Group 1. Employees in Work Group 1 may be compensated for overtime worked either by monetary payment or by compensatory time off, at the option of the employee. Compensatory time off which accrues in excess of eighty (80) hours must be liquidated by monetary payment. All monetary payments for overtime must be paid not later than the next biweekly payroll following the pay period in which the overtime was worked.
(2)	Work Group 2: Employees in Work Group 2 may be compensated for overtime worked only by being allowed compensatory time off.
No more than two hundred forty (240) hours of such compensatory time off may be accumulated at any one time.
When an employee in Work Group 2 is separated from County service, his/her remaining compensatory time shall be added to his/her final compensation.
Note: Work Groups 3 and 4 pertain to employees not covered by this Memorandum of Understanding.
(3)	Work Group 5: Employees in Work Group 5 are exempted from the Fair Labor Standards Act and may be compensated for overtime worked either by monetary payment or by compensatory time off, at the option of the employee.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
13
Compensatory time off which accrues in excess of 80 hours must be liquidated by monetary payment.
Notwithstanding the allocation of job classifications to work groups, any employee covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act shall be compensated in accordance with the Act.
Should the County, through some future Federal ruling, be exempted from the Fair Labor Standards Act, the County shall then revert to the base rate for the computation of overtime.
7.4	Employees required to report back to work during off-duty hours shall be compensated for a minimum of three (3) hours of overtime.
7.5	Compensatory Time Off
Utilization of compensatory time off shall be by mutual agreement between the department head and the employee.
The smallest increment of compensatory time which may be taken off is six (6) minutes.
7.6	Scheduled Workday
Employees covered by this Memorandum of Understanding will not have a scheduled workday reduced in whole or in part to compensate for time which they are ordered to work in excess of another regularly scheduled workday.
7.7	Out of Town Weekend Work Assignments
Any employee who is assigned work that requires him/her to be out of town on one or more weekend days shall be compensated as follows:
1.	Fifty dollars ($50.00) per day for each weekend day (Saturday and/or Sunday) the employee is out of town.
2.	Regular and/or overtime compensation as provided in this section for each hour actually worked during such assignments, subject to the usual pre-approval requirements.
3.	Travel time for such assignments shall be compensated at actual time traveled, portal to portal, at one and one-half (1%) time, when the travel occurs outside of the employees' regular work schedule.
Section 8.	Shift Differential
8.1	(1) Shift differential pay, for the purpose of this Section, is defined as pay at a rate
which is one step above the employee's base pay in the salary range for his/her classification. If the base pay is at the top step, shift differential pay shall be computed at one step above such base pay.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
14
(2)	Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, the biweekly shift differential pay for fulltime employees shall be at least Twenty Dollars ($20.00) above the employee's base pay, to be prorated for part-time employees.
(3)	Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, the shift differential pay for the Licensed Vocational Nurse and Licensed Vocational Nurse Trainee classifications shall be computed as set forth in Exhibit E, attached hereto.
8.2	Full-time employees who are assigned to work a shift which starts between 2:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. shall be paid at shift differential rates for all hours worked during such shift.
8.3	Full-time employees who are assigned to and work a shift of more than eight (8) hours which starts before 2:00 p.m. and includes at least five (5) hours worked after 2:00 p.m., shall be paid at shift differential rates for all hours so worked after 2:00 p.m.
8.4	A split shift is defined as a normal daily shift which is worked over a span of more than nine (9) consecutive hours. Employees required by proper authority to work a split shift shall be paid Three Dollars ($3.00) per each such split shift worked in addition to all other compensation.
Section 9.	Application of Differentials
If an employee has been receiving a shift differential or some other differential or pay for work-out-of-class as provided in this Memorandum of Understanding or in the Salary Ordinance for thirty (30) or more calendar days immediately preceding a paid holiday, or the commencement of a vacation or the commencement of a paid sick leave period, or compensatory time off, as the case may be, the applicable differential shall be included in such employee's holiday pay, vacation pay, paid sick leave or paid compensatory time. The vacation, sick leave, holiday and compensatory time off pay of an employee on a rotating shift shall include the shift differential such employee would have received had he/she been working during such period.
Section 10.	On-Call Duty
When warranted and in the interest of the County operation, department heads may assign employees to on-call status. Compensation for on-call duty shall be computed as follows:
Employees shall be paid an hourly rate of Three Dollars and ninety-five cents ($3.95) for time in which they are required to be in an on-call status, unless otherwise provided below.
Operating Room Technicians and employees of the Professional Clinical Laboratory Technologist Unit shall be paid the hourly equivalent rate of one-half (1/2) their base pay for time in which they are required to be in an on-call status. For the purpose of computing pay, overnight assignment will constitute one (1) day; a week-end in on-call status will constitute three (3) days for pay purposes.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
15
Radiologic Technologists and Respiratory Therapists shall be paid the hourly equivalent rate of one-half (1/2) their base pay for time in which they are required to be in an on-call status.
Environmental Health Division employees shall be granted eight (8) straight-time hours compensatory time off for each sixty-one (61) hour weekend shift during which they are in on-call status.
Refer to Exhibit E regarding On-Call Duty provisions for Licensed Vocational Nurses and Licensed Vocational Nurse Trainees.
An employee receiving call-back pay shall not be entitled to "on-call" pay simultaneously.
Section 11.	Bilingual Pay
A salary differential of Forty Dollars ($40.00) biweekly shall be paid incumbents of positions requiring bilingual proficiency as designated by the appointing authority and Employee and Public Services Director. Said differential shall be prorated for employees working less than full-time or who are in an unpaid leave of absence status for a portion of any given pay period.
Bilingual pay for employees carrying a caseload at least 50% of which is comprised of non-English speaking clients shall be paid a salary differential of Fifty Dollars ($50.00).
Effective November 7, 2004 the $40.00 differential shall be raised to $42.50 and the $50.00 differential shall be increased to $55.00.
Designation of positions for which bilingual proficiency is required is the sole prerogative of the County and the decision of the Employee and Public Services Director is final. The Union shall be provided listings of employees receiving bilingual pay twice a year.
11.1	Hiring and Selection
The County will continue to recruit and hire employees based on a specific need for bilingual skills.
11.2	Testing
All employees hired to fill positions requiring bilingual skills will be tested for bilingual proficiency.
11.3	Continued Use of Bilingual Language Skill
Employees hired to fill positions requiring bilingual skills may be required to remain in bilingual pay positions. Nothing herein precludes any of the above specified employees from promoting to higher classifications.
11.4	T ransfers
Transfers of employees occupying bilingual pay positions shall be in accordance with County policy and practice and shall not be in violation of the Memorandum of
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
16
Understanding. It is recognized that utilization of a bilingual skill may be the sole reason for transfer in order to meet a specific County need.
11.5	Review
The number and location of bilingual pay positions shall be periodically reviewed by management. If the number of filled positions in a specific division or geographical location are to be reduced, employees will be given reasonable notice prior to loss of the bilingual pay differential.
11.6	Administration
Administration of the bilingual pay plan will be the overall responsibility of the Employee and Public Services Department. Any disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the bilingual pay plan shall be referred to the Employee and Public Services Director whose decision shall be final.
Section 12.	Mileage Reimbursement Policy
12.1	General
Except where indicated below, the County does not reimburse employees for home to work and work to home travel. Any disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the mileage reimbursement policy shall be referred to the Employee and Public Services Director whose decision shall be final. As soon as practicable after notification is received from the IRS of a change in its allowable mileage rate, the County shall increase its rate to coincide with that set by the IRS.
12.2	Definition of Regular Work Location: The County facility(ies) or designated area(s) within the County where an employee reports when commencing his/her regularly assigned functions.
Any County facility(ies) or designated area(s) to which an employee is assigned for a period in excess of twenty (20) consecutive work days shall ordinarily be considered a regular work location and, as such, not subject to employee mileage reimbursement. Temporary assignments which extend beyond twenty days may be considered for a mileage reimbursement eligibility extension not to exceed a total of ten (10) additional work days. All approval authority for extensions rests with the Employee and Public Services Director whose decision shall be final.
An employee is entitled to mileage reimbursement under the conditions specified below:
1.	Once an employee arrives at his/her regular work location, any subsequent work related travel in the employee's own vehicle shall be eligible for mileage reimbursement.
2.	a) If an employee uses his/her own vehicle for travel to and from any required training program or conference, the employee shall be entitled to mileage reimbursement for all miles traveled unless the employee is leaving directly from his/her residence, in which case the total shall be less the normal mileage to or from the employee's regular work location.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
17
	b) If an employee uses his/her own vehicle for travel to and from any optional work related training program or conference the employee may, with department head approval, be eligible for mileage reimbursement up to the limits specified in paragraph "a" above.
3.	An employee who is required to travel from his/her residence to a location other than his/her regular work location shall be entitled to mileage reimbursement for all miles traveled less the normal mileage to or from his/her regular work location. For Example: An employee's residence is in Burlingame and regular work location is in San Mateo. Distance from home to work is 8 miles. Because of an early morning meeting, the employee must travel from home to Redwood City, a distance of 21 miles. Based upon the above rule, the employee would be entitled to 13 miles of reimbursement. This figure is arrived at by subtracting 8 miles (normal mileage from home to work) from 21 miles (distance from home to Redwood City).
4.	An employee who is required to engage in any work related travel at the conclusion of which the employee's work day will be completed shall be entitled to mileage reimbursement for all miles traveled less the normal mileage from the regular work location to his/her residence. For example: An employee's residence is in Palo Alto and regular work location is in Redwood City. Distance from home to work is 13 miles. The employee has a meeting at the Hayward City Hall (31 miles) which will not conclude until 5:00 p.m. and therefore, the employee will go directly home, a distance of 31 miles. Based on the above rule, the employee would be entitled to 18 miles of reimbursement. This figure is arrived at by subtracting 13 miles (normal mileage from home to work) from 31 miles (distance from Hayward to home). Any exceptions to the above policy may be considered on a case by case basis by the Employee and Public Services Director, whose decision shall be final.
Section 13.	Tuition Reimbursement
The County may reimburse an employee for tuition and related fees paid for taking courses of study in an off-duty status if the subject matter content of the courses are closely related to the employee's present or probable future work assignments. Limits to the amount of reimbursable expense may be set by the Employee and Public Services Director with concurrence of the County Manager. There must be a reasonable expectation that the employee's work performance or value to the County will be enhanced as a result of the course of study. Courses taken as part of a program of study for a college undergraduate or graduate degree will be evaluated individually for job relatedness under the above-described criteria. The employee must both begin and successfully complete the course while employed by the County.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
18
The employee must submit an application on the prescribed form to his/her department head giving all information needed for an evaluation of the request. The department head shall recommend approval or disapproval and forward the request to the Employee and Public Services Director whose decision shall be final. In order to be reimbursed the employee's application must have been approved before enrolling in the course. If a course is approved and later found to be unavailable, a substitute course may be approved after enrollment. Upon completion of the course the employee must submit to the Employee and Public Services Department a request for reimbursement accompanied by a copy of the school grade report or a certificate of completion. The Employee and Public Services Department shall, if it approves the request, forward it to the Controller for payment. Reimbursement may include the costs of tuition and related fees, but may not include costs of books or materials which become the property of the employee.
Section 14.	Layoff and Reemployment
14.1	Definition of Layoff
Any department head may, with the Board of Supervisors approval, layoff employees because of lack of work, lack of funds, reorganization, or otherwise when in the best interest of the County.
14.2	Notice of Layoff
The department head will give at least fourteen (14) days advance written notice to employees to be laid off except in an emergency situation in which case the Employee and Public Services Director may authorize a shorter period of time.
14.3	Precedence by Employment Status
No permanent employee shall be laid off while employees working in extra-help, seasonal, temporary, provisional, or probationary status are retained in the same classification unless that employee has been offered the extra-help, seasonal, temporary, or provisional appointment. The order of layoff among employees not having permanent status shall be according to the following categories:
(1)	Extra-Help or Seasonal
(2)	Temporary
(3)	Provisional
(4)	Probationary - among probationary employees in a given classification, order of layoff shall be according to reverse order of seniority as determined by total continuous County civil service, not continuous time in that probationary period. Employees in flexibly-staffed positions serving a second probationary period (at a higher level classification in the series) shall not be considered probationary for layoff purposes.
Seniority
Layoffs shall be by job classification according to reverse order of seniority as determined by total continuous County civil service, except as specified above. For employees within the Court, all Court service time counts in determining seniority within the Court. If an employee transfers or otherwise moves from the Court to a County position, or if an employee transfers or otherwise moves from a County position to the Court, only the
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
19
employee’s time in the Classified service counts in determining seniority for purposes of layoff.
The following provisions shall apply in computing total continuous service:
(1)	Time spent on military leave, leave to accept temporary employment outside the County government and leave to accept a position in the unclassified service shall count as County service.
(2)	Periods of time during which an employee is required to be absent from his/her position by reason of an injury or disease for which he/she is entitled to and currently receiving Workers' Compensation benefits shall be included in computing length of service for the purpose of determining that employee's seniority rights.
(3)	Time worked in an extra-help or seasonal status shall not count as County service.
(4)	Time worked in a permanent, probationary, provisional, or temporary status shall count as County service. Part-time status shall count at the rate of one (1) year of continuous employment for each 2080 straight-time hours worked.
If two (2) or more employees have the same seniority, the examination scores for their present classification shall determine seniority.
14.4	Identification of Positions for Layoff
(1)	The classifications in a flexibly staffed series are treated as one classification for purposes of layoff.
(2)	When a classification has formal numbered options, each of which specifies separate hiring criteria, each option shall be treated as a separate classification for layoff purposes.
14.5	Procedures
(1)	A displaced employee will be transferred to any vacancy with equivalent FTE status in his/her classification in his/her home department.
(2)	If no vacancy with equivalent FTE status exists in the employees classification in the home department an employee shall have the following options:
(a)	He/she may take the longest standing vacancy, County-wide, in his/her classification in another department, or
(b)	He/she shall have the right to interview for any other vacancies, Countywide, in his/her classification, or other classifications for which he/she has bumping rights. Employee who choose this option shall have a list of all vacancies provided by the County. The County will arrange for interviews for vacancies in which the employee is interested.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
20
(3)	Employees who are laid off shall have any of the following three choices:
(a)	Taking a voluntary demotion within the same department to any classification, at the employee's discretion, in which the employee had prior probationary or permanent status provided such a position is held by an employee with less seniority.
(b)	On a County-wide basis, displacing the employee in the same classification having the least seniority in County service. For the purpose of such County-wide move, County service, including military leave, shall be allowed at the rate of two-thirds (2/3) of the actual time so served.
The two-thirds (2/3) rule in this subpart (b) and subpart (c) below only applies to the computation for movement between departments. Total seniority is retained by the employee in his/her new assignment.
(c)	On a County-wide basis, taking a voluntary demotion to any classification, at the employee's discretion, in which the employee had prior probationary or permanent status provided such a position is held by an employee with less seniority. For the purpose of such County-wide move, County service, including military leave, shall be allowed at the rate of two-thirds (2/3) of the actual time so served.
(4)	Displaced employees may request the Employee and Public Services Director to place the employee's name on the promotional eligible list or open eligible list for any classification for which, in the Employee and Public Services Director's opinion, the employee is qualified. The employee's name will be above the names of persons who have not been displaced, ranked in the order specified in subsection 14.3.
(5)	Pursuant to Rule XI, Sections 11 and 12 of the Civil Service Rules as revised, an employee may, with the approval of the Employee and Public Services Director and the gaining department head, demote or transfer to a vacant position for which he/she possesses the necessary skills and fitness.
(6)	At the sole discretion of the Employee and Public Services Director, an employee may be allowed to transfer and displace a less senior employee in a position in which he/she had prior probationary or permanent status and which the Employee and Public Services Director determines is equivalent with respect to duties and responsibilities to the position the employee presently occupies.
(7)	A transfer is defined as a change from one position to another in the same classification or in another classification, the salary range of which is not more than ten percent (10%) higher.
(8)	Part-time employees shall not displace full-time employees, unless the part-time employee has held full-time status in the classification.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
21
(9)	In addition to all other options, employees in classifications at risk of being eliminated, as determined by the affected department head, may also be placed on the reinstatement list.
14.6	Names of Employees Laid Off to be Placed on Reemployment and General Eligible Lists
The names of employees laid off shall be placed on reemployment eligible lists as hereinafter specified. Former employees appointed from a reemployment eligible list shall be restored all rights accrued prior to being laid off, such as sick leave, vacation credits, and credit for years of service. However, such reemployed employees shall not be eligible for benefits for which they received compensation at the time of or subsequent to the date they were laid off.
The departmental reemployment eligible list for each classification shall consist of the names of employees and former employees having probationary or permanent status, and who were laid off or whose positions were reallocated downward as a result of reclassification. The rank order on such lists shall be determined by relative seniority as specified in subsection 14.3. Such lists shall take precedence over all other eligible lists in making certifications to the department in which the employee worked.
The general reemployment eligible list for each classification shall consist of the names of employees and former employees having probationary or permanent status, and who were laid off or whose positions were reallocated downward as a result of reclassification. The rank order on such lists shall be determined by relative seniority. Such lists shall take precedence over all other eligible lists, except departmental reemployment eligible lists, in making certifications on a County-wide basis.
The provisions of this subsection 14.6 shall not apply to employees who have accepted severance pay upon termination of employment.
14.7	Abolition of Position
The provisions of this Section 14 shall apply when an occupied position is abolished resulting in a classified employee losing status in his/her assigned classification in his/her department.
Section 15.	Severance Pay
15.1	Unless herein provided for in Section 15.3, in the event that an employee's position is abolished and such employee is unable to displace another County employee as provided in Section 12 of this Memorandum of Understanding, such employee shall receive reimbursement of fifty percent (50%) of the cash value of such employee's unused sick leave; provided, however that such employee shall be eligible for reimbursement only if the employee remains in the service of the County until his/her services are no longer required by the department head. The County shall make every effort to secure comparable employment for the displaced employee in other agencies, and if such employment is secured, the employee will not be entitled to the aforementioned reimbursement.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
22
15.2	Severance pay as described in Section 15.1 above shall not be denied because an employee refuses to take a position which requires twenty-nine (29) hours or less work per week.
15.3	If, during the term of this Memorandum of Understanding, a full-time employee in the class F020, Licensed Vocational Nurse, is laid off because a position is abolished as a result of the closing or the partial closing of San Mateo County General Hospital and such nurse is unable to displace another County employee as provided in the Rules of the Civil Service Commission, such nurse shall receive severance pay in the amount of One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) for each full year of completed service (severance pay for part-time nurses will be prorated on the basis of hours worked in the twelve month period immediately preceding layoff); provided, however, that such nurse shall be eligible for severance pay only if the nurse remains in the service of the County until his/her services are no longer required by the department head; and provided further, that the County reserves the right to reduce severance pay for any nurse by an amount not to exceed sick leave that was denied during the year immediately preceding termination.
As an exception to the foregoing, nurses who have worked on a regular basis for at least one (1) year immediately preceding layoff in one of the following specialties: Operating Room, Emergency Room, Intensive Care Unit or Electrocardiography shall have the option of either displacing another County employee as provided in the Rules of the Civil Service Commission or receiving severance pay if the department head determines that such specialty cannot be used on a regular basis elsewhere in the County. This determination may be appealed to the Civil Service Commission. Employees electing to receive severance pay as provided herein shall relinquish all reemployment rights to which laid off nurses are or might be entitled under the Rules of the Civil Service Commission.
This section 15.3 shall not apply to any nurse hired on or after January 1, 1980.
15.4	The County agrees to pay the County premium for three (3) months of medical coverage for an individual who is laid off. This coverage is contingent on the following conditions: a) the individual has not refused a County job offer; b) the individual is unemployed; c) the individual continues to pay their share of the premium and d) the coverage is for health only and does not cover dental or vision.
Section 16.	Holidays
16.1	Regular full-time employees in established positions shall be entitled to take all authorized holidays at full pay, not to exceed eight (8) hours for any one (1) day, provided they are in a pay status on both their regularly scheduled workdays immediately preceding and following the holiday. Part-time employees shall be entitled to holiday pay in proportion to the average percentage of full-time hours worked during the two (2) pay periods immediately preceding the pay period which includes the holiday. If two or more holidays fall on succeeding or alternate pay periods, then the average full-time hours worked in the two (2) pay periods immediately preceding the first holiday shall be used in determining the holiday pay entitlement for the subsequent holiday.

For County employees occupying permanent part-time positions who work a minimum of sixty (60), but less than eighty (80) hours in a biweekly pay period, the County will pay three-fourths (3/4) of the hospital and medical care premiums described above.
In either case cited above the County contribution shall be based on the designation by management of the position as either half-time or three-quarter time, not on the specific number of hours worked.
The County agrees to adjust the benefit status of part-time employees to conform to the budgeted FTE status of the position they occupy.
21.3	Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, employees whose employment with the County is severed by reason of retirement during the term of this Memorandum of Understanding shall be reimbursed by the County for the unused sick leave at time of retirement on the following basis:
(a)	For each 8 hours of unused sick leave at time of retirement, the County shall contribute towards one (1) month's premium for health coverage or for dental coverage for the employee and eligible dependents (if such dependents are enrolled in the plan at the time of retirement). The County shall not be obligated to contribute at a rate in excess of $160.00 per 8 hours of unused sick leave per month for the retired employee to continue health or dental coverage (e.g., if an employee retires with 320 hours of unused sick leave, the County will continue to pay the health or dental premiums on said employee for a period of 40 months). For workers who retire with 45% or more of the total amount of sick leave they could have accrued during their career with the County of San Mateo, the conversion rate for each 8 hours of unused sick leave shall be $190.00. Effective November 7, 2004, the $160.00 amount shall be increased to $165.00 and the $190.00 amount shall be increased to $195.00.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
34
Effective November 10, 2002, workers may increase the number of hours per month to be converted up to a maximum of 14 hours of sick leave per month. Such conversion may be in one full hour increments above a minimum of eight hours (e.g., if a worker converts 12 hours at the rate applicable until November 7, 2004, he/she would be reimbursed $240.00 instead of $160.00). The number of hours to be converted shall be set upon retirement and can be changed annually during open enrollment, or upon a change in family status that impacts the number of covered individuals (e.g., death of spouse, marriage and addition of spouse).
Should a retired employee die while receiving benefits under this section, the employee's spouse and eligible dependents shall continue to receive coverage to the limits provided above.
(b)	The County provides a specified contribution to retirees who have unused sick leave at the time of retirement. For each unused eight hours of sick leave at time of retirement the County will make a specified contribution, as defined above, to the monthly premium for the retiree. If the cost of the premium is greater than the County's contribution, the retiree pays the difference through their retirement pay warrant. If the cost of the premium is less than the County's contribution, the County will apply the difference to the retiree's Medicare Part B premium cost.
(c)	The County will provide up to 192 hours of sick leave (2 years of retiree health coverage) to employees who receive a disability retirement. For example, if a worker who receives a disability retirement has 100 hours of sick leave at the time of retirement, the County will add another 92 hours of sick leave to his/her balance. This sick leave will be converted at the rate of $160.00 per 8 hours of sick leave until November 7, 2004, at which time the conversion rate will be $165.00 per 8 hours of sick leave.
(d)	Employees who waive retiree health/dental coverage including COBRA rights may, upon retirement, convert each 8 hours of accrued sick leave for $100.00. Should this cashout be determined, either through legislative or judicial action, to constitute compensation earnable for retirement purposes, this provision shall become null and void.
21.4	Employees in the Licensed Vocational Nurse Unit shall be reimbursed by the County for unused sick leave at the time of retirement on the following basis:
For each day of unused sick leave at the time of retirement, the County shall pay for one (1) month's premium for health coverage for the nurse only, to a maximum of 180 months of continued health coverage. Should a retired nurse die while receiving benefits under this section, the employee's spouse and eligible dependents shall continue to receive coverage to the limits provided above.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
35
21.5	The surviving spouse of an active employee who dies may, if he/she elects a retirement allowance, convert the employee's accrued sick leave to the above specified limits providing that the employee was age 55 or over with at least twenty years (20) of continuous service.
21.6	Out-of-Area
Retirees who live in areas where neither Kaiser nor Aetna coverage is available, and who are eligible for conversion of sick leave credits to a County contribution toward health plan premiums, may receive such contribution in cash while continuously enrolled in an alternate health plan in the area of residence. It is understood that such enrollment shall be the sole responsibility of the retiree.
This option must be selected either:
1)	At the time of retirement or
2)	During the annual open enrollment period for the County's health plans, provided the retiree has been continuously enrolled in one of the County's health plans at the time of the switch to this option.
Payment to the retiree will require the submission to the County of proof of continuous enrollment in the alternate health plan, which proof shall also entitle the retiree to retain the right to change back to any County-offered health plan during a subsequent open enrollment period.
An out-of-area retiree who has no available sick leave credits for conversion to County payment of health plan premiums may also select the option of enrollment in an alternate health plan in the area of residence, provided that no cash payment will be made to the retiree in this instance. Should such retiree elect this option during an open enrollment period, rather than at the time of retirement, s/he must have had continuous enrollment in a County-offered health plan up to the time of this election. Continuous enrollment in the alternate plan will entitle the retiree to re-enroll in a County-offered health plan during a subsequent open enrollment period.
It is understood that the County is actively seeking coverage for out-of-area retirees under a nationwide HMO or other health insurance plan and that, should such coverage become available during the term of this Memorandum of Understanding, the County will meet with the Unions regarding substitution of this plan for the arrangement described in this subsection. Upon agreement by both the County and employee organizations such new plan will replace the cash option.
21.7	The County shall continue its practice of calculating employee contributions for health and dental premiums on a pre-tax basis consistent with Section 125 of the IRS Code.
21.8	Effective October 20, 1996 grandchildren of custodial grandparents will be eligible dependents on all health, dental, and vision plans, whether or not formal adoption has occurred. This eligibility is contingent on documentation which is acceptable to the Health Plan.

24.2	The County agrees to continue all benefit programs at current benefit levels as listed in the MOU and the Benefit Summary.
24.3	Agreement Implementation
Agreements reached as part of the Health Care Cost Containment Committee may be implemented outside of negotiations if employee organizations representing a majority of employees agree, providing, however, all employee organizations are given an opportunity to meet and confer regarding such agreements.
24.4	Benefit Booklets
The County agrees to receive and discuss any suggestions the Unions may have for improvement of the booklets or folders describing various employee benefits provided by the County.
Section 25.	Retirement Plans
25.1	Retirement Plan 4 participants hired on or after July 1, 1997, will be eligible for a maximum annual cost of living adjustment to the retirement benefit of two percent (2%) per year. There is no "banking" or "rollover" of any cost of living adjustment in excess of the annual adjustment.

25.2	The County will pick up the following percentages of employee’s statutorily required retirement contribution, but not of the employee’s contribution under Section 25.3 of this Agreement:
20% after the equivalent of 10 years of full time service (20,800 hours)
40% after the equivalent of 20 years of full time service (41,600 hours)
50% after the equivalent of 25 years of full time service (52,000 hours)
25.3	The County will implement the 2%@55 retirement enhancement (Government Code Section 31676.16) for employees in the General Retirement Plan on or before September 7, 2003. This implementation is contingent on reaching agreement with all
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
37
employee organizations representing employees in the General Retirement Plan or on enactment of legislation enabling implementation of such benefits by individual bargaining unit.
The County will implement the 2%@55.5 retirement enhancement (Government Code Section 31676.14) for employees in the General Retirement Plan in March, 2005. This implementation is contingent on enactment of legislation enabling the determination of member contribution rates to be based upon an annuity of 1/120 of final pay per year of service at age 55. This implementation is further contingent on reaching agreement with all employee organizations representing employees in the General Retirement Plan or on enactment of legislation enabling implementation of such benefits by individual bargaining unit.
The benefit enhancement under Government Code section 31676.16 (2%@55) shall be applicable only to those employees who retire after the County’s implementation of section 31676.16. The benefit enhancement under Government Code section 31676.14 (2% @55.5) shall be applicable only to those employees who retire after the County’s implementation of section 31676.14.
The enhancements will apply to all future service and all service back to the date of employment pursuant to the Board of Supervisor’s authority under Government Code section 31678.2(a). Government Code section 31678.2(b) authorizes the collection, from employees, of all or part of the contributions by a member or employer or both, that would have been required if either section 31676.16 or 31676.14 had been in effect during the time period specified in the resolution adopting either section 31676.16 or 31676.14, and that the time period specified in the resolution will be all future and past general service back to the date of employment. Based upon this understanding and agreement, employees will share in the cost of the 31676.16 or 31676.14 enhancements through increased retirement contributions by way of payroll deductions as follows:
•	Effective August 30, 2003, employees shall contribute 1% of compensation earnable as defined in SamCERA regulations
•	Effective August 28, 2004, employees shall contribute an additional 1% of compensation earnable as defined in SamCERA regulations for a total of 2%
•	Effective March 13, 2005, employees shall contribute an additional 1% of compensation earnable as defined in SamCERA regulations compensation earnable as defined in SamCERA regulations for a total of 3%
•	These contributions will not be reduced by the employer pick-ups described in Section 25.2.
The County will pay a general wage increase of pay as set forth in Section 5.1 of this MOU, and it is understood and agreed that this wage increase will help employees pay the increased retirement contributions set forth above.

The County shall provide an additional Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) of life insurance payable to the employee's beneficiary if the employee's death results from an accident either on or off the job.
26.2	Employees, depending on pre-qualification, may purchase additional term life insurance to a maximum of $250,000 for employee, $125,000 for spouse, and $10,000 for dependents. Applying for additional life insurance will not place an employee's current level of insurability at risk.
Section 27.	Long Term Disability Insurance
The County shall continue to provide its present long term income protection plan for permanent employees at no cost to said employees; provided, however, that in order to be eligible for such plan, employees must have been employed by the County for three (3) or more years.

The onset date shall be defined as the first workday the employee was unable to work.
The maximum benefit of the Long Term Disability Plan shall be Two Thousand Four Hundred Dollars ($2400) monthly. The County also agrees to cover under the LTD Plan, part-time workers who work a minimum of twenty (20) hours per week.

ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
42
Opportunities Program shall go directly to the Employee and Public Services Director and if not satisfactorily resolved then to the Civil Service Commission. Procedures that are appealable under this section have been mutually agreed to by the Career Opportunities Program Joint Labor/Management Committee.

Section 31.	Part-Time Positions Which Become Full-Time
When the workload increases so that a part-time position becomes full-time, the Employee and Public Services Director may at his/her sole discretion, certify that parttime employee to a full-time position in the same geographical location.
Section 32.	Geographical Displacement
32.1	If it becomes necessary to transfer permanently one or more employees from one geographical location to one or more work locations in different cities, employees at the original geographical location who are working in the affected classifications shall be given an opportunity to express their desires for transfer. In such cases the department head shall give consideration to length of service and transportation factors along with such job related criteria as he/she deems appropriate, provided where all of these criteria are relatively equal, length of service shall prevail. Nothing shall preclude a department head from temporarily assigning employees to work at a different geographical location when prompt action is required by the needs of the County. The County shall discuss these criteria with the Union before selecting employees for transfer.
32.2	Employees shall not be transferred from one geographic location to another for disciplinary reasons.
Section 33.	Change of Assigned Duties
No employee shall be required regularly to perform duties of a position outside of the classification to which he/she has been appointed.

In addition, under the conditions described in the Rules of the Civil Service Commission, a department head may temporarily assign to employees whatever duties are necessary to meet the requirements of an emergency situation.
An employee my submit to his/her department head a written request for re-evaluation of his/her position based on significant changes in job content or significant discrepancies between job content and the job description. If the employee feels his/her request has been unreasonably denied and he/she is performing duties of a position outside of the classification to which he/she is assigned, he/she shall have the right to file a grievance in
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
43
accordance with Section 38 of the MOU. If a study is conducted and the employee is denied the requested reclass, he/she shall have the right to file an appeal in accordance with Civil Service Commission Rule XIV, Section 1.B.
Section 34.	Pay for Work-Out-Of-Classification
When feasible, the County will offer work-out-of-class assignments to qualified, interested permanent employees prior to offering such assignments to extra-help employees. If offered, it is the employee's responsibility to inform management of their interest in work-out-of-class assignments. The intent of this section is to provide additional career development opportunities to permanent County employees when such assignments do not cause unreasonable disruptions to the work environment or work production.
When feasible, the County will offer to rotate interested, qualified employees in previously identified long-term (more than 20 days) work-out-of-class assignments in three month intervals. Work out of class assignments will not normally extend beyond one year. The intent of this section is to provide additional career development opportunities to permanent County employees when such assignments do not cause unreasonable disruptions to work environment or work production.
When an employee has been assigned in writing by the department head or designated representative to perform the work of a permanent position having a different classification and being paid at a higher rate, and if he/she has worked in such classification for five (5) consecutive workdays (or four consecutive workdays for employees on a "4/10 shift"), he/she shall be entitled to payment for the higher classification, as prescribed for promotions in subsection 5.5 of this Memorandum of Understanding, retroactive to the first (1st) workday and continuing during the period of temporary assignment, under the conditions specified below:
(1)	The assignment is caused by the temporary or permanent absence of the incumbent;
(2)	The employee performs the duties regularly performed by the absent incumbent, and these duties are clearly not included in the job description of his/her regular classification;
(3)	The temporary assignment to work-out-of-classification which extends beyond twenty (20) working days be approved by the Employee and Public Services Director, a copy of the approval form to be given to the employee; and
(4)	A copy of the department head's written approval must be submitted in advance to the Employee and Public Services Director. If the Employee and Public Services Director determines that he/she will not approve pay for work in the higher classification which exceeds twenty (20) workdays, the employee will be so notified and have the opportunity to discuss this matter with the Employee and Public Services Director whose decision shall be final.
When a work-out-of-classification assignment made in accordance with Section 34 for an individual employee extends beyond one year (or one full year equivalent for part-time
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
44
employees), that employee's salary shall be raised to the next step in the classification in which the employee is working out of classification, except that the increase shall not exceed the maximum salary of the higher classification.
Section 35.	Probationary Period
35.1	Probationary employees shall undergo a probationary period of 1040 regular hours, unless a longer period, not to exceed 2080 regular hours is prescribed by the Civil Service Commission for their classifications. Individual probationary periods may be extended with good cause upon request of the department head and concurrence of the Employee and Public Services Director; however, no probationary period shall exceed 2080 regular hours. If an employee is incapacitated due to medical conditions and is reassigned to work that is not part of the employee's normal duties, the probation period for the primary job will be extended for the duration of the reassignment. The employee shall be notified in writing of the probationary extension at the time of the reassignment.
Time worked by an employee in a temporary, extra-help, or provisional status shall not count towards completion of the probationary period. The probationary period shall start from the date of probationary appointment.
35.2	An employee who is not rejected prior to the completion of the prescribed probationary period shall acquire permanent status automatically. Former permanent employees appointed from a reemployment eligible list shall be given permanent appointments when re-employed. Permanent employees who are involuntarily demoted to lower classifications shall be given permanent appointments in the lower classifications.
35.3	An employee who is laid off and subsequently appointed as a result of certification from a general employment eligible list to a position in a different classification than that from which laid off shall undergo the probationary period prescribed for the class to which appointed. Former probationary employees whose names were placed on a reemployment eligible list before they achieved permanent status shall start a new probationary period when appointed from a reemployment eligible list.
35.4	The appointing authority may terminate a probationary employee at any time during the probationary period without right of appeal in any manner and without recourse to the procedures provided in Section 38 (Grievances) hereof, except when the employee alleges, and substantiates in writing that the termination was due to discrimination prohibited by county, state or federal statutes or regulations. If discrimination is alleged, the appeal or grievance shall be decided solely on the basis of whether or not the termination was due to discrimination; and unless it is determined that there was discrimination, the person or persons hearing the appeal or grievance shall not substitute their judgment for that of the appointing authority. In case of rejections during probationary periods, employees shall be given written notice, with reasons therefor, at once. The Employee and Public Services Director may, upon request by an employee rejected during his/her probationary period, restore that employee's name to the eligible list for that classification. However, the employee's name shall not be certified to the department from which rejected without approval of the department head.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
45
35.5	Permanent employees who transfer to another position in the same classification within the same department shall not be required to undergo a new probationary period in the position into which transferred.
Employees who transfer within the same class to another department may be required by the department head to start a new probationary period. If a new probationary period is a condition for transfer, the employee must sign a statement indicating an understanding of this fact prior to the effective date of the transfer.
If a new probationary period is in force, the employee shall have a window period of twenty-eight (28) days from the date of transfer to elect to return to his/her former position. Should an employee be rejected at a point beyond the window period, he/she shall have the right to return to their former department if a vacancy in their former classification exists. If no vacancy exists, such employees shall be placed in the longest standing vacancy, as determined by the requisition form date, County-wide. Should the longest standing vacancy entail "unusual" work hours, the employee shall have the onetime option of returning to the second longest standing vacancy should one exist. ("Unusual" shall mean work hours or work week dissimilar to those of the position from which or to which the employee was promoted.) If no vacancy exists, such employees shall displace the least senior employee as determined by Section 14. If no less senior position exists, then the employee shall be removed from County service.
Section 36.	Performance Evaluations
36.1	Formal Appeal
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 38 of the Memorandum of Understanding, appeals of permanent employees relating to performance evaluations which are below a standard score or rating set by the Employee and Public Services Director shall go directly to the Civil Service Commission. Upon receipt of the appeal the Commission will review the facts and order such action as it determines is appropriate. Appeals must be filed with the Commission within ten (10) calendar days after the evaluation's finalization. No evaluation shall be considered finalized until the employee has been given ten (10) working days for review and comment.
36.2	Informal Appeal
Permanent employees may also request an informal appeal of below standard evaluations. At the request of the employee and the union to the Employee and Public Services Director or his/her designee, a meeting will be arranged in an effort to clarify and, if possible, resolve areas of disagreement. Such meetings will be attended by the employee, his/her union representative, the employee's first and second level supervisors, and a representative of the Employee and Public Services Department. Informal appeals may be granted at any time prior to Civil Service Commission review.
36.3	Clarification of Probationary Evaluations
Probationary employees are entitled to clarification of below standard evaluations and may request that a union representative be present. All such requests must first be made to the Employee and Public Services Director, or his/her designee.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
46
Section 37.	Dismissal, Suspension, Reduction in Step or Demotion for Cause
The appointing authority may dismiss, issue non-punitive disciplinary letters to, suspend, reduce in step, or demote any employee in the classified service provided the rules and regulations of the Civil Service Commission are followed. A reduction in step is defined as movement to the next lower salary step in the range for the classification for a period not to exceed six months.
Any employee may either appeal such dismissal, non-punitive discipline, suspension, reduction in step or demotion to the Civil Service Commission or file a grievance in accordance with subsection 38.2 of this Memorandum of Understanding. Appeal to the Civil Service Commission must be filed within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of such charges. Grievances filed in accordance with subsection 38.2 of this Memorandum of Understanding must be filed within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of written charges. No grievance involving demotion, suspension or dismissal of an employee will be entertained unless it is filed in writing with the Employee and Public Services Director within fourteen (14) calendar days of the time at which the affected employee was notified of such action. An employee may not both appeal to the Civil Service Commission and file a grievance under subsection 38.2 of this Memorandum of Understanding.
A permanent classified employee may be dismissed, non-punitively disciplined, suspended, reduced in step or demoted for cause only. Any written notice of dismissal, suspension, reduction is step or demotion sent to an employee shall include a statement advising him/her of the right to be represented by the union concerning the disciplinary action.
Section 38.	Grievances
38.1	A grievance is any dispute which involves the interpretation or application of any provision of this Memorandum of Understanding excluding, however, those provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding which specifically provide that the decision of any County official shall be final, the interpretation or application of those provisions not being subject to the grievance procedure. If an employee files an EEOC, DFEH or administrative EEO complaint with the EEO Coordinator, the issue will no longer be subject to this grievance procedure, but will be processed in accordance with regulations or procedures governing the processing of said complaints. An employee may, however, file an EEOC, DFEH or administrative EEO complaint and may also file a grievance if the grounds for the grievance are not based on discrimination and/or sexual harassment.
38.2	Grievances shall be processed in the following manner:
(a)	Step 1. Department Head and/or the Designated Representative
Any employee who believes that he/she has a grievance may discuss his/her complaint with such management official in the department in which he/she works as the department head may designate. If the issue is not resolved within the department, or if the employee elects to submit his/her grievance directly to the Union recognized as the representative of his/her classification, the procedures hereinafter specified may be invoked, provided, however, that all complaints
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006

Such notification must be filed (as determined by postmark) within twenty-eight (28) calendar days from the date of the employee's knowledge of an alleged grievance. Any grievances involving demotion, non-punitive discipline, suspension, reduction in step or dismissal must be received within fourteen (14) calendar days (as determined by postmark) after receipt of written notification of such disciplinary action. The Employee and Public Services Director or his/her designated representative shall have twenty-eight (28) calendar days in which to investigate the merits of the complaint, to meet with the complainant and, if the complainant is not the Union, to meet also with the officials of the Union, and to settle the grievance. No grievance may be processed under paragraph (c) below which has not first been filed and investigated in accordance with this paragraph (b).
(c)	Step 3. Adjustment Board
If the parties are unable to reach a mutually satisfactory accord on any grievance which arises and is presented during the term of this Memorandum of Understanding, the Union may advance the grievance to an Adjustment Board by submitting a written request to the Employee and Public Services Director within twenty-eight (28) calendar days from the date that the grievance is denied at Step 2. The Adjustment Board shall be comprised of two (2) representatives designated by the Union and two (2) representatives designated by the County. Either party may request that one member of the Adjustment Board for the other party not be a County employee. Adjustment boards shall be convened within twenty-eight (28) calendar days from the date such notification is received.
(d)	Step 4. Arbitration
If an Adjustment Board is unable to arrive at a majority decision, the Union may advance the grievance to arbitration by submitting a written request to the Employee and Public Services Director within twenty-eight (28) calendar days after receipt of the Adjustment Board decision. When arbitration is invoked in a timely manner, an impartial arbitrator shall be designated by mutual agreement between the Union and the Employee and Public Services Director. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and of the Court Reporter shall be shared equally by the Union and the County. Each party, however, shall bear the costs of its own presentation, including preparation and post-hearing briefs, if any.
38.3	Scope of Adjustment Board and Arbitration Decisions
(a)	Decisions of Adjustment Boards and arbitrators on matters properly before them shall be final and binding on the parties hereto, to the extent permitted by the Charter of the County.
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
48
(b)	No Adjustment Board and no arbitrator shall entertain, hear, decide or make recommendations on any dispute unless such dispute involves a position in a unit represented by the Union which has been certified as the recognized employee organization for such unit and unless such dispute falls within the definition of a grievance as set forth in subsection 38.1.
(c)	Proposals to add to or change this Memorandum of Understanding or written agreements or addenda supplementary hereto shall not be arbitrable and no proposal to modify, amend or terminate this Memorandum of Understanding, nor any matter or subject arising out of or in connection with such proposals, may be referred to arbitration under this Section. Neither any Adjustment Board nor any arbitrator shall have the power to amend or modify this Memorandum of Understanding or written agreements or addenda supplementary hereto or to establish any new terms or conditions of employment.
(d)	If the Employee and Public Services Director pursuant to the procedures outlined in subsection 38.2 (b) above, or the Adjustment Board pursuant to the provisions of subsection 38.2 (c) above resolve a grievance which involves suspension or discharge, they may agree to payment for lost time or to reinstatement with or without payment for lost time.
38.4	Compensation Complaints
All complaints involving or concerning the payment of compensation shall be initially filed in writing with the Employee and Public Services Director. Only complaints which allege that employees are not being compensated in accordance with the provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding shall be considered as grievances. Any other matters of compensation are to be resolved in the meet and confer process if not detailed in the Memorandum of Understanding which results from such meet and confer process shall be deemed withdrawn until the meet and confer process is next opened for such discussion. No adjustment shall be retroactive for more than sixty (60) calendar days from the date upon which the complaint was filed.
No change in this Memorandum of Understanding or interpretations thereof (except interpretations resulting from Adjustment Board or arbitration proceedings hereunder) will be recognized unless agreed to by the County and the Union.
38.5	No Strike
The Union, its members and representatives, agree that it and they will not engage in, authorize, sanction or support any strike, slowdown, stoppage of work, curtailment of production, concerted refusal of overtime work, refusal to operate designated equipment (provided such equipment is safe and sound) or to perform customary duties; and neither the Union nor any representatives thereof shall engage in job action for the purpose of effecting changes in the directives or decisions of management of the County, nor to effect a change of personnel or operations of management or of employees not covered by this Memorandum of Understanding.
In the case of a legally declared lawful strike against a private sector employer which has been sanctioned and approved by the labor body or council having jurisdiction, an employee who is in danger of physical harm shall not be required to cross the picket line,
ercemuafscme01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006
49
provided the employee advises his/her supervisor prior to leaving the picketed location, and provided further that an employee may be required to cross a picket line where the performance of his/her duties is of an emergency nature and/or failure to perform such duties might cause or aggravate a danger to public health or safety.
38.6	County Charter and Civil Service Commission
(a)	The provisions of this Section shall not abridge any rights to which an employee may be entitled under the County Charter, nor shall it be administered in a manner which would abrogate any power which, under the County Charter may be within the sole province and discretion of the Civil Service Commission.
(b)	All grievances of employees in representation units represented by the Union shall be processed under this Section. If the County Charter requires that a differing option be available to the employee, no action under paragraph (b) of subsection 38.2 above shall be taken unless it is determined that the employee is not availing himself/herself of such option.
(c)	No action under paragraph (b) of subsection 38.2 above shall be taken if action on the complaint or grievance has been taken by the Civil Service Commission, or if the complaint or grievance is pending before the Civil Service Commission.
(d)	If any award by an Adjustment Board or arbitrator requires action by the Board of Supervisors or the Civil Service Commission before it can be placed in effect, the County Manager and the Employee and Public Services Director will recommend to the Board of Supervisors or the Civil Service Commission, as appropriate, that it follow such award.
Section 39.	Loss of Compensation
If an employee covered by this Memorandum of Understanding suffers loss of compensation due to the inequitable application of rules, regulations, policies and procedures and where said loss of compensation is not subject to the grievance procedure specified in Section 38 of the Memorandum of Understanding, the employee shall attempt to resolve this matter with the immediate supervisor. If unable to resolve this matter satisfactorily, the employee or the employee's Union representative may submit the complaint in writing to the Employee Relations Officer with a copy to the County Manager. If this matter is not resolved by the Employee Relations Officer within thirty (30) working days from the date of receipt of the complaint, the employee or the Union representative shall advise the Employee and Public Services Director in writing that the matter has not been resolved and the Employee and Public Services Director shall render a decision within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this notification which decision shall be final. The County recognizes that other employee problems also merit prompt attention and will attempt to resolve such matters in an expeditious manner.

2.	Leave of Absence Status. Recognizing that the Union needs information as to the leave status of its members for various purposes, the County agrees to provide a list of members who are on leave on a periodic basis and at the request of the Union. It is understood that the main purpose of such lists is for election purposes and that the requests should not be more often than twice a year.
3.	Release Time Notification. The County will make every reasonable effort to notify and confirm to employees when they have been released from work to attend to Union business.
4.	Use of Extra-Help. The County will provide the Union a quarterly listing of ExtraHelp employees and their length of service, by department.
5.	Americans With Disability Act (ADA). Upon the request of the employee a Union representative will be included in meetings dealing with issue of ADA reasonable accommodation.
6.	Job Search. It is the intent of the County to allow a reasonable amount of County time for job search for employees whose positions have been identified as at risk of elimination.
7.	Voluntary Time Off. In the event of a proposed layoff, the County will meet with the union representatives to discuss the feasibility of increased use of VTO as a means of reducing layoffs.
8.	Performance Evaluations. The County agrees that the timely preparation of performance evaluations, (particularly timely evaluations of probationary employees), as stated in the County manager's letter to AFSCME of September 13, 1990, is one of the most important responsibilities of managers and supervisors, and will continue to stress this responsibility. In addition, concerns over employees having not received said evaluations, be they either probationary or permanent employees, should be brought to the attention of the Director, Employee and Public Services Department, through the Employee Relations
F:\SHARED\ERDATA\Current MOUs\ercemuAFSCME01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006.doc
116
Division. The Department or Agency involved will be notified of the need to prepare the evaluation where it is found to be due.
9.	The County agrees to remind and support departments' sending copies of final decision letters in the disciplinary process to the Union, where the Union has represented the employee in the Skelly process.
10.	The County does not intend to charge employees for parking. If circumstances occur which result in the County being required to charge employees for parking, the parties agree to meet and confer.
11.	Workers who are required by the Department to obtain a Class A or Class B license will be reimbursed for the cost of the license fee. Additionally, the employee will be afforded reasonable time to obtain the required physical exam and the required DMV test on County time.
12.	Direct Deposit shall be mandatory for all employees hired after October 30, 1999.
13.	The parties agree to draft and jointly support legislation to allow workers in Retirement Plan 3 to “bridge” their service if they leave County service and subsequently return at a date more than two years from the date of departure.
14.	Domestic Partner Coverage. The parties will jointly support legislation to restrict the domestic partner survivor benefit to same-sex only. Any benefit change will have to be negotiated during the next contract negotiations.
15.	Parity. During the final year of the Agreement, the parties will meet to discuss concerns the Union has raised regarding the comparability of salary for represented classes with comparable agencies. Issues which may be discussed include factors in determining salary parity and competitiveness, and the County’s methodology in adjusting wages where deemed warranted.
16.	The County agrees to recommend to the Civil Service Commission of San Mateo County that Civil Service Rule XIII, Section 4 (causes for dismissal, suspension, reduction in step or demotion) be amended in the following manner:
Change the title of Rule 4F from “Incompetence” to “Unacceptable Performance”, and add Rule 4Q to read: “Failure to follow policy(ies), procedure(s) or work rule(s), or negligence in the performance of one’s duties.”
17.	The County agrees to implement an IRC Section 125 Medical Spending Account for employees effective January 1, 2004.
18.	The County will communicate to its health and dental plan providers its desire to increase provider membership (doctors and dentists) to increase the choice available to County employees, retirees and dependents. While the County understands that providers are constantly working through their provider relations
F:\SHARED\ERDATA\Current MOUs\ercemuAFSCME01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006.doc
117
staff to accomplish this objective, the County will offer its support in identifying ways it can assist in this effort.

Dear Ms. Gregory:
Occupational health and safety are the mutual concern of the employer, the union and employees. To that end, the County shall comply with applicable Federal, State and local safety laws, rules and regulations and ensure that employees will do the same.
Any workplace safety or health problem which is identified should be initially directed to the supervisor, departmental safety committee or safety representative, or the County's Central Safety Committee as appropriate for review and/or investigation. If the matter is not resolved at the initial level, the union or employee may appeal in writing to Risk Management.
The Safety Officer will investigate the safety and/or health problem, and will respond in writing as soon as possible, but no later than 30 calendar days from the date the problem was brought to his/her attention. The response will include a timeframe for abatement of the problem. If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved with this response, the matter may be submitted to the County Manager for review.
Sincerely,
Priscilla Harris Risk Manager

Dear Ms. Gregory:
The following memorandum was distributed on November 5, 1990, and remains the policy on the confidentiality of sick leave information:
DATE:	August 5, 1990
TO:	All Department Heads, Division Heads, and Payroll Clerks
FROM:	Mary Welch, Human Resources Director
SUBJECT:	Confidentiality of Sick Leave Information
During the recently completed negotiations with AFSCME and SEIU, it was brought to our attention that, in some cases, employee sick leave statements are not being treated with appropriate confidentiality. In order to ensure confidentiality, the following is suggested:
1.	The number of people reviewing these statements should be kept to a "need to know" level;
2.	Sick leave statements should never be left in plain view on a desk or other work area; and
3.	Until sick leave statements are permanently placed in an employee's personnel file, they should be maintained in an envelope and removed only when necessary.
Sincerely,
Mary Welch

Dear Ms Gregory:
It is the County's policy and goal that all workers shall be treated with respect and dignity. To that end, managers, supervisors, and line workers will each have an obligation of mutual respect.
This shall not prevent a manager or supervisor from providing training or correction to workers and shall not prevent a line worker from responding on their own behalf or offering their personal opinion on the subject under discussion. However, each is expected to do so in a civil manner and without name-calling or demeaning tone. Correction of work performance, when given by a supervisor, shall normally be done in private.
Sincerely,
Mary Welch

It has been the County's policy to investigate allegations of harassment made by workers of this County against their supervisors. Admittedly, harassment is a very subjective matter, but the County has and will continue to investigate said allegations and attempt to resolve the problem in an expeditious manner. The County will also investigate and attempt to resolve in an expeditious manner problems which are brought to our attention concerning the narrative section of performance evaluation.

Dear Ms. Gregory:
Re: Appeal Process - Incompatible Activities
A County employee who is denied participation in any outside employment, activity, or enterprise for compensation because such outside employment, activity, or enterprise was deemed inconsistent, incompatible, in conflict with, or inimical to his/her employment with the County may appeal such a decision in the following manner. An employee may be represented throughout the appeal process by his/her employee organization.
Step 1 - Department Head. The employee shall contact his/her department head to schedule a meeting with the department head or his/her designee in an effort to resolve the issue at this level. If the issue is not resolved within the department, the employee may proceed to Step 2.
Step 2 - Employee and Public Services Director. The employee shall make a written request to the Employee and Public Services Director for an informal hearing. The letter should delineate the specifics of the dispute and the remedy sought. Such notification must be received within 28 calendar days from the date the employee's department head first notified him/her of the denial of outside employment. The Employee and Public Services Director shall meet with the employee and whomever else is deemed appropriate to determine the merits of the dispute. Once the Employee and Public Services Director reaches a decision, the employee and the department head will be notified in writing. The decision of the Employee and Public Services Director shall be final except as specified below.
Outside Employment Limited to 20 Hours per Week (full-time employees only). In instances where outside employment is denied solely because such employment exceeds 20 hours per week, the employee may, after appealing to the Employee and Public Services Director as described in Step 2 above, seek an exemption from the Board of Supervisors and the employee's department head as specified in Section 2940 of the County Ordinance Code.

Dear Ms. Gregory:
The following letter was sent to all management staff by April 30, 1990, as agreed in negotiations.
TO:	All Management Employees
FROM:	John L. Maltbie
SUBJECT:	Employee Performance Evaluation
Evaluating employee performance is one of the most important responsibilities of a manager or supervisor. Evaluations provide a framework for setting and accomplishing organizational and individual goals and objectives. An effective evaluation process lets employees know hat is expected of them, how they are performing, and how they can improve and/or take advantage of growth and career opportunities. This is particularly true when the employee is on probation, forming the basis for their future work habits and relationships. The following guidelines should be followed in the performance evaluation process:
1.	Timelines: Employee Performance Reports are to be completed annually on all permanent employees regardless of the length of service. For 6 month probationary employees, reports are to be completed prior to the end of the third and sixth months and for 12 month probationary periods, prior to the end of the third, sixth, and twelfth months.
It is particularly important that reports be done in a timely manner. Probationary employees must have a report completed at the end of their third month of service so that they have every opportunity to successfully complete their probationary period.
2.	Feedback: Feedback on employee performance is a continual process throughout the year and needs to be given as recognition for achievements or when the employee is having difficulty meeting performance standards or objectives. the report form itself documents the ongoing feedback that the supervisor has discussed with the employee throughout the year, in addition to setting specific objectives the employee is expected to accomplish during the next review period. Although employees may disagree with some of the supervisor's statements, there should be no surprises during the performance appraisals conference.
F:\SHARED\ERDATA\Current MOUs\ercemuAFSCME01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006.doc
124
3.	Employee Response: Employees should be given 10 working days from the date the written report is discussed with the employee to comment and/or respond to the evaluation content and process.
4.	Working Draft: Since the performance appraisal conference is a cooperative effort between supervisor and employee, the report form should initially be done as a draft. This provides an opportunity for the employee to assess his/her performance and draft performance objectives to be discussed at the conference.
5.	Improvement Needed/Unsatisfactory Evaluation: If the overall work performance either needs improvement (below the standard level required for the position) or is unsatisfactory (inadequate and definitely inferior to the standards of performance required for the position), Employee Performance Reports must be completed monthly with clearly defined 30-day performance objectives.
Sincerely,
Mary Welch

- Revised Agreement -
Mental Health Division and AFSCME Local 829 Part-Time Employees - School and Community-Eased Youth Staff
The following agreement is entered Into between the Mental Hea th Services Division and AFSCME Local 829, effective November 1, 2000.
The Mental Health Division employs part time staff in schoor based and comm unity- based Mental Health youth programs whose weekly work schedules often exceed the hours authorized by their status (e.g. .5 F’l L = 20 hours per week, .8 - 32 hours per week) 1) while school in session and/or 2) because of the inability to predictably schedule work with tneir target client population. Conversely, the weekly work schedules of those positions commonly .require fewer hours th?? those authorized by their status 1) during the sumoe" (non-SChool) months and/or 2) when there are fewer crises or slower, more predictable activity in their target client population.
The goal of this agreement is that the hours worked in any such part time position over the calendar yeaar will, excepting authorized overtime (see below) be approximately equal to the worker's status as a percent of full time.
Hours worked in a work week while schools in session or during a period of peak client activity which exceed die worker's harm al status may be converted to compensatory time on an hau--for-haur straight time basis subject to the provisions of the MOU regarding compensable overtime and to the limits on accrued compensatory time in the applicable work groups.
If such ah employee works more than forty (40) hours in a work week they will be compensated a: the overtime rate pursuant to the provisions of Section 7 of the MOU.
Tnese part time employees shall be entitled tc holiday pay ir proportion to their annual FTE status (e.g. .5 FTE - 4 hours holiday pay, .8 “ 6,4 hours holiday pay). Employees will accrue holiday time at the same rates for floating and Saturday holidays. Section 16.1 of the MQU on calculating holiday pa ay for part time employees shall not apply to these employees.

Dear Nadia:
This letter confirms the underslandlngs reached at the October 21, 2002 side meeting. The discussion covered the career advancement program, the normal workweek for the Licensed Vocational Nurses, and the orientation for individuals (LVN's/MSA's/Community Workers) who are temporarily reassigned within the outpatient system.
CAREER ADVANCEMENT
Staff of the San Mateo Medical Center remains committed to the development of a career advancement program which will enable staff to not only improve their skills but enhance their advancement opportunities. Recognizing that the legislated staffing requirements will place additional pressure on recruitment and retention strategies, the department will continue to explore all possibilities to fund a comprehensive program. Current efforts are being made to develop a program in conjunction with the Hospital Consortium.
NORMAL WORK WEEK
I understand the LVNs desire to have Iwo days eff in succession, and I appreciate how disruptive it can be io have only one full day off and the second day split in two half days. However, the County and the Medical Center have made increased access tc health care one of its primary objectives. This objective is met. by having clinics open six days a week. Our current resources dictate the number of hours the clinics are open and the staff availability to staff them. At this time economics prohibit the hiring of additional staff or the rescheduling of clinics, in January 2903, I expect to receive detailed fiscal and productivity data which will enable us to make scheduling decisions on a clinic-by-clinic basis. At that time I will review the information to include identifying opportunities to improve the work schedules for all affected staff.
Board nJ Super visors: Mark C.hurch. Rose Jacobs Gibson. Richard S Gordon . Jerry Hdl - Michael /J. A't’vbi
0RIENTATION/TRAINING (clinic reassignments)
I have agreed to develop an orientation checklist for the LVNS, MSAs and Community Workers to assist them when they are assigned to a clinic other than their regular assignment. The purpose of the checklist is to provide staff with a basic guide on what they need to know io order to do their work while in the temporary assignment. This checklist is meant to be a tool and does not replace the orientation or competency training. I expect ail Charge Nurses to provide this Checklist so that all employees understand their responsibilities and the procedures related to the particular clinic in which they are assigned. This checklist will be available no later than January 1, 2003. The clinics will be redefining the duties and competencies for LVN's and MSA's, and I will work with Supervising Physicians to provide training to providers (Physicians, Nurse Practitioners, Physician's Assistants) regarding the job duties of the classifications that support them.
I look forward to continuing to work with you to enhance the work environment and career opportunities for all clinic employees
Sincerely,
Deputy Director
Outpatient Services

Dear
This letter is to confirm our conversations and side meetings related to Aging and Adult Services developing a job sharing program and a training program tor adult protective services and public guardian staff.
JOB SHARING
Aging and Adult Services agrees to implement a job sharing policy and procedure, which mirrors the agreement that had been previously negotiated with the Human Services Agency. It is my intent to add job sharing to the alternative work programs, which are already in existence within the Division. Such an option will be available to staff no Later than April 1, 2003. Any staff expressing an interest in the program prior to the completion of the agreement and the necessary policies and procedures may indicate such interest in writing and every effort will be made to accommodate the request providing the issues of workload coverage are adequately addressed.
TRAINING
Aging and Adult Services agrees to work jointly with the union on the development of a standardized training program to provide orientation tor all new staff and program specific training for employees assigned to centralized intake and the public guardian units. The intent is to provide a combination of classroom training and on-the-job training. The curriculum and length of training will be developed by staff, supervisors and managers, and the program components will be developed and approved by the supervisors of the units.
Aging and Adult Services has a vacant Deputy Public Guardian position which we will request to fill to provide the training and as feasible cover vacant caseloads within adult protective services and the public guardian program-

Dear Ms. Gregory:
This letter is in response to the Union's request to clarify and capsulate our recent discussion. On October 28, 2002 we met to discuss Benefit Analysts located at the Family Resource Centers, potential future hiring in the Benefit Analysts classification, lead function/positions and the workload for Income Employment Service Specialists (IESS) with CalWORKs caseloads.
1 am pleased to indicate that we will consider the feasibility of your proposal to have all cases that are generally assigned to Eligibility Technicians moved from the Family Resource Centers to regional offices. We are researching the impact on staffing if we were to commit to this proposal.
Our plan is to hire Benefit Analysts in the future contingent upon sufficient State funding and within the context of the proposed Medi-Cal service delivery changes. We are being very cautious in our hiring efforts as we expect the upcoming budget cutbacks to be at least as substantial as what was experienced during this and the last fiscal years. Additionally, we are in the process of redesigning services for Medi-Cal clients by implementing a call center. While future hiring of Benefit Analysts will occur, the exact timing of this cannot be predicted at this moment.
We discussed your request for additional Lead Workers. As you are aware we are currently developing supervisory and leadership initiatives. We are also implementing a quality assurance process in the future. In this context and given the current fiscal situation creating additional Lead Worker positions is Inappropriate from our prospective.
In response to your request to decrease the IESS caseload target from 45 family cases to 32, we are unable to accommodate your request. We don't believe that the caseload ought to be lowered.
F:\SHARED\ERDATA\Current MOUs\ercemuAFSCME01 AFSCME MOU 2002-2006.doc
132
Further, we understand that this performance level is towards the lower end of such Statewide levels. In addition, this request could not be achieved given the reduction in State funding and the current fiscal crisis the County is facing. However, it is our intention to look at how the Employment Services Delivery system can be improved. In this context we will consider the IESS function and prioritize tasks that need to be completed. The Employment Services integration Workgroup has been given, among its tasks, the charge to begin discussions around IESS activities prioritization. The Workgroup membership includes managers, supervisors, and line staff, We have attached a Workgroup raster. If you would like additional Union participants in this Workgroup, please forward their names to me.
We continue to appreciate our discussions with the Union as we work through these tumultuous fiscal times. If you have any questions concerning this letter, please cal! me at 802-6579.
Sincerely yours,
Glen H. Brooks, Jr.
