PREAMBLE
This Agreement is made and entered in this 14th Day of August 2014 between Akima Technical Solutions, LLC, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”) and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO, District Lodge 4 (formerly District 12), (hereinafter referred to as “the Union”).
ARTICLE 1
RECOGNITION
Section 1.1 - Recognition of Union. The Company recognizes the Union, certified by the National Labor relations Board on February 10, 2005 in Case No. 5-RC-15806, as the exclusive representative of “employees” as defined in Section 1.2 of this Agreement.
Section 1.2 - Definition of Employees. Whenever used in this Agreement, the term “employees” shall mean all full-time and regular part-time fuel systems operators, distribution employees, driver/warehouse technicians, supply technicians, lead technicians, clerks, and computer specialists employed out of and by the Company at its facility located at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, as listed and designated in Appendix 1 to this Agreement; but excluding all other employees, including temporary personnel as defined in Section 1.4 of this Agreement, managerial personnel, confidential personnel, office clericals, professional employees, watchmen, guards, and supervisors as defined in the National Labor Relations Act.
Section 1.3 - Definition of Probationary Employee. An employee who has never been employed by the Company, or an employee rehired after termination of employment with the Company shall be in “probationary” status until he or she has completed sixty four (64) work days. The transfer, discipline, lay-off, or discharge of an employee who is in probationary status shall not be a violation of this Agreement and shall not be subject to or reviewable through the grievance procedure or appealable by arbitration under Articles 6 and 7 of this Agreement.
Section 1.4 - Definition of Temporary Personnel. “Temporary personnel” are persons hired by the Company to work for a period not to exceed ninety (90) calendars days from the commencement of their employment and who, prior to the commencement of actual work, have executed a written statement acknowledging such duration of employment. A person initially hired under such conditions may not actually work in excess of ninety (90) calendar days from the commencement of employment, except by the mutual written agreement of the Company and the Union.

ARTICLE 2
MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
Section 2.1 - Retention of Managerial Prerogatives. Except as expressly modified or restricted by a specific provision of this Agreement, all statutory and inherent managerial rights, prerogatives, and functions are retained and vested exclusively in the Company, including, but not limited to the rights, in accordance with its sole and exclusive judgment and discretion: to reprimand, suspend, discharge, or otherwise discipline employees for just cause; to determine the number of employees to be employed; to hire employees, determine their qualifications, and assign and direct their work; to promote, demote, transfer, lay off for lack of work, recall to work, and to process employees' retirement; to set the standards of productivity, the products to be produced, and/or the services to be rendered; to train and develop employees; to determine the amount and forms of compensation for employees; to determine what types and levels of benefits may be provided to employees; to determine whether to share or allocate any awards to employees; maintain the efficiency of operations; to determine the personnel, methods, means, and facilities by which operations are conducted; to set the starting and quitting time and the number of hours and shifts to be worked; to use independent contractors to perform work or services; to subcontract, contract out, close down, or relocate the Company's operations or any part thereof; to expand, reduce, alter, combine, transfer, assign, or cease any job, department, operation, or service; to control and regulate the use of machinery, facilities, equipment, and other property of the Company or provided for the use or lease of the Company; to introduce new or improved research, production, service, distribution, and maintenance methods, materials, machinery, and equipment; to determine the number, location and operation of departments, divisions, and all other units of the Company; to issue, amend, revise, implement, and enforce reasonable policies, rules, regulations, and practices, including but not limited to safety and substance abuse requirements and prohibitions; and to take whatever action is either necessary or advisable to determine, manage, and fulfill the mission of the Company, to manage its operations, and to direct the Company's working force and employees. These rights are not intended to be all inclusive, but enumerate by way of illustration, the type of rights which belong to and are retained by the Company. The Company's failure to exercise any right, prerogative, or function hereby reserved to it, or the Company's exercise of any such right, prerogative, or function in a particular way, shall not be considered a waiver of the Company's right to exercise such right, prerogative, or function or preclude it from exercising the same in some other way not in conflict with the express provisions of the Agreement. No relationship between the parties to this Agreement shall be construed to constitute or create any implied limitation on the Company's authority, rights, functions, prerogatives, or powers.
Section 2.2 - Work by Management and Supervisors
(a)	Work performed by management or supervisory personnel will be restricted to those requirements beyond the capabilities of bargaining unit employees or as provided in Section 2.2(b) below.
(b)	Management or supervisory personnel may perform work of employees covered by this Agreement under the following conditions and circumstances:
(1)	For the purpose of instructing and training employees.
(2)	Under emergency conditions, including when necessitated by security requirements.
- 2 -
(3)	To prevent harm or injury to employees, other persons, or damage to property.
(4)	When required for safety.
(5)	When bargaining unit employees lack the technical ability to perform the work required and when work being performed is not used to avoid paying overtime, to avoid paying wages for a higher classification, or to displace a bargaining unit employee.
(6)	When the work being performed is within the normal job duties of a position that is not covered by this Agreement and is not used to avoid paying overtime, to avoid paying wages for a higher classification, or to displace a bargaining unit employee.
(7)	When required to maintain personal qualifications and proficiency of the managers or supervisory personnel and when the work being performed is not used to avoid paying overtime, to avoid paying wages for a higher classification, or to displace a bargaining unit employee.
(8)	To cover absences and temporary vacancies if no other bargaining unit employee is available and when work being performed is not used to avoid paying overtime, to avoid paying wages for a higher classification, or to displace a bargaining unit employee.
ARTICLE 2A
UNION RECOGNITION AND EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION
Section 2A. 1 - Union Stewards.
(a)	Recognition of Union Stewards. From among the bargaining unit employees employed by the Company, the Union will designate, and the Company will recognize, not more than five (5) union stewards to serve as the Union’s agents in the representation of employees. From the five (5) recognized stewards, the Union will select a chief steward. The Company shall not recognize any employee as a union steward unless the Union has notified the Company, in writing, of the employee’s name, department, and designation as a union steward. The individual union stewards will be selected from and assigned to one of the following work areas to represent the employees in that union steward’s area:
(1)	Area A: Warehouse Department
(2)	Area B: Customer Service Department
(3)	Area C: East Side Fuel Operations
(4)	Area D: West Side Fuel Operations (Day Shift)
(5)	Area E: West Side Fuel Operations (Swing-Night Shift)
The number of union stewards on the Union Grievance Committee under this Agreement may be modified at any time by the Company and the Union upon their mutually agreeing in writing to such a modification.
- 3 -
(b)	Compensation of Union Stewards While Engaged in Union Activity. Except as may be otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the union stewards shall not be compensated by the Company for their duties on behalf of the Union. Compensation shall be governed by the following rules:
(1)	Meetings scheduled at the unilateral request of the Union - the Union shall compensate all attendees from the Union. Such meetings involve steward training, Union Elections, Union Conferences, etc.
(2)	In the event of the Company needs to meet with shop stewards it will attempt to have those meetings occur during their regular shift. In the event the Company attempts to have a combined meeting with stewards who work multiple shifts, it normally will schedule those meetings during the crossover period between shifts. During those meetings if stewards are required to come in before their regular shift or stay after their regular shift to attend such a meeting, the Company shall compensate stewards for that time outside the normal shift. Stewards are generally not expected to come in completely off shift, but if requested and approved by management to do so, they will be compensated for that time. Stewards will not be compensated for coming to work to participate in meetings unless requested and approved by management.
Section 2A.2 - Authorized Activities of Union Stewards.
(a)	For any grievance, only one of the union stewards shall be authorized to investigate that grievance and to represent the grievant(s) in accordance with Article 6 of this Agreement. The scope of the activities of the union stewards during scheduled work hours shall be limited and only authorized as follows:
(1)	The union steward for a particular grievance is authorized to meet and consult with an employee regarding an alleged grievance or the presentation of a grievance for which the employee desires the union steward to be present.
(2)	The union steward is authorized to review employee’s personnel files (with prior authorization from the employee), relevant documents and reports while investigating an alleged grievance or a grievance of record before final decision is made in accordance with the grievance procedure in Article 6 of this Agreement before presentation to the appropriate manager.
(3)	The union steward is authorized to present an alleged grievance or a grievance to an employee’s immediate department manager in an attempt to settle the matter for the employee or group of employees who may be similarly affected.
(4)	The union steward is authorized to meet with an appropriate manager or other designated representative of the Company when necessary to adjust grievances in accordance with the grievance procedure in Article 6 of this Agreement.
(5)	A union steward, who is a grievant, shall not be allowed to be the union steward or to function as union steward for his or her own grievance.
(6)	Except as may be otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the union stewards shall perform any activities or duties as a union steward on behalf of the Union, including investigating a grievance, during times when they are not scheduled to work for the Company. Time spent by
- 4 -
the union steward in investigating a grievance shall be the minimum amount of time necessary to perform the specific investigation involved.
(7)	With prior notice to and permission of the union steward’s department manager and subject to other provisions of this Agreement, the union steward shall be authorized to meet with a grievant and to investigate a grievance during the union steward’s working hours for a reasonable period of time on the Company’s premises, so long as the investigation or meeting does not unreasonably interfere with or adversely affect the operations and work of the Company or the assigned work of the grievant or the union steward.
(8)	The parties agreed to add a chief steward who will have time if needed every week to work with other stewards on any grievances. The amount of time the stewards and chief steward have to work on grievances has been clarified. Total paid time shall not exceed three (3) hours for the participation and activities of the grievant and the steward in grievance proceedings at Steps, 1, 2, and 3 under Article 6 of this Agreement unless additional time is granted by the Project Manager or his designee.
(b)	Recognizing the mutual benefit of resolving problems at the lowest level, any employee who has an alleged grievance should first discuss the matter with his or her immediate department manager, with or without the employee's union steward present at the employee's discretion. If the alleged grievance is of the nature that the degree of the immediate department manager's involvement or conduct related to the alleged grievance would make such a discussion clearly unproductive or futile, the employee then should first discuss the alleged grievance with his or her next level manager with or without the employee's union steward present at the employee's discretion. Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to preclude and does not preclude an employee from initially discussing any concerns or alleged grievances with his or her union steward or choosing to have a union steward present at discussions with any manager.
(c)	The necessary time away from the union steward's official work assignment shall be arranged in a manner to minimize interruption of work flow. When the union steward finds it necessary to discuss a problem or labor-management disagreement with a bargaining unit employee or management official, or both, the union steward shall request permission to leave his or her work assignment from the union steward's manager. If the need should arise for a union steward to enter another manager's work area, the union steward's manager will contact the manager of that other work area to establish and schedule a time for the union steward to enter the area. In each instance, the manager's permission will be granted unless work or operation commitments dictate otherwise. If permission is initially denied, the manager shall establish and schedule an alternate time at which the union steward can contact the employee within two (2) work days.
(d)	If no union steward is available and other union stewards either are unavailable or refuse to come to the work site as requested, the Company is authorized, in any proceeding or action normally requiring union representation or the presence of an union steward, either to defer proceeding and taking any action until a later time when an union steward is available or to proceed or take action without the presence of an union steward if the circumstances warrant immediate action. The Union hereby expressly waives any claim, and will not bring any claim, of an unfair labor practice or a violation of this Agreement based on the Company's taking action without the presence of a union
- 5 -
steward or the Company's deferring any action until a union steward is available as authorized by this subparagraph (d) of Section 2A.2. Nothing in this subparagraph (d) will preclude the employee from grieving or arbitrating the actual employment action taken against the employee if such action is otherwise grievable under Article 6 or arbitrable under Article 7 of this Agreement.
Section 2A.3 - Posting of Union Literature and Information; Bulletin Boards
(a)	The Company will permit the Union to use portions of bulletin boards on the Company's premises at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, in the main hall of the Supply Department, and in the drivers' lounge at the East Side Fuel Operations and the West Side Fuel Operations on a space available basis for the purpose of posting legitimate Union notices. The Union will be permitted to install, at its own expense, additional bulletin boards as needed and subject to the approval of the Project Manager for the purpose of posting legitimate Union notices at the Company's facility located at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. Legitimate Union notices are defined as:
(1)	Notices of meetings.
(2)	Notices of official Union elections and results.
(3)	Notices of official Union appointments.
(4)	Official notice of Union recreational and social events.
(5)	Other notices that shall be specifically approved in writing by the Project Manager. The denial of permission by the Project Manager to post any other notices under this subparagraph (a)(5) of Section 2A.3 shall not be a matter that can be grieved under Article 6 and cannot be appealed to arbitration under Article 7 of this Agreement.
(b)	Only the union stewards and the Union's Business Representative shall be authorized to post notices on the bulletin boards. All notices posted on the bulletin board must be dated and bear the signature and printed name of the union stewards and/or the Union's Business Representative who posted the notice.
(c)	Only the union stewards and the Union's Business Representative shall be permitted to remove notices on the bulletin boards; however, any materials or notices posted on the bulletin board in violation of this Section 2A.3 may be removed and retained by the Project Manager. The Project Manager will promptly notify the Union's Business Representative of the removal of the material and the reason for its removal. The Union's Business Representative may request and upon that request be allowed at a mutually convenient time to meet with the Project Manager to inspect and copy at the Project Manager's office any materials which the Project Manager has removed under this subparagraph (c) of Section 2A.3.
(d)	The internal mail system, voice mail system, telecommunication system, and the computer, email, and Internet systems of the Company and the government shall not be used by the Union or the union stewards to distribute any communications or correspondence to employees; provided,
- 6 -
however, that employees and union stewards will be allowed to use telephones for the purpose of coordinating and scheduling meetings pertaining to dispute resolutions, including grievance proceedings and activities under Article 6 of this Agreement.
Section 2A.4 - Union Business. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to pay an employee for any time or leave taken from work by that employee to serve the Union in any official capacity (other than union steward pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), to serve on any Union committee (the Company's Safety Committee under Article 15 of this Agreement is not a Union committee), or to attend Union-sponsored conventions, training, and seminars. The Project Manager may refuse to grant leave under this Section 2A.4 if the Project Manager determines that any employee's absence would unreasonably interfere with or adversely affect the operations of the Company or the operations or mission of the United States government (customer/client).
Section 2A.5 - Union Visitation
(a)	Meetings with the Company. Subject to any security regulations promulgated by the Company or the United States government (customer/client), the Union's Business Representative may enter upon the Company's premises to attend meetings at Step 3 of the grievance procedure set forth in Article 6 of this Agreement and such other meetings as may be scheduled between the Business Representative and the Company's Project Manager (or his designated delegate). The access of the Business Representative under this Section 2A.5(a) shall be limited to the meeting space designated by the Project Manager.
(b)	Other Access.
(1)	Subject to any security regulations promulgated by the Company or the United States government (customer/client), the Union's Business Representative or other authorized business representatives of the Union as the Company's Project Manager may approve in advance, will be granted access to such areas of the Company's premises and for such purposes and at such times as the Project Manager may approve.
(2)	Such access to the Company's premises may be denied if such access, in the judgment of the Company or the Project Manager, would endanger the life, safety, or health of any person or would risk damage to equipment or property, or if such access, as determined by the Company or the Project Manager, would unreasonably interfere with or adversely affect the operations of the Company or the operations and mission of the United States government (customer/client). Otherwise, access will not be unreasonably withheld.
(3)	Before proceeding to the designated work area, the Business Representative (and such other Union business representatives as the Company's Project Manager may approve in advance) shall report to the Project Manager (or other authorized Company representative designated in writing by the Project Manager), who shall permit the Union representative (or representatives) to enter the Company's premises and proceed to the designated area. The Union representative or representatives shall likewise inform the Project Manager (or other authorized
- 7 -
Company representative designated in writing by the Project Manager) when the Union representative or representatives leave the Company's premises.
(c)	Limited Waiver of Right of Access. Representatives or agents of the Union, who are neither the Designated Business Representative nor a bargaining unit employee of the Company, shall only be authorized and permitted to enter upon the Company's premises upon obtaining written permission from the Project Manager in accordance with this Section 2A.5.
(d)	Indemnification.

Section 6.2	- Procedural Steps.
(a)	Both parties encourage the verbal resolution of disputes as quickly as possible and agree that all disputes and grievances should be resolved at the earliest practical time, whenever possible with the immediate department manager and the employee involved. It is the intent and purpose of the parties to provide a fair and equitable procedure for the orderly settlement of all grievances. Any employee with a complaint or issue should contact the appropriate department manager to discuss and resolve the issue. Both parties will make every effort to resolve the issue. The employee may have his or her union steward present if desired; and if an employee has chosen to have a union steward present, the grievance shall not be settled without the presence of the union steward.
(b)	Step 1:
(1)	Supply Department-Written Grievance to Supply Department Manager. If a grievance is not resolved informally by the employee and the Supply Department Manager under Section 6.2(a) above, the union steward, on behalf of the employee and not later than six (6) work days following the date of the occurrence of the condition or event upon which the grievance is
- 14 -
based, must submit a written grievance to the Supply Department Manager. If the employee or union steward fails to present the written grievance within this time limit, the grievance shall be considered settled and no further action can be taken thereon. Both parties will make every effort to resolve the issue. At any meetings or conferences held between the employee and the Supply Manager, the employee shall be represented and accompanied by a union steward. Once a grievance is presented, no new violations or issues can be raised in that grievance. The Supply Department Manager shall give his or her written answer to the grievance within six (6) work days after receipt of the written grievance. If a settlement of the grievance is reached before the Supply Manager renders his or her Step 1 decision, the settlement will be reduced to written form and signed by the Supply Manager, the union steward, and the employee; and the matter and grievance shall then be considered closed. If the Supply Manager fails to provide his or her written response within the time limit specified in this Section 6.2(b)(1), the response to the grievance shall be deemed a denial on the date the limitation period expired, and the employee may advance the grievance to the Final Step of the grievance process.
(2)	Fuels Department- Written Grievance to Fuels Department Manager. If a grievance is not resolved informally by the employee and the Fuels Manager under Section 6.2(a) above, the union steward, on behalf of the employee and not later than six (6) work days following the date of the occurrence of the condition or event upon which the grievance is based, must submit a written grievance to the Fuels Manager. If the employee or union steward fails to present the written grievance within this time limit, the grievance shall be considered settled and no further action can be taken thereon. Both parties will make every effort to resolve the issue. At any meetings or conferences held between the employee and the Fuels Manager, the employee shall be represented and accompanied by a union steward. Once a grievance is presented, no new violations or issues can be raised in that grievance. The Fuels Manager shall give his or her written answer to the grievance within six (6) work days after receipt of the written grievance. If a settlement of the grievance is reached before the Fuels Manager renders his or her Step 1 decision, the settlement will be reduced to written form and signed by the Fuels Manager, the union steward, and the employee; and the matter and grievance shall then be considered closed. If the Fuels Manager fails to provide his or her written response within the time limit specified in this Section 6.2(b)(2), the response to the grievance shall be deemed a denial on the date the limitation period expired, and the employee may advance the grievance to the Final Step of the grievance process.
(c)	Final Step - Written Appeal to the Project Manager. If the grievance of a Supply Department employee is not settled at Step 1 or the grievance of a Fuels Department employee is not settled at Step 1, the union steward on behalf of the employee, not later than ten (10) work days after the union steward's receipt of the decision rendered in accordance with Sections 6.2(b)(1) or 6.2(b)(2) above, may file a written appeal of that decision to the Project Manager. Department(s) without a manager, or an acting manager, i t is understood the Step 1 is waived. The written appeal shall include a copy of the written grievance submitted at the preceding step and a copy of the decision from the preceding step, together with all documents and other evidence in support of the grievance. Not later than ten (10) work days after receipt of the written appeal, the Project Manager, or his or her designee, shall meet with the employee, the union steward, and the Union's Business Representative, as well as with the employee's managers to confer and discuss the grievance.

- 15 -
Project Manager, or his or her designee, shall give his or her written answer to the grievance within ten (10) work days after such meeting, which answer shall be final and binding on the employee, the Union, and the Company, unless it is a matter that is subject to review by arbitration and it is timely appealed to arbitration by the Union in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article 7 of this Agreement. If a settlement of the grievance is reached before the Project Manager renders his or her Final Step decision, the settlement will be reduced to written form and signed by the Project Manager, the Union Business Representative, the union steward, and the employee; and the matter and grievance shall then be considered closed. If the Project Manager fails to provide his or her written answer within the time limit specified in this Section 6.2(c), the response to the grievance shall be deemed to be the Project Manager's written answer of denial on the date the limitation period expired for purposes of taking an appeal to arbitration under Article 7 of this Agreement.

During any procedural step or within the time limit for proceeding to the next step or to arbitration after a decision by the Company, the Union may accept the Company's decision; reject the Company's decision and timely proceed to the next step or arbitration, as applicable; or withdraw the grievance. If such time limits are not met or if the grievant and/or the Union do not take the required action within the specified time limits (except in those instances where the Union and the Company both consent and agree in writing to extend such time limits), the grievance shall be deemed forever settled and waived.
(b)	The time limits specified in this Section 6.2 may be extended by mutual written agreement of the parties. The Company and the Union may mutually agree in writing to waive any prior step of the grievance procedure and proceed directly to the Final Step of the grievance procedure.

NOTICE TO EMPLOYEES SUBJECT TO IAM SECURITY CLAUSES
Employees working under collective bargaining agreement containing union security clauses are required, as a condition of employment, to pay amounts equal to the union's monthly dues and applicable initiation and reinstate1nent fees and, for those under the Railway Labor Act, assessments. This is their sole obligation to the union, regardless of the wording of the clauses. Individuals who join the I-AM as members pay monthly dues and applicable fees. For individuals who decide not to be. members, such amounts represent "agency fees'' for their receipt of representation services. Initiation refers to the fee that is normally collected when a me1nber or nonmember first beco1nes subject to a security clause. Reinstatement refers to the fee that is normally collected when a member or nonmember falls two months behind in satisfying his or her monthly obligations.
Nonmembers also have a legal right to file objections to funding expenditures that are "nongennane to the collective bargaining process." Non1nembers who choose to file such objections should follow the procedures set forth below. When considering these matters, individuals should be aware that the union security clause contained in their collective bargaining agreement was negotiated by their fellow employees so that everyone who benefits from the collective bargaining process shares in its cost. The working conditions of all bargaining unit employees are improved immeasurably when the union gains higher wages, better health care and pensions, fairness in the disciplinary system, overtime pay, vacations, and many other improvements in working conditions at the bargaining table. And while individuals may choose to n1eet their financial obligations as nonmember agency fee payers, before electing agency fee payer status individuals should be aware of the additional benefits of union membership they will give up.
Among the many opportunities available to IAM members are the right to attend and participate in union meetings; the right to nominate and vote for candidates for union office and the right to run for union office; the right to participate in contract ratification and strike votes; the right to participate in the formulation of IAM: collective bargaining demands; the right to run for delegate to the International Union convention; the right to participate in the development and formulation of IAM policies; and the right to enjoy the many benefits of the Union Privilege Benefits Program, including low-interest union credit ca1ds, prescription drug cards, life insurance, legal and travel services.	'
Individuals who nevertheless elect to be nonmember agency fee payers may object to funding expenditures nongermane to the collective bargaining process and support only chargeable activities. Examples of "expenditures germane to the collective bargaining process for which objectors may be charged are those made for the negotiation, enforcement and administration of collective bargaining agreements; meetings with employer and union representatives; proceedings on behalf of workers under the grievance procedure, including arbitration; internal union administration; and litigation related to the above activities. Expenditures from the union's strike fund are chargeable because nonmembers have the same right to strike benefits as members if they meet the applicable requirements.
'
.
Expenditures nongermane to the collective bargaining process and, thus, nonchargeable to objectors, are those which are not directly related to collective bargaining. Examples of such expenditures are those made for efforts on behalf of retirees, for general organizing activities; for general community services for certain affiliation costs; and for legislative activities.	'
IAM objectors must file objections in accordance with the following procedures:
1.	Beginning on November 1, 2013 and ending on November 30, 2013, or during the first 30 days in which an objector is required t9 pay agency fees to the union, that objector may request that his/her initiation fee, if applicable, and monthly fee payment be reduced so that he/she is only bearing the cost of representational activities. Agency fee reductions will be based on prior audited figures of the IAM Grand Lodge and on a sample of prior audited figures from the IA.M's District and Local Lodge levels. For the calendar year 2014, the percentage reduction in monthly Grand Lodge per capita payments will be 30.64 percent, plus a 16:49 percent reduction in district lodge per capita and a 19,28 percent reduction in local lodge fees. For objectors represented by TCU/IAM lodges, there will be a reduction during calendar year 2014 of 30.64 percent in Grand Lodge per capita and a reduction of 16.49 percent in the remainder.
2.	A request must be in the form of a letter, signed by the objector and sent to the General Secretary-Treasurer of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 9000 Machinists Place, Upper Marlboro, MD 20772-2687, postmarked during the period described in paragraph 1 above. The request shall contain the objector's home address and local lodge number, if known.
3.	Upon receiving a proper request from an objector, the General Secretary-Treasurer shall notify such objector that _the request is perfected and provide a summitry of major categories of expenditures showing how the reduction is calculated. The Grand Lodge maintains an escrow account that contains sufficient monies to cover any challenges to expenditures that may reasonably be in dispute.
4.	Upon receiving the General Secretary-Treasurer's notice of the calculation of chargeable expenditures, an objector shall have 30 days to file a challenge with the General Secretary-Treasurer if he or she has reason to believe that the calculation of chargeable activities is incorrect.
5.	If an objector chooses to challenge the calculation of the advance reduction, there shall be an expeditious appeal before an impartial arbitrator chosen through the American Arbitration Association's (AAA) Rules for Impartial Determination of Union Fees.
a.	Any and all appeals shall be consolidated and submitted to the AAA. The presentation to the arbitrator will be either in writing or at a hearing, as determined by the arbitrator. If a hearing is held, any objector who does not wish to attend may submit his/her views in writing by the date of the hearing, or may participate by telephone. If a hearing is not held, the arbitrator will set the dates by which all written submissions will be received and will decide the case based on the evidence submitted.
b.	The IAM shall pay the costs of the arbitration. Challengers shall bear all other costs in connection with presenting their appeal (travel, witness fees, lost time, etc.). Challengers may, at their expense, be represented by counsel or other representative of choice.
c.	A court reporter shall make a transcript of all proceedings before the arbitrator if a hearing is held. The transcript shall then be the official record of the proceedings.
d.	The union shall bear the burden of justifying their calculations.
e.	The union shall be bound by the decision of the arbitrator.
6.	Objectors may choose to renew their requests for an advance reduction annually in compliance with the above-described procedures, or they may indicate in their letter to the General Secretary-Treasurer that they want their objection to be treated as continuing in nature.
7.	A person who was a member of the IAM at the time set forth in paragraph 1, but who subsequently resigns from membership, may request objector status for the remainder of the year. Said former member may, within the first thirty days after the effective date of resignation, write to the IAM General Secretary-Treasurer, as set forth in paragraph 2.

A.	INTRODUCTION
All written programs and policies applicable to our operations have been incorporated into this program. A periodic review of this material will be performed to ensure that the information presented is current.
When necessary, new specific procedures and policies will be developed and implemented.
This is our safety philosophy and the elements which are the foundation to our Safety Program.
All accidents and injuries can be prevented. Nothing we do in our daily activities is so important that we will sacrifice safety. Management is responsible, and will be held accountable, for preventing injuries and occupational illness. Occupational safety and health is part of every employee's total job performance. Working safely is a condition of employment. All workplace hazards can and will be safeguarded. Training employees to safely work is essential and the responsibility of management/ supervision. We will continuously try to exceed our safety standards.

B.	SAFETY AND HEALTH POLICY STATEMENT
It is our policy at Akima Technical Solutions, LLC to provide a safe, accident-free, and healthy work environment for everyone.
However, excellent safe and healthy conditions do not occur by chance. They are the result of diligent work and careful attention to all company policies by everyone.
Safety demands cooperation on everyone's pa1t. Thus, it is important that communication be kept open at all times between management and employees. Workers who notice hazards or other safety problems, or feel that they need additional training, must notify their manager. Managers and Leads must address these concerns and take corrective action when warranted.
Everyone at Akima Technical Solutions, LLC is obligated to know the safety requirements and standards for their area or job, and just as important, to abide by them. Managers and Leads must instill a positive attitude and safety awareness in their workers through personal adherence, personal contact, training, and regularly scheduled safety meetings . It is the duty of all employees to perform their work with maximum regard for the safety of themselves and co-workers.
Our safety policies are based on past experience and current standards, and are also an integral part of the company's personnel policies. This means that compliance with these policies is a condition of employment and must be taken seriously. Failure to comply is sufficient grounds for disciplinary action or for termination of employment.
Safety and health are every bit as important in this organization as productivity and quality. In fact, they go hand in hand. Of course the best reason for you to observe these policies is because it's in your own self-interest to do so. Conscientiously following them can help you stay safe, healthy, and able to work, play, and enjoy life to its fullest.

D.	SAFETY INCENTIVE PROGRAM
This company will implement a Safety Incentive Program. The program is designed to recognize those employees who contribute through the safe performance of their assigned tasks and promote Akima Technical Solutions, LLC Safety Program.
The company's safety goal is ZERO Incidents.

Once a mishap occurs, the 120 free Mishap days incentive will start over again. Mishaps that occur and are deemed not to be the employee's responsibility will not affect or count against this incentive program .
Safety deeds that are acknowledged and documented as above and beyond the normal safety work tasks, by a lead, manager, safety committee rep or the safety manager, will be presented to the Project Manager.
