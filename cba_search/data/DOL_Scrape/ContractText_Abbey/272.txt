2)	Employees eligible for overtime assignment shall first be obligated to accept work on their currently assigned shift if overtime is available. If overtime is not available on their currently assigned shift, eligible employees will be solicited for overtime on other shifts in accordance with their eligibility to work the available overtime.
26.	Out Of Department Overtime
A)	If an employee wishes to work out-of-department overtime, he may "opt in" by signing a list provided by the Company indicating his desire to do so in his current classification.

D)	If after the Company has completed the steps referred to in paragraph 26.C) above and there is still a need for

29.	No overtime pay will be given an employee who by virtue oi change of shifts works more than eight (8) hours in a twenty four (24) hour period. Employees will be given not less than a twenty four (24) hour notice of change of their regular shift If an employee does not receive such notice, he should be paid time-and-one-half for all hours in excess of eight whicf he works to effect the change (old shift and new shif combined).

It is also agreed all hours worked on such call back will be paid at double time, An employee called in as a result of another employee’s failure to honor an overtime commitment shall receive the regular premium pay for such hours worked.
34.	When employees are scheduled to work two (2) hours or more of overtime on a regular work day, they will be given a ten minute rest period with pay at the end of eight (8) hours. A ten (10) minute rest period will be given for each succeeding two (2) hours overtime worked.
35.	If employees are called to work before the starting time of their regular work shift, they will not be sent home early to avoid payment of overtime.

Page 13
36.	Except by agreement, the splitting of shifts to avoid th payment of overtime shall not be permitted.
37.	Senior employees will be given preference of shifts ii accordance with the following procedure:

Ar employee, in order to be considered for shift change just mentioned, must have his name on file in the Personnel Office indicating his classification and the shift to which he desires to be moved. His filing, ir order to receive consideration, must be made fifteer (15) days prior to the occurrence of the opening Any employee who has his name on file must accep the shift change if offered. In a reduction in force ar employee who has his name on file in the Personne Office fifteen (15) days in advance of a move will be allowed to bump to where his seniority would entitle him.
B)	On the fifteenth day of January each year and on the fifteenth day of July each year, an employee ma) exercise the option of a shift preference, by displacing z less senior employee on another shift who holds the same job classification.

Page 14
move. Employees with sufficient seniority shall within the following two (2) weeks be allowed to bump to the shift of their choice. Employees with less than one (1) year seniority shall not be entitled to any shift preference. The bumping privilege described herein shall prevail only during the period described above.
1)	Employees returning from a leave of absence will be treated as follows:
a) Employees returning from a leave of absence prior to a window period will be returned to the shift they previously held if their seniority entitles them to do so except that, if an employee was on a leave of absence during a window period, he shall go to the shift of his preference if his senioriN entitles him to do so.
In any labor grade above 8, it may be necessary to assign employees contrary to the above provision for a period not to exceed 30 days for training purposes; however, no employee shall be subject to such an assignment more than once in a twelve (12) month period. Employees so assigned will be returned to their original shift and classification at the end of the training period and will be considered as having been on that shift and classification for the entire training period so far as bumping rights or other benefits are concerned. Employees so assigned will be transferred and in the event of a night shift assignment will be eligible for night shift premium.
When an employee is moved from the shift of his preference to accept work on an upgraded job and subsequently that employee is reduced from an upgraded job as a result of a company action, he will be transferred to the shift of his preference provided he has a preference form filed fifteen (15) days prior to the
Page 15
Company action and provided his seniority entitles him t< do so. Employees who elect to sign away a job shall bf required to remain on their current shift until thei seniority allows them to move at a normal window.

C)	If an employee has selected a job classification in Grades 5-7 that has been eliminated due to technological or other changes, the employee will be allowed to select a previously held job (Grades 5-7) as their job of choice and would be entitled to that job per their seniority.

If the least senior employee in the job classification does not have sufficient division seniority to replace another employee
Page 18
in a non-upgraded job in his Division, he may exercise his plantwide seniority to replace the least senior employee in a non-upgraded job, if any, in another Division, providing he is more senior, and also qualified to do the work. In case of a recall after lay off, the oldest seniority employee laid off from a Division will be the first one recalled into that Division provided he is qualified to do the work available. Employees laid off or recalled at any time within a single day shall be regarded as being laid off or recalled simultaneously.
1) Employees will be recalled via the telephone. Two numbers may be supplied by each employee and both numbers will be called by the company in an effort to recall to work. In the event the employee cannot be reached at one of the two phone nuiTiuurs, ilie same numbers will be called again the following workday. In the event the employee still cannot be reached, the employee will be bypassed on the recall and a certified letter will be sent to their last known address asking the employee to contact the company. Once the employee has contacted the company, the employee will be asked if they are still available for recall and if there are any new phone numbers they would like to use for recall purposes. Those employees still available for recall will be returned to work within ten (10) working days of contact with the employee, provided their seniority will allow. Employees that fail to contact the company will be terminated as stated in paragraph 51. D) below.

A)	In case of layoff due to reduction of forces affecting upgraded jobs, the employee with the least upgraded Job Classification Seniority will be cut back first from the specific job classification affected. He may then revert to the previously held upgraded job in the same labor grade or lower to which his Upgraded Job Classification Seniority entitles him. (See classification selection paragraph 41.B) above)
1)	If his upgraded Job Classification Seniority does not entitle him to any previously held upgraded job, the employee may then exercise his Division Seniority on a non-upgraded job within his Division.
2)	If an employee does not have sufficient Division seniority to replace an employee on a non-upgraded job in his Division, then the employee may exercise his plantwide seniority to replace the least senior employee in a non-upgraded job, if any, in another Division, providing he is more senior, and also qualified to do the work.
3)	In case of recall after lay off, employees will be returned to upgraded jobs in line with their previously held Upgraded Job Classification Seniority.
B)	When an employee is being downgraded and holds seniority in two or more Upgraded Job Classifications in the same labor grade he will downgrade or replace the least senior employee.
C)	Payment of Temporary Upgrade Pay - In the event of a temporary move to an upgraded job, if the supervisor is
Page 20
unable to obtain the most senior - cut back employee within the job classification required, he will temporarily upgrade the employee used to do the work and will also temporarily upgrade the most senior cut back employee holding the job classification on the shift required to perform the work within the division.
44.	If employees on layoff are recalled by seniority for ten (10) consecutive days or less of available work, they will not be obligated to accept such recall. Employees working in the plant may not be temporarily assigned to classifications of work to which their seniority does not entitle them for more than ten (10) consecutive working days if the employees entitled to such work are on permanent layoff.
45.	To insure all employees an opportunity to apply for and receive consideration of 'obs in higher classifications, the following procedure will be followed:
A)	When all employees holding seniority on any upgraded job have been returned to such job, and additional employees are needed, an announcement of such openings will be posted on all shop bulletin boards for a period of not less than forty-eight (48) hours during the regular scheduled work week. On al) postings for upgrade jobs, the Company will provide a brief, nonbinding description.
B)	Employees in lower classification may bid for such jobs by signing an application in the Personnel Office. The Chief Steward will receive copies of the signed application of all bidders. The Chief Steward will be advised of the employees who have been selected for the promotion. An employee who bids on and is awarded an upgraded job will be required to go to the job. Once the bid has been awarded the successful bidder is prohibited from signing it away for a period of up to fifteen (15) days.
Page 21
C)	Consideration for placement of personnel on such jobs will be given in accordance with promotion policy as outlined in paragraph 46 below.
D)	Posting of a particular job classification will not be required more than one (1) time in a thirty (30) day period. All promotions will be made on the basis of the bids submitted within the forty-eight (48) hour bidding period. Exception will be made for those employees absent or on leave to permit them to bid on any job posted during their absence and be considered for such promotion provided that the job has not been filled or that no employee has been sent recall notice or transferred, or a new employee hired in preparation for filling such a job. If all bids have been exhausted and there are additional openings in a classification, an additional posting will be made at least one (1) time within the above thirty (30) day period. Posting shall include the job classification, labor grade, shift and maximum rate of pay.
E)	When it becomes necessary to combine two (2) or more job classifications, the appropriate Chief Steward will be notified.
46.	Promotions: Promotions will be made on the basis of the most senior qualified employee receiving the promotion. Where possible and practical personnel tests of ability and aptitude will be used in helping to determine qualifications of employees. Such tests will not be unreasonable or discriminatory in nature. Employees who meet the minimum requirements of such tests who have the greatest seniority shall be selected for promotion. An employee shall be allowed to take a particular test only one (1) time in a four (4] month period; however, he may take the test a second time within said period on his own time if such test is given. Tes scores will remain in effect for nine months. Segments of; test which an employee passed will also remain in effect fo Page 22
nine months. The Union shall have the right to have a representative present whenever such tests are given, who will observe the giving of the tests and the grading. This representative selected and paid by the Union shall be instructed by the Company in the mechanics of giving and grading the test. An employee selected for trial on an upgraded job will serve a probationary period as provided in paragraph 38. B) above. Should management determine he is not making satisfactory progress in learning the job he will be subject to removal from the job and reassignment to his previously held classification at any time up to the end of the trial period. Should the Union challenge such disqualification as discriminatory it will be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure. Should the employee decide he does not desire the position for which he has bid, he may voluntarily return to his previously held classification provided that, no employee shall exercise his "voluntary downgrade" more than one time in any six (6) month period.
A) Employees exercising such “voluntary downgrade" shall not be eligible to bid on the upgraded job affected for a period of one calendar year. If an employee voluntarily downgrades by signing away an upgraded classification and then at a later date rebids on the same job classification, the previous experience on the same job classification will not be a factor in obtaining said bid.
47.	Voluntary Lay-Offs: Employees may elect to be placed on layoff status in the event of a reduction in force. To make such election, an employee must place their name on file in Human Resources at least fifteen (15) days prior to the reduction, indicating that they prefer to get laid off. If a reduction occurs in a job classification, those in that classification who have elected layoff will be laid off in seniority order (most senior first). Employees may cancel their Voluntary Layoff option at any time, except that an employee's request to cancel their Voluntary Layoff option
Page 23
must be signed fifteen (15) days prior to the time of an opening. Once the cancellation of the Voluntary Layofl Option is in effect, the employee will be recalled to openings in the job from which they were laid off. Employees on Voluntary Layoff will be recalled to the job from which they were laid off in reverse seniority order when there are not other employees cutback who hold that job. After one year on Voluntary Layoff, employees will be recalled to openings in any job they hold. Failure to return to work upon recall will subject the employee to termination as stated in paragraph 42.A)1) above.
48.	When an employee to be laid off or reduced from an upgraded classification in one division is more senior than employees in other divisions who are still working, he may displace the least senior in the other division in such job as his seniority entitles him. Since many employees may prefer lay offs to accepting jobs in other divisions, employees subject to lay offs or on lay off will be given an opportunity to bump into or fill job openings only if they apply at time of lay off to the personnel department in writing indicating that they will accept such jobs if made available to them. Failure to honor that application shall result in the employee’s termination. Employees electing to make application must do so within three (3) work days following the time of their lay off or reduction. Employees who have made application will be placed on such jobs in line of seniority. The1 Company shall upon determination of the successful candidate have three (3) work days to effectuate the resulting move.
49.	Temporary Layoffs:
A)	In cases when a line, or section of a division may have cutbacks due to shortages in materials and othei necessary interruptions in production, temporary layoffs may be made without regard to seniority for periods no to exceed five (5) consecutive scheduled work days ir Page 24
the group immediately affected without permitting the employees in the group affected to exercise their Division Seniority. In no event will any employees be assigned to perform the work of the group affected except in emergency situations. Where two or more groups of employees in a department are performing identical work and only part of the employees in those work groups are temporarily laid off, the reduction shall be by Job Classification Seniority, from employees actively in the job, with employees holding the least seniority on the affected shift being laid off first No employee shall be affected by such temporary lay-off more than one hundred and twelve (112) scheduled working hours in any one (1) contract year.
1) When such a temporary lay off occurs, employees within an upgraded classification within a department, group, or section, the reduction shall be by Upgraded Job Classification Seniority, from employees actively in the job, with employees holding the least upgraded seniority on the affected shift being laid off first. When a temporary layoff occurs within a non-upgraded job classification within a department, group or section the reduction shall be by Division Seniority with employees holding the least Division Seniority on the affected shift being laid off first.
B)	If temporary employment is available in other parts of the plant when employees are temporarily laid off, said employees may be placed on these temporary jobs in line with their Job Classification Seniority, with employees holding the most seniority on the affected shift being placed first, provided they are actively in the job classification. When such temporarily assigned employees' regular jobs start up again, said employees will be returned to their regular jobs.
Page 25
1) Employees assigned to a temporary opening within their classification within the first hour of a shift shal not be subject to displacement for the balance of the shift. Other temporary work assignments shall be subject to displacement only once during the shift, Replacements made due to absenteeism will not be controlled by this section and employees so moved to replace an absentee shall not be subject to displacement for the balance of the shift - regardless of classification.
C)	When it is necessary to start a new line, resumption of work following a shut down, or other circumstances requiring the retraining or rescheduling of an assembly line, employees assigned to that line shall be recalled within a three (3) day period as operations are available to them without respect to their seniority status within the line affected. When such lines are cleaned of work prior to changes of the type listed above, employees may be laid off as their operations are concluded over a three (3) day period without consideration as to their seniority in relation to the group affected. Any days lost out of line of seniority because of this section shall apply toward the maximum of one hundred and twelve (112) hours as specified in paragraph 49.A) above.
D)	Employees of any Division can be laid off for a total of no more than four (4) weeks in any contract year because of customer scheduling requirements without permitting the employees in the group affected to exercise their seniority.
50.	It is agreed that it may be necessary at times to retain or hire, an employee irrespective of seniority when by reason of special training, ability or experience it is essential to the practical operation of the Company's business and the Company shall be the sole judge thereof. In no event shall the total number of employees covered by the foregoing Page 26
exceed ten (10) employees and employees included in the above shall be retained because of such qualifications for bargaining unit occupations only. Only bargaining unit jobs in labor grade 9 and above will be retained per this provision.
51.	Loss of Seniority: Employees shall lose all seniority and be terminated for any of the following reasons and shall be removed from the payroll:
A)	Resignation.

This notice is referenced in paragraph 42.A) 1) above.
E)	Layoff more than one (1) year duration.
1)	Note: Employees with more than one (1) year of service may retain their seniority for a total lay off period of four (4) years provided they notify the Personnel Office of any address change. Failure to maintain a current address with the Personnel Office will cause them to lose their seniority.
2)	Laid off employees who have selected jobs and/or shifts that do not meet the current or foreseeable needs of the business, will not be allowed to extend their layoff beyond one (1) year. At the end of the year, the employee's failure to take the necessary
Page 27
actions that would result in reasonable possibility ol their recall in line with their seniority will result in loss of all seniority and termination as per paragraph 51.E) above.
F)	Failure to report at termination of a leave of absence. Employees who do not present themselves for reemployment by the close of the next scheduled work day or submit proper evidence requesting extension of said leave by the close of the next scheduled work day shall be considered as having resigned.
G)	Re-enlists for a second tour of duty in the Armed Forces of the United States or Merchant Marines after completing an initial enlistment or period of conscripted service.
52.	Where changes in job assignment are required due to promotion, demotion, layoff, or transfer, the Company will not be required to assign an employee to a job for which he is not qualified regardless of seniority. The Company will make the determination of qualification. Employees will have recourse to the grievance procedure if such determination is disputed relative to the qualification of the individual. This section will not be used to deny an employee the right to bump a younger employee within a classification where he holds seniority unless he lacks the physical qualifications to perform the job.
53.	Employees excluded by Article I from participating in the bargaining unit shall not regularly do production or maintenance work usually performed by employees included within this Agreement except that such employees may when necessary be assigned to production or maintenance j work within reasonable limits whenever it is practical for the purpose of efficient operations or to eliminate standby or idle time on the part of unit employees. It shall not be the intent of this clause to use supervisory employees for the purpose
Page 28
of replacing regular production or maintenance employees or to avoid the assignment of such production and maintenance employees, or to eliminate working production and/or maintenance employees' overtime.
54.	Steward Seniority
A)	The President, Vice President, Chief Steward(s), Work Standards Stewards, and the Grievance Committee provided there is work available which they are capable of performing shall possess top ranking plant wide seniority for purpose of layoff, temporary layoff, and of recall.

The number of section stewards shall be limited in accordance with ARTiCLE XV, Aiiocauun ui Sie wards.
C)	As long as there is work available which the steward is qualified to perform a section steward will not be moved from his own section. However, this section will not permit a section steward to be retained in an upgraded job which his Upgraded Job Classification Seniority does not entitle him. Should a section steward choose to remain in his own section on a lower rated job, he will not be required to relinquish any seniority rights on any other higher rated jobs elsewhere.
1 55. Effective with the signing of this Agreement, if an employee works on or is transferred to a supervisory or other position excluded from the coverage of this Agreement, such employee shall retain his established and accumulated seniority in the event he should be transferred back within a period of six (6) months, to any of the jobs referred to in Article I (paragraph 5 above) of this Agreement. Should the return transfer occur after the six (6) month period, he will Page 29
accumulate only the six (6) months in addition to his bargaining unit time:

ARTICLE IX
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
70.	To adequately provide for the settlement of disputes arising out of the administration of this contract a grievance procedure is hereby provided. A claim that the Company has violated some provision of this contract or failed to perform some obligation assumed under this contract is a grievance within the meaning of this contract. Formal grievances must be presented through union representation as provided in Steps 1, 2, 3 and pre-arbitration of the Grievance Procedure. This does not restrict employees from discussing day-to-day problems with their foreman or supervisor.
71.	The following procedure will be adhered to in the handling of ail disputes as defined in paragraph 70 above. If an employee is taken from his work position and out of his general work area by a Company representative for the
Page 34
purpose of initiating progressive discipline he shall have the right to have his Section Steward present if he requests same. The Union Steward will initial copies of such written notice, if any, as evidence that he was present when it was administered.
A)	Step 1 - Presentation of Grievance to immediate supervisor. The grievance shall be presented orally by the affected employee or by the affected employee and the steward to the immediate supervisor. Such grievances must be presented within ten (10) working days of their occurrence and in no case will any liability for restitution by the Company predate the presentation of the oral grievance. When a continuing alleged violation exists, the ten (10) day limitation will not apply as long as the alleged violation exists. If employees are improperly laid off or improperly recalled, restitution will be made to the date of the violation if a grievance is filed within fifteen (15) days of ine violation.
1)	If a grievance is filed later than fifteen (15) days after the violation, restitution will be to the date of filing. Payroll errors will be corrected when found. Should those involved be unable to settle the grievance by oral discussions, the grievance must be reduced to writing, signed by the aggrieved employee and the department steward, and presented to the immediate supervisor no later than the close of the next following work day. If a grievance is presented which involves more than fifteen (15) employees such a grievance will be presented with the signature of the steward only, and without the signature of the employees involved. This grievance will be assigned a number according to a numbering system agreed to by both the Company and the Union. The immediate supervisor will reply In writing within two (2) working days after receipt of the
Page 35
written grievance. If grievances arise which involve general policies of divisions or departments rather than individuals or groups of employees such grievances may be presented without the signature of any employee other than the steward.
B)	Step 2 - Appeal to Department Manager. If the immediate supervisor's written reply to the grievance does not settle the dispute, the Union through the division Chief Steward may appeal to the Department Manager. This request must be made in writing within three (3) working days following the receipt of the immediate supervisor’s written reply. This request must give the primary portion of contract violated and remedy sought. Upon receipt of this request the manager will schedule a meeting within two (2) working days to discuss the grievance. Those attending these meetings will include the Department Manager, immediate supervisor, and/or general foreman, the Labor Relations representative, the aggrieved employee, the department steward, and the division chief steward. If two (2) or more employees are filing the grievance, one (1) of the employees involved will be designated by the Union as their representative to participate in this stage of the grievance procedure. Within three (3) working days a written answer to the grievance will be submitted to the Division Chief Steward by the Company.
C)	Step 3 - Appeal to Division Manager. If a grievance still remains unsatisfied, the Union may appeal to the Division Manager by written notice within five (5) working days following receipt of the reply from the Company. Such grievances will be scheduled in the next meeting between the Division Manager or his designated representative and the Grievance Committee. At these । meetings matters may be raised for discussion which concern employer-employee relationship, but are not
Page 36
contractual issues. Such meetings will be normally scheduled two times per month, but more frequently, if necessary, with the Division Manager or his designated representative and the Plant Grievance Committee. The meetings will be scheduled for 1:30 p.m. and will end with the close of the regular eight (8) hour shift.
1)	The committee will be limited to four (4) employees, the Union President, two Chief Stewards and the Recording Secretary; or five (5) if there are three (3) Chief Stewards. If additional information is needed in discussing a particular grievance, the committee may caucus with the witness. The Work Standards Steward may be called into the Step III meeting. The Business Manager and/or the International Representative of the Union and other management representatives, as necessary, shall participate in such meetings. Such meetings are to be held only if a request is made by the union wilTi the submission of an agenda of matters to be discussed at such a meeting.
2)	Within five (5) working days following such meetings, the Company will reply in writing to all issues raised in such meetings including final answers on Step 3 grievances.
D) Pre-Arbitration Meeting - Appeal to Plant Manager. If a grievance still remains unresolved, the Union may appeal to the Plant Manager or his designated representative by written notice within thirty (30) days following receipt of a reply from Third Step by the Company. A meeting will be scheduled within five (5) working days of the appeal to the Pre-Arbitration meeting. Within five (5) working days following such meeting, the Plant Manager or his designated representative will reply in writing to all issues raised in such meetings including final answers on the grievances heard at the Pre-Arbitration meeting.
Page 37
1)	Those attending the Pre-Arbitration meeting will be the same as those attending the Step 3 meeting except either party may have in attendance two additional persons to assist in resolving the grievance.
72.	It is understood and agreed that all time limits must be strictly adhered to in the processing of grievances, unless the Company and Union mutually agree in writing to extensions. It is further understood that failure on the part of the Union to submit grievances within the time limits specified, will automatically exclude them from any consideration. Should the management representative fail at any step in the grievance procedure to reply to a formal grievance within the prescribed time limit the Union will have the right to immediately process the grievance To the next step in the grievance procedure.
73.	Any dispute not settled in the above procedure may then be appealed to the Arbitration Procedure as provided for in ARTICLE X.
74.	It is agreed that time spent by Union Officials in the investigation of grievances shall be held to a minimum. When a Union Official is required to participate in a grievance during working hours he shall first obtain from his foreman an "Authorization Pass” and he must return this pass to his foreman when returning to his job. If it is necessary for any reason that he enter another department he must inform the foreman of the department of which he enters of the reason for his presence and that foreman must sign his “Authorization Pass" indicating the time when he enters and leaves the department. At the request of the Union any and all stewards will be supplied with pads of blank passes. Time spent during regular working hours by stewards or chief stewards in investigating and disposing of grievances will be paid for by the Company. When departments or groups of employees are scheduled for
Page 38
overtime work and the Steward of such group or department is also scheduled for overtime the Steward shall be permitted to handle grievances whenever necessary during such overtime hours in accordance with the established grievance procedure. This is not to be construed as requiring the Company to necessarily schedule stewards on overtime basis nor does it require the Company to pay stewards for overtime work if they of their own volition work after their scheduled quitting time in the investigation or processing of grievances.
75.	When a grievance is presented in accordance with the Grievance Procedure the Company will not attempt to settle the grievance with any employee or group of employees without the appropriate union representative or representatives being present.
76.	If in the presentation of a grievance it is disclosed that additional witnesses are required the parties may by mutual consent call such witnesses.
77.	Any grievance in which no employee is involved or any question of interpretation or application of this Agreement may be raised by the Union at the third step of the grievance procedure.
78.	Prior to discharge, an employee shall be suspended for five (5) work days pending discharge. Both the employee involved and the appropriate Chief Steward shall be notified of the suspension and the employee will have an opportunity to see the appropriate Chief Steward before leaving the plant. The sole purpose of said five (5) day suspension period is to allow further investigation into the facts supporting the discharge. If no new evidence satisfactory to the Company is uncovered during said period, the discharge— shall be effective. Both the Union and the employee will be= so advised. Discharge shall be subject to the grievance anc= arbitration procedure.
Page 39
79,	Official Notices of hires, rehires, transfers, rate changes, lay offs, any terminations will be made available daily to the appropriate chief steward. If said information to be submittey by Company to the appropriate chief steward is incorrect incomplete, or not provided, the ten (10) day limitation fOr filing grievances which such information would have revved an(j the (imitation of the Company's liability for restitution! sha[| not apply. When the information is corrected or supplier the grievance must be filed within ten (10) days and the region shall be the date of the violation.

REASONABLE SUSPICION TESTING*
135.	Grounds
A)	Reasonable suspicion testing may be based upon, . among other things:
B)	Observable phenomena, such as direct observation or alcohol use or possession and/or the physical symptoms of being under the influence of a drug or alcohol.
C)	A pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior.
D)	Conviction for a drug-related or alcohol-related offense, or the identification of an employee as the focus of a criminal investigation into illegal drug possession, use or trafficking.
E)	Information provided either by reliable and credible sources or independently corroborated.
F)	Serious injury to the employee or another employee which results in lost time.
136.	Procedures - If an employee is suspected of using drugs or alcohol at the work place or reports for work under the influence of drugs or alcohol, supervision is responsible for taking the following action:
A)	The supervisor will notify the appropriate steward or chief steward. If both are unavailable, the supervisor will call the representative designated by the Union.
B)	if medical personnel are on the premises, the supervisor must consult the Company nurse or Company doctor and relay all information, facts and circumstances leading to and supporting his suspicion to medical personnel. The supervisor and the Union official notified will then request that the employee accompany them to the nurse or doctor. The nurse or doctor will at that point conduct
Page 68
their own medical investigation and determine if a drug/alcohol test is in order (e.g. it may not be if prescription drugs are in use). Should a test be deemed appropriate, the employee will be asked to sign a consent form and will be advised that a positive test outcome confirming the presence of drugs or alcohol will not necessarily result in discipline. For instance, an employee who tests positive may be referred to an organization for help (e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous). Employees, however, may face discipline up to and including discharge for repeated positive test results. Any employee who refuses to consent to a test under the aforementioned circumstances will be terminated for insubordination in accordance with Plant Rules.
C)	If medical personnel are not on the premises, the supervisor must notify the appropriate Union official and confer with a higher level of supervision and relay all information facts and circumstances leading to and supporting his suspicion to said higher level supervisor. When the higher level supervisor agrees with the supervisor’s reasonable suspicion, both will then request that the employee accompany them and the Union official to a private office and review their suspicions with the employee. Based upon this discussion, supervision may decide that an appropriate drug or alcohol test is appropriate (e.g.; it may not be if prescription drugs are in use). Supervision will then request that the employee sign a consent form and accompany them to an appropriate testing site. At this point, the same rules regarding positive test results, repeat positive test results and refusal to consent to a test as outlined in paragraph 136.B) above apply.
137.	Supervisory Training - Supervisors will be trained to address drug and alcohol use or abuse by employees, to recognize facts that give rise to a reasonable suspicion, and to
Page 69
document facts and circumstances to support a finding of reasonable suspicion. Union officers, chief stewards and stewards will be invited to attend the same training. Failure to receive such training, however, shall not invalidate otherwise proper reasonable suspicion testing.
138.	Testing Procedures
A)	Chain of Custody - The testing laboratory will ensure that a proper “chain of custody” is maintained throughout the testing process. Both parties will agree upon an appropriate testing site and testing laboratory.
B)	Privacy Assured - Should any individual be subject to urine testing under this policy, he/she shall be permitted to provide a urine specimen in private, and in a test room, stall or similar enclosure so that the employee is not observed while providing the sample. Collection site personnel of the same gender as the individual tested, however, may observe the individual provide the urine specimen when such personnel have reason to believe that the individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided.
C)	Test Results - Upon receipt, the Company will share the results of any test with the Union,
D)	If an employee undergoes a test and the test results are reported negative, the employee will be reimbursed for any and all lost time incurred.
139.	Non-Discriminatory Impact - Both the Company and the Union agree that this program is not to be used to discriminate against or harass employees.
140.	NOTE: This exhibit will be modified as necessary so that the Agreement will be in compliance with the ‘Drug Free Workplace Program of Tennessee’ (Tenn Statutes 50-9-101) so that the Company will receive all available relief from Worker’s Compensation costs provided in the Act. The
Page 70
regular testing of employees will be based upon Reasonable Suspicion Testing and not Random Sample Testing.
Page 71
CONSENT FORM FOR ALCOHOL, DRUG AND SUBSTANCE SCREENING
I hereby consent for the Company to collect blood, urine, hair, breath or saliva samples from me and to conduct other necessary medical tests to determine the presence or use of alcohol, drugs or controlled -substances. Further, I give my consent for the release of the test results, and other relevant medical information to authorized Company management and union representatives for appropriate review.

APPENDIX II
IN-DEPARTMENT, WEEKEND OVERTIME
142.	For the purpose of distribution of weekend in-department overtime for on-line departments, the departments associated with each production process will be considered together to determine which shift is solicited for the weekend work. In the case of a "Flow Line" (Final and Chassis Lines are linked together by production requirements), the Final Assembly Area will determine which shift works the weekend overtime. The Final Line will keep a record of the hours worked by the entire process, for weekend distribution purposes.
143.	The solicitation will be as follows:
A)	In-department solicitation for all departments in the flow process, on the flow process, on the entitled shift. The hours between the shifts will be kept as equal as practical. The overtime hours will be kept for the entire
Page 74
process by the Final Assembly Area for distribution purposes of weekend overtime. Individual departments will also keep normal overtime records to divide overtime offered to only part of the department, on each shift, such as rework and pilot run.
B)	When all employees in each department, on the shift solicited for the weekend overtime, are solicited and the overtime requirements are not met, the out-of-department procedure will be utilized.
1)	Overtime - Between Shifts - Per agreement reached on 05/25/83, end-of-shift overtime during the week will be offered by shift - other shift will not be asked during the week. Saturdays will be used to attempt to equalize the overtime hours between shifts; i.e., the shift with low overtime hours will be offered the Saturday overtime.
144.	This method will be used on all production lines with noe than one shift. This will help to equalize the overtime between shifts.
145.	The off-line departments will be solicited by having supervision solicit the low employee regardless of shift. This will assist in the equalization of overtime in-department with multiple shifts. The off-line departments are listed below.

522 571 572 573 590 100	IMI Material Handlers Material Handlers Receiving Truck Drivers Receiving Shipping - All Classifications
146.	There will be times when the need for overtime is not known until Friday. In such instances, the first shift will be solicited, regardless of which shift is low. It is hoped that this will not be a frequent occurrence and if it does happen, the low shift will be given the next opportunity to work the overtime. This procedure makes no changes in the contract language - only in the method used to solicit in-department overtime.
147.	If any major problem needs to be addressed at any time, the two parties will discuss the problem as soon as possible. If resolution to the problem cannot be reached, the issue can be handled through the grievance procedure.
APPENDIX III
LETTERS OF UNDERSTANDING
148.	TEMPORARY UPGRADE TO SUPERVISORY POSITION -If an hourly employee works in a salaried position on a temporary basis and the work is performed on an overtime basis, the employee will be charged as having worked the hours within his current classification within his home department. This will prevent the problem of the employee getting two opportunities to work the overtime.
149.	JOB BIDS - Based on our understanding in contract negotiations, if an employee bids on an opening and prior to being awarded the job withdraws his bid, he shall not be charged with a voluntary downgrade pursuant to paragraph 46.A) above of the Labor Agreement. If he withdraws his bid, after being awarded the job, however, he shall be charged with exercising his “voluntary downgrade" and shall
Page 76
not be eligible to exercise his voluntary downgrade again for six (6) months.
150.	JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE - During the course of the negotiations, the parties agreed to establish a Joint Labor-Management Committee on “change” which will undertake discussions on new ways, methods and ideas for the purpose of retaining existing jobs and work at the Greeneville plant. This Committee will also explore new ways to expand or improve the current work volume and/or work processes. Revision of contractual procedures consistent with these new operating concepts will be subject to local membership approval.
A) This Committee will be established as soon as possible following negotiations and will consist of Company Representatives, the Union Grievance Committee and employees from the area or department affected by the proposed change.
151.	401K PLAN - The Company agrees to create a 401K Plan for employees to allow them to make tax sheltered contributions and for the Company to make voluntary contributions at its discretion. In addition, the Company agrees that that they will match twenty-five percent (25%) of an employee's contributions, up to five percent (5%) of the contributing employee's gross earnings. The company will fund the plan with the matching contributions at least on a quarterly basis.
152.	NEW MARKETS, PRODUCTS, AND BEING MORE COMPETITIVE - In the discussions and negotiations preceding the acquisition of Plant #3 from Philips, the Company expressed a need to enter into new markets with existing products and services, develop new products, and the necessity of generally being more competitive. It was agreed that although the specific language of Article II (paragraph 6 above) might not state it, the Company would
Page 77
have the full rights needed to accomplish these objectives. Although unaffected by practices or informal understandings not actually a part of the contract, these rights would be limited by the specific terms of the Agreement between the parties. However, the Agreement can be modified or amended in writing, signed by designated representative of • the Company and the appropriate Local or International Union officials.
153.	PAYMENT FOR GRIEVANCE MEETINGS AND FORMS -Certain practices which exist regarding Company payments for grievance meetings between the Company and the Union Grievance Committee were discussed. These practices will be continued.
A) The Company also agreed to continue to furnish grievance forms, appeal forms, seniority rosters, pass books, dues deduction reports, time off forms, and hourly employee deduction forms.
154.	JOB GRADE FIVE (5) THROUGH SEVEN (7) SELECTION -If an employee has selected a job classification in Grades 5-7 that has been eliminated due to technological or other changes, the employee will be allowed to select a previously held job (Grades 5-7) as their job of choice and would be entitled to that job per their seniority. (This option is in reference to paragraph 41.B) above, and can only be exercised in the event of a total job classification elimination.)
155.	DISCIPLINARY LAYOFFS FOR OVERTIME MISSED (22 above) - In cases where employees miss scheduled overtime, the company will agree to have the facts reviewed by Human Resources, for the purpose of determining good 1 cause. Employees may present any relevant documentation substantiating their absence and HR will make decisions based on the facts in each case. Employees that are found
Page 78
to have missed scheduled overtime without good cause will be subject to one day disciplinary layoff.
156.	IN-DEPARTMENT, WEEKEND OVERTIME (Appendix II, 142 above) - During contract negotiations, while the company could not agree to change the current overtime procedures for weekend overtime for on-line departments to include all shifts in the overtime solicitation process, the company does agree to the following steps in overtime solicitation for weekend overtime for on-line departments:
A)	Solicit employees on the entitled shift in the department where the work exists.
B)	Secure employees from the out-of-department listing on the solicited shift.
C)	While preserving its contractual right to then select any employee it chooses, the company’s preference in selecting employees will be first from employees assigned to the department working overtime, on shifts not previously solicited.
This agreement in no way obligates the company to any overtime solicitation requirements beyond what the contract requires. It is simply a description of our intent to give preference to employees assigned to the department working overtime, on other shifts, after the contractual requirements have been met.
157.	STEWARD STATUS IN CREATIVE MOLDING, LLC/DISTRIBUTION SERVICES, LLC - The Company agrees that the common labor grade in Creative Molding, LLC will be Grade 7 and in Distribution Services, LLC will be Grade 6. This agreement will allow stewards in those divisions to remain in their upgraded job instead of being laid off. This letter supersedes the second sentence in Article VI, paragraph 54.C) above for these divisions.
Page 79
158.	LINE STARTUP TRAINING - When a new line starts operation and employees assigned to the new line are needed to report to work early for training, they will be notified via their recall or transfer notice. Notice will include that their schedule has been changed and that they will be required to work their entire regular shift after completion of the early training hours.
159.	GRADE 4 REINSTATEMENT - The company agreed that employees will have a 30 day window (June 23, 2003 -July 22, 2003) to reinstate labor grade 4. Laid off employees that reinstate labor grade 4 will be recalled to openings in line with their division seniority but will not be allowed to bump other employees as a result of the reinstatement. In order to be considered for labor grade 4 work, employees must sign a form reinstating labor grade 4 at least 15 days prior to the move. The company agrees that it will contact employees currently laid off to inform them of their right to reinstate grade 4.
