ARTICLE 2
ARTICLE 2.	SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT
Section 1.	Single Bargaining Unit
All employees covered by this Master Agreement and the various Supplements, Riders and Addenda thereto, shall constitute one (I) bargaining unit. The printing of this Master Agreement and the aforesaid Supplements, Riders and/or Addenda in separate agreements is for convenience only and is not intended to create separate bargaining units.
To the extent provided by law, this Agreement shall be applied to all subsequent additions to, and extensions of, current common carrier operations of the Employer and newly established operations of the Employer which are utilized as a part of such current operations of the Employer, without additional evidence of Union representation of the employees involved (provided that newly acquired operations of the Employer, which are not utilized as a part of such current common carrier operation of the Employer, shall not be deemed additions to. or extensions of, operations of the Employer). If the Employer purchases a related common carrier business, the Employer, to the extent allowed by law, recognizes the Teamsters UPS National Negotiating Committee as the bargaining representative and will meet to determine which applicable Supplement covers those employees, and negotiate a new Addendum covering economic terms if current Supplements do not cover the new job classifications, or, if a current collective bargaining agreement is in place for the acquired employees, then that agreement shall continue by its terms until expiration.
Section 2.	Riders
Present Supplements, Riders and Addenda shall remain in effect.
Any new Supplement, Rider or Addendum, or changes to Supplements, Riders or Addenda or in the contract affiliation of any Local Union covered by this Agreement must be submitted to the Joint National Negotiating Committee for review and approval.

- 4 -
ARTICLE 2
Any lesser conditions contained in any Supplement, Rider or Addendum shall be superseded by the conditions contained in this Master Agreement. However, except where specifically stated otherwise in the Master Agreement, nothing in this Master Agreement shall deprive any employee of any superior benefit contained in their Supplement, Rider or Addendum.
ARTICLE 3.	RECOGNITION, UNION SHOP AND CHECKOFF
Section 1.	Recognition
(a)	The Employer recognizes and acknowledges that the National Union Committee and Local Unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters are the exclusive representatives of all employees of the Employer in covered classifications. The employees and Unions covered under this Master Agreement and the various Supplements, Riders and Addenda thereto shall constitute one (I) bargaining unit.
(b)	When the Employer needs additional employees, it shall give the Union equal opportunity with all other sources to provide suitable applicants, but the Employer shall not be required to hire those referred by the Union.
If employees are hired through an employment agency, the Employer shall pay the employment agency fee, if any, due from the employee. However, if the Union has been given equal opportunity to furnish employees, as provided herein, and if the employee is retained through the probationary period, this fee need not be paid until the thirty-first (31st) day of employment, except as otherwise provided in the Local Union Supplements, Riders and Addenda.
Business agents and/or a steward shall be permitted to attend new employee orientations in the right-to-work states. In states without right-to-work laws, business agents shall be permitted to attend new employee orientations to talk about the benefits of Union membership. The Employer agrees to provide the Local Union at least one week’s notice of the date, time, and location of such orientation.
-5-
ARTICLE 3
The sole purpose of the business agent’s or steward’s attendance shall be to encourage new employees to join the Union. The steward shall remain on the clock for up to fifteen (15) minutes for that purpose if the orientation is held during his or her normal working hours at his or her normal place of work.
Section 2.	Union Shop and Dues
(a)	All present employees who are members of the Local Union on the effective date of this Subsection or on the date of execution of this Agreement, whichever is the later, shall remain members of the Local Union in good standing as a condition of employment. In order to assist the Local Unions in maintaining current and accurate membership records, the Employer will furnish the appropriate Local Union a list of new employees. The Employer agrees to notify the Local Union when a new employee attains seniority. This notification will be made in conjunction with the new employee listing. The list will include the name, address, social security number, date of hire, hub or center to which assigned, shift, and classification or position hired into. The Employer shall also notify the Local Union when the employee is promoted from part-time to full-time. The list will be provided on a monthly basis. All present employees who are not members of the Local Union and all employees who are hired hereafter, shall become and remain members in good standing of the Local Union as a condition of employment on and after the thirty-first (31st) day following the beginning of their employment, or on and after the thirty-first (31st) day following the effective date of this subsection, or the date of this Agreement, whichever is the later. An employee who has failed to acquire, or thereafter maintain, membership in the Union, as herein provided, shall be terminated seventy-two (72) hours after the Employer has received written notice from an authorized representative of the Local Union, certifying that membership has been, and is continuing to be offered to such employees on the same basis as all other members, and further that the employee has had notice and opportunity to make all dues or initiation fee payments. This provision shall be made and become effective as of such time as it may be made and become effective under the provision of the National Labor Relations Act, but not retroactively.
-6-
ARTICLE 3
(b)	No provision of Section 2(a) of this Article shall apply to the extent that it may be prohibited by state law. In those states where subsection (a) above may not be validly applied, the Employer agrees to recommend to all new employees that they become members of the Union and maintain such membership during the life of this Agreement.
Section 3.	Dues Checkoff and Joint Dues Committee
The Union and the Employer will establish a Joint Dues Committee to review the deduction and remittance of union dues. This Committee is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that dues are accurately deducted and remitted in a timely manner to the Local Unions. It is anticipated that this Committee shall serve as a source of continuing study regarding the most efficient, accurate, and expeditious deduction and payment of dues, including exploring electronic solutions. The Union and the Employer will establish procedures for the operation of this Committee.
No existing bargaining unit employee currently performing work in the payroll department will be laid off or suffer a loss of their current payroll type position as a result of this Section.
The Employer agrees to deduct from the pay of all employees covered by this Agreement the initiation fees, dues and/or uniform assessments of the Local Union having jurisdiction over such employees. The Local Union will provide the Employer a weekly amount to be deducted from each employee. The Local Union will individually specify the weekly amount to be deducted for initiation fees, union dues and/or assessments. For initiation fees and assessments, the Local Union will notify the Employer the number of weeks these deductions are to be taken from the employee. Notification of deductions to be made by the Employer for the benefit of the Local Union must be received at least one (1) month prior to the date the deduction is to be made. The obligation of the Local Union to provide this information shall be satisfied by the transmission of a computer file in mutually agreeable format.
The Employer shall make no deductions that are not listed on the Local Union's monthly or weekly checkoff statement in those loca
- 7 -
ARTICLE 3
lions which send a checkoff statement to the Employer. In the event the Employer improperly deducts too much dues money, the amount improperly withheld shall be remitted to the involved employee(s) on the second (2nc*) scheduled workday following notification to the Employer. The Local Union(s) shall return any overpayment(s) to the Employer within one (1) week following written notification from the Employer.
The Employer will provide a remittance to the Local Union within fifteen (15) days following the check date the deduction was taken. With each remittance, the Employer shall submit a report, by center and/or sort, listing all employees alphabetically with their social security number and job classification. For those employees who had no deduction for the week, the Employer will provide a reason. In the event the Local Union does not want to receive a weekly remittance, the Employer will provide a monthly remittance by the fifteenth (15th) day of the following month. However, if this option is chosen, the Employer will still make weekly deductions as described above.
The Employer will provide a list of peak season employees to the Local Union. The Company agrees to honor the dues checkoff cards for peak season employees.
Where law requires written authorization by the employee, the same is to be furnished in the form required. No deduction shall be made which is prohibited by applicable law.
Any Local Union shall have the option of monthly deductions with monthly remittance on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the same month.
On written request of the employee, payroll deductions will be made to purchase U.S. Savings Bonds for said employee.
The Employer agrees to deduct from the paycheck of all employees covered by this Agreement voluntary contributions to DRIVE. DRIVE shall notify the Employer of the amounts designated by each contributing employee that are to be deducted from his/her paycheck on a weekly basis for all weeks worked. The phrase
-8-
ARTICLE 3
“weeks worked” excludes any week other than a week in which the employee earned a wage. The Employer shall transmit to DRIVE National Headquarters on a monthly basis, in one (1) check, the total amount deducted along with the name of each employee on whose behalf a deduction is made, the employee’s Social Security number and the amount deducted from that employee’s paycheck. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters shall reimburse the Employer annually for the Employer's actual cost for the expenses incurred in administering the weekly payroll deduction plan.
The Employer agrees to deduct certain specific amounts each week from the wages of those employees who shall have given the Employer written notice to make such deductions. The Employer will remit amounts deducted to the applicable credit union once each week. The amount so deducted shall be remitted to the applicable credit union once each month or weekly. The Employer shall not make deductions and shall not be responsible for remittance to the credit union for any deductions for those weeks during which the employee's earnings shall be less than the amount authorized for deductions.
In the event the Employer has been determined to be in violation of this Article by a decision in the grievance procedure, and if such Employer subsequently is in violation thereof after receipt of seventy-two (72) hours’ written notice of specific delinquencies, the Local Union may strike to enforce this Article. However, such strike shall be terminated upon the delivery thereof. Errors or inadvertent omissions relating to individual employees shall not constitute a violation.
Section 4.	Work Assignments
The Employer agrees to respect the jurisdictional rules of the Union and, except as otherwise provided in this Master Agreement, Supplements, Riders, or Addenda, shall not direct or require their employees or persons, other than the employees in the bargaining units here involved, to perform work which is recognized as the work of the employees in said units. This is not to interfere with bona fide agreements with bona fide unions. The Employer further agrees not to combine into a single job work presently performed by
-9-
ARTICLE 3
members of one Teamster Local Union with work presently performed by members of another Teamster Local Union.
Section 5.
The term “Local Union” as used herein refers to the IBT Local Union which represents the employees of the Employer at the particular place or places of business to which this Agreement, and the Supplements, Riders or Addenda thereto are applicable, unless by agreement of the Local Unions involved or by directive issued pursuant to the IBT International Constitution.
Section 6.
Employees shall have the option of participating in the Employer’s electronic funds transfer (EFT), the Employer’s check card payment system, or a paper payroll check system. New employees, defined as employees who are not on the payroll on the date of ratification, shall designate either EFT or a check card, unless prohibited by applicable state law. New employees shall make this election during orientation. Recognizing the mutual benefits and advantages of these systems over a paper payroll check, the Union agrees to encourage all employees to select either EFT or a check card as a method of payment. No bargaining unit employee currently performing work in the payroll department will be laid off or suffer a loss of their current payroll type position as a result of this Section.
Section 7.	Supervisors Working
(a)	The Employer agrees that the function of supervisors is the supervision of Employees and not the performance of the work of the employees they supervise. Accordingly, the Employer agrees that supervisors or other employees of the Employer who are not members of the bargaining unit shall not perform any bargaining unit work, except to train employees or demonstrate safety, or as otherwise provided in the applicable Supplement, Rider or Addendum. However, in the case of Acts of God, supervisors shall comply with the procedures in subsections (b) and (c) and may only perform bargaining unit work until bargaining unit employees are available. The Employer shall make every reasonable effort to maintain a sufficient workforce to staff its operations with bargaining unit employees. The Employer also agrees that supervisors or
- 10-
ARTICLE 3
other employees of the Employer who are not members of the bargaining unit shall not perform bargaining unit work in preparing the work areas before the start of the Employer’s hub. preload or reload operation, nor shall the Employer send any bargaining unit employee home arid then have such employee’s work performed by a supervisor or other employees of the Employer who are not a member of the bargaining unit.
(b)	When additional employees are necessary to complete the Employer’s operations on any shift or within any classification, the supervisor shall exhaust all established local practices to first use bargaining unit employees including where applicable, double shifting; early call-in, and overtime.
(c)	If there is no established local practice, the following shall apply with regard to inside work. Within each building, each operation will rnaintain appropriate list(s), by seniority, of those part-time employees requesting coverage work. It will be the employees’ responsibility to sign up on the appropriate list. The Company shall post such lists and employees who are interested in adding their names to the lists shall do so on the first working day of each month. It will be the employee's responsibility to make sure his/her contact information is correct. Employees who are unavailable to work on three (3) separate occasions within a calendar month shall have their names removed from the coverage list. Those einployees shall be eligible to re-sign the list the following month. When coverage work is available; the Cornpany will use the appropriate list to fill the required positions, and such einployees will work as assigned. The employee must be qualified for the available work and double shift employees shall have seniority among themselves. No employee is allowed to work more than two (2) shifts in any twenty-four (24) hour period. Local call verification practices and procedures shall remain in place.
Nothirig contained in this Section shall charige existing practices or procedures covering full-time work.
(d)	If it is deterrnined at any step of the grievance and/or arbitration procedure that this Section, or a “supervisor working” provision iri a Supplement, Rider or Addendum, has been violated, the aggrieved
- 11 -
ARTICLE 3
employee will be paid as follows: (i) if the actual hours worked by the supervisor amounts to two (2) hours or less, the aggrieved employee will be paid for the actual hours worked by the supervisor at the rate of double time the employee’s rate of pay at the time of the incident; or (ii) if the supervisor works more than two (2) hours, the aggrieved employee shall be paid four (4) hours at straight time or actual hours worked at double time the employee’s rate of pay at the time of the incident, whichever is greater. If no aggrieved employee can be identified, the payment will be made to the grievant. Such remedy shall be in addition to any other remedies sought by the Union in the appropriate grievance procedure.
ARTICLE 4.	STEWARDS
The Employer recognizes the right of the Local Union to designate Job Stewards and alternates from the Employer’s seniority list. The authority of Job Stewards and alternates so designated by the Local Union shall be limited to, and shall not exceed, the following duties and activities:
(a)	The investigation and presentation of grievances with the Employer or the designated company representative in accordance with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement:
(b)	The collection of dues when authorized by appropriate Local Union action; and
(c)	The transmission of such messages and information, which shall originate with, and are authorized by the Local Union or its officers, provided such messages and information:
(I)	have been reduced to writing; or
(2)	if not reduced to writing, are of a routine nature and do not involve work stoppages, slowdowns, refusal to handle goods, or any other interference with the Employer’s business.
Job Stewards and alternates have no authority to take strike action or any other action interrupting the Employer’s business, except as authorized by official action of the Local Union. The Employer rec
- 12 -
ARTICLE 4
ognizes these limitations upon the authorized Job Stewards and their alternates, and shall not hold the Union liable for any unauthorized acts. The Employer in so recognizing such limitations shall have the authority to impose proper, nondiscriminatory discipline, including discharge. However, in the event the Job Steward or the designated alternate has led, or instigated or encouraged unauthorized strike action, slowdown or work stoppages in violation of this Agreement he/she may be singled out for more serious discipline, up to and including discharge. Stewards and/or alternate stewards shall not be subject to discipline for performing any of the duties within the scope of their authority as defined in this Section, in the manner permitted by this Section.
Recognizing the importance of the role of the Union Steward in resolving problems or disputes between the Employer and its employees, the Employer reaffirms its commitment to the active involvement of union stewards in such processes in accordance with the terms of this Article.
The Job Steward or the designated alternate shall be permitted reasonable time to investigate, present and process grievances on the Company’s property without interruption of the Employer’s operation. Upon notification to his or her supervisor, a steward shall be afforded the right to leave his/her work area for a reasonable period of time to investigate, present and process grievances and to represent a fellow employee concerning grievances or discipline so long as such activity does not interrupt the Employer’s operations. This shall include the steward’s right to represent an employee in connection with any grievance concerning safety issues. The Employer will make a reasonable effort to insure that its operations are not interrupted by the steward's engaging in such activity. The Employer shall not use interruption of its operation as a subterfuge for denying such right to the steward.

The decision of the National Grievance Committee shall be final and binding. The National Grievance Committee shall determine whether a decision submitted to it raises an issue of interpretation of Master Agreement language.
In order for such cases to be reviewed, the decision must interpret Master language. A decision raising an issue of interpretation of Master Agreement language is one in which (1) Master Agreement language was interpreted by a lower panel (2) the interpretation sets a precedent for future grievances; and (3) a reasonable case can be made that the lower panel interpretation was contrary to the true meaning of the Master Agreement. If the National Grievance Committee deadlocks on whether a decision meets these criteria, arbitration may be requested pursuant to Article 8, Section 4.
Prior to such cases being placed on the Master docket, the moving party (either the Chair of the Teamsters National United Parcel Service Negotiating Committee or his designee or the designated Employer representative) shall confer with his counter part and discuss the matter.
Cases that are docketed will be presented in the following manner:
I.	The representatives of the moving party, as described above, present first.
2.	The presenter will cite the specific Master language that the lower panel interpreted.

Arbitration decisions under any Supplement, Rider or Addendum which interpret Master Agreement language may also be submitted to the National Grievance Committee provided the three above-referenced criteria are satisfied. If an arbitration decision is reviewed by the National Grievance Committee it shall be processed in accordance with this section except that the Committee will make a final and binding decision rather than refer the case back to the arbitrator. Article 8, Section 4 shall not apply if the National Grievance Committee deadlocks upon review of an arbitrator’s decision.
Section 4.
Where the National Grievance Committee fails to reach a majority decision as to any case submitted pursuant to this Article (excepting arbitrator decisions) either party shall have the right to refer the case to binding arbitration.

Prior to invoking the arbitration procedure the parties, by mutual agreement, may submit said case to the National Grievance Committee for resolution.

Section 6.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to apply the provisions of this Agreement and to render a decision on any grievance coming before him/her but shall not have the authority to amend or modify this Agreement or to establish new terms or conditions of employment.
Any grievance that does not raise an issue of interpretation of a Master Agreement Article or Section shall be resolved pursuant to the provisions relating to the local, state and area grievance procedures set forth in the applicable Supplements, Riders and Addenda.

ARTICLE 35
trailer and is on the qualified feeder driver list is also subject to DOT mandated testing as provided in this Agreement.
In addition to testing mandated employees, controlled substance testing will be part of pre-qualification conditions for feeder driver employment, and those persons transferring to a feeder driver position. Individuals who are on a “bid list” for tractor-trailer employment or other similar classification type jobs are subject to being tested for controlled substances before being accepted into such a position.
Employees covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement who are not subject to DOT mandated drug testing are only subject to reasonable cause testing as provided herein. The substances for which testing shall be conducted, and cut-off levels thereto, shall be consistent with those listed for the DOT-covered employees. This provision also applies to testing conducted pursuant to rehabilitation and after care programs.
Section 3.2	Testing
Because of the consequences that a positive test result has on an employee, UPS will employ a yery accurate, two-stage testing program. Urine samples will be analyzed by a highly qualified independent laboratory which is certified by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). All samples will be tested according to DOT drug testing requirements. Validity testing for the presence of adulterants shall be conducted on all specimens, per HHS requirements.
Section 3.3	Screening Test

Section 3.5	Laboratory Testing
All laboratories selected by UPS for analyzing Controlled Substances Testing will be HHS certified.
Section 3.6	Types of Testing Required
Testing procedures will be performed as part of pre-qualified practices, after defined DOT reportable accidents, on the basis of reasonable cause, upon return to duty after a positive test, under DOT mandated random testing and as follow-up testing for post drug rehabilitation as outlined under Article 16, Section 5.
Section 3.7	Pre-Qualification Testing
Controlled substance testing will be part of UPS’s regulated prequalification conditions for feeder driver positions.
Drivers will be advised in writing prior to the application process that pre-qualification testing will be conducted to determine the presence of controlled substances. Applicants will be required to acknowledge in writing an understanding of this request before they receive an application.
Section 3.8	Reasonable Cause Testing
Upon reasonable cause, UPS will require an employee to be tested for the use of controlled substances.
Reasonable cause is defined as an employee’s observable action, appearance, or conduct that clearly indicate the need for a fitness-for-duty medical evaluation.
The employee’s conduct must be witnessed by at least two (2)
-99-
ARTICLE 35
supervisors, if available. The witnesses must have received training in observing a person’s behavior to determine if a medical evaluation is required. When the supervisor(s) confronts an employee, a Union representative should be made available pursuant to Article 4 of the National Master UPS Agreement as interpreted. If no steward is present, the employee may select another hourly paid employee to represent him.
Documentation of the employee’s conduct shall be prepared and signed by the witnesses within twenty-four (24) hours of the observed behavior, or before the test results are released, whichever is earlier. In addition, a copy will be sent to the Local Union in a timely manner.
Note: (Reasonable Cause)
At the time the urine specimen is collected, the employee may opt to also give a blood sample. If the employee takes this option, the blood sample must confirm positive presence for the substance confirmed in the urine test. If no positive is confirmed in the blood specimen, the employee will be given a warning letter, offered an opportunity for rehabilitation as set forth in this Article, and the employee will be required to otherwise satisfy the requirements imposed by the DOT regulations. However, if there is a second occasion where reasonable cause testing results in a positive urine test, the employee will then be subject to discharge.
Non-DOT - Reasonable Cause:
In the event an employee (not covered by DOT) is tested pursuant to the discipline Article in the Supplemental Rider or Addenda to the National Master UPS Agreement, such test will be performed under the same procedures and requirements as those set forth in this Article. In the event the test result is positive, as set forth above, it shall be considered a dischargeable offense.
Section 3.9	Post-Accident Drug Testing
DOT mandated drivers will be required to submit to a drug test after a DOT defined serious accident, which is one in which:
- 100-
ARTICLE 35
1.	There is a fatality, or;
2.	A citation is issued and there is bodily injury to a person who, as a result of the injury, receives immediate medical treatment away from the scene of the accident, or;
3.	A citation is issued and one (1) or more motor vehicles incur disabling damage as a result of the accident requiring a vehicle to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle.
Non-DOT mandated drivers may be required to submit to drug testing if there is any reasonable suspicion of drug usage or reasonable cause to believe that a driver has been operating a vehicle while under the influence of drugs, or reasonable cause to believe the driver was at fault in the accident and drug usage may have been a factor.
Drivers are required to submit to such testing as soon as possible, but in all events within thirty-two (32) hours. Union representation will be made available pursuant to Article 4 of the National Master UPS Agreement, as interpreted.
It is not the intention of this language to prohibit the driver from leaving the scene of an accident for the period of time necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to receive necessary medical attention.
The result of a urine test for the use of controlled substances, conducted by federal, state, or local officials having independent authority for the test, shall be considered to meet the requirements of post-accident testing, provided such tests conform to applicable federal, state or local requirements, and that the results of the tests are obtained by the Employer.
Section 3.10 Random Testing
Random Employee Selection:
The procedure used to randomly select employees for drug testing, in compliance with the U.S. Department of Transportation
- 101 -
ARTICLE 35
Regulations, will be a computer program specifically intended for such an application.
The program will utilize an internal computer clock procedure to randomly generate lists of employees mandated for testing by the Department of Transportation/Federal Highway Administration. The computer shall randomly select the required number of employees from the total pool of affected employees. The total pool list shall be by each region.
For verification purposes and to cover absences the computer shall print the following lists for each testing period:
I.	An alphabetical total pool list of employees in the region, and
2.	A district list of employees shall be printed from the random list in the order in which they are computer selected.
An absent employee whose name appears on the primary list on the random test day must be tested upon return to work immediately upon notification provided he/she returns prior to the next selection period. The lists or true copies of the lists shall be maintained by a third party administrator. Upon request to the District Labor Relations Manager, the lists will be made available for review by Local Union representatives and company labor relations managers to verify the proper application and use of the lists in the random testing system.
The parties agree that no effort will be made to cause the system and method of selection to be anything but a true random selection procedure insuring that all affected employees are treated fairly and equally.
The parties further agree not to amend or change the current method of random selection as described herein without prior agreement between the parties.
Section 3.11	Notification
UPS employees, subject to Department of Transportation mandated random drug testing, will be notified of testing in person or by

direct phone contact. Notification shall be given by the management person responsible for such notification.
Section 3.12	Rehabilitation and Testing After Return To Duty/SAP and Employer Duties
A positive test specimen as a result of a DOT pre-qualification or random test will result in a rehabilitation opportunity. An employee whose test results are reported to the Medical Review Officer by the HHS certified laboratory and who has been contacted by the Medical Review Officer or his/her designee has seventy two (72) hours to contact the Medical Review Officer to review the test results. If the review time schedule is not met, then the Medical Review Officer (MRO) may report to UPS Management that the test is verified as positive. If neither UPS nor the MRO, after making all reasonable efforts, as required by the DOT regulations, is able to contact the employee within ten (10) days from receiving the laboratory results, the test will be considered an uncontested positive test result. If the Medical Review Officer determines a specimen is positive, then the employee will have five (5) calendar days to evaluate his/her situation with an approved Substance Abuse Professional and then up to fifteen (15) calendar days to enter the rehabilitation treatment center after approval of a leave of absence as outlined in Article 16, Section 5 of the National Master UPS Agreement. UPS will follow the final recommendations of the Substance Abuse Professional as to the appropriate after-care protocol and post rehabilitation unannounced drug testing.
The employee will be permitted to return to work after the SAP has determined that the employee has successfully complied with prescribed education and/or treatment and the employee has provided a negative drug test result conducted under direct observation, as per cutoff levels contained in Section 3.3 or Section 3.4 of this Article, as applicable, and/or an alcohol test with an alcohol concentration less than 0.02. The Employer will make all reasonable efforts to conduct all retum-to-work testing, conference calls, and examinations within five (5) working days of completion of a rehabilitation program.
It is understood that if the grievance procedure is utilized contractual time limits on disciplinary action and the employee’s request
- 103 -

ARTICLE 35
Photo identification issued by the Employer or a federal, state or ■ local government;
If the employee arrives without the above-listed item, the collection agent should contact the district Safety and Health manager or district Human Resources manager.
A standard DOT approved urine custody and control form will be supplied by the appropriate laboratory. This form must be used by all collection facilities and signed by the employee and the collection agent in the appropriate areas.
Section 3.15	Specimen Collection Procedures
The Employer agrees to continue use of the Specimen Collection Checklist. The checklist, approved by the National UPS/IBT Safety and Health Committee, is to be used with the affected employees at the collection site by the person performing the collection services for the Employer.
The checklist is to be used at all locations, but it is understood that failure to use or the refusal to use the checklist does not invalidate a properly conducted controlled substance testing procedure. Nor does it prohibit an employee’s recourse to the collective bargaining agreement and/or the grievance procedure.
All procedures for urine collection will follow Department of Transportation guidelines to ensure an individual’s privacy. Ah employee who gives reason to believe that he or she may have adulterated or substituted a sample will be required to provide a specimen under direct observation by a same gender collection agent. If it is determined that an employee has adulterated or substituted a sample it shall result in the termination of his/her employment.
No unauthorized personnel will be allowed in any area of the collection site. Only one (I) controlled substances testing collection procedure will be conducted at a time and the specimens can only be handled by the collection site person.
The employee being tested should remove any outer garments, such
- 107-

The Employer agrees to recognize all employees’ rights to privacy while being subjected to the collection process at all times and al all collection sites. Further, the Employer agrees that in all circumstances the employee’s dignity will be considered and all necessary steps will be taken to insure that the entire process does nothing to demean, embarrass or offend the employee unnecessarily. Authorization for collection under direct observation will be in accordance with Department of Transportation regulations. All procedures shall be conducted in a professional, discreet and objective manner. Refusal to provide a specimen under direct observation when requested shall be considered a refusal to test and a terminable offense.
The employee shall be instructed to provide at least forty-five (45) milliliters of urine in the collection container. The employee shall hand the specimen to the collection agent. The specimen shall remain in the sight of both the collection agent and the employee at all times. A minimum of thirty (30) milliliters of urine shall be placed in the primary specimen container by the collection agent. The collection agent then must pour at least fifteen (15) milliliters of urine from the collection container into the second specimen bottle to be used for the split specimen.

If the individual is still unable to provide forty-five (45) milliliters of urine, he/she will be taken out of service and a medical evaluation will be conducted within five (5) business days by a licensed physician who has the expertise in this type of medical issue, and is approved by the Employer to determine if there is a medical reason for the inability to provide a specimen. If it is not determined that there is a medical reason, the individual will be treated as having refused to take the test. If the employee fails for any reason to provide forty-five (45) milliliters of urine, the collection agent should contact a third party administrator (TPA) and either the District Safety and Health Manager or another Employer designee.
The regulations specify the privacy procedures and the reasons to believe that a specimen has been adulterated which includes, but is not limited to, conduct clearly and unequivocally indicating an attempt to substitute or adulterate the sample, e.g., abnormal urine color or urine temperature outside the acceptable range. All specimens suspected of being adulterated shall be packaged and forwarded to the laboratory for testing.
In the event of suspected specimen adulteration, a second (2ntb specimen will be immediately collected under direct observation and the entire procedure should be repeated including initiation of a new custody and control form and separate packaging for shipping: If an employee refuses to provide a second (2ncb specimen, it shall be noted as a refusal to test and shall be a terminable offense.
The collection agent shall document any unusual behavior or appearance on the urine custody-and-control form.
Specimen handling (from one (1) authorized individual or place to another) will always be conducted using chain-of-custody procedures. Every effort must be made to minimize the number of people handling specimens. Both specimen containers shall be sealed and then forwarded to an approved laboratory for testing.

When a test kit is received by a laboratory, the thirty (30) milliliter sealed urine specimen container shall be removed immediately for testing. The shipping container with the remaining sealed container shall be immediately placed in secure refrigerated storage.
If an employee is told that the first (Ist) sample tested positive, the employee may, within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt of actual notice, request that the second urine specimen be forwarded by the first (Ist) laboratory to another independent and unrelated HHS approved laboratory of the parties' choice for GC/MS confirmatory testing of the presence of the drug. If an employee chooses to have the second (2nd) sample analyzed, he/she shall at that time execute a special checkoff authorization form to insure payment by the employee. If the second (2n<^) test is positive, and the employee wishes to use the rehabilitation option, the employee shall reimburse the Employer for the costs of the second (2nd) confirmation test and handling and shipping charges before entering the rehabilitation program. For those employees who choose to have the second (2nd) specimen tested, disciplinary action can only take place after the MRO verifies the first test as positive and the second laboratory confirms the presence of the drug. However, the employee must be taken out of service once the first (Ist) test result is verified as positive by the MRO while the second test is being performed. If the second (2nd) laboratory report is negative, the employee will not be charged for the cost of the second (2nd) test and will be reimbursed for all lost time. It is also understood that if an employee opts for the second (2nd) specimen to be tested, contractual time limits on disciplinary action in the Supplements are waived.

Drivers who choose to opt-in on the 9.5 list shall have the right to file a grievance if the Employer has continually worked a driver more than nine and one half (9.5) hours per day for any three (3) days in a workweek. The Company will not assign excessive overtime on the two (2) remaining days within the workweek in order to retaliate against a driver for opting onto the 9.5 List.
If a driver is paid a penalty under this subsection more than three (3) times in a single five (5) month opt-in period, then the District labor Manager and Business Agent will meet with the Center Manager, the steward and the driver to ensure future compliance under this subsection. If any further penalty is paid on this employee during the five (5) month period, a meeting shall be scheduled with the above parties and the Co-Chairs of the applicable Supplemental panel to determine what actions are necessary to ensure compliance.

In the event the position of the Union is sustained. the arbitrator shall have the authority to impose any remedy set forth in this Section.
If there is a deadlocked grievance by the “9.5 committee” the Co-Chairs of the National Negotiating Committee may require a review of the adequacy of the Company’s staffing in the center in which the grievance was filed.
