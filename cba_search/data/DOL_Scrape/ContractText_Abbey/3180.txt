ARTICLE 14	- OVERTIME	'
14.1	All time for which an employee has worked or utilized accrued vacation time will be used in the calculation of overtime.
14.2	Overtime for employees working a regular workweek is time worked in excess of eight (8) hours per day, or forty (40) hours per week within the employees' basic workweek of seven (7) consecutive twenty-four (24) hour periods. Overtime for employees working an irregular work schedule is time worked in excess of the scheduled hours per day approved by the Director of Human Resources or forty (40) hours within the employee's basic work week; or eight (8) hours in a day and eighty (80) hours in an established time of fourteen (14) consecutive twenty-four (24) hour periods. Time worked beyond regular schedules by employees scheduled for less than eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week is additional straight time worked rather than overtime until work exceeds eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week within the employees' basic workweek.
Except for irregular work schedules, employees eligible for overtime compensation who are required to work consecutive hours in excess of eight (8) consecutive hours within a twenty-four (24) hour period shall be compensated at the appropriate rate for hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours per day.
14.3	All eligible employees shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half (1-1/2) their regular hourly rate of pay for overtime. No application of this Article shall be construed or interpreted to provide for compensation for overtime at a rate exceeding time and one-half (1-1/2), or to effect a “pyramiding” of overtime, i.e., time and one-half (1-1/2), of time and time and one-half (2-1/2).
14.4	Employees who work over sixteen (16) consecutive hours shall be paid two (2) times their regular hourly straight time rate of pay for each consecutive hour or fraction of in excess of sixteen (16) hours.
14.5	All classifications within the bargaining unit which are currently eligible for overtime shall continue to be eligible for overtime compensation.
14.6	Mandatory Overtime. The Employer has developed staffing procedures and guidelines which minimize the need for nursing personnel to work overtime shifts on a mandatory basis. Should it ever become necessary for an employee to work a mandatory overtime shift, the Employer agrees to equitably distribute such work according to its procedures and to compensate the employee at two times (2X’s) the employee’s regular hourly rate of pay for all such hours worked. This provision equally applies to employees volunteering for identified mandatory overtime shifts. Individual bargaining for the purpose of securing payment of double time in a nonmandatory overtime situation is prohibited.

The first four (4) or eight (8) hours of a twelve (12) hour shift may be curtailed by mutual agreement. Curtailed FTE hours will count toward the cancellation tally per Section 15.3. This obligation to pay will not apply when interruptions of work are caused by an Act of God. Nothing herein contained is intended to deny the Employer the right to require the employee to work during the period for which she/he is being paid.
b.	An employee's shift may be curtailed with a minimum of one (1) hour notice, when workload changes occur after a shift has begun and will be compensated a minimum of four (4) hours per Section (a) above. However, if an employee is curtailed during the last hour of the shift, they remain eligible for Double Back per Article 74. The Employer will not adjust the regular start time(s) of a shift(s) to avoid Double Back eligibility as outlined in Article 74. Employees shall not be curtailed more than once during any given shift.
15.2	Shift Cancellation is defined as a temporary interruption of employment because of lack of work. An employee shall be given notice of cancellation two (2) hours prior to the beginning of the scheduled shift from which he/she is being canceled. The Employer may place the Adult Critical Care employee on-call consistent with the provisions of Article 24.2. The non-Adult Critical Care employee may choose to be on-call at the Employer’s request, or remain at home using accrued leave or leave without pay at the employee's discretion.
If a department anticipates a lack of work on or adjacent to a holiday, it shall make a reasonable effort to so notify employees. When there is a general closing of a department for a day, on or adjacent to a holiday, the Employer will not be expected to grant the right to work to any employee in that department on that day. However, when work is available, an employee may make up the time, upon approval of the

The Employer shall make reasonable effort to release pre-scheduled Resource Nurses from their work obligation greater than two (2) hours before the shift, if it appears no work will be available.
72.8	Resource Nurse positions will be posted according to the specific scheduling needs of the unit. Preference among interested and qualified applicants for Resource Nurse positions will be awarded on the basis of their length of service on the unit.
72.9	Should a Resource Nurse fail to meet the minimum shifts obligation as identified in 72.1 above in any fiscal year, the nurse will be deemed to have voluntarily resigned and will be removed from the Employer's resource roster. The minimum shift obligation shall be prorated during that fiscal year for new hires, or FTE nurses

76.3	Nurses shall be selected to fill Critical Need shifts in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 - Work Schedules related to the order of assignment of work and the utilization of the most cost effective staffing option(s) available, immediately following Resource Nurses working an additional shift (13.2 h).
76.4	The incentive will not apply to stand-by shifts, or to shifts of less than seven and one half hours duration, with the exception of nurses regularly scheduled for twelve (12) hour shifts which would be permitted access to this incentive for shifts involving four (4) additional hours. Critical Need Incentive shifts will be subject to cancellation in accordance with Article 15 - Shift Curtailment and Cancellation immediately following Overtime and/or Double Back shifts. If a shift is curtailed, all hours worked will be paid the Critical Need Incentive. Cancellation of nurses from a Critical Need Incentive Shift shall occur in reverse order of their commitment to work such shift.
76.5	The incentive will be available to FTE, Float Pool, Interim, and Temporary nurses.
76.6	The Critical Need Incentive will be applied to all shifts scheduled after posting deadlines which are required to bring staffing to baseline for all Prime Time periods as identified in Article 56. Further, the Critical Need Incentive also will be applied to any shift where staffing is twenty percent (20%) below baseline staffing adjusted for census and acuity two (2) hours prior to the beginning of the shift as determined by the Department Director or designee.
ARTICLE 77 - JOB SHARE
Employees will be allowed to job share 1.0 FTE positions if it will not incur extra cost to the Employer. Job Share opportunities may be initiated by Managers or staff nurses.
a.	Two employees wishing to job share must notify their immediate supervisor in writing outlining the FTE to be shared, which portion each person will fill, and an explanation of how the shared position will not result in additional cost to the Employer. The supervisor will have the right to approve or deny such request, however, a written explanation of any denial will be provided to the employees and the Association. An approved job share arrangement shall be required to fulfill only the original position’s weekend obligation.
b.	If the job share arrangement is approved, it will be posted on the unit to allow ONA/OHSU Contract 2001-2004	67
1	any nurse on the unit to bid upon one of the portions. The most senior nurse(s)
2	applying for the job share positions will be awarded the position(s).
3
4	c. The newly created job share positions will become effective at the next
5	regularly posted scheduling period.
6
7	d. If a job share participant resigns or transfers from the job share position, the
8	remaining position portion will be posted on the unit. If no one bids upon the
9	remaining portion, the remaining nurse must return to the 1.0 FTE.

LETTERS OF AGREEMENT
Salary Placement for Reclassified RN2s
The formerly titled Assistant Head Nurses “red circled” will be placed on the new salary schedule. Placement will occur by matching their current hourly rate onto the RN1 salary schedule by matching their hourly rate to the closest, but no less than hourly rate. ‘
If the “red circled” hourly rate continues to surpass the RN1 salary schedule, they will continue to receive their current hourly rate and service increases, if merited, until the salary range meets or exceeds their hourly rate. At such time, the individual’s hourly rate will reflect placement on the salary schedule which is equal to, or greater than, their current hourly rate.
Salary Overpayment
Upon notice of an overpayment as the result of an administrative error, the nurse must submit a repayment plan to the OHSU Payroll Office. Should the payment plan be unacceptable, an agreement will be reached by a board consisting of the following members:
Two (2) Hospital/Clinic Management Representatives
Two (2) AURN Representatives appointed by the Executive Committee of the AURN Associate Vice President for Administration
The parties agree that the decision of the board shall be final and binding and that the nurse will abide thereby.
