Section 4.	No employee shall be summarily discharged. The Union can institute formal grievance action at any point in the following procedure:
In all cases in which the Company concludes that an employee’s conduct may justify discharge, the employee shall be suspended initially for up to three (3) of the • employee’s scheduled working days. The Local Union representative designated by the Local Union President shall be notified in writing prior to such suspension and such written notification will detail the reason(s) for the suspension, unless the alleged offense justifies immediate action.
During the suspension period, if requested, the Company will meet with the Union and review the facts of the case. At this time the Company and the Local Union
may agree to the period of time necessary to give the employee an opportunity to explain his position, and the Union and the Company an opportunity to conduct a full investigation of the matter to make sure there is no hasty decision based on inadequate facts.

At the end of the suspension period, the Company shall, within twenty-four (24) hours, excluding weekends and holidays, notify the Local Union and the suspended employee, in writing, of its final decision and action and the Grievance Procedure can be initiated immediately at the second (2nd) step of the grievance procedure.

The Local Union will maintain a Shop Steward available to each shift and the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the members of the Business Committee and the Shop Stewards will be available to the Company on a current basis. The Company may delay the start of disciplinary suspension, if the first day of such suspension is Sunday, and/or interrupt the consecutive days of disciplinary suspension in cases where one and one-half (1 1/2) days calculation will create a part shift scheduling problem when the employee returns from suspension.
Section 6.	Circumstances which could have a mitigating effect on discipline will be considered in assessing discipline.

voluntary layoff. However, if the employee was in the classification because of a previous reduction, and an opening occurs in his original classification, he will return to the original classification.

Section 4.	An employee who bids successfully for a job which has the same or a higher qualified rate but a lower starting rate than his hourly wage rate for the job on which he is currently working shall retain his present hourly wage rate when transferred to his new job until such time as the wage progression for the job exceeds his present rate of pay. At such time and subsequently, the employee’s hourly wage rate will be increased in accordance with the steps of the Company’s wage progression program for such new job.
Section 5.	Steady Days and Frozen Shifts and all jobs other than entry level jobs will be posted as they occur.
In the event an employee who is awarded a steady day shift or frozen shift is removed from such shift, as a result of a reduction of the work force or any other reason other than voluntary removal, such an employee will retain recall right to such a shift for a period of five (5) years from the last day the employee worked on such shift.
A permanent posting for entry level jobs, and jobs of similar kind as hereafter may be established by the Company, if other than steady days or frozen shifts, will be posted in each plant.
All job requests for entry level jobs, desirable hours of work and/or desirable working conditions will be kept in the Personnel Office, in book form, and all requests will be signed and dated. At the time an opening occurs, the personnel department will review the request book and will fill the jobs in accordance with plant seniority. If there are no requests to fill openings and the jobs cannot be filled through this procedure, the Company may fill them by hiring from outside sources.
An employee may indicate his desire for such jobs by filing a dated application in the Personnel Department.
Section 6.	Lateral or downward movement will be permitted only one time during the life of this Contract by an employee, except that there shall be no limitation on lateral or downward movement for health reasons, job advancement or in the event of job reduction or elimination. (Job advancement means the potential of greater earning power on the job that the employee is bidding on). A job posting awarded, but not accepted will not count as a move under this Section, provided the affected employee has not abused this privilege.
Section 7.	Jobs shall be posted for a period of five (5) days. The successful bidder will be placed on the job within five (5) days following the end of the posting period or paid the rate of the new job, if higher, provided other bid jobs are not involved.

the new rate, if higher, within fifteen (15) days. During this time period the Company may use a temporary replacement to fill the vacancy. Job posting will include job description, shift job to be assigned to and the rate of pay.
All jobs shall be posted as steady days, fixed shifts, rotating shifts or frozen shifts as they occur, and shall not be changed except as provided for in this Contract.
Section 8.	When an employee is awarded a job through the job posting procedure, he will have up to thirty (30) days in which he may elect to return to his previous position. If he so elects, all other employees affected by the original job posting will be returned to their prior jobs.
When an employee is awarded a job through the job posting procedure and that job is subsequently eliminated by the Company, he may elect to return to his previous position. If he so elects, all other employees affected by the original job posting will be returned to their prior jobs.

Therefore, it is understood that when it becomes necessary to change an employee’s shift in order to accomplish scheduled work, the Company will solicit volunteers to change shifts. If volunteers are not available, the least senior employee in the job classification will be transferred. Upon completion of the scheduled work, the transferred employee(s) will be returned to their original shift and location.
The parties agree that those employees who are currently working Monday through Friday day shift will not be taken off that shift unless through layoff or mutual agreement to work another shift temporarily.

Wage incentive plans for forming machines define performance levels at which incentive earnings will be paid and the amount of such payment.
The effective application of skill and effort above normal by the Journeymen Machine Operators and Machine Upkeepmen in the performance of their duties is necessary in order to attain a satisfactory performance level, and it is for this reason that incentive can be paid to them on the output of the machine.
On the basis of the foregoing, the Company will maintain a sound wage incentive plan for Journeymen Machine Operators, Machine Upkeepmen and the other classifications currently covered by the Plan as listed in Article 42, Sections 2 and 3. The levels of performance and corresponding bonus payment will be as defined in the Company’s wage incentive plan, the attainment of which should be accomplished by sound operating methods and techniques.
The Company agrees that each employee covered by the present Forming Incentive Plan shall receive his or her individual bonus earnings, line average or twenty percent (20%) for all hours worked, whichever is greater.
It is agreed that, with the exception of temporary standards, the Company will audit bonus standards no more than once per calendar year, and no sooner than one year from the date of last audit. Temporary standards, which will be included in the annual standards will also be audited once after the initial production runs, (temporary runs will be limited to three (3), Whenever a speed is increased, as a result of an audit, the bonus gross per hour will only be increased by half of the effect of that speed increase. Such increase will be limited to five percent (5%). Whenever a speed is decreased, as a result of an audit, the full effect of that speed decrease will be given back. The full effect of a bonus percent pack change will be reflected in the revised standard.
All Plants will participate in the Forming Incentive Plan using a twenty-four (24) hour basis of participation in the following manner:
OCCUPATION Forming Operator Relief Operator Upkeep	WINDOW OF APPLICATION Twenty-four (24) hr. shop/line average Twenty-four (24) hr. line average Twenty-four (24) hr. average shop(s)/line average
Job Change Crew Fixed Day Crew Machine Repair	Twenty-four (24) hr. line average Twenty-four (24) hr. line average Twenty-four (24) hr. line average
Machine Repair Days Twenty-four (24) hr. line average
Each plant will continue its past practice of compensating the Upkeep classification from the shops assigned and/or from the 24 Hour Line Average.
Section 2.	The Company shall periodically, or as established by its plan, or at the request of the Local Union, review and when necessary, revise its incentive plan and incentive and bonus rates. All parties to this Contract must agree to changes to the Forming Bonus Plan.
Section 3.	Any incentive systems and any future revisions thereof, shall be in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Article.

Section 4.	If the Company discontinues an incentive system, it shall negotiate with the International Union the buy-out method that shall be used for discontinuing the system. If the Company and the International are unable to agree upon the amount or method of buy-out this matter shall be submitted to arbitration upon the request of either party. Any such buy-out shall be considered to be money in lieu of bonus.
Section 5.	All employees covered by the plan will receive no less than twenty percent (20%) bonus for all hours worked. This will include the Machine Repair Department.

ARTICLE 50	AMD Drug and Alcohol Testing Agreement
The Union and the Company have a strong commitment to provide a safe and secure workplace for all employees and to promote high standards of employee health and productivity. Because of this commitment, both the Union and the Company agree to this program of screening for use and/or abuse of alcohol or chemical substances in the workplace.
It is the purpose of this contractual provision to provide the procedure, which will be used for all testing for substance use/abuse by employees.
Section 1.	The following provisions apply to employees, suspected by the Company, of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol while at work or on company property.
Section 2.	If an employee appears, by virtue of his/her unusual conduct, to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the supervisor will secure a Shop Steward, Business Committeeperson, or other union official, on the shift, to observe the employee’s actions/conduct and to represent the employee. If there is reasonable cause to believe that the employee is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the supervisor and
the union representative will escort the employee to one of the plant offices for further investigation. The union representative shall be present during the investigation. If there is no union representative on the shift, then an elected union official will be secured for the purposes set forth in this Section.
Section 3.	If, as a result of the investigation, the supervisor has reasonable cause to believe that the employee, due to the use/abuse of alcohol or chemical substances, is in a condition that is jeopardizing workplace safety or cannot perform his or her job because of on-the-job intoxication or impairment, the Plant Manager or Human Resource Manager or their designated representative will be secured. If the Plant Manager or Human Resource Manager or their designated representative, after meeting with the employee and the union representative, has reasonable cause to believe the employee is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the employee will be required to submit to a screen for alcohol and/or drugs. In such case, both the employee and the union representative will be transported to the testing facility by the supervisor, Plant Manager, or Human Resource Manager or their designated representative.
If, in the above described situation, the Plant Manager or Human Resource Manager or their designated representative cannot be secured and there is reasonable cause to believe the employee is in a condition that is jeopardizing workplace safety or cannot perform his or her job because of on-the-job intoxication or impairment, the supervisor may send the employee home. In such case, the supervisor will make the necessary arrangements for the employee to be taken home.
The term “designated representative” as used in this Article is defined as individuals who have overall responsibility for the plant which precludes designating shift supervisors.
Section 4.	The initial urine screen for suspected drug use will be an enzyme multiplied immunoassay test (EMIT) using the NIDA (DOT) Panel 5 for drug identification. The confirmatory test will be a Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) test. A confirmatory test will automatically be performed on any sample that is initially positive.
Section 5.	The appropriate test for suspected alcohol use will be a Breathalyzer test. In order to verify the positive results of the initial Breathalyzer test, a second Breathalyzer test will be given fifteen minutes following the first test or, at the employee’s request, a Blood Sample Confirmatory test will be performed. These tests will be performed at the Company’s expense.
Section 6.	Split samples will be taken for all tests referenced in Sections 4 and 5. The samples will be retained by the testing laboratory after being sealed and properly identified across the sealing material by the laboratory representative and initialed by the employee at the time of the taking of the samples. If requested, the sample will be split (and signed across the sealing material as set forth in the preceding sentence) and sent to a certified NEDA Laboratory, designated by the employee, which meets the criteria
providing for an appropriate chain of custody program, utilizes quality control methods, and who can assure confidentiality and accuracy of the results. The Company laboratory will meet the same criteria as outlined above. The laboratory selected by the Company will transmit the sample directly to the laboratory selected by the employee to protect the chain of custody. If requested, the employee will be supplied a listing of National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) certified labs.
The employee will be reimbursed by the Company for the cost of any screen performed at his direction if the screening results are negative. The employee will sign a consent agreement authorizing the release of the results of the screen to the Company.
If the result of any test and/or screen of an employee is negative, the employee will be paid for all time lost as a result of the testing procedure, including time lost from work while awaiting the results of the test/screen.
Section 7.	Any employee who is asked to submit to a screen for alcohol or drug abuse will sign a chain of custody release form (consent agreement) in accordance with NIDA guidelines.
The NIDA-certified laboratory performing the testing will provide test results to the Medical Review Officer (MRO). For negative results, the MRO will certify to the Company that the test was passed. For reported positive results, prior to making a final decision to certify that the test was failed, the MRO will give the employee an opportunity to discuss the test result.
Employees who have taken prescription drugs or have undergone medical or dental procedures should be prepared to produce evidence of a valid prescription or other medical information for review by the MRO in the event that positive result is received from the laboratory.
The MRO will review all medical records made available by the tested employee to determine if a confirmed positive test could have resulted from legally prescribed medication or a medical or dental procedure: if so, the test result would be reported as passed. If a medical explanation for a positive result is not found the MRO will certify that the test was positive and will notify the Company.
The Medical Review Officer (MRO) referred to in this Article must be a licensed medical physician.
Section 8.	Refusal to submit or sign a consent agreement will be considered insubordination and the employee will be subject to the appropriate discipline.
Section 9.	The Company will select a properly licensed and accredited testing facility certified by NIDA and follow testing procedures specified above to assure the most accurate results, maintain the chain of custody and quality control procedures, and assure maximum confidentiality.
Section 10.	All screening and the results of any screen will be treated in a confidential manner and will be accomplished in a manner compatible with the employee’s dignity. All employees who are tested will be given the results, from the testing laboratory, of their test in writing.
Section 11.	Any employee found to be under the influence of alcohol in accordance with five (5) above, or who has evidence of illegal/illicit chemical substances or controlled substances in his system which would indicate abuse, will be offered the opportunity for rehabilitation. The appropriate medical authorities will determine the type of rehabilitation program. The Union and the Company will cooperate in establishing a list of appropriate medical authorities.
In those locations, which presently have an EAP, the EAP will be used instead of the above-mentioned medical authority.
Section 12.	An employee may be suspended subject to termination if any one of the following occurs:
(a)	The employee refuses the initial offer for rehabilitation.
(b)	If for reasonable cause, the employee is found to be under the influence of alcohol in accordance with five (5) above or has the presence of illegal/illicit chemical substances, or controlled substances in his system, in accordance with six (6) above, the second time.
(c)	The employee fails to comply with the requirement of the rehabilitation program.
Section 13.	If an employee comes forward and admits that he has had a relapse, after having been rehabilitated, a clinical evaluation will be made to determine the medical facts. The EAP, or the appropriate medical authorities as set forth in this Article, will evaluate factors contributing to the relapse and then be responsible for developing the second treatment.
Section 14.	Any dispute with respect to this Drug and Alcohol Program Agreement shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in this Contract.
ARTICLE 51
Personal Premiums
Section 1.	Machine, product, or other equipment premiums which are in excess of the job rates of employees covered by this Contract shall become “personal” premiums and apply only to employees who were regularly receiving such personal premiums.

No joumeyman/apprentices will be displaced or on lay off during any time that outside contractors are performing work at the Company’s facility. When bargaining unit personnel are not trained in the skills needed to perform the work which would be subcontracted, then in such cases employees would be recalled from layoff on a one-for-one basis. In all other cases, there would be no one displaced or remaining on layoff prior to said subcontracting.
Section 4.	When subcontractors are performing work normally performed by bargaining unit employees, those employees in the respective department(s) will be entitled to at least an equal amount of overtime hours of the work performed by the subcontractors.

No joumeyman/apprentices will be displaced or on layoff during any time that outside contractors are performing work at the Company’s facility. When bargaining unit personnel are not trained in the skills needed to perform the work which would be subcontracted, then in such cases employees would be recalled from layoff on a one-for-one basis. In all other cases, there would be no one displaced or remaining on layoff prior to said subcontracting.
Contracting Out For Non-Maintenance Work
Prior to the Company employing or contracting out any work normally and customarily performed by employees from departments other than the Maintenance Department, the Company shall meet with the Local Union and provide it with a written explanation for its desire to contract the work out.

Travel Policy
I.	INTRODUCTION
SCOPE
This policy is applicable to all employees who incur travel, entertainment or other reimbursable expenses on behalf of the Company.
A. PURPOSE
Good business practices, as well as current laws, require that employees traveling on Company business account for expenses incurred.
This policy has been adopted in order to achieve reasonable, consistent and fair treatment of employees in the handling of travel and related business expenses. It is designed to assist employees in keeping the increasing cost of such expenses within reasonable limits. It also is intended to conform with Company accounting practices and requirements for substantiation of travel, entertainment and other reimbursable expenses to Federal Income Tax Regulations.
B. ADMINISTRATION
Responsibility and authority to implement and enforce this Policy is placed with each manager who has employees who incur reimbursable expenses. This responsibility includes effective communication of the Policy and any necessary related procedures to all personnel affected. The responsibility for interpretation of the provisions of the Policy will reside with the Vice President - Administration. Approval to deviate from the Policy can be given only by an appropriate vice president or officer. The immediate manager will be responsible for authorizing “prior approval” where necessary.
II.	GENERAL
A. It is imperative that the Company maintain strong controls over these expenditures in order to control rising costs.
When formulating plans for a trip, please consider the following:
1	.) Is the trip really necessary?
2	.) Are the number of individuals traveling necessary?
3	.)	Will the benefits justify the expense?
4	.) Does the monthly/annual budget support the expense?
5	.) Have I considered all cost saving options?
Because of the climbing cost of travel and entertainment, if the answer to any one of the preceding four questions is “no,” serious consideration should be given to less expensive alternatives. All employees and supervisors share a joint responsibility for the use of good business judgment in transacting the Company’s business.
B. It is the Company’s policy to reimburse employees for reasonable expenses which they may incur in the conduct of Company business. Such expenses include reasonable costs of travel, meals, lodging, telephone and similar expenses. Also included are entertainment expenses in connection with Company business.
It is recognized that the nature and amount of expense will vary with the objective of the employees’ assignments and circumstances surrounding individual trips. Expenses incurred should be on a conservative basis. Effective control of expenses is a vitally important part of our business and very often determines the difference between profit and loss. This is a primary responsibility of everyone.
III.	TRANSPORTATION GENERAL
A.	The method of travel should be selected in the best interest of the Company, cost and time considered.
B.	Employees should be mindful of costs and practice economy such as the utilization of round-trip tickets, “super saver” type airfares, special corporate discounts and corporate or convention rates at hotels and motels.
C.	Travel reservations for airline tickets, rental cars and lodging will be made through the Corporate Travel Department or, when made during non-business hours, Travel Incorporated’s toll free number. This is required in order for the Company to receive full advantage of any negotiated rates, fares and commissions.
IV.	AIR TRAVEL
A.	AIRLINE TICKETS
Paper tickets and Electronic tickets (etickets) are defined as tickets and should be handled in an identical manner regarding returns, cancellations, etc.
B.	PROCEDURES
All commercial airline reservations will be made by the Corporate Travel Department. They have been instructed to obtain the lowest cost flight available according to your travel requirements. The hours of operation are 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) Monday through Friday. Arrangements can be made either by phone or by mailing or faxing a Travel Reservation Form to the Travel Department. For enroute changes and cancellations, please call the Travel Department or call Travel Incorporated at 1-888-874-8390. When calling Travel Incorporated at the 800 number, always identify yourself as an Anchor Glass employee and advise if you need assistance in a new reservation, an existing reservation or a cancellation.
All air travel should be charged through the Travel Department. If an employee uses his corporate American Express Card, the charges will appear on his individual American Express invoice. They will not be centrally billed unless the reservation is made in the Travel Department. FOR ALL CENTRALLY BILLED AIRLINE CHARGES, AN ADVICE OF TRAVEL FORM MUST BE COMPLETED WITHIN 48 HOURS OF THE EMPLOYEE’S RETURN, SIGNED BY THE EMPLOYEE’S SUPERVISOR, AND GIVEN TO THE APPROPRIATE DEPARTMENT SECRETARY RESPONSIBLE FOR RECONCILING THE AIRLINE CENTRAL BILL.
All air travel will be made at the lowest applicable fare. The travel reservationists will search for alternate schedules that will result in a savings to Anchor Glass.
Any exceptions must be authorized by a vice president or manager for employees under their supervision when in their judgment the circumstances warrant such action. A standard report will be issued comparing the lowest cost fare to the actual cost of the fare incurred. This report will be reviewed on a regular basis by management.
AT NO TIME SHOULD PERSONAL PREFERENCES SUCH AS AIRLINE PREFERENCES OR FREQUENT FLYER MEMBERSHIPS INTERFERE WITH COST SAVING OPTIONS!
C.	ADVANCE PURCHASES
Advance purchase of airline tickets usually results in a fare savings, and all employees are expected to utilize this option whenever possible.
D.	PENALTY FARES
The use of Penalty or Super-Saver fares is a very effective cost reduction tool which should be used whenever possible. Since these tickets are usually either fully or partially non-refundable, when making your travel arrangements, be sure to ask your reservationist about all the rules, regulations and options available to you if your travel plans shed change.
E.	WAITLISTING
If the lowest fare is not available at the time of booking; the travel reservationist will place the traveler on a waitlist for later confirmation. This information will appear on the itinerary and should also be monitored for clearance. It is imperative that you check for your waitlist clearance upon check-in, as this is the most common time for confirmation. Should this occur, always obtain a refund application copy for credit follow-up.
F.	UNUSED AIRLINE TICKETS
Unused tickets or partial tickets should be considered the same as cash and returned to the Travel Department as soon as possible. It is to the benefit of Anchor Glass to return all tickets within the same week they were issued whenever possible. Employee
must still complete an Advice of Travel Form stating that the ticket was returned for credit
G.	TICKETS OBTAINED USING EMPLOYEE FREQUENT FLYER POINTS
Employees have the option of using their personal frequent flyer points to obtain an airline ticket for business travel. If this option is taken, the employee will be reimbursed for half the resulting savings to the Company. The amount reimbursed will be used on one-half of what the airline ticket would have cost Anchor Glass had the lowest fare available in the market been obtained. Any dispute over the low cost fare must be directed to and resolved by the Director in charge of the Travel Department before the reservation is made.
In order to obtain this 50% reimbursement (maximum of $500.00), the employee must complete a Check Request Form, have it approved by his/her supervisor and the Travel Department, and forward to Corporate Distribution for the approval of the Director responsible for the Travel Department. The voucher copy of the ticket, the itinerary, and the Travel Department’s quote for the lowest cost fare should be attached to the check request. (See attached Exhibit “E”).
H.	PERSONAL & BUSINESS TRAVEL MIX
The extension of a business trip to include personal trips is permissible providing;
1	.) Prior authorization is obtained from immediate supervisor.
2	.) No additional cost to Anchor Glass.
3	.) Travel reservationist is advised at time of booking.
The employee must reimburse the Company for the difference between the cost of the whole trip (business and personal) and just the business portion of the trip.
V.	PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
A. This should be used whenever possible and economical in lieu of a rental car. Airport/hotel limousines, buses or taxicabs are often far more economical. These options should be considered to eliminate or decrease the number of car rental days.
