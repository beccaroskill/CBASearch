Section 5.1	- Seniority Defined
Except as otherwise provided in Sections 5.2, 5.6 and 6.8 of this Agreement, seniority is defined as date of hire within a coded classification with the classified service of the County. For the purpose of computing total time in the worker’s classification, the worker will be given credit for all time in any classification, at the same or higher salary level, in which permanent status had formerly been held. Original continuous unclassified service shall be counted if permanent status was subsequently attained in a classified classification. Date of hire shall be adjusted for all time on leave without pay which extends beyond one full pay period, but shall not be adjusted for all time on maternity leave, worker's compensation leave and military leave.
Section 5.2	- Transfer of Prior Agency Service
If a function of another agency is transferred to the County, the seniority of workers who transfer with the function shall be computed, based upon application of the definition of Section 5.1, to each worker’s prior service with the other agency.
Section 5.3	- Changes to Classes
The County and the Union agree that to the extent possible, workers should not lose their rights under this Article because classes have been revised, established, abolished or retitled.
Section 5.4	- Consideration of Layoff
When the County determines that a layoff is imminent within the bargaining unit, it shall give the Union such advance notice as is reasonable under the circumstances. Such notice shall describe the general areas which may be affected and the circumstances requiring the layoff. Upon request, the Union shall be afforded the opportunity to meet with the County to discuss these matters and any proposed alternatives.
The County shall provide a listing of unclassified positions represented by the Union and shall meet to review the purpose of the position and the feasibility of filling the position with a laid off worker in the same classification.
Section 5.5	- Order of Layoff
When one (1) or more workers performing in the same class in a County Department/Agency are to be laid off, the order of layoff in the affected Department/Agency shall be as follows:
a)	Provisional workers in inverse order of seniority.
b)	Probationary workers in inverse order of seniority.
c)	Permanent workers in inverse order of seniority.

Section 5.6	- Notice of Layoff
Workers subject to the provisions of this Article shall be given at least twenty (20) working days written notice prior to the effective date of layoff.

The procedures of Section 5.7 shall be applied prior to the effective date of the layoff.
Section 5.7	- Reassignment in Lieu of Layoff
a)	Vacant Code in County
In the event of notice of layoff, any worker so affected will be allowed to transfer to a vacant position the County has determined to be filled in his/her current classification or any classification at the same or lower level in which permanent status had formerly been held. Workers will not be required to transfer to vacant positions formerly held if the level for such vacancy would be lower than the level of any classification to which a worker could exercise displacement rights.
The County shall provide a listing of appropriate vacancies and the affected worker(s) shall select a vacancy for which he/she qualifies under 5.7 (a). The worker(s), along with any workers remaining on re-employment list under Section 5.9 below, shall appear at a time and place designated by the County which shall be approximately ten days after the notice of layoff. The worker on a seniority basis shall be allowed ten minutes for the selection. If a currently employed worker does not appear or does not select a vacancy the County will make the designation; however, a worker shall be allowed to use a duly authorized proxy. Workers on the re-employment lists who do not bid in this process shall be considered to have declined one offer in their existing class.
All appropriate departmental bidding will be suspended during this process, or by mutual agreement, it may be accelerated to facilitate layoff placement for the laid off worker.
b)	Displacement
In the event there are no vacancies as listed in (a) the worker shall have the right, upon request, to be returned to the classification in the Department/Agency at the same or next lower level in which permanent status had formerly been held and the regular layoff procedure in that same or lower level shall apply.
Section 5.8	- Administrative Transfer Because of Layoff
A worker who is to be administratively transferred because of the layoff of other workers shall at his/her option be allowed to select on a seniority basis an available transfer in the same classification within the department.

a)	Layoff
In the event that a worker is not reassigned in lieu of layoff as in Section 5.7, or placed in another County position as in Section 5.9(b), the worker shall be laid off. If a worker elects not to exercise the rights in Section 5.7(b), or does not accept placement under Section 5.9(b), he/she may be deemed to have been offered and to have declined such work.
b)	Inplacement

a.	Testing requirements will be the same as if the worker had been reclassified.
b.	In determining qualifications and possible positions, transfers and demotions to both related and non-related classes may be considered.
2.	Transfer will be deemed a "lateral transfer" if movement from one class to another does not exceed an upward salary change of 10% (ten percent).
3.	Normal transfer (ordinance code) rules apply (i.e., the worker can be taken on a permanent or probationary basis at the discretion of the appointing authority). If a worker has underlying permanent status the probationary period following the transfer shall be considered a subsequent probation. Consistent with this status, the worker on a subsequent probation with underlying permanent status, has Personnel Board appeal rights.
4.	The worker may express a preference for certain occupational fields, assignments or departments. However, the worker has no right to claim any position nor is the County required to offer placement.
5.	A position shall not be considered "vacant" for inplacement purposes if the position has been identified as claimable under Section 5.7(a), or (b) by
-14-
another worker who has been issued a layoff notice under Section 5.6 or by worker on a re-employment list established pursuant to Section 5,10.
6.	A worker who is placed under Section 5.9(b) or laid off under Section 5.9(a) shall have his/her name placed on all re-employment lists pursuant to Section 5.10 for the appropriate classification.

Upon certification of the re-employment list to the appointing authority, the person standing highest on a re-employment list for a particular classification shall be offered the appointment. Workers on reemployment lists shall retain the right to take promotional exams and/or receive promotional preference on exams.
b)	When required by the needs of the department and approved by the Director of Personnel, selective certification may be utilized to re-employ workers with bilingual or steno skills.
Section 5.11	- Temporary Work for Laid Off Workers
Interested workers who are placed upon the re-employment list due to layoff and who elect to be available for temporary work shall be given preference for such work for any classification for which they qualify. The election to be available for temporary work may

be made at the time of layoff, or in writing at any time. Workers may decline to be available for temporary work or may decline such work itself without affecting any rights under this Article.
Section 5.12	- Names Dropped from Re-employment List
a)	No name shall be carried on a re-employment list for a period longer than two (2) years, and the names of persons re-employed in a permanent position within the same classification shall, upon such re-employment, be dropped from the list. Refusal to accept one of two offers of re-employment within the same classification shall cause the name of the person to be dropped from that reemployment list.
b)	Workers who were laid off from part-time positions shall be offered full-time employment and workers laid off from full-time positions shall be offered part-time positions. However, a worker’s refusal to accept such an offer with more or fewer hours than the position they left will not be counted as a refusal of an offer of employment in Section 5.12(a) above.

ARTICLE 13 - BENEFIT PROGRAMS
Section 13.1	- Workers’ Compensation
a)	Eligibility
Every worker shall be entitled to industrial injury leave when he/she is unable to perform services because of any injury as defined in the Workers’ Compensation Act.
b)	Compensation
A worker who is disabled as a result of an industrial injury shall be placed on leave, using as much of his/her accumulated compensatory time off, his/her accrued sick leave and vacation time as when added to any disability indemnity payable under the Workers' Compensation Act will result in a payment to him/her of not more than his/her full salary, unless the worker subsequently notifies his/her department payroll unit of his/her desire not to have integration occur. The change from integration to non-integ ration shall be implemented at the beginning of the next pay period after such request.
The first three (3) days shall be charged to the worker's accrued but unused sick leave. If the temporary disability period exceeds fourteen (14) calendar days, temporary disability will be paid for the first three (3) days.
c)	Industrially Injured Workers - Temporary Modified Work Program
The County has established a program to return workers with temporary disabling occupational injuries or illnesses to modified duty within the County as soon as medically practical. Pursuant to the program, the County will make every reasonable effort to provide meaningful work assignments to all such workers capable of performing modified work. The maximum length of such work program shall not exceed twelve (12) weeks. With the approval of the Worker’s Compensation Division, a temporary modified work assignment may be extended to no more than 16 weeks.
There are three kinds of "Temporary Modified Work" shown in order of preference:
1.	Return to the worker's same job with some duties restricted.
2.	Return to the same job, but for fewer hours per day or fewer hours per week. To be used if an injured worker cannot return on a full time basis.
3.	Return temporarily to a different job. This is the least desirable and will only be attempted if the regular job cannot be reasonably modified to meet the injured worker's medical limitations.
-64-
d)	Treatment Following Return from Leave
Workers required by their physician to undergo therapy or treatment due to an industrial injury shall receive leave with pay under the following conditions:
1.	Treatments are being paid under Workers’ Compensation.
2.	The therapy or treatment falls within the worker's normal working hours.
3.	Applies only to actual prescheduled treatment time and reasonable travel
time.
e)	Public Safety Members
Those workers governed by the Public Safety Members provision of the Public Employees' Retirement System, when entitled to benefits under Section 4850 of the Workers' Compensation Act, shall be entitled to disability leaves of absence for a period not to exceed one (1) year as provided in the Act, without loss of salary or related benefits. When an injured worker covered by these provisions has received the maximum benefits allowed by Section 4850, he/she shall be entitled to use sick leave and vacation accruals as provided for under subsection (b) of this Article. Retirement ends the benefits listed in this Section except for the rights to receive vacation and sick leave payoffs under this Agreement.
f)	Clothing Claims
Loss of, or damage to, a worker's clothing resulting from an industrial injury which requires medical treatment will be replaced by the County through the following procedures:
The Department/Agency will review and make a determination on all such incidents as submitted in writing by the worker. Reimbursement will be limited to the lesser of:
I.	75% of proven replacement cost, or
2.	the repair cost.
However, both of the above are limited by a fifty dollar ($50,00) maximum. (Nothing in this Section is intended to replace or supersede Section 9.2 which provides for replacement of items damaged, lost or destroyed in the line of duty.)
Section 13.2	- Insurance Programs a) Medical Insurance

-65-
contribution will be made to the other plans (i.e., Kaiser, Health Net and Valley Health Plan).
The County will continue to pay the worker only contribution for Kaiser, Health Net Plan and Valley Health Plan.
The parties agree that Kaiser coverage will be the Kaiser S Plan with the 3A option through October 1999. The parties also agree that the Valley Health Plan and the Health Net plan shall continue under the current coverage in effect on July 12,1999.

All newly hired workers shall be limited to enrollment in either the Valley Health Plan or Health Net. This limitation shall continue until the next open enrollment window after the worker has been employed for twelve (12) months. This enrollment limitation shall not apply if the worker is already with Kaiser on their date of hire.
2.	Dual Coverage
Effective November 1, 1999, married couples and same sex domestic partners who are both County workers shall be eligible for coverage under one medical plan only with the County paying the full premium for dependent coverage. Married couples and same sex domestic partners who are both County workers and had one dependent coverage and one single coverage will have the single coverage dropped effective November 1, 1999. If both workers have single coverage, one will be converted to dependent coverage. County worker couples are not eligible to participate in the Health Plan Bonus Waiver Program.
3.	Domestic Partners
The County will continue same sex domestic partner coverage.
4.	Medical Premium Payments During Family Leave Without Pay, Medical Leave Without Pay and Industrial Injury Leave

The County shall contribute an amount equal to the cost of Kaiser retiree-only medical plan premium to the cost of the medical plan of workers who have completed five (5) years service (1305 days of accrued service) or more with the County and who retire on PERS directly from the County on or after December 5, 1983. Retirees over 65 or otherwise eligible for Medicare Part B must be enrolled in such a plan, and the County shall reimburse the retiree for the cost of Medicare Part B premium on a quarterly basis. This reimbursement is subject to the maximum County contribution for retiree medical. The surviving spouse or same sex domestic partner of a worker eligible for retiree medical benefits may continue to purchase medical coverage after the death of the retiree.
b.	For workers hired on or after August 12,1996.
The County shall contribute an amount equal to the cost of Kaiser retiree-only medical plan premium to the cost of the medical plan of workers who have completed eight (8) years of service (2088 days of accrued service) or more with the County and who retire on PERS.

Basic and Prosthodontics:
Orthodontics:
75-25 - no deductible. $1,000 maximum per patient per calendar year.
60-40 - no deductible. $1,500 lifetime maximum per patient (no age limit).
Effective November 1, 1999, the maximum per patient per year for basic and prosthodontics will be increased to $2,000. The lifetime maximum for orthodontics will be increased to $2,000 per patient. The County will pick up inflationary costs for the term of the agreement.
The County will continue to provide an alternative dental plan. The current alternative dental plan is Pacific Union Dental. The County will contribute up to the same dollar amount to this alternative dental plan premium as is paid to the Delta Dental Plan.
c)	Health Plan Bonus Waiver Program
Beginning January 1, 2000, with proof of alternative medical coverage, a worker may opt to waive County provided medical coverage:
1.	Effective with each new plan year starting January 1, a worker who waives medical coverage for self and family must do so for the entire plan year by signing up in a special open period in the prior November. The worker shall then receive a bonus of sixty-five dollars ($65.00) gross payment per pay period (subject to the usual payroll deductions) commencing the first pay period of the pay year and through the end of the pay year.
2.	A part-time worker who waives medical coverage will receive a pro-rated bonus payment according to the code status. At the end of a plan year, a part-time worker may submit a request for supplemental bonus payment to
-68-
ESA-Benefits Division for adjustments due to additional hours worked beyond code status.
3.	A new hire worker may waive medical coverage at the time of new employment and receive a pro-rated bonus of sixty-five dollars ($65.00) gross payment per period starting with the first full pay period.
4.	During the plan year, a worker participating in this Program is eligible to re-enroll for coverage within thirty (30) calendar days of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) defined qualifying event. A worker who re-enrolls shall no longer be eligible to receive the bonus waiver payment effective with the date of coverage.
5.	Retirement is not an IRS defined qualifying event. If a worker who is enrolled in the Health Plan Bonus Waiver Program retires during the plan year, the retiree is not eligible to enroll in retiree medical coverage upon retirement until the next open enrollment period after retirement, typicaily in September.
d)	Life Insurance
The County agrees to continue the existing base group Life Insurance Plan of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) per worker.
e)	Vision Care Plan
The County agrees to provide a Vision Care Plan for all workers and dependents. The Plan will be the Vision Service Plan - Plan A with benefits at 12/24/24 month intervals with twenty dollar ($20.00) deductible for examinations and twenty dollar ($20.00) deductible for materials. The County will fully pay the monthly premium for worker and dependents and pick up inflationary costs during the term of this agreement.
Effective November 1, 1999, the plan will be changed to benefits at 12/12/24 month intervals with twenty dollar ($20.00) deductible for examinations and twenty dollar ($20.00) deductibles for materials.
f)	Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Plan
The County has implemented a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Plan effective with a new plan year starting January 1, 1999 in accordance with Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 125. This County established FSA Plan enables a County worker to annually designate and set aside bi-weekly payroll deduction, up to $1,500 of wages on a pre-tax basis for eligible medical/dental expenditure based on a list of IRS approved expenditure.
-69-
g)	County-wide Benefits
The parties agree that, during the term of this Agreement, County-wide changes in benefits, such as medical, dental, holidays, or retirement, shall be applied to workers in these units.
Section 13.3	- Training for Disabled Workers
a)	Vocational Rehabilitation
When a worker is determined by the County unable to return to the classification in which he/she was employed at the time of injury or illness because of a work-connected illness or injury and does not elect a disability retirement, that worker will be offered vocational rehabilitation.
b)	Lateral Transfer/De motion Openings
If the worker meets all the qualifications for a particular position (this would take into account his/her medical limitations, prior work experience and skills) and an opening exists that involves a lateral transfer or demotion, the position shall be offered to the worker.
c)	Salary Level
In accordance with Chapter VI, Article 5, Section A25-661 (e) of the Personnel Practices,"...the salary of the employee shall be placed at the step in the salary range which corresponds most closely to the salary received by the employee as of the time of injury. In the event that such a demotion would result in a salary loss of more than ten (10) percent, the employee’s new salary shall be set at the rate closest to but not less than ten (10) percent below his salary as of the time of injury." It is understood that "salary as of time of injury" as used in the previous sentence refers to range and step, not specific dollars.
d)	Training Program
In those cases where the worker may not have the necessary prior experience or all the required skills but there is reasonable assurance that the worker will be capable of obtaining them through a designated formal on-the-job training program, the County will make reasonable efforts to place the worker in a training program.
e)	Placement Review
If, after a period on the job, it is demonstrated that the worker is unable to develop the required skills, knowledge and abilities and/or cannot meet the physical requirements to handle the new position, he/she will be placed on a leave of absence and the placement process begins again.
f)	Promotions
Any position which involves a promotion will call for the normal qualifying procedures, written and/or oral examination. However, If it is found that a worker meets all the qualifications for a higher paying position and an eligibility list is already in existence, the worker shall be allowed to take a written and/or oral
-70-
examination, and, if the worker qualifies, the worker's name will be placed on the eligibility list commensurate with his/her score.
g)	Referral to Accredited Rehabilitation Agency
In those cases where the County is unable, for one reason or another, to place a worker in a comparable occupation, that worker's case will be referred to an accredited rehabilitation agency as approved by the Division of Industrial Accidents for testing, counseling and retraining at either the County’s or State’s expense.
h)	State Legislation
The provisions of this Section shall not apply if State legislation removes from the County the control of training for disabled workers.
Section 13.4	- Deferred Compensation Plan
The County will continue the present deferred income plan. If the County proposes to change the plan it shall provide appropriate notice to the Union and the parties shall meet and confer over said changes.
Section 13.5	- Joint Health Care Cost Containment Committee
A Joint Union-Management Committee with equal representation of management and Union will continue to meet and further develop measures for limiting increased health plan costs (without shifting such costs to workers or reducing the level of benefits or quality of care). The committee will be responsible to explore health plans, including Kaiser options and dental changes and other topics on an as needed basis.
The Health Care Cost Containment Committee will also investigate other plan options for workers and retirees outside of the Santa Clara County service area, including contracting with out of area government agencies for local health plan coverage. With the agreement of the Union and the County, there shall be a limited mid-term re-opener for the purposes of implementing optional plans or changes to workers' benefits.
Section 13.6	- Joint Childcare Committee
The County and the Union agree to continue the Joint Childcare Committee.

The County will continue the present benefit contract with PERS which is the 2% at 55 Retirement Plan, except those workers covered by safety retirement as listed in Appendix E.
The County of Santa Clara’s increase in contribution to PERS as a result of implementation of the 2% at 55 Plan as well as the existing employer payment of employee PERS contribution shall be reflected as part of effective wages.
The County shall pay on behalf of all workers covered under PERS miscellaneous the currently required worker contribution to the Public Employees’ Retirement System.

I.	The driver of the other vehicle is responsible for the accident as verified by a police report, and the damages shall be unrecoverable from the other party by reason of lack of liability insurance, or
2.	The damage is caused by a hit-run or unidentified driver as verified by a police report, and/or
3	The amount of damage to be reimbursed by the County is not recoverable under any policy of insurance available to the worker. The County shall be subrogated to the worker's rights of recovery from the responsible party.
Section 15.2	- Reimbursement for Use of Private Vehicles a) Mileage Reimbursement
Any worker required to travel on business for the County and who has been duly authorized to use and does use a privately owned automobile shall be allowed and paid as traveling expense for the actual miles traveled during any calendar month at the rate of $0.31 per mile for all miles. Actual miles traveled shall be defined as all miles driven on County business. However, no mileage reimbursement shall be paid for miles traveled to the first field or work location of the day from the worker's place of residence or from the last field or work location of the day to the worker's place of residence, unless the miles traveled exceeds
-73-
the distance normally traveled by the worker during his/her normal home-to-work commute. In that case, the worker may claim reimbursement for only the added mileage which exceeds the normal home-to-work mileage.
This rate will remain subject to a reopener based on the following:
1.	When the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, San Francisco-Oakland average price per gallon of gasoline (all types) moves 12.5 cents above the June, 1981 energy report, however;

-76-
ARTICLE 17	- SAFETY
Section I7.I	- Safety Standards
The County necessarily abides by safety standards established by the State Division of Industrial Safety and pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Appendix J of this Agreement describes the agreed guidelines for Department Safety Committees. Upon request, departmental negotiations on the number of representatives to the Departmental Safety Committee (paragraph 3 of the Guidelines) shall be negotiated at the departmental level. Such negotiations shall be subject to the provisions of Article 8.3(b) of this Agreement and shall also be subject to review and approval of the Countywide Safety Committee pursuant to the Guidelines.
Section I7.2	- Ambience Guidelines
The County has promulgated guidelines with respect to variations in ambience (e.g., heat, light) in work locations within the County. The guidelines cover conditions encountered by workers who work both inside and/or outside. These guidelines are as follows:
Workers of the County work in a variety of physical locations, both indoors and out, where environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, solar radiation and air movement vary widely. Individual workers' tolerance levels for variations in those environmental factors vary from person to person based on physiological differences, general health, physical condition, the nature of the worker's work and other individual tolerance factors not otherwise definable.
Although Federal and State OSHA regulations do not deal specifically with variations in these environmental factors, nor can individual tolerance levels be controlled, these guidelines are issued and intended to assist departments/agencies in dealing with extremes of the environmental factors listed above.
"Extremes” in such factors are not specifically defined here; but should be determined by each department/agency in accordance with the season of the year or the work setting, based on commonly accepted standards for the nature of the work and the facilities or environment in which the work is performed. Distinctions should be kept in mind between comfort, efficiency and health considerations. Under these guidelines, each department/agency should determine acceptable limits of variation based on the factors described above, giving due regard to the work environment and its inherent characteristics and limitations. Department/agency determinations concerning extremes and acceptable limits of variation are subject to review by the County Executive's Office of Occupational Safety and Environmental Compliance (OSEC).
Procedures
Each department/agency shall designate representative(s) responsible for receiving, evaluating and reporting worker complaints of environmental extremes through channels in accordance with these procedures. Depending on whether the reported extreme is in a building or outside, it will be acted upon as described below.
-77-
Buildings
Buildings are defined as all indoor facilities and structures operated (owned or leased) by the County and occupied by County workers.
The Office of Occupational Safety and Environmental Compliance (OSEC) shall designate representative(s) for the purpose of receiving and responding to department/agency reports of environmental extremes in County facilities.
The Office of Occupational Safety and Environmental Compliance (OSEC) shall promptly investigate complaints received from designated department/agency representatives and take reasonable steps to make any needed corrections. OSEC will also promptly provide a status report for the complaining department/agency regarding the conditions. The report will note if the condition is extreme, the expected duration of the extreme and the cause. If requested, this report will be made available by the department/agency to the worker(s) who initiated the complaint.
Outside of Buildings
Environmental factors outside of buildings are not controllable. Reports received by designated representatives concerning outside environmental extremes will be evaluated and a decision made regarding alternative work procedures for work crews engaged in out of doors physical labor. If alternative work procedures are implemented, reasonable access to available shelter and water shall be provided consistent with the nature and locale of the work.
A distinction is to be made between those who perform physical labor in the outdoors versus those whose work requires temporary or regular presence in the outdoors or in vehicles necessary for completion of assigned work. In the latter instances, alternative work procedures should generally be required less frequently than in the case of work crews performing out of doors physical labor.
Alternatives When Environmental Extremes Exist
The decision to implement any variation in work activities shall be that of the appointing authority or his/her authorized representative. Careful consideration must be made regarding the department/agency’s overall operation to meet required service needs. However, when in the department/agencies judgment extremes in environmental conditions will continue to exist for a significant period, the department/agency head may invoke any or all of the following possible alternative work procedures:
I.	Reduce work productivity levels.
2.	Authorize more frequent rest periods throughout the work cycle.
3.	Where workers may be excused from duty and they request time off because of
the extreme situation, excuse those who may be released and charge said time,
-78*
at the worker's option, to his/her accrued but unused vacation, compensatory time off or personal leave days; or to leave without pay.
These alternatives are not intended to limit the appointing authority from approving other alternatives, such as temporary changing of hours of work, temporary changing of work assignments, etc.
Workers who become ill because of extreme conditions may use sick leave in accordance with regular County procedures.

Section 18.5	- Informal Grievance Step
It is agreed that workers will act promptly through an informal meeting with their immediate supervisor outside of the bargaining unit on any act, condition or circumstance which is causing worker dissatisfaction and to seek action to remove the cause of dissatisfaction before it serves as the basis for a formal grievance.

At this step, a meeting shall be held if requested by either party. The grievant may be accompanied by his/her Steward and/or Chief Steward. All parties meet and disclose the theory of the grievance and the theory of denial as well as the facts upon which these theories are based.
c)	Pre-Arbitration Meeting (Stipulation and Arbitrator Selection) - After a grievance has been moved to Step Two, the Union and County shall continue efforts at resolution. In addition, all parties will attempt to stipulate to all facts, disclose all pertinent information and agree on the question or questions to be submitted to an arbitrator.
Pre-Arbitration meetings shall be held monthly for each department/agency. By mutual agreement, pre-arbitration meetings may be scheduled more frequently.

APPENDIX G - EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
This Agreement represents the results of meeting and conferring in good faith between the County of Santa Clara and Locals 715 and 535, SEIU, AFL-CIO pursuant to Article 12, Section 12.9 and Article 13, Section 4 of the current Memoranda of Agreement between the County and Locals 7I5 and 535, respectively.
It is understood that materials/leaflets/news releases, etc., relating to this program will be developed jointly between County and the Unions.
The elements of this program are: (1) a Policy Statement, (2) a Referral Procedure, and (3) a Program Structure. Such elements are described below.
a)	Policy Statement
1.	The County of Santa Clara recognizes alcoholism, alcohol abuse and other health and behavioral problems as treatable conditions.
2.	A County worker having these conditions will be given the same consideration and offer of assistance presently extended to workers having any other illness.
3.	The social stigma associated with alcoholism and alcohol abuse has no basis in fact. It is expected that a County-wide enlightened attitude and a realistic acceptance of these conditions will encourage workers and members of their immediate families who suspect that they have a problem, even in the early stages, to take advantage of the diagnostic, counseling and treatment services available through this Program.
4.	The County is concerned with a worker's use of alcohol and with other health and behavioral problems only when they affect his/her job performance.
5.	It will be the responsibility of the County to implement this policy, and to follow the procedures assuring that no worker’s request for assistance will jeopardize his/her job security or promotion opportunities.
6.	It is recognized that, for purposes of this Program, supervisors do not have the qualifications or the responsibility to make any diagnosis or judgment as to whether or not a worker is an alcoholic or has any other health or behavioral problem. Supervisors' responsibilities are limited to assessing job performance and initiating the corrective action appropriate to that level of job performance.
7.	Employee Assistance Program records will be kept strictly confidential. Any identifying information about any worker will be given out only with the written approval of the worker.
-191-
8.	County workers and members of their immediate families who suspect that they have an alcohol or other health or behavioral problem, even in the early stages, are encouraged to seek confidential assistance by contacting the designated program personnel or any appropriate public or private service provider.
9.	Implementation of this policy will not require, or result in, any special regulations, privilege or exemptions from the standard administration practices applicable to job performance requirements.
10.	Performance problems will be handled in accordance with established County and Merit System procedures and labor-management agreements. Alcoholism, drug or other personal problems will not be an acceptable reason for lowering job performance standards.
11.	Workers who participate in counseling, diagnosis, or treatment may, at their request, use accumulated sick leave, vacation leave, and compensatory time while away from work for such a purpose. Leave of absence without pay, depending upon departmental policies and labormanagement agreements, may also be used for these purposes.
A prime objective of this policy is to retain workers who may have or develop alcoholism or drug dependency by helping them to arrest its further advance before the condition renders them unemployable.
b)	Referral Procedure
These procedures should be followed even when alcohol or other personal problems are obviously involved in the poor work performance. The objectives are:
1.	To establish uniform handling of troubled workers, and
2.	To reduce or eliminate poor work performance associated with alcohol or other personal problems.
Job performance issues should generally be resolved in the most informal way possible. Where such problems cannot be so resolved, action that you will take is governed by the following procedures. It is suggested that you determine a course of action based on the observed problems by consulting with your supervisor.
Stepl. Conduct at least one informal interview where the problems are discussed with the worker and alternatives for correction are identified. The supervisor must decide what is the next step. This may include nothing if the worker refuses to admit a need for change or it may
-192-
include some very intricate program involvement The Employee Assistance Program should be offered as a source of help. Assure the worker of the confidentiality of the program and his/her involvement in it. Suggest that if the worker has any questions or doubts about the E.A.P., that he/she discuss it with his/her steward, and provide the worker with Union and E.A.P. leaflets.
A reasonable amount of time should be allowed for correction of the performance deficiencies.
Continue to monitor performance.
Step 2. Conduct a formal interview if there is continued poor performance. Discuss the problems and changes needed in job performance.
Establish what the outcome will be if the changes do not occur; that is, advise the worker of disciplinary proceedings which will follow should he/she not improve his/her performance. Encourage the worker to call the Employee Assistance Program and make an appointment. Reemphasize to the worker the confidentiality of the Program and provide the worker with Union and E.A.P. leaflets. Suggest that if the worker has any questions or doubts about the E.A.P. that he/she discuss it with his/her Steward. Prepare a written report of the interview in accordance with established procedures.
Continue observation of performance, documenting changes, if any, and informally discuss such observations with worker.
Step 3. If job performance does not improve, conduct an additional formal interview. Carry out the disciplinary action specified in the last formal interview. Advise of further action if improvement in job performance does not occur. Again, offer referral to the Employee Assistance Program. Re-emphasize confidentiality of the Program. Suggest that the worker discuss it with his/her Steward. Prepare a written report of the interview in accordance with established procedures. Work out with worker a timetable for improvement in job performance.
Continue observation.
If no changes occur, institute discipline as appropriate.
c)	Program Structure
The Employee Assistance Program of the County of Santa Clara will have a structure which recognizes the joint interests of Management and Labor in the carrying out of the Program and in monitoring the Program to assure success.
-193-
The structure of the Program involves two significant elements: (1) E.A.P. Coordinating Counselor and (2) E.A.P. Coordinating Committee.
The roles of each element are as follows:
1.	E.A.P. Coordinating Counselor
Subject to general supervision and monitoring by the E.A.P. Coordinating Committee.
Acts as a primary developer of treatment resources
Acts as a primary liaison with treatment resources
Coordinates training of supervisors and Stewards
Coordinates all other aspects of the Program
Reports to and provides information for the E.A.P. Coordinating Committee
Acts as the primary counseling and referral agent for the Program
2.	E.A.P. Coordinating Committee
The Employee Assistance Program Coordinating Committee would consist of one member designated by each Union desiring to do so, and a number of members designated by the County Executive, not to exceed the number of Union members.
The functions of the Coordinating Committee would be as follows:
To monitor the overall Program
To develop and implement evaluation procedures
To review complaints (case problems, failures, discuss possibilities)
To evaluate staff performance
To provide general program direction to the Coordinating Counselor
To approve Steward and supervisor training program
The Coordinating Committee would meet at least monthly and more frequently as necessary. Release time would be provided for such meetings.
-194-
The Coordinating Counselor would be a full-time administrative position in the Bureau of Alcoholism Services reporting directly to the Director of Alcoholism Services, but generally supervised by the E.A.P. Coordinating Committee.
Location - The geographic location of the Program should be a neutral location and definitely not a Union Office, the Personnel Office or the Bureau of Alcoholism Services. In this way, some control over staff activities could be maintained.

AGREEMENT
Between the County of Santa Clara and
SEIU Local 715 Extra Help Usage
This Agreement was reached in accordance with Appendix I of the 1999-2002 Agreement between the County of Santa Clara and Local 715, SEIU. Pursuant to Appendix I, the County and Union agreed to have a special reopener on the issue of extra help use.
As a result of this Agreement, the Union agrees to dismiss its lawsuit against the County of Santa Clara (SEIU Local 715 v. County of Santa Clara, Superior Court No. CV782425) with prejudice and release the County from all claims relating to SEIU extra help members through the date of this Agreement.
The parties agree to the following:
1.	Reduction in the use of extra help:
The parties agree to a reduction in the use of extra help. Extra help hours for calendar year 1998 will be used as the county wide baseline - 2,039,198 hours. It is agreed that the assumption of 70% of the countywide baseline or 1,427,500 hours is used as the Local 715 represented extra help baseline. The following is a breakdown of how the reduction will occur over the next three (3) years.
a)	Extra help hours for 1-1-00 to 6-30-00 (second half of FY 2000) to be capped at 606,750 hours.
b)	Extra help hours for FY 2001,7-1-00 to 6-30-01, to be capped at 1,142,000 hours.
c)	Extra help for FY 2002,7-1-01 to 6-30-02, to be capped at 1,070,600 hours.
d)	Extra help for FY 2003,7-1-02 to 6-30-03, to be capped at 950,000 hours.
In the event of unanticipated circumstances which cause additional usage of extra help hours, the County may exceed the extra hours usage caps only after meeting and conferring with the Union and reaching mutual agreement.
The County will add coded positions as needed to meet program needs and extra help hours caps.
2.	Streamlining of the Hiring Process:
The County and the Union will jointly support methods to streamline the hiring process in an effort to reduce the need for extra help including amending merit system where necessary and change processes as supported by the Extra Help Stakeholders' Group and approved by the Board of Supervisors in the following areas:
a)	Weekly job bulletins;
b)	An increase in the number of classes for continuous recruitment;
c)	All applications to be screened within five (5) working days of recruitment closing;
d)	All exams to be scored within five (5) working days of testing;
e)	All certification lists to be provided to department/agency within three (3) days of a request;
f)	Use the In temet for recrui tment;
g)	Start recruitment process before some jobs become vacant;
h)	Training managers and supervisors on effective use of eligible lists, filling temporary vacancies and the recruitment process; and, alternatives to extra help usage including Provisional and Substitute Provisional.
3. Float Pools:
a) A pilot project will be established at the Santa Clara Valley Health & I lospital System. This pilot project will involve the following classifications:
Classification Hospital Services Assistant II Medical Admitting Clerk Nursing Attendant Janitor Medical Assistant Office Clerk Unit Support Assistant	# of Codes 7 5 4 3 1 4 2
b)	A pilot project will be established at the Department of Correction one year after implementation at Santa Clara Valley Health & Hospital System. This pilot project will include two (2) float positions to be selected by management from the classifications of FSW-Correction, Cook I, Cook II, Dietetic Assistant or Baker.
c)	Float positions are to be used to cover absences of classified or unclassified workers or for special projects as needed
4.	Part Year Codes:
The County and the Union agree to the establishment of half-year (13 pay periods) and three-quarter year (19 pay periods) positions in the Department of Parks & Recreation. Workers hired into such positions shall work full-time for either 13 or 19 pay periods.
Workers hired into such-eedes shall be eligible for benefits as full-time employees for the effective time period (13 pay periods or 19 pay periods) of the code. Workers who work beyond the time period of the code shall be eligible for benefits in accordance with Section 7.4 b) of the Agreement between the County and the Union.
All time worked in a part year coded classification will be used for the purposes of determining a part year worker's probationary period under Section 6.1.
Workers in half-year or three-quarter year codes shall not be eligible for coverage under Article 5 - Layoff.
Workers in such positions shall be released from County employment at the expiration of the time period established for the position, but may be retained on an as needed basis by the Department of Parks & Recreation. Workers released from such positions because of the expiration of time for the position are not guaranteed recall into such positions in subsequent years. To the extent that the County determines to fill such positions in subsequent years, workers will be recalled by classification and seniority.
Seniority shall be defined as the date of hire within a part year coded classification in the Department of Parks & Recreation within the classified service of the County. For the purpose of computing total time in the worker's classification, the worker will be given credit for all time in any part year classification at the same or higher salary level, in which status had formerly been held. Date of hire shall be adjusted for all time on leave without pay which extends beyond one full pay period, but shall not be adjusted for all time on maternity leave, worker's compensation leave and military leave.
For the initial hiring, the Department of Parks & Recreation will contact the seasonal workers from 1999 using contact information on file. First, the 1999’ seasonal workers will be offered positions on the basis of seniority. Seniority will be defined as the total length of extra help service as determined by the department, in consultation with the Union. Thereafter, hiring will be done according to Merit System Rules.
The parties agree to expedite the meet and confer process over the new classification of Parks Service Attendant.
County agrees to delete the extra help classification of Park Aide.
5.	Reports:
a)	Extra help hours report:
The County will modify the bi-weekly extra help hours report to include the total number of extra help hours in each budget unit and the original date of hire of each extra help worker. Any date prior to February 23, 1998 will not be considered.
The Union will also be provided with a bi-weekly intermittent hours report that contains the same type of information as the extra help hours report.
b)	Quarterly reports to Board of Supervisors:
If the Board of Supervisors is provided with a quarterly report on extra help workers represented by Local 715, the report will include the total number of hours by department/agency. Local 715 will be provided with a copy of the report.
c)	Creation of tests:
The Union will provide the County with a list of particular tests where members report problems with the description of problems and suggestions for revisions. The County agrees to study and respond to the Union's report.
6.	Budget Item:
A line item for each budget unit will be added to the County Budget starting FY 2001-2002 that represents the cost of budgeted extra help usage.
7.	Department/Agency Meetings:
At the request of the Union, a joint meeting conducted with Union representatives, Department representatives and representatives of the Employee Services Agency (ESA) when a County department/agency significantly exceeds extra help targets. ESA will prepare a report that includes a review of the meeting, the reasons the extra help target was exceeded and any plans or recommendations to reduce extra help use if appropriate. The report will be provided to the County Executive and copied to Union.
8-	Term of Agreement:
This Agreement will be effective following approval by the County and the Union and will continue up to and including June 30,2003.
The parties agree that extra help usage is an appropriate topic for discussion in the 2002 Master Negotiations. Any agreement reached between the parties on the same subjects covered by this extra help reopener shall not be effective any earlier than July 1,2003.

2004 Extension Agreement
between
County of Santa Clara
and
SEIU Local 715
County of Santa Clara (County) and Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 715 (Union) have agreed to extend the current Memorandum of Agreement that was scheduled to expire on June 20, 2004. The existing Memorandum of Agreement (1999-2004) shall remain in full force and effect up to and including June 18, 2006 with the additional terms and conditions described below:
1.	The current Memorandum of Agreement between the County and the Union (July 12, 1999 through June 20, 2004) shall be extended through June 18, 2006.
2.	There shall be no general wage increase during the first extension year (2004-2005) of the Memorandum of Agreement.
3.	Effective pay period 04/14, June 21, 2004, there shall be realignments for certain specific classifications and/or differentials to be determined in accordance with Item 4 below totaling approximately one percent (1%) of base wage for all workers represented by the Union.
4.	The County and the Union agree to meet and confer during the month of April 2004 on the actual realignments for specific classifications and/or differentials. Further, if agreement is not reached by April 30, 2004, all outstanding realignment issues shall be forwarded to John Kagel for resolution in the mediation/arbitration process. Results of the mediation/arbitration shall be finalized by no later than May 28, 2004. Costs of mediation/arbitration shall be equally borne by the County and the Union.
5.	In the second extension year (2005-2006) effective pay period 05/14, June 20, 2005 there shall be a general wage increase of approximately two percent (2%) for all workers represented by the Union.
6.	In the second extension year (2005-2006) effective pay period 05/14, June 20, 2005, there shall be realignments for certain specific classifications totaling approximately one percent (1%) of base wage for all workers represented by the Union.

Page 2
9.	All new and revised job titles, and additional job classes that became eligible for reimbursement of State required continuing education and license fees and costs will be updated in time for printing of the Extension Agreement. A Union-Management SubCommittee will review the effect of the clerical study on B.8, B.l 1 and B.l5 of contract Appendix B for the purpose of conforming to new job titles and series.
10.	VRWH denials are to be accompanied by written reason for denial. The County will work with the Union to develop a process for appeal to the Department Head by the September 2004 VRWH window.
11.	The entire amount of one-time funds from residuals of the 2003 2.5% Wage Deferral Agreement will be expended for the use and benefit of workers represented by the Union, by establishing two (2) additional full time positions of Marriage and Family Therapist in the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for FY05 and FY06, expansion of the 20/20 Program (inside and outside of the Health and Hospital System) and establishing other training and re-training programs for SEIU Local 715 members for the purpose of enhancing opportunities of job retention for existing County workers.
12.	A Union-Management Committee will be established on training pursuant to Item 11 above. The Committee is charged with the identification and recommendation for establishment of “bridge” classifications similar to the concept of Legal Secretary Trainee (with every reasonable effort made to put in place such positions to be filled by July 1, 2004 as possible layoff inplacement options), identifying the type and nature of training and re-training programs such that completion of such programs would result in meeting qualifying requirements for County jobs that are less likely to be affected by layoffs; review tuition reimbursement program procedures for possible streamlining, develop more user friendly policies related to tuition reimbursement; and identify ways to market and distribute alternate opportunities such as Park Maintenance Worker Training (contract Appendix D).
13.	Based on the acceptance of Items 1 through 1-7 above, and in consideration thereof, the County will offer 2 additional years of service credit under PERS (Government Code section 20903) as early retirement incentive to eligible workers (at least age 50 with 5 or more years of qualifying PERS service) in all classes represented by Local 715. The 90 day window for workers opting for this incentive and actually retiring from the County would be the period beginning April 7, 2004 and lasting through July 5, 2004 after necessary and required public actions are taken by the Board of Supervisors.

It is understood and agreed by the parties that this is a one-time offering of early retirement incentive and the County intends to make no similar offer of early retirement incentive in the next 5 years; and that likewise, the Union does not intend to make any new proposal for early retirement incentive during the same time period.
