JOB RECOVERY ADDENDUM
All requirements for crew sizes are eliminated on all work bid under this Agreement. The Company will be the determinant as to the number of pile drivers to be employed for the performance of pile drivers work based upon job site conditions. It is understood and agreed that other crafts will not be used to perform work historically performed by pile drivers in the Heavy & Highway Agreement nor will work be performed in an unsafe manner in an attempt to avoid the employment of additional pile drivers.
If another craft is used to perform the work of the pile driver as described herein, this provision is negated and the crew requirements of the original Agreement as noted hereafter are in effect for that contractor on that project.
