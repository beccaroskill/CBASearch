C.	Area of Representation - A Union steward's "area of primary representation" is defined as an institution, office, or building.

A.	Union stewards, Union staff, and/or elected bargaining unit council representatives may have access to employees to represent them pursuant to Section 2.1 A. above.

2.6	Steward Time Off
Upon request of an aggrieved employee, a steward shall be allowed reasonable time off during working hours, without loss of compensation, for representational purposes in accordance with Section 2.1 A. of this Contract, provided the employee represented is in the steward's designated area of representation.

formula furnished by the Union for Fair Share fees deductions. The State further agrees to recalculate, deduct, and transmit Fair Share fees to the Union based upon any revised amounts or formulas furnished by the Union for Fair Share fees deductions during the term of this Contract. The State and the Union agree that a system of authorized dues deductions and a system of Fair Share fee deductions shall be operated in accordance with Government Code Sections 3513(h), 3513(j), 3515, 3515.6, 3515.7, and 3515.8, subject to the following provisions:
1.	When Fair Share fees are in effect, an employee may withdraw from membership in the Union by sending a signed withdrawal letter to the Union with a copy to the State Controller at any time. An employee who so withdraws his/her membership shall be subject to paying a Fair Share fee, if such a fee is applicable.
2.	The Union agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the State and its agents harmless against any claims made of any nature and against any suit instituted against the State arising from this section and the deductions arising therefrom.
3.	The Union agrees to annually notify all State employees who pay Fair Share fees of their right to demand and receive from the Union a return of part of that fee pursuant to Government Code Section 3515.8.
4.	No provisions of this section or any disputes arising thereunder shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure contained in this Contract.
5.	Should a rescission election be successful, the written authorization for payroll deductions for Union membership shall remain in full force and effect during the life of this contract except that any employee may withdraw from the Union by sending a signed withdrawal letter to the Union with a copy to the State Controller's Office within thirty (30) calendar days prior to the expiration of this Contract.
3.2	Release of Home Addresses: Non Law Enforcement Employees
A.	Home Addresses - Generally
1.	Consistent with PERB regulations and State law, the State shall continue to provide the Union with home addresses on a monthly basis for all employees covered by this Contract until it expires.
2.	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, any employee may have his/her home address withheld from the Union at any time by submitting a written request to his/her appointing power on a form provided by the State.

ARTICLE 8	- LEAVES
8.1	Vacation Leave
A.	Employees shall not be entitled to vacation leave credit for the first six (6) months of service. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of six (6) qualifying monthly pay periods of continuous service, all full-time employees covered by this section shall receive a one-time vacation bonus of forty-two (42) hours of vacation credit. Thereafter, for each additional qualifying monthly pay period, the employee shall be allowed credit for vacation with pay on the first day of the following month as follows:
7 months to 3 years
37 months to 10 years
121 months to 15 years
181 months to 20 years
20 years and over
7 hours per month
10 hours per month
12	hours per month
13	hours per month
14	hours per month
An employee who returns to State service after an absence of six (6) months or longer, caused by a permanent separation, shall receive a one-time vacation credit on the first monthly pay period following completion of six (6) qualifying pay periods of continuous service in accordance with the employee's total State service before and after the absence.
B.	A full-time employee who has eleven (11) or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall earn vacation credits as set forth under Item A. above. Absences from State service resulting from a temporary or permanent separation for more than eleven (11) consecutive working days which fall into two consecutive qualifying pay periods shall disqualify the second pay period.
C.	Employees working less than full-time accrue vacation in accordance with the chart shown in Section 7 L. of this Contract.
D.	Vacation credits may be taken in fifteen (15) minute increments.

BU 20

E.	Employees are authorized to use existing fractional vacation hours that may have been accumulated.
F.	Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for accrued vacation credits for all accrued vacation time.
G.	Subject to operational needs, the time when vacation shall be taken by the employee shall not be unreasonably denied. Employee vacation requests shall be submitted and granted or denied in writing in a timely manner. Vacations can only be cancelled when unanticipated operational needs require it.
H.	Vacation requests must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on this subject. However, when two (2) or more employees on the same shift (if applicable) in a work unit (as defined by each department head or designee) request the same vacation time and approval cannot be given to all employees requesting it, employees shall be granted their preferred vacation period in order of seniority (defined as total months of State service in the same manner as vacation is accumulated). When two (2) or more employees have the same amount of State service, department seniority will be used to break the tie. Vacation schedules, which have been established in a work unit, pursuant to the seniority provisions in this Article, shall not be affected by employee(s) entering the unit after the schedule has been established.
I.	By June 1 of each calendar year those employees whose vacation balance exceeds, or could exceed by December 31, the vacation cap of Section 8.1 J. must submit to their supervisor for approval a plan to use vacation to bring their balance below the cap. If the employee fails to submit a plan, or adhere to an approved plan, the department head or designee has the right to order an employee to take sufficient vacation to reduce the employee's vacation balance or potential balance on December 31 below the cap specified in Section 8.1 J.
J.	If an employee in Unit 1, 14 and 20 does not use all of the vacation that the employee has accrued in a calendar year, the employee may carry over his/her accrued vacation credits to the following calendar year to a maximum of six hundred forty (640) hours. A department head or designee may permit an employee to carry over more than six hundred forty (640) hours of accrued vacation hours if an employee was unable to reduce his/her accrued hours because the employee: (1) was required to work as a result of fire, flood, or other extensive emergency; (2) was assigned work of a priority or critical nature over an extended period of time; (3) was absent on full salary for compensable injury; (4) was prevented by department regulations from taking vacation until December 31 because of sick leave; or (5) was on jury duty.
8.2	Sick Leave
A.	As used in this section, "sick leave" means the necessary absence from duty of an employee because of:
1.	Illness or injury, including illness or injury relating to pregnancy;
2.	Exposure to a contagious disease which is determined by a physician to require absence from work;
34
BU 20
03-05
3.	Dental, eye, and other physical or medical examination or treatment by a licensed practitioner;
4.	Absence from duty for attendance upon the employee's ill or injured mother, father, husband, wife, domestic partner (as defined in accordance with Family Code Section 297), son, daughter, brother, sister, or any person residing in the immediate household. Such absence shall be limited to six (6) workdays per occurrence or, in extraordinary situations, to the time necessary for care until physician or other care can be arranged.
B.	A full-time employee who has eleven (11) or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall be eligible for up to eight (8) hours of sick leave credit. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each qualifying pay period of service, each full-time employee shall earn eight (8) hours of credit for sick leave with pay.
C.	Credit for less than full-time employees shall be computed as follows:
1.	Part-time employees: On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each monthly pay period of continuous service, each part-time employee shall be allowed, on a pro rata basis, the fractional part of his/her appropriate accrual rate of credit for sick leave with pay in accordance with the schedule in Article 7.
2.	Multiple positions under this rule:
a.	An employee holding a position in State service in addition to the primary full-time position with the State shall not receive credit for sick leave with pay for service in the additional position;
b.	Where an employee holds two (2) or more "less than full-time positions," the time worked in each position shall be combined for purposes of computing credits for sick leave with pay, but such credits shall not exceed the amount earned for (8 hours per pay period) full-time employment credit.
D.	An employee may be required to provide a physician's or licensed practitioner's verification of sick leave when:
1.	The employee has a demonstrable pattern of sick leave abuse; or
2.	The supervisor has good reason to believe the absence was for an unauthorized reason. A supervisor has good reason if a prudent person would also believe the absence was for an unauthorized reason.
E.	An employee will not be denied the right to use sick leave or be subject to any type of corrective or disciplinary action, or in any manner discriminated against for using or attempting to exercise his/her right to use sick leave based solely on the amount of use.
35
BU 20
03-05
F.	The department head or designee shall approve sick leave only after having ascertained that the absence is for an authorized reason and may require the employee to submit substantiating evidence including, but not limited to, a physician's or licensed practitioner's verification. The State recognizes the confidential nature of the relationship between the health care provider and patient. However, such substantiation shall include, but not be limited to, the general nature of the employee's illness or injury and prognosis (i.e., the anticipated length of the absence, any restrictions upon return to work that prevent the employee from performing the full range of his/her normal work assignment and anticipated future absences). If the department head or designee does not consider the evidence adequate, the request for sick leave shall be disapproved. Upon request, a denial of sick leave shall be in writing stating the reason for denial.
G.	Sick leave may be accumulated without limit.
H.	Sick leave may be requested and taken in fifteen (15) minute increments.
I.	A full-time employee whose continuity of employment is broken by a permanent separation of six (6) months or longer and is subsequently reemployed cannot be credited with any unused sick leave accumulated prior to the employee's separation and the full-time employee must complete one month of continuous service before being granted one day of sick leave credit. In addition, when a full-time employee has a break in the continuity of employment because of a permanent separation of less than six (6) months or because of a temporary separation, the full-time employee's prior unused sick leave balance is restored.
J.	When an employee's sick leave balance is zero, other leave credits such as vacation, CTO, PLP, personal holiday, or holiday leave may be substituted with the supervisor's approval, and shall not be unreasonably denied.
8.3.20 Bereavement Leave
A.	A department head or designee shall authorize bereavement leave with pay for a permanent full-time State employee due to death of his/her parent, stepparent, spouse, child, grandchild, grandparent, brother, sister, mother-in-law, father-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, stepchild, or adopted child, or anyone living in the household. Such bereavement leave shall be authorized for up to three (3) regular work days of the employee per occurrence. The employee shall give notice to his/her immediate supervisor as soon as possible and shall, if requested by the employee's supervisor, provide substantiation to support the request.
B.	If the death of a person as described above requires the employee to travel over four hundred (400) miles one-way from his/her home, additional time off with pay shall be granted for two (2) additional days which shall be deducted from accrued sick leave, or any existing leave credits. Should additional leave be necessary, the department head or designee may authorize the use of existing leave credits or authorized leave without pay.
C.	Employees may utilize all leave credits for additional time required in excess of the time allowed in A. or time required due to the death of other relatives not listed in A. above.

Upon request, and subject to operational needs, an employee on an alternate work schedule or shift other than Monday - Friday, 8am to 5pm may be placed on an existing work schedule or shift that coincides with the time he/she is required to be available in accordance with the provisions of A. above.
8.14	Jury Duty
A.	An employee shall be allowed such time off without loss of compensation as is required in connection with mandatory jury duty. Upon receiving notice of jury duty an employee shall immediately provide a copy of the notice to his/her supervisor.
B.	If payment is made for such time off, the employee is required to remit to the State jury fees received. If an employee elects to use accrued vacation leave or compensating time off while on jury duty, the employee is not required to remit jury fees. For the purposes of this section, "jury fees" means fees received for jury duty excluding payment for mileage, parking, meals, or other out-of-pocket expenses.
C.	For an employee summoned to jury duty during hours other than the employee's regular and customary shift, management will endeavor to temporarily reassign the employee to a work shift that more closely coincides with the hours the employee is required to serve on jury duty, including any necessary travel time, subject to the following:
1.	The department already maintains an appropriate work shift that utilizes the employee's classification; and
2.	The operational needs of the department permit such reassignment.
D.	An employee shall be allowed time off without loss of compensation if approved by the department head or designee for voluntary jury duty such as grand jury. If approved by the department, paragraphs B. and C. apply.

E.	For the purpose of this section, an employee summoned to jury duty may be required to adjust the work shift to an eight (8) hour schedule.
F.	An employee summoned to jury duty who does not serve for a full day or who is placed on "on-call" status shall return to work to complete his/her scheduled workday if reasonable time remains for such return. An employee may not be required to report back to work if he/she feels there is not reasonably enough time left in the workday and if the employee's supervisor concurs. Concurrence will not be unreasonably withheld.
8.15	Personal Leave Program: 1992
A.	Personal Leave shall be requested and used by the employee in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Requests to use Personal Leave must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on vacation or annual leave. Employees may not be required to use Personal Leave credits.
B.	At the discretion of the State, all or a portion of unused Personal Leave credits may be cashed out at the employee's salary rate at the time the Personal Leave payment is made. It is understood by both parties that the application of this cash-out provision may differ from department to department and from employee to employee. Departments shall consider an employee's request to retain leave credits for future use rather than have the leave cashed out. Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for unused Personal Leave credits in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Cash-out or lump-sum payment for any Personal Leave credits shall not be considered as "compensation" for purposes of retirement. If funds become available for the Personal Leave Program, departments will offer employees the opportunity to cash out accrued Personal Leave.
C.	If any dispute arises about this Personal Leave section, an employee may file a grievance and the decision reached at Step 3 (Department of Personnel Administration) of the grievance procedure shall be final and not subject to the arbitration clause of this Contract.
D.	Personal Leave credits shall not be counted towards the 1,734/1,934 hours of compensation for Special School employees subject to the State Special Schools 10-Month Compensation Agreement.
8.16	Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
A.	The State acknowledges its commitment to comply with the spirit and intent of the leave entitlement provided by the FMLA and the California Family Rights Act (CFRA) referred to collectively as "FMLA”. The State and the Union recognize that on occasion it will be necessary for employees of the State to take job-protected leave for reasons consistent with the FMLA. As defined by the FMLA, reasons for an FMLA leave may include an employee's serious health condition, for the care of a child, spouse, domestic partner (as defined in Family Code Section 297), or parent who has a serious health condition, and/or for the birth or adoption of a child.
43
BU 20
03-05
B.	For the purposes of providing the FMLA benefits the following definitions shall apply:
1.	An eligible employee means an employee who meets the eligibility criteria set forth in the FMLA;
2.	An employee's child means any child, regardless of age, who is affected by a serious health condition as defined by the FMLA and is incapable of self care. "Care" as provided in this section applies to the individual with the covered health condition;
3.	An employee's parent means a parent or an individual standing in loco parentis as set forth in the FMLA;
4.	Leave may include paid sick leave, vacation, annual leave, personal leave, catastrophic leave, holiday credit, excess hours, and unpaid leave. In accordance with the FMLA, an employee shall not be required to use CTO credits, unless otherwise specified by Section 8.8 of this Contract.
a.	FMLA absences due to illness and/or injury of the employee or eligible family member, may be covered with the employee's available sick leave credits and catastrophic leave donations. Catastrophic leave eligibility and sick leave credit usage for a FMLA leave will be administered in accordance with Sections 8.8 and 8.2 of this Contract.
b.	Other leave may be substituted for the FMLA absence due to illness and/or injury, at the employee's discretion. An employee shall not be required to exhaust all paid leave, before choosing unpaid leave, unless otherwise required by Section 8.8 of this Contract.
c.	FMLA absences for reasons other than illness and/or injury (i.e., adoption or care of an eligible family member), may be covered with leave credits, other than sick leave, including unpaid leave, at the employee's discretion. Except in accordance with Section 8.8 of this Contract, an employee shall not be required to exhaust all leave credits available before choosing unpaid leave to cover an FMLA absence.
C.	An eligible employee shall provide certification of the need for an FMLA leave. Additional certification may be requested if the department head or designee has reasonable cause to believe the employee's condition or eligibility for FMLA leave has changed. The reasons for the additional certification request shall be provided to the employee in writing.
D.	An eligible employee shall be entitled to a maximum of twelve (12) workweeks (480 hours) FMLA leave per calendar year and all other rights set forth in the FMLA. This entitlement shall be administered in concert with the other leave provisions in Article 8 of this Contract. Nothing in this Contract should be construed to allow the State to provide less than that provided by the FMLA.
44
BU 20
03-05
E.	On January 1 of each year, FMLA leave shall be recorded in accordance with the calendar year. Each time an employee takes an FMLA leave, the remaining leave entitlement is any balance of the twelve (12) workweeks that has not been used during the current calendar year. Employees who have taken FMLA leave under the previous 12 month rolling period, shall be entitled to additional leave up to a total of 12 weeks for the current calendar year.
F.	An employee on FMLA leave has a right to be restored to his/her same or "equivalent" position (FMLA) or to a "comparable" position (CFRA) with equivalent pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment.
G.	For the purposes of computing seniority, employees on paid FMLA leave will accrue seniority credit in accordance with the Department of Personnel Administration Rules 599.608 and 599.609.
H.	Any appeals regarding an FMLA decision should be directed to the department head or designee. FMLA is a Federal law and administered and enforced by the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division. The State's CFRA is a State law which is administered and enforced by the Department of Fair Employment and Housing. FMLA/CFRA does not supersede any Article of this Contract which provides greater family and medical leave rights. This section is not subject to grievance or arbitration.
8.17	Mentoring Leave
A.	Eligible employees may receive up to forty (40) hours of "mentoring leave" per calendar year to participate in mentoring activities once they have used an equal amount of their personal time for these activities. "Mentoring leave" is paid leave time which may only be used by an employee to mentor. This leave does not count as time worked for purposes of overtime. "Mentoring leave" may not be used for travel to and from the mentoring location.
B.	An employee must use an equal number of hours of his or her personal time (approved annual leave, vacation, personal leave, personal holiday, or CTO during the workday and/or personal time during non-working hours) prior to requesting "mentoring leave”. For example, if an employee requests two (2) hours of "mentoring leave”, he or she must have used two (2) verified hours of his or her personal time prior to receiving approval for the "mentoring leave". "Mentoring leave" does not have to be requested in the same week or month as the personal time was used. It does, however, have to be requested and used before the end of the calendar year.
C.	Prior to requesting mentoring leave and in accordance with departmental policy, an employee shall provide his or her supervisor with verification of personal time spent mentoring from the mentoring organization.
D.	Requests for approval of vacation, CTO, and/or annual leave for mentoring activities are subject to approval requirements in this Contract and in existing departmental policies. Requests for approval of mentoring leave are subject to operational needs of the State, budgetary limits, and any limitations imposed by law.
45
BU 20
03-05
E.	In order to be eligible for "mentoring leave", an employee must:
1.	Have a permanent appointment;
2.	Have successfully completed their initial probationary period; and
3.	Have committed to mentor a child or youth through a mentoring organization that meets the quality assurance standards in accordance with the California Mentor Program Directory, under the guidance of the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, for a minimum of one school year. (Most programs are aligned with the child's normal school year, however, there may be some that are less or more. Department management may make exceptions to the one school year commitment based on the mentor program that is selected.)
F.	An employee is not eligible to receive “mentoring leave” if:
1.	He or she is assigned to a “post” position in the Departments of Corrections or Youth Authority; or
2.	He or she works in a level of care position in the Departments of Developmental Services, Mental Health, Education or Veterans’ Affairs.
G.	Permanent part-time and Permanent Intermittent employees may receive a pro-rated amount of mentoring leave based upon their time base. For example, a half time employee is eligible for twenty (20) hours of mentoring leave per calendar year, whereas an intermittent employee must work a qualifying monthly pay period (equivalent to 160 hours) to earn 3.3 hours of mentoring leave.
H.	Any appeals and/or disputes regarding this section shall be handled in accordance with the Complaint procedure specified in Article 6 of this Contract.
8.18	Work and Family Participation
A.	Family Activity
Subject to operational needs and reasonable notice to the employer, employees shall be permitted to use accrued leave credits (vacation, annual leave, personal holiday, holiday credits, CTO) for the purpose of attending school or non-school family-related activities such as sports events, recitals, 4-H, etc., in which the employee’s child is participating.
However, use of such leave shall not diminish an employee’s entitlement under the Family School Partnership Act (Labor Code Section 230.8) to, upon reasonable notice to the employer, use up to eight (8) hours per month but not to exceed forty (40) hours per calendar year of accrued leave credits (vacation, annual leave, personal holiday, holiday credits, CTO) for the purpose of attending school or preschool related activities in which the employee’s child is participating.
Family is defined as the employee’s son, daughter, or any child the employee stands in loco parentis (to the child).
Employee leave requests for family activities shall be in accordance with the appropriate departmental procedures.
46
BU 20
03-05
B.	Family Crisis
Subject to operational needs, and upon reasonable notice to the employee’s immediate supervisor, employees shall be eligible to use accumulated leave credits for the purpose of dealing with family crisis situations (e.g., divorce counseling, family or parenting conflict management, family care urgent matters and/or emergencies). If the employee has exhausted available leave credits, the employee may request unpaid leave.
Family is defined as the parent, stepparent, spouse, domestic partner (as defined in accordance with Family Code Section 297), child, grandchild, grandparent, brother, sister, stepchild, or any person residing in the immediate household.
If eligible, any family crisis leave that meets the definition of serious health condition will run concurrently with Section 8.16 of this Contract, Family and Medical Leave Act.
The State shall consider requests from employees to adjust work hours or schedules or consider other flexible arrangements consistent with a department’s operational needs and the provisions of this Contract.
Employee requests related to family crisis or domestic violence shall be in accordance with departmental procedures and, except in emergencies, shall be made with reasonable notice to the employee’s immediate supervisor.
The State shall maintain the confidentiality of any employee requesting accommodation under this section, but may require substantiation to support the employee’s request.
8.19.20 Annual Leave Program
A.	Employees may elect to enroll in the annual leave program to receive annual leave credit in lieu of vacation and sick leave credits. Employees enrolled in the annual leave program may elect to enroll in the vacation and sick leave program at any time except that once an employee elects to enroll in either the annual leave program or vacation and sick leave program, the employee may not elect to enroll in the other program until twenty four (24) months has elapsed from date of enrollment.
B.	Each full-time employee shall receive credit for annual leave in lieu of the vacation and sick leave credits of this agreement in accordance with the following schedule:
1 month to 3 years	11 hours per month

All provisions necessary for the administration of this Section shall be provided by DPA rule or memorandum of understanding.
C.	A full-time employee who has eleven (11) or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall earn annual leave credits as set forth in DPA Rules 599.608 and 599.609.
Absences from State service resulting from a temporary or permanent separation for more than eleven (11) consecutive days which fall into two (2) consecutive qualifying pay periods shall disqualify the second pay period.
D.	Employees who work in multiple positions may participate in annual leave, provided an election is made while employed in an eligible position subject to these provisions. Annual leave accrual for employees in multiple positions will be computed by combining all positions, as in vacation leave, provided the result does not exceed the amount earnable in full-time employment, and the rate of accrual shall be determined by the schedule which applies to the position or collective bargaining status under which the election was made.
E.	If an employee does not use all of the annual leave that the employee has accrued in a calendar year, the employee may carry over his/her accrued annual leave credits to the following calendar year to a maximum of six hundred forty (640) hours. A department head or designee may permit an employee to carry over more than six hundred forty (640) hours of accrued hours because the employee: (1) was required to work as a result of fire, flood, or other extensive emergency; (2) was assigned work of a priority or critical nature over an extended period of time; (3) was absent on full salary for compensable injury; (4) was prevented by department regulations from taking annual leave until December 31 because of sick leave; or (5) was on jury duty.
F.	Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for accrued annual leave credits for all accrued annual leave time.
G.	The time when annual leave shall be taken by the employee shall be determined by the department head or designee. If on January 1 of each year an employee’s annual leave bank exceeds the cap in Subsection E., the department may order the employee to take annual leave.
H.	Annual leave request must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on this subject. However, when two (2) or more employees on the same shift (if applicable) in a work unit (as defined by each department head or designee) request the same annual leave time and approval cannot be given to all employees requesting it, employees shall be granted their preferred annual leave period in order of State seniority.
I.	Each department head or designee will make every effort to act on annual leave requests in a timely manner.
J.	Annual leave that is used for purposes of sick leave is subject to the requirements set forth in section 8.2, Sick Leave, of this Agreement.

B.	Salary ranges and rates shall be changed to reflect the July 1, 2003 general salary increase; however, each full-time employee shall continue to work his/her assigned work schedule and shall have a reduction in pay equal to 5%. In exchange 8 hours of leave will be credited to the employee's Personal Leave Program monthly.
C.	Personal leave shall be requested and used by the employee in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Requests to use personal leave must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on vacation and annual leave. Personal leave shall not be included in the calculation of vacation/annual leave balances pursuant to Article 8 (Leaves) and Sections 8.1 (Vacation Leave) and 8.19, (Annual Leave).

BU 20
03-05
D.	At the discretion of the State, all or a portion of unused personal leave credits may be cashed out at the employee's salary rate at the time the personal leave payment is made. It is understood by both parties that the application of this cash out provision may differ from department to department and from employee to employee. Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for unused personal leave credits in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Cash out or lump sum payment for any Personal Leave credits shall not be considered as "compensation" for purposes of retirement. If funds become available, as determined by the Department of Finance, for the Personal Leave Program, departments will offer employees the opportunity to cash out accrued personal leave. Upon retirement/separation, the cash value of the employee’s personal leave balance may be transferred into a State of California, Department of Personnel Administration Deferred Compensation Program as permitted by federal and state law.
E.	An employee may not use any kind of paid leave such as sick leave, vacation, or holiday time to avoid a reduction in pay resulting from the Personal Leave Program.

G.	The Personal Leave Program shall not cause a break in State service, a reduction in the employee's accumulation of service credit for the purposes of seniority and retirement, leave accumulation, or a merit salary adjustment.
H.	The Personal Leave Program shall neither affect the employee's final compensation used in calculating State retirement benefits nor reduce the level of State death or disability benefits the employee would otherwise receive or be entitled to receive nor shall it affect the employee's ability to supplement those benefits with paid leave.
I.	Part-time employees shall be subject to the same conditions as stated above, on a prorated basis.
J.	The Personal Leave Program for intermittent employees shall be prorated based upon the number of hours worked in the monthly pay period.
K.	The Personal Leave Program shall be administered consistent with the existing payroll system and the policies and practices of the State Controller's Office.

For the a.m. and p.m. shifts, the calendar shall clearly indicate by unit/work location (as defined by the program management) and shift, the number of LOC employees that maybe on vacation on each day of the upcoming year. For the NOC shift, the calendar shall indicate by program, the number of employees that may be on vacation on each day of the upcoming year. The posted vacation time shall be sufficient to permit all employees on each shift to have a vacation sometime during the year. Non-Client residential programs are exempt from coverage but will be governed by terms and conditions provided under the expired Collective Bargaining Agreement.
B.	During the period of October 1 to October 31, all employees, without regard to Bargaining Unit classification or seniority, may sign up for no more than two vacation periods for the upcoming calendar year. Each vacation period shall be for consecutive days. The vacation periods combined shall not exceed thirty-two days of vacation days scheduled off during the vacation year, and any one vacation period shall not exceed twenty-four vacation days scheduled off.

C.	Beginning November 1 and ending the close of November 30, those employees with overlapping vacation requests that would result in exceeding the authorized vacation posting shall be notified. These employees will be given the opportunity to modify their vacation choices through discussion and compromise among the affected employees. Where these discussions do not result in compromise and agreement among the affected employees, the most senior employee’s vacation request shall prevail if the employees are in the same bargaining unit. Conflicts between employees of different bargaining units shall be resolved by lot (coin toss). If an employee does not obtain his/her bid vacation, he/she will be provided the same duration of time off as bidded, as determined by management, or the employee may bid on the remaining unbid vacation time.
D.	On December 7, program management shall post the vacation calendar for the upcoming vacation year.
E.	Program management shall post an ad hoc calendar on a quarterly basis for the purpose of identifying potential time slots.
The calendar shall be posted on or about December 20 for the January/March quarter and by the 20th day of the last month of each quarter thereafter.
1.	Program management shall maintain full and unabridged discretion to determine the time slot(s) subject to cancellation for operational needs.
2.	The ad hoc calendar shall be obtained on a first-come, first-served basis without regard to what type of employee time accrual is used to request the time slot(s) off.
F.	When an employee cancels a vacation period, the State shall make a reasonable effort to make all or part of the time available on the ad hoc calendar.
G.	A reasonable effort shall be made to honor vacation time when an employee transfers to another position within the facility. If it cannot be honored, the employee will be guaranteed the equivalent time off at another time, as determined by management.
H.	Nothing in this agreement shall prevent program management from granting additional time in excess of the ad hoc calendar.
I.	If an ad hoc time slot is available, an employee who elects to use a personal holiday, it shall be granted if the request is made at least five (5) calendar days in advance.
J.	The above vacation scheduling procedure supersedes the “DDS Vacation Scheduling” method and nullifies all other prior understandings over intent or application of vacation scheduling and ad hoc time off unless explicitly incorporated into this provision.

That same year pool shall be utilized to pay those who have incurred eligible health care expenses in excess of the $1500, but again according to the procedures and limitations in the statute. The monies in the same year pool would be distributed at the end, or even soon after, each fiscal year to that group of employees who had expenses in excess of $1500 in the relevant fiscal year.

A. Notwithstanding Government Code Section 22777, the State employer shall, upon the death of an employee while in State service, continue to pay employer contributions for health, dental, and vision benefits for a period not to exceed 120 days beginning in the month of the employee’s death.

An employee is not eligible for a second disability benefit due to the same or related cause or condition unless they have returned to their regular time base, and work for at least ten (10) consecutive workdays. Paid leave shall not be used to cover the ten (10) workdays.
C.	The employee shall serve a ten (10) consecutive calendar day waiting period before NDI payments commence for each disability. Accrued vacation or sick leave balances may be used to cover this waiting period. The waiting period may be waived when the employee is a registered bed patient in a hospital or nursing home, or receives treatment in a hospital or surgical unit or licensed surgical clinic. Procedure rooms and doctor's offices are not included.
D.	If the employee elects to use vacation, annual leave, personal leave, or sick leave credits prior to receiving NDI payments, he/she is not required to exhaust the accrued leave balance.
E.	Following the start of NDI payments, an employee may, at any time, switch from NDI to sick leave, vacation leave, annual leave, personal leave, or catastrophic leave but may not return to NDI until that leave is exhausted.
F.	In accordance with the State's "return to work" policy, an employee who is eligible to receive NDI benefits and who is medically certified as unable to return to full-time work during the period of his or her disability, may upon the discretion of his or her appointing power work those hours (in hour increments) which, when combined with the NDI benefit, will not exceed 100 percent (100%) of their regular "full pay". This does not qualify the employee for a new disability period under B. of this section. The appointing power may require an employee to submit to a medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the Director of the Employment Development Department for the purpose of evaluating the capacity of the employee to perform the work of his/her position.
G.	If an employee refuses to return to work in a position offered by the employer under the State's Injured State Worker Assistance Program, NDI benefits will be terminated effective the date of the offer.

BU 20

H.	Where employment is intermittent or irregular, the payments shall be determined on the basis of the proportionate part of a monthly rate established by the total hours actually employed in the eighteen (18) monthly pay periods immediately preceding the pay period in which the disability begins as compared to the regular rate for a fulltime employee in the same group or class. An employee will be eligible for NDI payments on the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of 960 hours of compensated work.
I.	All other applicable Department of Personnel Administration laws and regulations not superseded by these provisions will remain in effect.
J.	Upon approval of NDI benefits, the State may issue an employee a salary advance if the employee so requests.
K.	All appeals of a denial of an employee’s NDI benefits shall only follow the procedures in the Unemployment Insurance Code and Title 22. All disputes relating to an employee’s denial of benefits are not grievable or arbitrable. This does not change either party’s contractual rights, which are not related to the denial of an individual’s benefits.

B.	An employee working in the Departments of Developmental Services, Mental Health, or Veterans Affairs, or in the Special Schools in the Department of Education who loses the ability to work for more than twenty-two (22) workdays as the result of an injury incurred in the official performance of his/her duties may be eligible for a financial augmentation to the existing Industrial Disability Leave benefits. Such injury must have been directly and specifically caused by an assault by a resident, patient, student, client, or member.
C.	The EIDL benefits will be equivalent to the injured employee’s net take home salary on the date of occurrence of the injury. EIDL eligibility and benefits may continue for no longer than one year after the date of occurrence of injury. For the purposes of this section, “net salary” is defined as the amount of salary received after Federal income tax, State income tax, and the employee’s retirement contribution have been deducted from the employee’s gross salary. The EIDL benefit will continue to be subject to miscellaneous payroll deductions.
D.	EIDL will apply only to serious physical injuries and any complications directly related medically and attributable to the assault, as determined by the department director or designee. This benefit shall not be applied to either presumptive, stress-related disabilities, or physical disability having mental origin.

BU 20

E.	The final decision as to whether an employee is eligible for, or continues to be eligible for EIDL, shall rest with the department director or designee. The department may periodically review the employee’s condition by any means necessary to determine an employee's continued eligibility for EIDL.
F.	Other existing rules regarding the administration of IDL will be followed in the administration of EIDL.
G.	This section relating to EIDL will not be subject to the arbitration procedure of this Contract.
H.	In circumstances that deviate from paragraphs A, B, and D the Director may consider and grant EIDL on a case-by-case basis when he/she determines the injury was in fact job-related.

B.	In the event that the disability exceeds twenty-two (22) workdays, the employee will receive 66 and 2/3 percent of gross pay from the twenty-third (23rd) workday of disability until the end of the fifty-second (52nd) week of disability. No IDL or payments shall be allowed after two (2) years from the first day (i.e., date) of disability.
C.	The employee may elect to supplement payment from the twenty-third (23rd) workday with accrued leave credits including annual leave, vacation, sick leave, or compensating time off (CTO) in the amount necessary to approximate the employee's full net pay. Partial supplementation will be allowed, but fractions of less than one (1) hour will not be permitted. Once the level of supplementation is selected, it may be decreased to accommodate a declining leave balance but it may not be increased. Reductions to supplementation amounts will be made on a prospective basis only.
D.	Temporary Disability (TD) with supplementation, as provided for in Government Code Section 19863, will no longer be available to any State employee who is a member of either the PERS or STRS retirement system during the first fifty-two (52) weeks, after the first date of disability, within a two (2)-year period. Any employee who is already receiving disability payments on the effective date of this provision will be notified and given thirty (30) days to make a voluntary, but irrevocable, change to the new benefit for the remainder of his/her eligibility for IDL.
E.	If the employee remains disabled after the IDL benefit is exhausted, then the employee will be eligible to receive Temporary Disability benefits as provided for in Government Code Section 19863.
F.	In the event that an employee is determined to be "permanent and stationary" by his/her physician before the IDL benefit is exhausted, but is unable to return to work, he/she must agree to participate in a vocational rehabilitation program. Refusing to participate will result in immediate suspension of the IDL benefit.
G.	All appeals of an employee's denial of IDL benefits shall only follow the procedures in the Government Code and Title 2. All disputes relating to an employee's denial of benefits are not grievable or arbitrable. This does not change either party's contractual rights which are not related to an individual's denial of benefits.

9.19.20 Enhanced Non-Industrial Disability Insurance - Annual Leave
A.	This ENDI provision is only applicable to employees participating in the annual leave program referenced in Section 8.17.
B.	Enhanced Non-Industrial Disability Insurance (ENDI) is a program for State employees who become disabled due to nonwork-related disabilities as defined by Section 2626 of the Unemployment Insurance Code.
C.	For periods of disability commencing on or after January 1, 1989, eligible employees shall receive ENDI payments at fifty (50%) percent of their gross salary, payable monthly for a period not exceeding twenty six (26) weeks for any one (1) disability benefit period. An employee is not eligible for a second disability benefit due to the same or related cause or condition unless they have returned to their regular time base, and work for at least ten (10) consecutive work days.

At the time of an ENDI claim, an employee may elect either the fifty percent (50%) ENDI benefit rate or a supplementation level of seventy five percent (75%) or one hundred percent (100%) at gross pay. Once a claim for ENDI has been filed and the employee has determined the rate of supplementation, the supplemental rate shall be maintained throughout the disability period.
D.	The employee shall serve a seven (7) consecutive calendar day waiting period before ENDI payments commence for each disability. Accrued paid leave or CTO leave balances may be used to cover this waiting period. The waiting period may be waived when the employee is a registered bed patient in a hospital or nursing home, or receives treatment in a hospital surgical unit or licensed surgical clinic. Procedure rooms and doctors offices are not included.
E.	If the employee elects to use annual leave or sick leave credits prior to receiving ENDI payments, he/she is not required to exhaust the accrued leave balance.

This does not qualify the employee for a new disability period under C. of this article. The appointing power may require an employee to submit to a medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the Director of the Employment Development Department (EDD) for the purpose of evaluating the capacity of the employee to perform the work of his/her position.

A.	The Special Schools shall guarantee the opportunity for ten (10) months of compensation (as defined by State Personnel Board Rule 9) to permanent full-time Special Schools’ employees except when budgetary or program considerations preclude it. Budgetary and program considerations are those which are mandated by the Legislature, Governor, or Superintendent of Public Instruction. This means that these employees may be scheduled either for work, CTO, holiday credits, or paid or unpaid leave; so, that when all of these are considered in total for the year each employee at the California Schools for the Deaf and California School for the Blind receives a minimum annual compensation equivalent to approximately 1,734 hours of the employee’s regular (straight-time) rate of pay. The Special Schools may provide an annual compensation greater than 1,734 hours, subject to budgetary and program considerations. If an employee chooses not to work, the School’s obligation to provide a minimum opportunity for ten (10) months compensation shall be reduced accordingly. During recess periods, the Special Schools may utilize any combination of work, training, vacation, CTO or unpaid leave (including dock). Priority considerations will be given first to regular work assignments, second to training and third to work not associated with their normal duties. It is understood by both parties that regular work, work not associated with their normal duties, and training may not be available. Employees may request training that enhances the Special Schools program.

This vacation leave credit shall be used to offset noncompensable absences during school recess periods.

However the minimum annual compensation (1,734 hours) shall be reduced by the time utilized.
3.	Sections B. (1) and (2) shall apply to permanent part-time employees on a pro rata basis.
4.	The seventy (70) hours of vacation leave credit (and pro-rated amount for permanent part-time employees) is contingent upon an employee’s continued employment for a minimum ten (10) qualifying pay periods beginning with the employee’s first qualifying pay period of the school year. If an employee terminates employment prior to this ten (10) qualifying pay period duration and the Special School is unable to adjust the employee's vacation and/or CTO credit balances in order to reflect the proper vacation leave credit balance, the employee shall reimburse the Special School for the amount that is outstanding.

14.8	Contracting Out
A.	Purpose
The union has presented evidence that State departments are presently contracting out work appropriately done by Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees, and that said contracting results in unnecessary additional costs to the State. Thus, the purpose of this section is to guarantee that the State does not incur unnecessary, additional costs by contracting out work appropriately performed at less expense to the State by Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees, consistent with the terms of this section. In achieving this purpose the parties do not intend this section to expand the State’s ability to contract out for personal services. The parties agree that this section shall not be interpreted or applied in a manner which results in a disruption of services provided by state departments.
B.	Policy Regarding Personal Services Contracts and Cost Savings
Except in extremely unusual or urgent, time-limited circumstances, or under other circumstances where contracting out is recognized or required by law, Federal mandate, or court decisions/orders, the State must make every effort to hire, utilize and retain Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees before resorting to the use of private contractors. Contracting may also occur for reasons other than cost savings as recognized or required by law, Federal mandate, or court decisions/orders.
C.	Information Regarding Contracts To Be Let
1.	Departments will provide CSEA’s designated representative with copies of Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and Invitations for Bid (IFBs) for personal services contracts when released for publication if they call for services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications.
2.	To the extent that a department is preparing to enter into a contract (or amend a contract) and it does not require an RFP or IFB, the department shall provide CSEA’s designated representative with a copy of the Standard Form 215 (or its departmental equivalent) if and when the Form 215 is completed but no less than five (5) business days thereafter provided the contract is/will be for services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications. If the Form 215 contains confidential or proprietary information, it shall be redacted as discussed below in subsection D(2).
3.	The purpose of this subsection (C) is to provide CSEA with notice and an opportunity to present alternatives which mitigate or avoid the need for contracting out, while still satisfying the needs of the State to provide services. Directors (or their designee) shall therefore meet with CSEA for this purpose, if requested by CSEA.
112
BU 20

D.	Labor/Management Committee To Review Personal Service Contracts In Existence
1.	A State Joint labor/management committee shall be established. It shall consist of representatives of CSEA, the Department of Personnel Administration, the Department of Finance and affected departments. The first meeting of this committee shall occur no later than 10 working days from ratification of the MOU, and shall be for purposes of determining the procedures by which the committee will operate. An initial review of all currently existing contracts as requested by the committee shall be completed within six (6) months from ratification of this agreement. However, if this deadline cannot be met due to the number or complexity of existing contracts for review, the committee may mutually agree to extend this deadline.
2.	Upon request of the committee (or either party on the committee) each department shall submit copies of any or all personal services contracts that call for services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications. For each contract, departments shall provide additional documents establishing the number, scope, duration, justification, total costs of all such contracts, and payment of all overhead and administrative costs paid through each contract, provided it does not disclose confidential or proprietary information, in which case it shall be redacted as discussed below. The requested contract and related information shall be provided as soon as reasonably possible. The parties expect that this shall be provided no more than 21 calendar days following the request by the joint labor/management committee, or longer if approved by the committee. This shall include contracts that may otherwise be protected from public disclosure, if they provide for services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications. However, the State may redact those portions of protected contract(s) that are proprietary, necessary to protect the competitive nature of the bid process, and that which does not pertain to the costing of personnel services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 classes. The goal shall be to protect against disclosure of information which should remain confidential, while at the same time providing the committee with sufficient information to determine whether unnecessary, additional costs are being incurred by contracting out work found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications. Costing information provided to the committee for protected contracts shall include total personnel costs for personnel services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 classifications plus any overhead charges paid to the contractor for these services, provided such disclosure does not breach confidentiality requirements or include proprietary information.

BU 20

3.	Within 10 workdays after receipt of the personal service contracts and associated documents as provided for in paragraph D (2) above, the committee shall begin reviewing the contracts. The committee shall examine the contracts based on the purpose of this section, the terms of the contracts, all applicable laws, Federal mandates and court decisions/orders. In this regard, the committee will consider which contracts should and can be terminated immediately, which contracts will take additional time to terminate, which contracts may continue (for how long and under what conditions) and how (if necessary and cost effective) to transition contract employees or positions into civil service. All determinations shall be through express mutual agreement of the committee. Committee determinations regarding contracts let by the Department of Corrections shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in subsection F below.
4.	The committee will continue to meet as necessary to examine personal services contracts which have been let.
5.	If savings are generated by the termination of personal service contracts under this provision, it is the intent of the State to implement findings of the committee for utilization of said savings. Such findings may include:
a.	Contributing toward position reductions which would otherwise be accomplished by the layoff, salary reduction or displacement of Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees.
b.	Enabling the employment of Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees for services currently performed by contractors;
c.	Enabling of the conversion to Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 civil service employment of qualified contract employees who wish to become State employees, as otherwise permitted by law, regulations, provisions of the contracts and resolutions by the State Personnel Board.
d.	Providing timely, adequate and necessary recruitment efforts. These efforts may include focused recruitment, publicizing in professional journals, use of the media, job fairs, expedited hiring, expedited background checks, spot testing authorized by the SPB, State employee registries, and recruitment and retention incentives.
e.	Such other purposes as may be mutually agreed upon by the joint labor/management committee.
E.	Displacement Avoidance
1.	The objective of this subsection is to ensure that Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees have preference over contract employees consistent with, but not limited to the following principles.
a.	The duties at issue are consistent with the Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee’s classification;
b.	The Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee is qualified to perform the job; and, c. There is no disruption in services.
114
BU 20
03-05
2.	To avoid or mitigate Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee displacement for lack of work, the appointing power shall review all existing personal services contracts to determine if work consistent with the affected employee’s classification is being performed by a contractor. Displacement includes layoff, involuntary demotion, involuntary transfer to a new class, involuntary transfer to a new location requiring a change of residence, and time base reductions. If the joint labor/management committee that reviews personal services contracts determines that the terms and purpose of the contract permit the State to assign the work to a Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee who would otherwise be displaced, this shall be implemented consistent with the other terms of this section. The State and CSEA shall meet and confer for purposes of entering into an agreement about the means by which qualified employees are notified and provided with such assignments. This shall include developing a process that ensures that savings realized by terminating the contract and reassigning the work to a Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee to avoid displacement, are utilized to offset that employee’s moving and relocation costs, the amount of which shall be consistent with Section 12.2 Moving/Relocation of the parties’ collective bargaining agreement.
F.	Department of Corrections
1.	This section shall not be applicable to the Department of Corrections until such time as it has been approved by the Federal court special master(s). Nothing in this section shall be interpreted or applied in such a manner as to interfere with Federal court orders, the authority of the Federal court or the authority of the special masters.
2.	The Department of Corrections shall present this section to the special master(s) immediately in writing upon ratification of this agreement. The parties agree to make themselves immediately available to meet with the special master, on a schedule determined by the special master.
3.	No contract for services by the Department of Corrections shall be prohibited, modified, restricted or terminated by virtue of this memorandum of understanding or by operation of the joint labor management committee established by this memorandum of understanding without approval of the Special Masters in Madrid v. Alameida et al (as it pertains to contracts effecting Pelican Bay State Prison), and/or the Special Master in the Coleman litigation (as it pertains to contacts effecting Coleman class members), and/or counsel for the parties in the Plata litigation or the Plata court (as it pertains to contracts effecting medical care for Plata class members).
4.	If this section is not approved by the special master the parties agree to reopen negotiations for the purpose of agreeing on an alternative contracting out provision, with the goal of satisfying the concerns of the Federal court and CSEA.
G.	Relationship Between This Section And Related Statutes
The State is mindful of the constitutional and statutory obligations (e.g., Govt. Code § 19130) as it pertains to restriction on contracting out. Thus, nothing in this section is intended to interfere with pursuit of remedies for violation of these obligations as provided by law (e.g., Public Contract Code § 10337).

ARTICLE 15 - TRANSFER
15.1	Appeal of Involuntary Transfer
A.	The State shall make reasonable efforts to avoid involuntary transfers. An involuntary transfer which reasonably requires an employee to change his/her residence may be grieved under Article 6 only if the employee believes it was made for the purpose of harassing or disciplining the employee. If the appointing authority or the Department of Personnel Administration disapproves the transfer, the employee shall be returned to his or her former position; shall be paid the regular travel allowance for the period of time he/she was away from his/her original headquarters; and his/her moving costs both from and back to the original headquarters shall be paid in accordance with the Department of Personnel Administration laws and rules.
B.	An appeal of an involuntary transfer which does not reasonably require an employee to change his/her residence shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure. It shall be subject to the complaint procedure if the employee believes it was made for the purpose of harassing or disciplining the employee.

Employees, who are unwilling to accept the geographical transfer required by their current department, may pursue other options, such as but not limited to voluntary transfer, voluntary demotion, reduced work-time program, authorized partial service retirement, or voluntary retirement or resignation. Such employees who meet the Department of Personnel Administration, State Restriction of Appointments (SROA) definition, shall be considered surplus. The department head or designee shall make job opportunity bulletins and materials available to all eligible surplus employees. Eligible surplus employees shall be permitted to apply and compete for vacant positions of their current class or other classes to which he/she can transfer, pursuant to the SROA Process. Article 16 shall govern employee rights and appeals under these conditions.

15.2	Hardship Transfer
The State and the Union recognize the importance of hardship transfers as a way of dealing with Work and Family issues. An employee experiencing a verifiable hardship, e.g., domestic violence, mandatory job transfer of a spouse or domestic partner as defined in Family Code Section 297, family illness, serious health condition, injury or death of family members, may request a transfer to another geographic area to mitigate the hardship.
The State shall endeavor to reassign the employee to a comparable or lesser (if comparable is not available) position in the requested geographic area. If the employee accepts a position in a lower paid classification, the State shall endeavor to reinstate the employee to their former classification and comparable salary level.
Transfers under this section shall be considered voluntary and any associated relocation costs shall be subject to the applicable Department of Personnel Administration laws and rules.
A department shall provide in writing the reason(s) for the inability to grant the transfer.
This section is not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of this Contract.
15.3.20 Post and Bid Procedure for Vacant LVN Positions
Post and Bid shall apply to the Licensed Vocational Nurse (LVN) Classification at facilities (1) with 15 or more LVN positions and (2) which either provide services seven (7) days a week or for which management has established multiple starting times. Only permanent full-time employees are eligible to participate in the post and bid process.
A.	Vacant Positions
As management determines that positions become available, or vacant, they shall first be reviewed by the State to determine whether they shall be posted or filled without posting.
If the State determines to fill the position without posting, the position may be filled by hire, transfer, promotion, or any other method allowed by the Civil Service System. Such positions may be advertised where appropriate, but will be filled through the sole discretion of the State. As positions become vacant and determinations are made by the State, the excess of non-posted positions over posted positions shall not exceed two (2) at any facility at any time. In no case shall more than sixty percent (60%) of the filled positions in a facility be held by employees through successful bids.
The post and bid process is designed as a method to advertise and fill current position vacancies with existing employees. The filling of vacancies by either promotion from an eligible list or external lateral transfers is not subject to the post and bid procedure.
B.	Posted Positions
Those positions which are determined to be posted shall be posted in a prominent place where such notices are customarily posted on each unit and, in addition, may
118
BU 20
03-05
be advertised in each facilities publication. The posted notice shall be on a form designed for that purpose and shall include the following posting criteria:
1.	Identification posting number
2.	Level of position
3.	Program and unit (or ward) or other assignment
4.	Shift

7.	Deadline for bid submittal
8.	Indication of an "incentive bid position"
9.	Location where bid is to be submitted
Each notice shall remain posted for no less than seven (7) calendar days.
C.	Bidding
Employees may bid on the posted position by filling out a bid form provided by the State. Bid forms shall be submitted in triplicate with the employee submitting the original to the appropriate central office, a copy to the union, and the employee retaining a copy. Bid forms shall include the identification posting number, the employee's name, classification, seniority points, current work location and business telephone number. The form must be dated and signed by the employee to indicate certification that the worksite has been visited.
Posted positions shall be available for bid only to those employees in the civil service classification specified on the posted notice.
D.	Assignment
Within fifteen (15) calendar days after the posting of notice of vacancy, the position shall be assigned to the eligible bidding employee with the most seniority. However, in emergencies or where severe staffing shortages exist in the employee's incumbent program, assignment may be delayed up to sixty (60) calendar days after the posting of notice. If no bids are received, management shall withdraw the bid notice. The withdrawn notice does not count against either party's ratios or 60/40 position count. These positions may be filled:
1.	In accordance with Subsection A. above, or
2.	Hire, promotion, reinstatement, transfer from within the facility or from another State agency.
If that position is filled or committed within sixty (60) days of withdrawal of posting under (2) above, it shall not count in the 50/50 posting ratios.

E.	Incentive Bid Position
A vacant position that is posted two (2) consecutive times and remains unbid may be identified as an "incentive position" on the third consecutive posting. In a program identified as a "designated program" an unbid position may be identified as an incentive position on the second consecutive posting.
An employee who successfully bids an incentive position and remains in the position for one (1) year shall be accorded super-seniority for their next successful bid. When two (2) or more employees with super-seniority bid, the position shall be awarded as follows:
1.	Length of super-seniority
2.	Seniority
3.	By lot
Incentive positions that are not bid upon may be filled through internal transfer from within the hospital without counting in the posting ratios or position counts. He/she is then eligible to receive super-seniority in the same manner as an employee who bid the position. Employees who successfully bid an incentive position and are bidding in-place (same unit and shift as the posted position) shall not be eligible to earn the super-seniority. In "designated programs" the super-seniority eligibility shall be limited to positions awarded to employees from outside the program only.
The facility shall provide the union with a weekly listing of "designated programs."
An employee in an incentive position that is deleted or altered in accordance with subsection E. shall retain the eligibility to earn super-seniority if he/she elects to remain in the altered or changed position. Employee absences due to illness or injury shall not be counted after the fourteenth (14th) consecutive calendar day toward the one (1) year qualifying period to earn super-seniority.
F.	Deletions and Changes
If a bid position is deleted due to reduced allocations or for other reasons, then the employee in that position may bid on any vacant posted position.
If, because of coverage or other legitimate operational need, it is determined that a bid position's posting criteria must be altered in any respect, the employee filling that position shall be notified of the proposed changes and the reason for such change in writing. If the employee desires to remain in the altered position, he/she shall notify management of that desire within five (5) calendar days and shall remain in the position. A position shall not be considered to be altered when training is conducted on a shift other than the employee's regularly scheduled shift and the employee is required to attend.
G.	Floating
If it becomes necessary to float employees to provide coverage, each work location (unit and shift) shall establish a rotational system that distributes floating on an equitable basis.

I.	Denial of Bid
Employees who have adverse actions taken against them shall lose their right to hold a bid position and/or to bid on any positions for a period of up to six (6) months if such position or bid is meaningfully related to the cause of action. If, on appeal, the employee is exonerated, his/her right to bid and/or hold positions shall be restored. Employees who are charged with wrongdoing, which is also grounds for adverse action, may lose their right to bid and/or hold a bid position for a period of up to six (6) months, if such position or bid is meaningfully related to the cause of action. A hearing before the facilities chief or designee is required prior to such denial.
Employees who receive yearly evaluations which have two (2) or more categories marked below standard may lose their right to hold and/or bid positions for up to six (6) months, subject to review in three (3) months. If the evaluation is overturned by a reviewing officer or as a result of a grievance decision, the employee shall have his/her right to bid and hold positions restored.
Employees losing their right to bid or hold positions as outlined above may be administratively transferred at the discretion of the State. Employees who have been absolved of wrongdoing as stated above, shall be accorded super-seniority for one (1) successful bid so long as this bid is exercised within three (3) months of the decision absolving the employee.
J.	Limits on Bid
An employee may not make more than one (1) successful bid each twelve (12) months except that if an employee's bid position is altered and the employee elects not to stay in the position, or if an employee is granted a bid under the provisions in Subsection J. above, these bids shall not be counted under this Subsection.
Exceptions to this limitation may be granted. Employees on probationary status shall not be eligible to bid on posted positions.
Management may deny a bid which is submitted by an employee who is on limited duty status if it is determined that the duties of the posted position are in conflict with the work limitation(s) described by his/her physician. Upon request of the employee, a meeting will be held with the Executive Director or designee prior to the final decision regarding the employee’s ability to bid.
K.	Nepotism
No bid shall be denied based solely on personal relationships. An employee may lose his/her right to hold and/or bid a position based on the Department's nepotism policy in accordance with the following:
1.	If such bid or position creates a nepotistic situation, notice must be given to the Union.
2.	Representatives of the Union and the State shall meet and review the situation.

15.5.20	Employee Opportunity Transfer
A.	The parties recognize that when the State deems it necessary to fill a vacant position, the needs of the State must be given first priority. The needs of the State include the right to fill vacant positions using existing eligible or promotional lists, involuntary transfers, reassignments, or other selection methods for reasons such as affirmative action, special skills, abilities or aptitudes.
B.	The parties also recognize the desirability of permitting a permanent employee to transfer within his/her department and classification to another location which the employee deems to be desirable. To this end, permanent full-time employees may apply for an Employee Opportunity Transfer to a position at another location within his/her department in accordance with the following procedure:
1.	Employees desiring an Employee Opportunity Transfer shall apply in writing to his/her department head or designee in a manner prescribed by the department. Such transfer requests shall be to permanent positions in the same department within his/her current classification.

Whenever a department head or designee elects to fill a vacancy through an Employee Opportunity Transfer, a permanent employee who already has an Employee Opportunity Transfer application to that location on file with the department shall be selected. If there is more than one (1) employee with an Employee Opportunity Transfer application to the same location on file, one (1) of the top three (3) employees with the greatest amount of department service by class shall be selected. When an employee is formally interviewed, the department head or designee will notify the employee of the non-selection.
D.	Permanent employees who wish to submit Employee Opportunity Transfer applications may do so during a thirty (30) calendar day open period, to be scheduled once every six (6) months by each department. No employee shall submit more than four (4) Employee Opportunity Transfer applications during an open period.
ARTICLE 16	- LAYOFF
16.1	Layoff and Reemployment
A.	Application. Whenever it is necessary because of a lack of work or funds, or whenever it is advisable in the interest of economy to reduce the number of permanent and/or probationary employees (hereinafter known as "Employees") in any State agency, the State may lay off employees pursuant to this section.
B.	Order of Layoff. Employees shall be laid off in order of seniority pursuant to Government Code Sections 19997.2 through 19997.7 and applicable State Personnel Board and Department of Personnel Administration rules.
C.	Notice. Employees compensated on a monthly basis shall be notified thirty (30) calendar days in advance of the effective date of layoff.

Both parties agree and understand that a different type of overtime payment (cash or CTO) may be provided to employees at different times and may even be different for employees in the same or similar situations. However, in the event that the Department of Industrial Relations determines that this provision is inconsistent with Labor Code Section 204.3, the parties agree to immediately meet and confer regarding the impact of that determination.

Employees shall receive this special allowance equivalent to the employee’s regular hourly rate on a straight time, hour for hour basis, in cash or CTO, at the discretion of the department head or designee. This is not overtime compensation and shall not be considered as time worked for calculation of overtime. This paragraph also applies to passengers in carpools, vans or other vehicles, traveling on state business. This paragraph does not apply to employees who voluntarily choose to travel outside their normal work hours.
3.	FLSA covered drivers of a carpool, a vanpool, or other vehicle traveling on state business will be compensated consistent with FLSA for purposes of overtime and shall not receive the special allowance described in I(2) above.

ADDENDUM I
Time off for Victims of Domestic Violence
State of California
M E M O R A N D U M
DATE: June 20, 2001
TO:	PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT LIAISONS	REFERENCE CODE: 2001-025
THIS MEMORANDUM SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO:
Employee Relations Officers Personnel Officers
FROM:	Department of Personnel Administration
Policy Development Office
SUBJECT:	Time Off for Victims of Domestic Violence
CONTACT:	Charlotte Gehringer, Personnel Management Analyst

Email: CharlotteGehringer@dpa.ca.gov
The purpose of this memo is to notify departments of an addition to existing law regarding time off for an employee who is a victim of domestic violence.
Effective January 1, 2001, Assembly Bill 2357 added Section 230.1 to the Labor Code to specify that employers with 25 or more employees may not discharge or in any manner discriminate or retaliate against an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, as defined in Section 6211 of the Family Code, for taking time off to seek medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, obtain psychological counseling related to an experience of domestic violence, obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program, or rape crisis center, or to participate in safety planning to increase safety from future domestic violence.
As a condition for taking time off, the employee shall give the employer reasonable advance notice of the employee’s intention to take time off for any of the purposes summarized above, unless advance notice is not feasible. When an unscheduled absence occurs, the employer may require the employee to certify that the absence is a result of domestic violence in the form of a police report, a court order, or medical documentation. An employer would be required to maintain the confidentiality of any employee’s request for time off pursuant to provision of this law.

The law does not require an employer to compensate an employee for the time taken off under these circumstances, but the employee may use vacation, personal leave, or other compensating time off that is otherwise available to the employee.
An employee whose rights are violated under this section may be entitled to lost wages and reinstatement. An employer who willfully refuses to reinstate an employee under this section may be guilty of a misdemeanor. This law also allows an employee to file a complaint with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement of the Department of Industrial Relations.
This section does not create a right for an employee to take unpaid leave that exceeds the unpaid leave time allowed under, or in addition to the unpaid leave time permitted by, the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
The provisions of this bill apply to the State as an employer and to State employees. The entitlement of any employee under this law shall not be diminished by a collective bargaining agreement.
If you have any questions, please contact Charlotte Gehringer at (916) 323-6938.
