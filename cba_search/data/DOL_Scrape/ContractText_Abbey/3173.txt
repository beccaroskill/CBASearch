PROCEDURES
INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE RIGHTS
Citizenship Rights and Equal Employment Practices
Employees shall be entitled to full rights of citizenship. There shall be no disciplinary action or other discrimination against any employee on the grounds of race, age, creed, religion, sex, national origin, ethnic identity, marital status, handicapping condition, or any other characteristic or political activity that is not directly related to job performance. This extends to recruitment, selection, wages, benefits, tenure, promotions, training programs, use of district facilities, terminations, layoffs, recalls, and all other terms, conditions and privileges of employment.
Practices Prohibited
The following employment practices are prohibited:
1.	Administration of any test or other criteria which has a disproportionately adverse effect on persons, unless it is a valid predictor of job success;
2.	Recruitment of employees from entities which furnish as applicants only or predominantly members of one group, if such action has the effect of discriminating on the basis of that group;
3.	Establishment of rates of pay which discriminate;
4.	Classification of jobs as being for males or females or other discriminatory notations;
5.	Provision of fringe benefits on any discriminatory basis;
6.	Any action based on marital or parental status. Pregnancies are considered temporary disabilities for all job-related purposes and shall be accorded the same treatment by the district as are all other temporary disabilities. No inquiries shall be made by the district in job applications as to the marriage status of an applicant. Inquiry may be made as to sex of a job applicant for employment if it is made of all applicants and is not a basis for discrimination;
7.	Any expression of preference, limitation, or specification, unless it is a bona fide occupational qualification for the particular job in question, shall be prohibited in employment advertising.
DUE PROCESS FOR EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE
Discipline Without lust Cause Prohibited
The Employee Conduct/Discipline Handbook shall ensure appropriate due process procedures for employee conduct and discipline.
EMPLOYEE FILES
A.	The district shall maintain one official personnel file for each employee. Such file shall exist in the Employee Relations Office.
All materials placed in the employee's file and originating within the district shall be available to the employee for review upon request in the presence of the person(s) responsible for keeping the files, except as provided below:
All references and information originating outside the district on the basis of confidentiality, and references and information obtained within the district in the process of recommending the
07/02
Proc. 1-1
employee for employment or change in position shall not be available for inspection by the employee.
Material originating within the district and which is derogatory to an employee's conduct, service, character or personality shall not be placed in an employee's file unless the employee has had an opportunity to read the material. The employee shall acknowledge that s/he has read such material by affixing his/her signature on the actual copy to be filed. The signature does not necessarily indicate agreement with the content of the material.
The employee shall have the right to answer any materials filed. His/her answer shall be submitted to the principal/supervisor and forwarded to the superintendent or designee, who shall attach it to all file copies.
The employee shall have the right to submit material for his/her file. This material shall be submitted to the principal/administrator/supervisor and forwarded to the superintendent or designee, who shall place all relevant material in the employee's file. Submitted material not placed in his/her file shall be returned to the employee.
B.	An employee may be accompanied by an association representative during a file review.
C.	The contents of the employee's personnel file are strictly confidential and shall not be released to any person or agency without written consent of the employee except as provided in Arizona statutes. In addition, copies of the assessment and evaluation of an employee are confidential and shall not be released or shown to any person except as permitted by statute, required by court order, or by administrators reviewing files.
D.	Documents may be duplicated and stored in a working file in the office of the Principal/Supervisor. The contents of the working file will be available for employee review under the same conditions as previously listed. Any documents unsigned by the teacher shall be removed upon the teacher's request.
ACADEMIC FREEDOM
Academic freedom shall be guaranteed to employees in order to create in the classroom an atmosphere of freedom which permits students to raise questions dealing with critical issues of the time and which maintains an atmosphere conducive of study, investigation, presentation and interpretation of facts which stress the interplay of ideas.
A.	The teacher has the right to express his/her point of view provided the students understand that it is his/her opinion and not to be accepted by them as an authoritative statement. The teacher is responsible for exercising judgment in selecting for objective analysis those relevant issues which contribute to the maturity and understanding of the students involved.
B.	Therefore, each teacher:
1.	Has the freedom to select materials which are supportive of stated instructional objectives and
2.	Has the responsibility of meeting the needs of students within prevailing district, community and state standards.
EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE
In the case of an assault upon an employee or a complaint or suit by third parties as a result of action taken by the employee while performing his/her duties, the district shall render all reasonable assistance to the employee in connection with the handling of the incident by law enforcement and judicial authorities.
Proc 1-2
07/02
In the event of a physical injury to an employee as the result of student conflict, intentional or unintentional, or injury to an employee as a result of intentional acts by third parties arising from an action taken by the employee while performing his/her duties, the District shall:
A.	Provide seven consecutive work days of leave (not to be charged against sick leave) with doctor’s verification.
B.	Exclude mental illness and stress from this policy.
C.	If more than seven days is required, a committee will be convened to determine the length of allowable leave on a case by case basis. In the interim, employee shall use his/her leave days which may be reimbursed pending the committee’s decision. The committee will be comprised of the following:
1.	Two doctors or their reports (District at district’s expense; employee at employee’s expense)
2.	President of whichever employee group involved
3.	Campus representative
4.	Employee’s supervisor
5.	Appropriate administrative director
6.	Employee Benefits Specialist
Committee should not discriminate based on whether employee has short term disability or sick leave accrued.
The maximum leave days allowed under this policy will be 90 days. The committee’s decision is advisory to the Superintendent who makes the final decision as to the length of the approved leave. The decision of the Superintendent is not grievable or appealable. Any procedural violation of this Operational Procedure is grievable.
MEMBERSHIP IN PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
An employee shall have the right to decide whether or not to join any particular professional organization without coercion from any administrator or fellow employee. No employee shall be discriminated against by reason of his/her membership in any representative group, or participation in any grievance or other proceedings with respect to any conditions of employment.
EMPLOYEE PRIVACY RIGHTS
Employee Lists
List of employee names and addresses will not be released.
SPECIAL STUDENT PROBLEMS
Student Discipline
A.	Whenever it appears, in the teacher’s opinion, that a particular student is a continuing disruptive influence in a class, and the student requires professional attention, other than that provided by his/her classroom teachers and counselors, the principal/designee will take reasonable steps to arrange for appropriate assistance which may include removal from the class.
B.	If the continued presence of a student in class is unacceptable to the teacher, the student shall be excluded from the class for the remainder of the period with the appropriate transmittal slip to the designated administrator. The teacher shall furnish the designated administrator with the full particulars of the incident as promptly as his/her teaching obligation will permit.
C.	Each referral to the designated administrator shall be in writing. This information shall be furnished on a District form with a copy to be retained by the teacher and a copy to be returned to the teacher indicating the action taken. The designated administrator may request a conference with the teacher.
07/02
Proc. 1-3
D.	A teacher shall be provided with the opportunity to be included in conferences between parents and the administration when the conferences pertain to the teacher’s relationship with one of his/her students.
E.	If the teacher has not received a response within three work days after the submission of the referral, the teacher shall contact the appropriate designated administrator concerning the status of the referral.
F.	If, after another three workdays following this contact, the teacher has not received a response to his/her referral and/or inquiry, the teacher may file a complaint with the Campus Committee.
G.	After a first and/or second referral, a conference with the teacher, the parent and the designated administrator may be held. After a third or subsequent referral by the same teacher during a semester, the class from which the referral came may be closed. A conference involving the teacher, the parent, and the designated administrator must be held immediately. A decision shall be made as to the action to be taken promptly after the conference and all parties shall be notified. Prior to the third referral, if circumstances warrant, the designated administrator may close the class from which the referral came.
H.	If a parent requests the teacher to be present at a conference, the teacher must attend, but may request the department chairperson to be present. The conference shall be arranged at a mutually convenient time. Once a teacher has fulfilled his/her responsibility to appear to give direct testimony at a conference requested by a parent, his/her written deposition may suffice in lieu of his/her presence at subsequent conferences relating to the same subject at the option of the principal.
Student Attendance
Attendance procedures at each campus shall be implemented and communicated to the staff at the start of each school year. These procedures shall be subject to staff and parent review at the close of each school year. After the yearly review, the procedures will be sent to the office of the Administrative Assistant to the Superintendent and the CTA President for their review.
It is not the intent of this proposal to allow grievance of the content of the procedure unless it violates the Professional Agreement.
Physical and Psychological Problems
A teacher shall be informed when a student is assigned to his/her class whose history of serious behavior deviation, psychological or physical problems indicate that s/he should be given special attention.
GRIEVANCES
Definition of Grievance
A “grievance” shall mean a complaint by a teacher, or teachers, that there has been a violation, a misinterpretation, or inequitable application of any of the provisions of the Professional Agreement.
Definition of an Aggrieved Person
An “aggrieved person” is a teacher or group of teachers asserting a grievance.
Definition of an Aggrieved Person
A “party of interest” is an employee who might be required to take action or against whom action might be taken in order to resolve a grievance.
Purpose
The purpose of a grievance procedure is to obtain, at the nearest administrative level, equitable solutions to the problems which may from time to time arise. The Governing Board, administration, and CTA agree that these proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure.
Proc 1-4
07/02
Informal Discussion
Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any teacher having a grievance to discuss the matter informally with any appropriate member of the administration and having the grievance adjusted, provided the adjustment is consistent with the educational policies.
Reprisal Prohibited
Reprisals shall not be taken against any teacher, any party of interest, any CTA representative or any other participant in the grievance procedure by reason of such participation.
Acting Superintendent
In the absence of the Superintendent, the administrator designated as Acting Superintendent may act in place of the Superintendent.
Time Limits
A.	Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the number of days indicated at each level should be considered as a maximum. If, at Level One, the time limits are not met by the Administration, the grievance will automatically move on to the next level. The time limits specified may be extended by mutual agreement.
B.	If a grievance is filed which might not be finally resolved at Level Three under the time limits set forth herein prior to the end of the school year, and which if left unresolved until the beginning of the following school year could result in irreparable harm to a party or parties of interest, the time limits set forth herein shall be reduced so that the Grievance Procedure may be concluded prior to tiie end of the school year.
Grievance Procedures
Informal Procedure
A.	If a teacher feels that s/he has a grievance, s/he shall first make an effort to resolve the problem informally by discussing the matter with the principal or the educational unit supervisor.
B.	In this informal procedure, the teacher may 1) discuss the alleged grievance personally, or 2) request a CTA representative to accompany him/her and request that the CTA act on the teacher’s behalf.
Formal Procedure
Level One - School Principal
A.	If an aggrieved person is not satisfied with the outcome of the informal procedure and if s/he wishes to continue processing the grievance, s/he shall present his/her alleged grievance formally in writing to the principal or educational unit supervisor.
B.	The aggrieved person or the principal or the educational unit supervisor may request a conference prior to the rendering of the written decision. The teacher may 1) discuss the alleged grievance personally, or 2) request that a CTA representative act on the teacher’s behalf.
C.	The principal or educational unit supervisor, within five (5) days after receipt of the alleged grievance or after the personal conference, shall render a written decision to the aggrieved person with a copy to the appropriate representative of the CTA, unless the teacher submits a personally written request to the principal or supervisor and the unit PR&R representative that the decision not be sent to the CTA representative.
Level Two- Superintendent/Designee
A.	If an aggrieved person is not satisfied with the decision concerning the alleged grievance at Level One, s/he may, within five (5) days after the decision is rendered by the principal or supervisor, file the alleged grievance with the CTA.
07/02
Proc. 1-5
B.	The CTA shall make a judgment on the merits of the alleged grievance. If the CTA decides either that the alleged grievance lacks merit or that the decision at Level One is in the best interest of the District, it shall send written notification to the teacher and the appropriate representative of the CTA. If the CTA decides that the alleged grievance has merit and the decision at Level One is not acceptable, it shall, within ten (10) days after receipt, refer such grievance in writing to the Superintendent.
C.	The Superintendent/ designee within five (5) days from the receipt of the written grievance shall schedule a meeting with the aggrieved person and the representatives of the CTA for the purpose of resolving the grievance. If the meeting does not occur within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the written grievance, the grievance shall be considered adjudicated in favor of the aggrieved person.

ASSIGNMENT OF PERSONNEL
Service or Subjects/Assignments
A.	Teachers shall be consulted by the department chairperson regarding the subjects/assignments they would prefer prior to the beginning of each semester. This consultation shall take place prior to development of or changes in department assignments before a semester begins. The department chair, the principal and another administrator selected by the principal shall develop a departmental schedule based upon consideration of the teachers’ stated preference, professional preparation, teaching experiences and staffing needs. These department assignments shall be presented at a departmental meeting where the staff, as a group, reviews it. When a change in an assignment occurs after the beginning of a semester, all concerned teachers shall be contacted prior to the change. A department meeting shall be held if time allows.
B.	Within five (5) days after the departmental meeting, any teacher who does not agree to his/her assignment shall meet with the department chair and the principal and appeal for a change in assignment. Within seventy-two (72) hours after the meeting is concluded, the principal shall send all participating parties his/her decision, which will include the rationale.
C.	If the teacher is still not satisfied with the assignment, the teacher shall have the right of appeal directly to the Superintendent’s designee, who will call a meeting involving the teacher, a representative from the CTA (if the teacher chooses), and the principal. The meeting will be held within ten (10) workdays unless another time is mutually agreed upon.

E.	Teachers shall normally be scheduled with two preparations per semester. There may be situations in some departments where they will be assigned three preparations. The nature of the Exceptional Student Program classes is such that these limitations will not apply, although the number of preparations will be limited as much as the program permits.
07/97
Proc. 3-1
F.	Any teacher may request to have more than three preparations. The request shall be made, in writing, to the department chair, who (after reviewing the matter with the department members) will make a recommendation to the principal, who will make the decision. AH such requests shall be reviewed by the Campus Committee.
G.	Teachers shall be assigned no more than two preparations and no more than two classrooms during their first year in the district, except for unusual circumstances. A teacher may choose to have more than three preparations if the only other option is a reduction in teaching periods for the teacher.

"Family member" is defined as spouse, child, sibling, or any relative by blood or marriage in the first, second, or third degree.
J.	Extended School Operations (ESO) teaching positions shall be part of the teacher’s contract and the contract may not exceed 1.0. Positions at Extended School Operations will be filled in the same manner as other educational units, and vacancies will be posted and positions will be filled through the reassignment process.
An ESO position shall be considered an assignment on the campus where it is located so that an ESO teacher is eligible for an assignment within his/her department on that campus and assumes the rights and responsibilities of a teacher on that campus. A teacher with a regular daytime assignment shall be given an evening assignment within the department only at the request of that teacher.
K.	The Director of Certificated Personnel, after consultation with the CTA President, may declare an emergency situation when all available means of filling teaching positions with qualified teachers have been exhausted.
When an emergency situation is declared, a teacher who is currently in a 1.0 assignment may agree to teach an additional assignment during the school day per the guidelines listed below.
1.	Each member of the department at the school in need shall be notified of the emergency positions available and, with the exception of those with a release period, will be asked if s/he wants to be considered.
2.	The assignment shall be for one semester or its equivalent on a block schedule.
3.	Selection for the assignment shall be based on per period seniority of qualified applicants.
4.	A teacher is not entitled to an additional assignment of this nature more than once per year but may elect to accept another such assignment for second semester as follows.
a.	In the event this emergency situation continues second semester, the position will first be opened to all department applicants, by per period seniority, who have not had a .2 assignment first semester.
Proc. 3-2
07/02
b.	The position will next be offered to any teacher who had a .2 assignment first semester and whose class is continuing into second semester.
c.	The position will next be offered, by per period seniority, to all who had .2 assignments during first semester.
5.	A qualified applicant shall not be on remediation.
6.	A teacher accepting this assignment will be compensated at .2 or .33 of daily rate, depending on the school schedule. The compensation will be paid as requisition pay rather than with an addendum contract and will be calculated as defined below.
7.	In the event there are not enough qualified applicants from within the department to fill all open positions, those with release periods and qualified certificated staff outside the department may be considered. Final decisions will be made by the Assistant Superintendent of Instruction and Accountability.
8.	Exceptions to these procedures, due to unusual circumstance, may be made by mutual agreement between the Director of Certificated Personnel and the CTA President.
L.	The per period pay for a teaching assignment in addition to a 1.0 contract will be calculated differently than a teacher's hourly rate. Instead of hourly rate which is the teacher's daily rate of pay divided by seven, the per period pay for this assignment will be the teacher's daily rate of pay divided by five. The teacher will not accrue additional leave days nor receive additional payment for holidays or Board-declared recess days. Further, the teacher will not receive payment for the additional assignment for any day for which the teacher does not perform the work. The calculation of daily rate of pay for other purposes will not be affected by this additional compensation.
M.	The emergency situation will no longer exist when a qualified new hire is found to fill any open position which has been offered as an additional .2 assignment to another teacher. In this event, the additional .2 assignment can be withdrawn provided the teacher has received compensation for the assignment for no fewer than five days and has been given pay for no fewer than two days for supporting the students and the new hire in the transition to the new teacher.
Request for Reduced/Increased Assignment
A.	A teacher with continuing status may elect to have his/her assignment reduced to an .8 or .6 assignment or .5 Metro Tech with a commensurate reduction in salary, but will retain all other benefits and privileges of a continuing teacher, as well as proportionate leave days and professional responsibilities. Such reduction in assignment shall be for a period of no less than one semester and may be renewed annually at the teacher’s option.
B.	The teacher shall inform the principal of his/her intention to reduce and/or increase his/her assignment by October 15 for second semester and by March 1 for first semester or a full year. If unforeseen circumstances arise after the specified date, requests for reduction/increase in an assignment may be approved by the principal or educational supervisor after reviewing the circumstances involved.
C.	An Athletic Trainer position is a full-time job based on student need and Professional Agreement language which allows teachers with continuing status to request reduction to part-time does not apply to Athletic Trainers.

Definitions
Subject Area
Any teaching area which requires a state secondary teaching certificate.
Service Area
Any non-teaching area which requires a specific state certificate or license. This includes areas such as Counseling, Social Work, Library Science, Speech, Hearing, and the Campus Health Center.
Special Program Area
Any teaching area which does not require a state secondary teaching certificate. This includes those areas for which a special vocational certificate is the minimum or only requirement for employment.
Seniority
A.	In order to be vested with rights for continued employment, a teacher must have an established date of hire for seniority purposes. A seniority date is established by the first date of current fulltime continuous paid employment as a teacher when the contracted full-time employment is at least 51 percent of the total number of contractual days in the given school year. Extended contracts are not counted toward seniority.
A teacher who has never been contracted for at least 51 percent of the contractual days or who works with emergency certification only does not establish a seniority date, does not accrue seniority, and has no rights for continued employment in the district.
Approved leaves of absence do not break continuity of service.
NOTE: Full-time shall mean an assignment of .6 or more for teachers hired prior to 1980-81. Part-time employment will not count toward seniority for employees hired between the 1980-81 school year and the current school year.
B.	Prior to the 1990-91 school year, if ties in seniority occur, a teacher’s seniority shall be determined in the following order:
1.	Date of approval for hire by the Governing Board.
2.	Date that the employee signed his/her first contract for current employment.
3.	Date of the recommendation for hire as it appears on the original Personnel Action Request (PAR).
C.	Effective with the 1990-91 school year, if ties in seniority occur, a teacher’s seniority shall be determined in the following order:
1.	The date that the Personnel Action Request (PAR) is received in the Employee Relations Office.
2.	Date of approval for hire by the Governing Board.
3.	The date that the employee signed his or her first contract for current employment.
4.	Date on the teacher’s original application for employment.
Seniority Lists
A.	A list of those teachers in the District who have established a seniority date, showing each teacher’s name and the date of hire in seniority order, shall be compiled and updated each year by February 1.
B.	Seniority lists shall list each teacher by subject or service area or special program area in which s/he is currently serving or served immediately prior to assignment to the CES-TBA list.
Proc. 3-4
07/02
C.	Athletic Trainers shall be placed on their own seniority list with teacher-trainers continuing from 2001-02 being placed at the top of the list in seniority order. These teacher-trainers will also remain on the seniority list of their respective teaching areas. Following these teacher-trainers, newly hired trainers will be placed in seniority order per guidelines similar to those used for determining teacher seniority.
D.	Copies of the Seniority Lists will be available in the Employee Relations Office, in each principal’s office, and by subject area in the departmental office. A copy of the List will be sent to the CTA office.
E.	The Employee Relations Division will develop transfer, reassignment, surplus, and reduction-in-force procedures based on seniority.
F.	Before any reassignments occur, the Employee Relations Division will have posted, in the office of each school or department, a Seniority List for each department/program which includes all teachers on the Reassignment List. A copy of this List will be provided to the CTA office and will be updated with the CTA as changes are made.
G.	If a teacher is given a preliminary notice of RIF and wishes to be included on other Seniority Lists where s/he has met North Central and/or State certification or endorsement requirements, the teacher will send a declaration and documentation of such additional competency to the Employee Relations Division within 24 hours after initial notification of the pending reduction-in-force. Otherwise, the teacher’s length of service will be determined only in the subject, service, or special program area in which s/he is currently serving. Other areas of competency will be considered only if a teacher is in danger of being reduced-in-force in his/her current area.
H.	A listing of all Seniority Lists and requirements will be available in the Employee Relations Division office and in each principal’s office by February 1. A copy of this listing will be provided to the CTA office and will be updated with the CTA as changes are made. A copy of this listing will be sent to each teacher when s/he is notified of being reduced-in-force.
Surplus Teachers
Surplus Defined
Surplus is a situation which exists when there are more teachers under contract and assigned to a school/ unit than are needed according to District staffing standards as they apply to registration/ membership.
Declaration of Campus/Departments Prior to RIF/Surplus
A.	Prior to identifying those teachers who will be surplused or reduced-in-force, the principal may, with consensus of the CTA Unit Chair and any teacher directly affected, make such interdepartmental changes that will reduce the number of split assignments between campuses.
B.	Prior to identifying those teachers to be surplused or reduced-in-force, a teacher with an assignment between two or more campuses and/or departments must be considered as follows:
1.	If the teacher had agreed to take the split assignment because it minimized the number of part-time assignments or split assignments between campuses, s/he shall declare which campus and/or department(s) of those currently assigned s/he prefers and shall be assigned to that campus and department(s). If this teacher prefers to remain split between departments (not schools), s/he may declare to remain in the split assignment and will be given such assignment provided it does not create an additional split between campuses. This assignment shall not exempt the teacher from surplus or RIF.
2.	If the teacher was given a split assignment per the teacher's request and as a courtesy to the teacher, s/he shall be considered a member of the original department and may not declare otherwise.

Selection for Schedule F Assignment Other Than Coaching
Normally, Schedule F Assignments other than coaching will be made only to certificated staff at a school. If it has been determined that there is no candidate available from among the certificated personnel at that school, it is possible to utilize other District employees who are qualified.
Selection of Coaches
A. Candidates for varsity head coaching positions shall be screened and interviewed by the principal, and/ or unit Athletic Director and a parent of a participant in the affected sport; final recommendation shall be made by the principal. The recommendations of the principal will be sent to the Director of Athletics, Health and Physical Education for approval and submission to the Employee Relations Division. Only a certificated person may be hired as a varsity head coach.
|Step 1|
Positions shall be advertised to all District certified employees by the school's Athletic Director on the District's electronic mail system and left open for ten working days. The advertisement will be placed in mailboxes at the school where the vacancy exists, and all electronic postings will be printed and posted outside the campus Athletic Director's office. Applications will be accepted only from this group of candidates and only if the employee has rights to continued employment in the District. If candidates are considered equally qualified, preference will be given to the on-campus faculty member.

PUHSD Alternative Certification Program
If the district has no certified applicant who is qualified per the job description for a certified position, the district shall attempt to fill this position with a candidate who qualifies for an Arizona Alternative Certificate. In accordance with Arizona Board of Education Alternative Certification guidelines, a candidate must:
1.	Possess a Bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited institution.
2.	Have a passing score on the basic skills section of the Arizona Teachers Proficiency Examination adopted pursuant to A.R.S. 15.203.A.24.
Proc. 4-10
07/02
3.	Have a major in each subject to be taught from a regionally accredited institution or a minor in each subject area, with the minimum number of hours meeting Arizona Board of Education Requirements to be certified in that subject, and a passing score on a State Board approved exam in the subject area.
A candidate who is selected for employment by the district through the PUHSD Alternative Certification Program will be expected to complete all three phases of the program within one year. No teacher hired with an alternative certificate shall accrue seniority in the district. No alternatively certified teacher may coach, receive any other Schedule F contract, or be paid for substituting in an emergency. If the candidate selected receives guest teacher pay due to delayed timelines of the Arizona Teachers Proficiency Examination, that candidate, upon qualifying with a passing score, will receive pay retroactive to the first day of employment to equal that of a candidate on a regular teaching contract.
[Phase l|
Each teacher hired with an alternative certificate will be expected to participate in one to four weeks of district-provided training before he/she is given responsibility of a classroom. This training will consist of secondary classroom activities and academic instruction on topics which include knowledge of adolescence, classroom management and instruction, development of curriculum, and foundations of education.
The teacher shall not be paid for Phase I training.
During Phase 1, an Alternative Certification Mentor Team (ACMT) shall be established which will include at least the following:
1.	A teacher from the PUHSD Staff Development Program who holds a Basic or Standard Secondary Certificate.
2.	A Content Area Specialist from the alternatively certified teacher’s school.
3.	A representative from the Arizona Department of Education or from a college or university with an Arizona Secondary Certification program.
4.	A certificated administrator from the Employee Relations Division. This administrator shall serve as the Chairperson of the ACMT.
The administrator from the Employee Relations Division who is assigned will assist the teacher through the three phases of the Alternative Certification program and evaluate the progress of the teacher at the end of each phase. This administrator shall decide, after a meeting with the ACMT at the end of each phase, if the teacher shall be permitted to continue in the program.
Phase I may run concurrently with Phase II or may be waived if the Alternative Certification Mentor Team so recommends. The ACMT may reach consensus that the candidate may be better served by an emergency certification and expected to finish the hours required for regular certification.
[Phase Il|
Upon successful completion of Phase I including approval from the teacher’s assigned administrator, the teacher shall be offered a one-semester contract.
During this semester of employment, the teacher will be expected to continue to participate in training and will also be given the responsibility for a classroom.
The ACMT is responsible for guiding the teacher in his/her efforts to be a successful classroom teacher. The chairperson of the ACMT shall ensure that a team member observes the alternatively certified teacher for a minimum of one full teaching period per week during Phase II.
07/02
Proc. 4-11
The ACMT is also responsible for developing an Individual Action Plan (IAP) which will describe the length, development and type of training the teacher is expected to pursue during Phase II and Phase III.
One purpose of the training is to assist the alternatively certified teacher to meet district goals, standards, performances and regulations required of a non-continuing teacher. As the teacher shall be observed for the purpose of evaluation by a unit administrator at least twice annually per the guidelines stated in the teacher assessment and evaluation process, the training shall assist the teacher through this process.
The IAP will also include suggestions as to how the teacher can best meet the demands of the State Department to ensure standard certification at the conclusion of Phase III.
The ACMT will meet at the end of Phase II and Phase III to determine the successful completion of each phase.
|Fhase IIl|
Upon successful completion of Phase II, including approval from the chairperson of the ACMT, the teacher shall be offered a second one-semester contract provided a position exists and that no non-alternatively certified applicant is available for the position.
During this semester of employment, the teacher will be expected to continue to participate in training as outlined in the IAP and will continue to be responsible for a classroom. The chairperson of the ACMT shall ensure that a mentor team member observes the alternatively certified teacher for a minimum of one full teaching period per month during Phase III.
A teacher who successfully completes Phase III and qualifies for a temporary or standard teaching certificate shall be offered a position in the district as positions become available. Seniority shall be determined for this teacher by the first date of full-time continuous paid employment as a teacher with a temporary or standard certificate, per the guidelines stated in the Professional Agreement regarding seniority.
Probationary and Continuing Status
Teachers
Under Arizona Revised Statutes, teachers employed in the public schools serve in probationary status during the first three years. Probationary teachers who have successfully completed three full years of full time continuous employment and begin a fourth consecutive contract become tenured or continuing teachers.
The contract of employment of a probationary or continuing teacher for a school year shall be deemed automatically renewed for the next ensuing year unless, on or before May 1 immediately preceding the ensuing school year, the District gives notice to the teacher of the termination of his/her contract.
Athletic Trainers
An Athletic Trainer shall be given non-continuing and continuing status through requirements similar to those required of teachers.
Nurses
Nurses will be in a probationary status during the initial ninety (90) workdays of employment. During this time, the probationary nurse is subject to release or discharge by the District. Information forming the basis for such action shall be made available to the employee.
Proc. 4-12
07/02
Temporary Certificated Personnel
The governing board authorizes the Employee Relations Division to employ qualified substitute teachers as temporary employees. When a substitute teacher replaces the same teacher for an extended period (20 days of continuous teaching), and is qualified according to district standards for that position, s/he is given an open-end contract. This contract extends for thirty (30) calendar days, or until the regular teacher returns, whichever occurs first. If the regular teacher does not return by the expiration date of the 30 calendar day contract, salary for the contract period will be at the rate shown in the Teachers’ Salary Schedule for a teacher with the substitute teacher’s training and experience.
A.	When the guest teacher is needed in the same classroom situation for more than 20 consecutive days, the guest teacher will be placed on an open-end contract, but only under the following conditions:
1.	Preference shall be given to the teacher who possesses a provisional or basic Arizona teaching certificate, qualifying the teacher to teach a subject of his/her major field for which s/he is being hired.
2.	A Personnel Action Request must be sent to the Employee Relations Division requesting that the guest teacher be placed on open-end contract.
3.	A guest teacher who has become eligible for or been given an open-end contract during a semester at one school, and then is assigned within five school days to another class or school where an extended absence is expected, or where there is a no-teacher situation, shall be issued an open-end or interim contract.
4.	The guest teacher’s work must have been rated satisfactory.
B.	A list of open-end contract teachers shall be sent to the office of the CTA on the first work day of each month.
C.	Teachers on open-end contract, as well as guest teachers, are temporary employees and, therefore, receive none of the fringe benefits accorded regular teachers.
D.	The open-end contract teacher must be evaluated at least once before a second open-end contract or a regular contract may be offered that teacher. A copy of the evaluation must be on file in the Employee Relations Division.
E.	If an open-end contract teacher is needed beyond the end of the first open-end contract period in a two-semester school, the teacher will receive a regular contract for the remainder of the semester, unless s/he is replacing a teacher who is expected to return from an extended absence before the end of the semester, in which case, a second open-end contract will be issued until the return of the teacher. A teacher on a regular contract under these provisions is eligible for fringe benefits retroactive to the first day of employment. A new Personnel Action Request must be submitted.
F.	If an open-end or interim teacher is needed beyond the end of a semester, the teacher will be made a regular employee and eligible for fringe benefits for the full semester.
EXCEPTIONS:
1.	The situation where a regular teacher for whom the open-end teacher is substituting will probably return from extended absence sometime during that period.
2.	In cases where uncertainty exists concerning the need for a teacher, a teacher may substitute for up to twenty (20) days, after which time the teacher will be given a regular contract or will be terminated.
3.	When a teacher returns from an extended absence, a Personnel Action Request must be sent immediately to the Employee Relations Division terminating the employment of the teacher on open-end contract.
07/02
Proc. 4-13
4.	No fringe benefits will be allowed any teacher until s/he becomes a regular employee teaching three periods or more.
5.	Any teacher who has taught full-time for more than one-half of the number of school days per the official school calendars - whether under regular contract, open-end contract, or any combination of the two - receives a full year of teaching credit.
6.	If s/he is not rehired, a letter must be sent and reasons for discontinuance given, since s/he has the rights of a probationary teacher.
7.	S/he receives a year of service credit on his/her next year’s salary, if s/he is rehired.
VOLUNTARY SEPARATION OF EMPLOYMENT
Employees who wish to terminate employment will notify the Employee Relations Division in writing, but only after such action has been reported to and discussed with the principal, educational unit supervisor or immediate supervisor concerned. Subject to the approval of the Governing Board, certified employees shall be permitted to resign while under contract providing the district is given 30 days notice and providing a suitable replacement can be found.
RETIREMENT
Employees who plan to retire from their employment with the District at the end of a contract year are expected to notify the Employee Relations Division and their supervisors by April 1.
Proc. 4-14

SALARY AND COMPENSATION
EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION
Annually, the administration shall meet and confer with representatives of the various employee groups to develop proposed salary schedules and benefits packages.
Contractual Errors
An apparent contractual error must be brought to the attention of the Employee Relations Division prior to June 30 of the fiscal year for which the contract is written, or within 45 days after receipt of the contract, whichever is later.

The rate of pay for full-time summer school shall be equal to the teacher’s daily rate of pay. The professional workweek for classroom teachers during the academic year shall be estimated at 1400 minutes of potential student contact time. Thus, summer school pay for less than a full day shall be prorated per the amount of minutes spent each week with students, with 1400 minutes per week with students equating to full-time status. (Example: A teacher who works with students for 1120 minutes per week in the summer shall be given a contract equal to 1120/1400 of full time, or .8 for each week that the teacher is expected to be with students for 1120 minutes.)

Teacher, Athletic Trainer and JROTC Salary Schedule Initial Placement
New employees shall be placed on the appropriate range and step per the guidelines listed in this section:
A.	A non-JROTC teacher with a regular or an emergency certificate will be placed on the appropriate range of the Teachers’ Salary Schedule depending upon the teacher’s level of education: Range 1 (BA), Range 2 (MA or BA+36), Range 3 (MA+15), Range 4 (MA+30), or Range 5 (MA+45).
B.	A non-JROTC teacher with State Licensure and the Provisional Vocational Certificate employed in a program for which State Licensure and the Vocational Certificate is the minimal or only requirement for employment shall be placed on Range 1.
C.	A non-JROTC teacher with State Licensure and the Basic or Standard Vocational Certificate employed in a program for which State Licensure and the Vocational Certificate is the minimal or only requirement for employment will be placed on Range 2.
D.	A JROTC teacher will be placed on the appropriate range of the JROTC Salary Schedule depending upon the JROTC teacher’s level of education: Range 1 (pre-BA), Range 2 (BA), Range 3 (MA or BA+36), Range 4 (MA+15), Range 5 (MA+30), Range 6 (MA+45).
E.	A JROTC teacher will be placed at the appropriate range per education and at the lowest salary permissible per military formula. If the military formula would cause the necessary salary to exceed the highest salary on the range, a salary line will be created on that range for that specific JROTC teacher and it will be equal to the salary required by the military formula. No salary increases, other than those required by military formula, will be given unless provided through the PUHSD JROTC Salary Schedule.
F.	Due to the creation of a new JROTC salary effective July 1, 2003, this paragraph will describe the process to be used to move JROTC teachers already employed at that time to their new salary schedule. Those JROTC teachers will be placed on the new JROTC Salary Schedule according to education level (range) at the step that would be greater than their current salary amount, with those with BA degrees being placed on Range 2 and those with MA degrees being placed on Range 3. Should that step placement exceed the thirteen (13) step limit for that range, a salary step will be created on that range for any individual affected. No future step advancement or salary increase will be given unless provided through the normal experience steps and educational ranges of the salary schedule. Following the initial placement, the JROTC teacher can seek further advancement for education by submitting the necessary paperwork to the Employee Relations Division.	.
G.	Newly hired Athletic Trainers shall be placed on the Athletic Trainers’ Salary Schedule at the appropriate range based on education and the appropriate step based on experience. Up to eight (8) years of prior experience will be granted on any range for teaching or school athletic training experience.
H.	An Athletic Trainer who was also a teacher during the 2001-02 school year may opt to teach an additional class with pay calculated on the Teachers’ Salary Schedule according to Professional Agreement language pertaining to additional .2 assignments. This teacher-trainer will maintain a right to this assignment, within normal seniority guidelines for teachers, for as long as the teacher-trainer chooses to continue to teach. Should the teacher-trainer relinquish this right, the trainer will no longer be guaranteed an additional .2 assignment but can be considered for such along with other teachers per Professional Agreement language.
I.	A teacher of JROTC who accepts a teaching job different than JROTC will be placed on the Teachers’ Salary Schedule at a step and range commensurate with the teacher’s education and prior teaching experience provided that placement does not cause the teacher a loss in salary. If the initial placement would cause a loss in salary, the teacher will be placed on the appropriate range for education but at the first step on that range which would not cause a loss in salary.
Proc. 5-7
J.	Beginning with non-JROTC teachers hired for the 2002-03 school year, prior service credit for teaching will be granted on the basis of one step on the salary schedule for each full-time, full year of prior teaching service with a seven-year maximum for those initially placed on Range 1, and an eight-year maximum for those initially placed on Ranges 2, 3, 4, or 5.	.

This prior service credit will be on the basis of one step on the salary schedule for each full-time, full-year of prior work experience in the field for which the teacher is being hired. Prior experience credit for these teachers shall include the combination of prior teaching and prior work experience. Beginning with teachers hired for the 2002-03 school year, prior service credit for work experience will be granted with a seven-year maximum for those initially placed on Ranges 2, 3, 4, or 5.
L.	Prior service credit for classified employees who began a teaching job after July 1, 1999, shall be granted on the basis of one step on the salary schedule for each 3 full years of continuous service in the Phoenix Union High School District. Beginning with teachers hired for the 2002-03 school year, prior service credit for District classified experience will be granted with a seven-year maximum for those initially placed on range 1 and an eight-year maximum for those initially placed on ranges, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Classified longevity may not be applied to the Teachers’ Salary Schedule.
M.	A teacher who submits his/her resignation and is rehired with no interruption of service will be placed on the salary schedule as if s/he were a continuing teacher. However, the teacher would be considered a first-year, non-continuing teacher with a new hire date for purposes of seniority and evaluation.

D.	A teacher whose teaching load is more than two periods per day and who is employed by this District for more than half of the total days on duty for teachers per the official school calendars) and who has not been terminated before the end of the school year shall be advanced one step on the salary schedule the following year. A teacher whose teaching load has been two periods per day or less shall remain on the same step of the salary schedule for the following year. In either case, the teacher shall receive the fractional part of that salary proportioned to the amount of time s/he is teaching.
E.	During the 5th year of service on the top step of the highest range, and each year of service thereafter, a teacher, a JROTC teacher and an athletic trainer are entitled to a career increment of $1000. Likewise, during the 10th year of service and during the 15th and 20th years of service on this top step, a teacher, a JROTC teacher and an athletic trainer are entitled to an additional career increment of $1000 at each of those levels of service.

Technology Integration Modules
Recognizing that the use of technology for the purposes of classroom instruction is an ever-changing and dynamic process, the Assistant Superintendent for Instruction and Accountability and the President of the Classroom Teachers’ Association will establish a joint committee each year that will be responsible for the development, implementation, and monitoring of these modules. In any year that the number of those completing the modules exceeds the available funds, first priority will be granted to applicants who have not yet completed a module, and those not funded will be given first priority in the next fiscal year.
Proc. 5-12
Due to budget constraints, no new modules will be processed after July 1, 2003. Teachers who renew modules or complete new modules by April 15, 2003 will receive compensation as outlined in the program. Should budgetary considerations allow, the Technology Integration Module Program may be revived at a later date.

Teachers Assigned to Two Campuses (Split Assignments)
Teachers whose total assignment is comprised of regularly scheduled classes and who travel to two campuses during each school day will be involved in the design of their professional day. They shall be paid on the regular Teachers’ Salary schedule plus $125.00 per month and a mileage allowance. An itinerant teacher whose assignment requires travel to two campuses at least four school days per week shall also be paid the additional $125.00 per month and a mileage allowance. Other certificated staff members whose assignment requires District travel will not qualify for the $125.00 stipend.
Mileage Allowance
A.	The use of personal cars for school business should be limited as much as possible through the use of District-owned vehicles. The first priority for District-owned vehicles is use for student oriented activities, and in no case shall they be assigned for personal use. The assignment of District-owned campus vehicles will be processed by the administration on each campus. The assignment of District-owned vehicles for itinerant teachers will be processed by the District supervisor.
B.	A teacher, however, may be required in the course of her/his employment to drive a personal car on a regular basis. The teacher will be authorized to receive a mileage reimbursement as permitted by state statute if his/her name has been placed on the eligibility list to receive such reimbursement. Such identification is the responsibility of the campus administration. A teacher required to use a personal car on school business must carry at his/her own expense the minimum insurance requirements of liability coverage of $15,000 per person or $30,000 per accident. Coverage above these minimum requirements is provided through the District liability insurance policy.
C.	A school nurse who is required to travel from one location to another during a work period shall be paid regular rate of pay for time spent in such travel and where the distance of travel requires transportation, the District shall attempt to furnish transportation. This is not always possible. In situations where it is not possible, Paragraph 2 of this section will apply.
Proc. 5-13
D.	In certain situations, the school nurse may be required to furnish transportation. At such time, mileage will be paid by check separate from the regular paycheck at the District’s current approved mileage rate, which will be equal to State government mileage rate.

Guidelines for Extra Pay Increments
A.	Criteria and Formula for Determining Schedule F Increments
The two major elements of consideration used in the development of the formula were the time spent and the responsibility assumed in carrying out Schedule F assignments.
The time element was divided into two segments - the total number of hours spent on assignment during the regular weeks of the season, and the total number of hours spent during vacation periods occurring during the season. The time spent during regular weeks was weighted by a factor of 2, and the time spent during vacation weeks was weighted by a factor of 4, as shown in the table below.
The responsibility element was subdivided into six categories, and each was assigned a weighted factor. The number of participants was assigned a factor of 2; the numbers of contests and assistants were given a factor of 5; liability and fiscal and public relations responsibilities were assigned factors ranging from O to 30 as shown in the table below.
The point total accrued as a result of the above considerations as applied to each Schedule F Assignment was divided by 100 to determine the percentage to be applied to the appropriate figure on the Teachers’ Salary Schedule. That percent figure was then divided by 100 to arrive at the index figure.
Determination of Time and Responsibility Quotients
Time Quotient Determination
Number of regular weeks during season x hours per week x factor 2	= A points
Number of vacation weeks worked during season x hours per week
x factor of 4	= B points
Responsibility Quotient Determination
Number of participants x factor of 2	= C points
Number of contests x factor of 5	= D points
Number of assistants x factor of 5	= E points
Liability related to travel and injuries x factor ranging from 0-30	= F points
Fiscal - related to equipment and budget preparation x factor
from 0-30	= G points
Public Relations x factor ranging from 0-30	= H points

Junior Reserve Officer Training Program (JROTC)
Per agreement between the U.S. Army and the Phoenix Union High School District, each campus program will be staffed with a minimum of one Officer and one Non-commissioned Officer, based on enrollment up to 150 cadets. When enrollment exceeds 150 for two consecutive years a third instructor shall be authorized. Beyond 150 cadets the instructor authorization increases one per 100 additional cadets.
A.	For each period of released time or non-teaching assignment for a teacher given as part of the five teaching periods, the maximum number of student/ teacher contacts shall be reduced by 34 for those teachers with classes on the 34:1 ratio, and proportionately for teachers with classes with a lesser ratio.
B.	By a majority vote at a meeting, a department other than Physical Education or Music may recommend to the Principal a department average of not more than 167 student/teacher contacts per day. Limit for an individual teacher in the department shall be 175 students per day.
C.	Teacher may request a review of the composition of class if, in the teachers's opinion, the educational climate is not conducive to learning. A review will consist of a meeting within 10 working days, including administration, counseling, department chair, CTA unit chair, the teacher, and other appropriate individuals. If the teacher is not satisfied with results of the meeting, the teacher may appeal to the Assistant Superintendent for Instruction and Accountability whose decision is final.
D.	In preparing schedules for Special Education teachers, administrators and department chairs will make every effort to limit the number of preparations assigned per period and per semester. In basic classes (ED/LD), excluding LSL classes, for each additional course over two taught in a period, classloads shall be reduced by two students. Case Management loads for Special Education teachers will be assigned equitably (evenly distributed to members of the department) and shall not exceed 25.
E.	In order for two levels of one general education or occupational education course (excluding music) to be taught within a single period, the teacher must agree in writing and the classload shall be reduced to 28.
F.	The maximum number of students assigned to a counselor shall not exceed 325. If Special Education students are assigned through the department, individual counselor loads shall be proportional to the staffing allocations.
G.	As budget funds are available, every attempt will be made to recognize the need for additional staffing on the basis of one teacher for each 75 students who are at or below stanine 3 on a standard reading test.
H.	The counselor staffing for each comprehensive high school shall be determined by applying the current staffing ratios to the first semester projected high point membership. If the calculation indicates:
1.	0.5 or less need, the school must absorb the 0.5;
2.	or more than 0.5, a 1.0 counseling position will be allocated.
This procedure will eliminate split counselor assignments.
I.	If the student/teacher contact limits are exceeded, the teacher will notify the principal. The principal shall reduce the teacher’s load to the specified limits within two (2) days after notification.
J.	A laboratory/shop classroom is defined as one that contains a limited number of stations containing equipment necessary for students to use in their course of study. The principal or his/her designee, the department chair, and a teacher from the department shall complete a

listing of maximum student stations for each laboratory/shop classroom. If a question arises concerning the listing, it will be reviewed by the Campus Committee. The student station list is to be updated by March 1 for the following school year. Prior to staffing each year, the schools shall submit agreed upon student stations for laboratory/shop classrooms to the Employee Relations Division and the President of the CTA. Should the Executive Director for Employee Relations/Legal Services or the CTA President determine that an inequity exists, he/she may refer the inequity to the Assistant Superintendent for Instruction and Accountability. Approval of all changes in student stations which are referred shall be made by the Assistant Superintendent for Instruction and Accountability or designee and the Classroom Teachers' Association president or designee after a campus visitation.
K.	Title classes, per federal guidelines, must supplement locally- funded classes. Since class loads for many teachers are inherently reduced when students are assigned to Title classes, eligible students shall be enrolled in Title classes as quickly as possible each semester. Furthermore, every effort shall be made to insure that the number of students enrolled in each Title class approaches the established class load limit as quickly as possible.
L.	When possible, an out-of-sequence course (e.g., Algebra 1 during second semester or American History 2 during first semester) shall be offered whenever the number of students needing the course warrants it.
M.	Every comprehensive campus is strongly encouraged to develop an alternative program for grades 9 through 12, structured to meet each school’s needs. If created, each regular education class shall be considered for a class load limit of 25 per class.
N.	Every comprehensive campus is strongly encouraged to develop a support program for all freshmen. If a program is approved which includes classes, a class load limit of 25 per class shall be enforced.
O.	In the event that a classroom teacher has an interval of time with one or more class periods with no students, other instructional duties which will benefit students and/or other teachers such as team teaching, tutoring, skill assessment, etc., may be assigned.
P.	Should an educational unit choose to eliminate a lower level course(s) and merge the respective students into a higher level course(s), the class load limit shall be the average of all courses involved. Example: One class with a classload limit of 28 is merged with another class with a classload limit of 30. Class load limit from first day of semester equals: (28+30) 4- 2 = 29. Class load limit after the end of the sixth week of the semester equals: (26+28) 2 = 27.

Directed Study
In addition to the Independent Study option, an effort will be made to provide students in the Phoenix Union High School District an alternative method for earning credit in district course offerings. Independent Study courses are defined as courses which provide enrichment opportunities to students in a given department. Credit is given in “Independent Study-.” Directed Study shall be defined as an alternative method of offering any of title existing regular course offerings. A Directed Study (DS) course will have the same curriculum requirements as the traditional course. Credit shall be given in the specifically identified course, which will be recorded on the transcript as “course name - DS”.
An Accreditation Committee shall exist on each campus and shall be chaired by a teacher appointed by the campus committee. Representatives shall include a counselor and a member from English, mathematics, social studies and science. Other departments which offer DS courses shall also have representation. Department representative selections shall be made prior to the initiation of any DS courses on the campus. Every department may choose to have a representative. This will be considered the club/committee assignment for the representatives. Prior approval from the Accreditation Committee is required for all DS course proposals. Since Directed Study may begin at any time in the semester, the committee shall meet as needed to avoid delays in beginning Directed Study course work. Minutes of the Accreditation Committee’s meetings, including their decisions, shall be sent to the Principal, Unit Chair, and Assistant Superintendent for Instruction and Accountability within five (5) calendar days of the meeting.
The following regulations/procedures have been established for Directed Study (DS):
1.	Directed Study (DS) is open to all students.
2.	A teacher will offer DS courses only on a voluntary basis. A non-continuing teacher may offer DS with the approval of the department chair. A teacher under remediation shall not offer DS.
07/97
Proc. 6-5
3.	A teacher may offer a DS course only in the area and school in which he/she is currently teaching. Because of the unique nature of the program at Metro Tech, a Metro Tech teacher may offer to a Metro-only student, per the provisions of this agreement, a DS course in any area in which the Metro Tech teacher is qualified.
4.	A teacher may offer DS to no more than 2 students per semester.
5.	A DS course may be offered in any PUHSD course offering except work experience, Honors, and Advanced Placement.

8.	A student may take no more than 7 classes per semester except with written authorization from the student’s assigned school guidance counselor. This includes classes taken during the day, at ESO, or through Directed Study.
9.	If a teacher who volunteers prior to the start of a semester to accept a DS student, that teacher shall be limited to two preparations (other than the DS preparation) provided this can be accomplished by changing the department schedule and without requiring additional staffing. The DS teacher may waive this right.
10.	DS students shall be weighted per department at a ratio of one (1) DS student to three (3) regular students. Each department will be given an additional .2 staff allocation for the semester for each equivalent 30 students (10 DS students) or major portion thereof. (Example: A department has a total of six (6) DS students. This equates to 18 after weighting. The department is assigned an extra .2 staffing.) This allocation shall be granted through the 6th week of the semester. The principal and department chair shall reach agreement on how the allocation is used.
11.	DS may be initiated by student, parent, counselor, administrator or teacher. A conference shall be held to determine if the student should be recommended for DS. Included in the conference shall be the student, a parent/guardian, if possible, the department chair, the teacher whose class the student will be exiting, if one exists, and the DS teacher.
12.	Once a student has been recommended for DS and a teacher has been identified, the teacher will work with the student to create the individual course of study. A written agreement outlining the course of study shall be entered into between the teacher and student. The agreement shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
a.	Under what conditions, if any, the student may change from DS to a regular class.
b.	Under what conditions, if any, the student may remain on campus outside of his/her regular class periods to do research, etc. on DS activities.
c.	Specific DS activities and timelines for their completion.
13.	A DS course of study shall include activities to address the District’s minimum competencies for the course in which credit is sought.

Leaves of Absence
Leave With Pay
A.	Each teacher shall earn one day of leave allowance for each 20 contract days or major fraction thereof. Two additional days are provided to each teacher each school year and these two days will be available for use from the beginning of the school year. A teacher must be on duty the first day that school is in session (i.e., students meeting classes) or be on an excused absence to be eligible for this two-day advance. If an emergency occurs requiring the use of leave days in excess of the number accrued, the teacher may contact the Employee Relations Division to ask that consideration be given for the front-loading of additional unaccrued days. If a teacher leaves the employ of the school district before the end of the school year, s/he will have the final pay check reduced by the amount of pay received for leave days used but not yet earned. The unused portion of such allowance shall accumulate from year to year without limitation. At the beginning of the school year, each teacher shall be advised in writing of the number of days of leave which the teacher has accumulated. For regular part-time and interim teachers, leave is prorated according to the percentage of full-time being worked. Contracts pertaining to Schedule F activities are not included.

The Superintendent (or designee) may require from the teacher a certificate signed by a duly licensed physician or Christian Science Practitioner verifying that the cause of an absence of more than three consecutive days was illness or injury to self or family. The teacher may also be required to have a health examination by the District Medical Advisor at no cost to the teacher.
The teacher shall be notified of this requirement in writing, including a statement citing just cause, and a copy of this notification shall be sent to the CTA.
D.	Reporting Process
1.	When a teacher knows of a short-term absence in advance, a two-day notice shall be given to the principal. In other cases, the teacher shall notify substitute service as soon as possible but never later than 7:00 a.m. on the day of absence.
2.	When an extended absence is known in advance (e.g., scheduled surgery, childbirth), the teacher shall notify the Principal and the Employee Relations Division as soon as possible so that arrangements for a guest teacher may be made. This notice shall be submitted on the appropriate form, indicating the beginning and ending date of the disability period. The form must be signed by the teacher’s personal physician. If circumstances require a change in the estimated disability period, a revised form shall be submitted, also signed by the teacher’s personal physician.
E.	Pregnancy leave is granted in accordance with the Federal Family Medical Leave Act provisions. In the case of a person who does not qualify for family medical leave, pregnancy leave will be treated as a medical leave.
Proc. 9-4
07/02
F.	If the probationary or continuing teacher wants additional time beyond the disability period to care for the child, the teacher will submit a request for a leave of absence without pay with the request being noted as personal. This will be treated as a personal leave of absence without pay.
Donation of Leave Days
A.	A teacher who has depleted his/her leave days may request access to the “Leave Assistance Program” by submitting a Medical Leave Assistance Program Request Form to the Executive Director for Employee Relations/Legal Services requesting donations of leave days from other teachers so that the teacher’s income can continue during an extended period of absence of two weeks or more. Donated leave days are intended for the use of the employee only to compensate for days missed due to personal illness.
Leave days for family illnesses are available through the Federal Family Medical Leave Act.
B.	The donor teacher may donate leave days only if he/she has thirty (30) or more days of accumulated leave. The donor teacher may donate no more than five (5) days of leave in any contract year. The donor teacher will designate the donation in the name of the teacher to receive the donation.
C.	If more days than are needed are donated to the receiving teacher, the extra days shall be returned to the donor teacher.
D.	No teacher shall be eligible for the leave assistance program after he/she qualifies for long-term disability coverage.
Leaves of Absence Without Pay
General
A.	Any teacher who must be absent without pay for any period must request a leave of absence without pay or submit a resignation. To do otherwise is a breach of contract and will be considered job abandonment (reference Employee Conduct/Discipline Handbook). This also applies to employees who have exhausted their leave allowance. A health leave of absence without pay must be requested, to be effective as soon as leave allowance is exhausted.
B.	AU requests for leave shaU be applied for in writing, using the appropriate form, and the term of the leave requested may not exceed one year. Those who have requested leaves wiU be informed in writing as to the disposition of the request.
Leaves of absence without pay may be requested under the foUowing:
• A teacher who is unable to teach because of personal illness or disability and who has exhausted aU leave available (or who has chosen not to use accumulated leave) may request a leave of absence without pay upon the submission of a physician’s certificate, for the remainder of the school year or until s/he is able to return to duty. If the teacher has not returned by the end of the school year, the teacher’s health condition wiU be reviewed and a decision made by the Employee Relations Division with the assistance of the District Medical Advisor, to permit the teacher to return to duty, extend the leave of absence, or take appropriate action.
1.	A teacher who becomes eligible for consideration for the District’s long-term disability insurance program must apply for a health leave of absence to begin upon the exhaustion of leave.
2.	A teacher who is injured while on duty and covered by the Workers' Compensation Plan will not be granted a health leave of absence until his/her leave is exhausted or until the teacher becomes eligible for coverage under the long-term disability insurance program, whichever comes first.
If a teacher is granted permission from a doctor, with concurrence from the District Medical Advisor (if deemed necessary), to return to work during the period of the leave of absence already granted, s/he will be returned to work only if a vacancy exists for which the teacher is qualified.
•	For maternity leave beyond the period of disability charged to leave or in lieu of leave.

D.	A leave of absence without pay other than a health or maternity leave shall be for a period of one semester or one school year so as to interfere as little as possible with the instructional process. Any request for a period of time other than these will be considered only in unusual circumstances.
E.	A teacher who is granted a leave for one school year or less will not break his/her continuity of service. Leaves of absence without pay for any reason other than health or maternity will not be granted to teachers with less than three years of full-time continuous teaching except in unusual circumstances. A teacher with less than three years of full-time continuous teaching who takes a leave for more than one-half of the school year, however, must begin his/her three-year full-time continuous teaching period over again, since the continuity of service required by law will be broken.
F.	A teacher who is granted a leave for one school year or less will be returned to his/her former assignment(s), and the teacher employed or transferred as a replacement for the teacher on leave will be employed or transferred only for the duration of the period of the leave, and will be so informed in writing. The replacement teacher will be placed on the reassignment list at the conclusion of the leave unless an opening exists in that department on that campus, in which case the teacher shall be assigned to that position.
G.	Health insurance benefits will be provided by the district for a teacher during a health related leave of absence without pay for one year or less. At the end of one year of leave without pay, health insurance benefits will no longer be provided by the district. The teacher will return to work, retire, resign or qualify or the long-term disability and health insurance programs through the Arizona State Retirement System.
H.	In the event that a teacher enters the ASRS Long-Term Disability (LTD) Program, the district will subsidize one half of the individual's health insurance premium in the district's plan up to $160 per month (exclusive of any ASRS subsidy provided) for the year following the one year of medical leave provided by the district. If this teacher recovers within a year of being on the LTD program and is deemed fit to return to work, the teacher may notify the district that he/she is able to return to work. The teacher will then be offered the first position that is available for which he/ she is qualified. If the teacher accepts the position, the salary will be at the pay range and seniority date which the teacher would have earned immediately prior to taking a medical leave.
I.	When a teacher returns to the employ of the district after a period of one year of unpaid leave (or a subsequent period of up to one year in the case of a teacher who entered the LTD program), the teacher must work one full year to be eligible to apply for another unpaid leave of absence.

N.	Each year the Governing Board shall fund sabbatical leave requests which were approved through the foregoing process. The Governing Board may authorize a salary to be paid to the person, not to exceed one-half of the salary then received by him/her.

D.	If the District determines that early retirees must be covered by a health insurance plan other than the one which insures active employees, the following provisions apply:
1.	Employees who enter the Early Retirement Program prior to July 1, 2003, and who also are receiving state retirement will have two options: (a) moving to the Arizona State Retirement System (ASRS) plan with the District paying the premium of the lowest cost plan (regardless of where the retiree resides) minus the ASRS subsidy; (b) staying on the District's plan with the retiree paying the difference between the cost of the District plan retiree rate and the lowest cost plan of the ASRS.
2.	Employees who enter the Early Retirement Program on or after July 1, 2003, and who also are receiving state retirement would be on the ASRS plan and the District would pay the premium of the lowest cost ASRS plan (without adjustment for where the retiree lives) minus the ASRS subsidy.

Those who enter early retirement after July 1,2003, will be covered by paragraph 2 above.
4.	Employees who took early retirement prior to July 1, 2003, and who reside out of state will pay the same amount toward their coverage as a pre July 1, 2003, early retiree who resides in state and chose to stay on the District plan. The District would pay any remaining premium cost.

The person will continue to receive all other benefits under the early retirement program, including payment of ASRS health plan premiums.
E.	A teacher choosing this program would be assured of annual renewal until the end of the contract year in which he/she becomes Medicare eligible, provided the teacher works for one or more days during the previous school year.

Post Retirement Return to Work Program
If an early retire returns to work for the District, the retiree does not forfeit any rights guaranteed through the early retirement program.

Effective July 1,1993, a teacher with continuous satisfactory service at the time of retirement, resignation, termination, or death in service from the District shall receive (or his/her estate) a financial payment at the rate of 45 percent times the daily rate of pay during the final year of employment for any unused paid leave. Leave shall be cumulative indefinitely.
B.	Incentives for Non-use of Leave
The District, in conjunction with the Phoenix Union Partnership of Business and Education, is committed to providing incentives for conservative use of leave days by teachers.
An employee who notifies the District in writing of his/her intent to terminate employment by February 15 of the year prior, may be issued a severance contract, which shall be binding upon the employee, written according to the following provisions.

Option I:
Sick leave payoff will be paid in one lump sum after the employee's final termination date.
Option II:
Sick leave payoff will be included in the contract issued for the final year of employment and will be paid according to the 20 and 26 pay period option chosen by the employee for his/her regular pay. The sick leave payoff amount shall not be included in the employee's daily rate of pay.
The sick leave bank purchased under Option II will be considered remunerated in full. If the employee should subsequently need to use sick days for which he/ she was paid, the District may grant those days and dock at 100% of his/her daily rate of pay for each additional day of sick leave used.
Option III:
Sick leave payoff will be paid in two equal lump sums; the first to be paid the last regular pay date in December of the employee's final year of employment and the second payment to be made after the employee's final termination date.
An employee who chooses Option II or III is not eligible to participate in the medical leave assistance program.
07/02
Proc. 9-11
If the employee does not notify the District in writing by the February 15 deadline, sick leave payoffs will be paid according to Option I.

WORKDAY AND WORK YEAR
School Calendar Recommendations
The CTA shall submit its recommended calendar(s) to the Superintendent not later than February 15. Each teacher shall be provided a copy of the succeeding year's calendar(s) as soon as possible after approval by the Governing Board.
Professional Workday and Work Week for Teachers
The professional workday and work week include many professional activities in which the teacher is involved other than direct student contact in a classroom. However, the main focus of this professional assignment is the classroom, which represents the portion of the teacher's assignment where the greatest
07/02
Proc. 10-1
amount of time is spent. The teacher must be in the classroom during the periods which are assigned as teaching periods, unless other arrangements have been specifically made with the principal/ supervisor or designee. Also, the teacher will perform those professional responsibilities necessary to meet the needs of students, and those professional duties necessary to be effective in the classroom. The teacher will conduct activities to retain potential dropouts as defined by the Keep Kids in School Program (KKIS) which is described later in this agreement.
1.	The usual workday for teachers shall be from 7:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M., or an equivalent period of time depending on the particular campus schedule and the beginning of the teacher's workday. Though variations to an eight-hour schedule are permitted, no teacher will be required to have a work schedule which ends later than 4:00 P.M. unless the teacher agrees to such a schedule. If a school has more than seven class periods scheduled per day, a teacher's individual assignment will be within a consecutive seven periods unless the teacher volunteers otherwise. Teachers who find it necessary to leave campus prior to the end of the workday shall notify the principal/ designee.
2.	The professional work week for classroom teachers shall include 1375 minutes for teaching or campus supervision assignment(s) and up to 100 minutes for a Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) Program if SSR is approved by the Campus Committee as described below. Should a campus have an overriding need for minor modifications to these guidelines, the principal may petition the Assistant Superintendent for Instruction and Accountability for a one-year variance. These numbers can then be reduced or increased if agreed to by the Assistant Superintendent for Instruction and Accountability and the CTA President. Time described may be averaged within a three-week, six-week, nine-week or eighteen-week semester. Normally work experience coordinators may have a weekly schedule which includes 825 minutes of teaching periods and 550 minutes of student supervision on the job.
3.	The principal/ designee shall seek input before the adoption of a schedule that changes the length or arrangement of periods in the work week from five, fifty-five minute periods per day. Such input shall consist of, but not be limited to department chairs as a group, the Campus Committee, and ultimately the entire faculty. This process shall be completed by March 1 of the school year prior to adoption of the schedule. Schedules must provide for every class to meet a minimum of 275 minutes per week, and for every class to meet a minimum of 4000 minutes per half-credit grading term during the normal school year. Should a campus have an overriding need for minor modifications to these guidelines, the Principal may petition the Assistant Superintendent for Instruction and Accountability for a one-year variance. These numbers can then be reduced or increased if agreed to by the Assistant Superintendent for Instruction and Accountability and the CTA President. Schedules must be in compliance with the Professional Agreement and must be submitted, prior to implementation, to the Assistant Superintendent for Instruction and Accountability, who shall examine them for compliance.
4.	The Instructional Cabinet, or Department Chairs as a Group, shall recommend to the Campus Committee a plan for requiring up to 8 hours per year of duties for teachers outside of the professional day. These duties could include:
a.	Extended staff meetings or teacher training activities to occur no more than once per month,
b.	Extra open houses during the year,
c.	Scheduled times for parent conference days, or
d.	Team-building activities.
The Campus Committee shall reach consensus on the Instructional Cabinet's plan or modify it to reach consensus. If consensus cannot be reached, the plan along with suggestions from the Campus Committee shall be returned to the Instructional Cabinet who shall consider the Campus Committee suggestions and then shall make the final decision. The Campus Committee must reach consensus on any activity that extends the professional workday beyond 4:30 P.M. and for any activity which is not included in the list above. An exception shall be made if the Instructional Cabinet, or Department Chairs as a group, recommend one additional open house or parent conference day during the year.
Proc. 10-2
07/02
An additional open house or parent conference day may be scheduled whether or not the Campus Committee concurs.
5.	The Principal and the Campus Committee shall concur on the adopted bell schedule each year and any changes to it. The Principal will inform the Campus Committee of any program changes occurring on campus. The District may call for a shortened day for teacher training. The Campus Committee may also be asked to concur with a campus request for a shortened day for teacher training. No more than one day per month may be shortened to provide for teacher training, and whenever a day is shortened for this purpose, teachers shall be required to attend. If training activities are provided outside of the professional day or outside of the campus plan for eight hours of potential additional professional duties, teachers are encouraged to participate and will be paid their hourly rate of pay or given professional growth credit.
6.	If a campus CTA member, a member of a campus group working on school improvement, or any member of the Campus Committee would like the campus to create or eliminate an SSR program which exceeds the 1375 teaching minutes, he/she should request consideration of such by the Campus Committee. The Campus Committee shall coordinate a plan for teachers to have time to understand and discuss the issue. The CTA Unit Chair shall then coordinate an election to allow all campus CTA members the opportunity to vote on such request. The ballot shall include a statement detailing the maximum number of minutes in excess of 1375 which the SSR Program would require. Following the vote, if at least 50 percent of campus CTA members voted and if a minimum of two-thirds of the votes were cast in support of the request, the Campus Committee will create a bell schedule pursuant to the vote. The new bell schedule will be operational no later than the beginning of the following school year and as early as the beginning of the next semester if all Campus Committee members agree. After a school's schedule is established for the year, no more than one change to create or eliminate an SSR program in addition to 1375 teaching minutes may be considered for the remainder of the academic year. If the Campus decides to create an SSR program within the 1375 minutes of teaching time, a campus vote is not required. Once an SSR program is established in addition to the 1375 teaching minutes, it shall continue as a program within the number of additional minutes per vote unless another vote is passed.
7.	The teacher is to be present during the hours when the teacher has an assigned responsibility with pupils while school is in session, unless provision for a substitute has been made, with approval of the principal/ designee.
8.	Classroom teachers shall be provided at least 275 minutes for preparation per week. These preparation periods are to provide time for preparation by the classroom teacher to carry out his/her responsibility to pupils and for the necessary administrative work related to his/her assignment. The teacher shall utilize preparation time in a professional manner.
9.	The professional workday and work week for certificated personnel, other than classroom teachers, shall be equivalent in time to that of classroom teachers but the time frame may be modified to achieve a schedule that will meet student and parent needs. The principal, after taking campus and student needs into consideration, shall work out an appropriate assignment schedule with the service personnel concerned. Counseling department members will adjust their lunch hours to ensure that counseling and crisis services are available to students during student lunch hours.
10.	All teachers shall be scheduled with a duty-free lunch period. Lunch periods shall be at least 40 minutes exclusive of passing periods at every comprehensive campus and Metro Tech. Any exceptions to this length, due to emergency situations, shall be approved on a temporary basis by the Campus Committee.
11.	An abbreviated class schedule ending no later than noon shall be provided on the final Friday of each established grading term that does not end a semester to allow teachers adequate time for student evaluation and grade preparation. No department or faculty meetings will be scheduled on these days.
07/02
Proc. 10-3
Teachers shall submit grades to the registration office no later than 8:00 A.M. on the following Tuesday or by 4:00 P.M. on that day if that day precedes a Board-declared holiday or recess day. This will ensure that students will receive their grade reports in a timely manner.
12.	A testing schedule, which includes parameters for addressing state directives, will be disseminated from the District for every day which includes state-mandated testing. The Principal and the Campus Committee, while working within the District parameters, will concur on the schedule for the day. Such a schedule may require a teacher to supervise students for more than 1375 minutes during the week but will ensure a reasonable workload for teachers. The Campus Committee will approve a plan for proctoring of such tests to ensure that the proctoring will be shared by all certificated staff and will allow for adequate breaks for staff.
13.	The last day of each semester shall be designated as a teacher workday for grade preparation and/or teacher planning. No meetings shall be scheduled on this day.
