If there are less senior full-time employees receiving forty (40) hours in floater assignments, the employee will be reassigned as a floater the following week. An employee who receives such reassignment waives his right to reassignment at his previous store, should more hours subsequently become available. Full-time floaters desiring non-floating assignments may request same in writing to the person designated by the Employer, and such assignments shall be made in seniority order when such opening occurs.

Section 83.	Additional Hours. Additional hours are those created by increased schedules, terminations or transfers within the classification which the Employer deems necessary to fill.

Should management be unable to fill such vacancy from the list, then such vacancy shall be posted within the affected store for seventy-two (72) hours and management shall offer the full-time assignment to the senior qualified employee of the store and classification who signed the posting before hiring off-the-street.
Four (4) week at forty (40) hour openings shall be filled by the most senior employee within the store and affected classification who has signed the full-time request list as set forth in this Agreement.

Section 93.	Reduction in Hours. When a reduction in hours is necessary within the store, as opposed to a layoff in the workforce, hours will be reduced from employees in the affected classification who have not requested additional hours in writing as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, before any reduction shall occur in the employee group which has requested additional hours.
Section 94.	Reduction of Hours. Full-time Employees: Management shall not write a schedule of shifts that would result in a full-time employee being unable to work a forty (40) hour schedule (thirty-two (32) hours in a holiday week) unless the average scheduled hours (including hours scheduled and paid for vacation, unworked holiday, jury, sick and funeral pay) of all part-time employees within the classification and department is twenty-four (24) hours or less for the involved workweek. A full-time employee who is not scheduled a forty (40) hour schedule, shall in their second consecutive week of such reduced hours, be allowed to exercise his/her seniority to claim the schedule of the least senior full-time employee in the classification within the bargaining unit who is working a forty (40) hour schedule.

1.	A regular full-time employee being laid off may displace the shortest service regular full-time employee within his classification within the bargaining unit. The regular full-time employee so displaced may displace the shortest service part-time employee in the same classification in the bargaining unit. In the event there is no less senior employee performing
28
work in the same classification, this displaced employee may displace the least senior employee in a lower classification in which he previously performed six (6) months of service in the classification for the Employer.
2.	A part-time employee being laid off may displace the shortest service part-time employee within his classification within the bargaining unit.
3.	Any employee with displacement rights under the procedures above shall be allowed to take a layoff in lieu of displacing any employee.

Employees recalled from layoff may refuse recall if the store being offered is more than ten (10) miles from their previous stores (i.e., the employee will maintain recall rights).

1.	Appendix "B-l" - Letter of Understanding
As a result of a meeting held on March 31*. 1983 between Charles Mercer and Rex Berry, the following terms and conditions have been agreed upon regarding future letters of agreement concerning employees re-instated under the terms of our Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program.
1.	The employee must enroll in an Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program recognized by the state and/or federal government.
2.	The employee must sign a release which permits Safeway Stores, Inc. and Retail Clerks Union, Local 7 access to any and all information related to his/her treatment required by, or undertaken in, the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program. Safeway Stores, Inc. has the right in its discretion, to obtain status reports from the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program Organization.
3.	Any employee terminated from Safeway Stores, Inc. for any reason, who later claims to be an alcoholic, will not be entitled to any back pay should the employee be reinstated under this policy.
4.	The Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program shall not in any way interfere with the written work schedule at the employee's place of employment.
5.	Any employee enrolled in an Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program is still subject to progressive discipline for any infraction of Safeway Stores, Inc. rules, regulations, or policies, and remains subject to the applicable collective bargaining agreement.
6.	Safeway Stores, Inc. shall not be liable for any expense associated with an employee's enrollment in an Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program.
7.	Should an employee violate any provision of the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program, the Company and the union will review the violation to determine if there arc any highly unusual circumstances which might warrant continuation in the program. If there are no such circumstances, the employee shall be terminated immediately.
8.	Upon enrolling in the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program, the employee shall be reinstated, but the employee will not necessarily be assigned his/her place of employment from which he/she was terminated. Safeway Stores, Inc. reserves the right to reinstate an employee to a place of employment which best serves the operational interest of Safeway Stores, Inc.
Dated March 31, 1983, and signed by Rex Berry, Safeway Stores, Inc., and Charles E. Mercer, Local 7,

2.	Appendix "B-3" - Procedures for Scheduling Employees With Conscientious Objections to Working on Their Day of Sabbath
We have had a number of requests for the procedure in the handling of employees scheduled on a day which is their day of Sabbath. Safeway has entered into an agreement with UFCW which provides certain procedures for accommodating individuals who have such conscientious objections.
Problems can result in a grievance under the contract as well as a possible violation of the laws against discrimination on the basis of religion, so please follow these procedures carefully and call Gordon Todd, 759-7831, in Employee relations should you have any questions.
This procedure, of course, applies only to any employee who advises you:
1.	That they have conscientious objections to working a particular day of the week.
2.	The nature of their conscientious objections, and
3.	The particular day of the week which they are unable to work.
If you have any questions concerning whether the employee actually has bona fide conscientious objections, be certain to contact Employee Relations and review the matter. You also should complete the form attached to these instructions, ask the employee to sign it, and route it to Gordon Todd, Employee Relations Department for future reference.
The procedure for scheduling is as follows:
1.	Until noon on Saturday for the following week’s schedule, an employee may identify and request an exchange of shifts with any employee junior to him in the same job classification in the store which will result in the employee obtaining their Sabbath as a day off. You may deny this request if the exchange would require an employee to perform duties for which they are not trained, or for some other equally substantial business reason. Otherwise you must grant the request. Seniority shall prevail, and the junior employee cannot refuse to make the trade.
2.	As an option, an employee may identify and request an exchange of shifts with a senior employee who is willing to make such an exchange. Again, you may deny this request if the exchange would require an employee to perform duties for which they are not trained, or for some other equally substantial business reason. Otherwise you must grant the request. Seniority shall prevail and the senior employee may refuse to make the trade.
3.	As a third alternative, an employee may simply decline to work on their day of Sabbath if they cannot trade shifts with anyone else. Such an employee will not be disciplined under the Absenteeism Program except for failure to notify (he Company prior to a scheduled
57
shift that he will not work on their day of Sabbath. You will then assess points for failure to call, but not for the absence itself.
4.	If an employee cannot make a change of shifts and is scheduled on their day of Sabbath for the entire bid period or for any extended period of time, it is permissible for that employee to advise you at the beginning of the bid period or other extended period of time uial they will not work on such day for the entire three months. Such an employee, if full-time, will not in fact be scheduled 40 hours, but 32 hours. The Company has no obligation to provide 40 hours work under these circumstances.
Attached you will find a form for keeping a record of any such scheduling accommodation.
It is very important that we follow these procedures and complete the attached form in the event we are challenged on our application of the settlement agreement.

4.	Appendix "B-l 1" ("B-10" for Brighton and Estes Park) - Additional Hour Request List For Northern Co\orado(Brighton, Longmont, Loveland, Fort Collins, Greeley, and Estes Park only)
The Company agrees to establish an additional hour request list, by classification, for the meat bargaining units represented by Local 7 in Brighton, Longmont, Loveland, Fort Collins and Greeley, and Estes Park.
Additional hours are those created by increased schedules, leaves of absence, vacations or sick calls during the affected work week.
When it is necessary to work additional hours, the additional hours shall first be offered by seniority to employees within the affected classification and store who are scheduled less than 40 hours. If these hours cannot be filled, the Company will offer the hours by seniority to employees within the affected classification within the bargaining unit who are scheduled less than 40 hours. And, if it is still necessary to fill the additional hours of work needed, the
59
Company will offer the hours by seniority to employees within the affected classification who are scheduled less than 40 hours in the above-described bargaining units.
Further, it is the employee's responsibility to notify the Company of his/her desire to work additional hours and said request shall remain in effect until revoked by the employee.
Either party shall have the right to terminate this agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice.
Dated March 28, 1991, and signed by G. Bruce Trull, Safeway Stores, Inc., and Dwayne A. Adkins. UFCW Local 7.
5.	Meat Cutters Bargaining unit--Colorado Springs. Establishes meat cutter floater pool for the Colorado Springs meatcutters signed by Dwayne Adkins, UFCW Local 7 and Bruce Trull and Gordon Todd, Safeway, Date 5/12/88.
All meat cutters with the exception of (Market Manager) Head Cutters, and one most senior cutter assigned to each store, shall be placed into a single “floater pool” within the bargaining unit.
When the Employer determines the hours necessary in the bargaining unit for said “floater pool", the seniority of floaters shall be honored, first in the weekly scheduling of floaters to the fewest number of stores, and secondly in scheduling a floater the greatest number of hours up to (40) forty in a week.
6.	Transfers and Seniority. Agreement added to all Colorado Meat bargaining units between Safeway and Meat Cutters Union Local 634 (now UFCW Local 7). Provides for continuous employment seniority after 30 days when an employee transfers between Colorado meat bargaining units. Effective January 10, 1978. Signed May 1, 1980. Resigned as a letter of agreement by Bruce Trull, Safeway and Al Pacheco, UFCW Local 7 on 7/27/94.
In the event an employee transfers from one area in the State of Colorado to a bargaining unit in the State of Colorado in the jurisdiction of Local 634 (now Local 7), then all continuous employment seniority with the Company shall be recognized by both the Union and the Company after thirty (30) days in the bargaining unit to which the employee transfers. In the event the transferred employee is laid off the new location, then the transferred employee shall retain the right to return to the area from, which the employee transferred during this thirty (30) day period in the new bargaining unit.
It is agreed that this provision shall become effective on January 10, 1978, and shall not be retroactive for employees who have previously transferred into a new bargaining unit.
7.	Layoff Procedures, Colorado Springs retail clerks and meat bargaining units. Clarifies layoff procedures in Section 75 of the retail clerks contract and Section 96 of the retail meat
60
contract for the Colorado Springs bargaining units. Signed by Bruce Trull, Safeway 12/18/94 and Michael Belo, UFCW Local 7 on 11/23/94.
1.	This agreement pertains to the implementation of layoff procedures in Section 96 of the retail meat contract and Section 75 of the retail clerks contract for the Colorado Springs bargaining units.
2.	The purpose of this agreement is to ensure that to the greatest extent possible in circumstances when multiple layoffs are necessary, the Company will operate the layoff procedures in Section 96 (retail meat) and Section 75 (retail clerks) so that the least senior employees in the bargaining unit will be the employees who are laid off. Therefore, the Company will discontinue its current practice. Instead, the Company will complete the process of offering and having the employee choose the layoff options with the first affected employee before going to the second affected employee, then will complete the layoff options with the second affected employee before going to the next employee, and so forth.
3.	Time limit for exercising options. When a reduction in the work force is necessary, the Company will notify the affected employee of his/her options in accordance with Section 96 of the retail meat contract of Section 75 of the retail clerks contract. If the affected person is notified of his/her layoff options before 11:00 a.m., the affected person must inform the Company’s designated representative (the district secretary, store manager, or other person handling the matter for the Company) of his/her chosen option by no later than 4:00 p.m. on the same day. If the affected person is notified of his/her options after 11:00 a.m., the affected person must inform the Company’s representative of the chosen option by 8:30 a.ni. on the next day. These are outside time limits, and the affected perspn is free to inform the Company of which option he/she chooses sooner than these time limits.
4.	Effect of not exercising option within time limits. If the affected person does not notify the Company of his/her chosen option within the time limits set forth above, the affected person will be deemed to have exercised the first option specified in Section 96 (retail meat) or Section 75 (retail clerks) that is available, assuming that the affected person qualifies for such option when the contract requires qualifications. For example, if a retail clerk employee does not notify the Company of his/her chosen option within the time limits, he/she will be deemed to have chosen the option in Section 75 of displacing a less senior employee within the same classification in the store or, if such option is unavailable, of displacing the least senior employee within the same classification in the bargaining unit.
5.	The Company will implement this procedure as soon as possible. If either party wishes to discontinue this agreement, it may do so after it has given written notice of at least 30 days to the other party.
