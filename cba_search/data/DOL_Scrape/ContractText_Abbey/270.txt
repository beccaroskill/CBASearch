PENSION BENEFITS
1.	A 5% increase shall be granted to all Pensioners and Beneficiaries on the rolls prior to October 1, 1989*
2.	All Standard Pension and Disability Pensions approved on or after October 1, 1989 shall be in the monthly amount of $200.00 plus $i0.00per month for each Pension Credit in excess of 20.
3.	All Normal Retirement Pensions and Vested Pensions for Employees who separate from covered employment on or after October i, ’ 989. shall be $10.00multiplied by the number of the Participant's Pension Credits.
4.	In all calculations the Husband-and-Wife reduction factors anc tne Partial Pension Credits reduction factors shall be applied where applicable.
How Are Pension Credits Accunlated?
For each calendar year starting with 1976 in which you work 1500 or more hours, you earn one (1) Pension Credit. If you work less than 1500 hours but at least 1000 hours you will earn partial Pension Credits. No Pension Credits are earned for any year in which you work less than 1000 hours. The chart below illustrates this rule:
Hoars of Service
Pension Credits
less than 1,000 1,000 - 1,199 1,200 - 1,499 1,500 or more
0 3/5 4/5 1
, Your working time during calendar years before 1976 (1975 and earlier) earns Pension Credits in a different way. In the calendar years before 1976 you earn one (1) Pension Credit if contributions were made on your behalf by your Employer for a certain number of months during the year. The number of months of contributions needed to earn a Pension Credit is different depending upon the Pension Fund in which you were a Participant and the years in which you worked. The chart below illustrates these rules:
Rane of Pension Plan	Time you First Became a Participant	Contributions Heeded to earn one Pension Credit in any year before 1976
"E” Fund	before 9/1/67	9 months
	9/1/67 to	
	12/31/75	10 months
Fund	all years	
	before 1976	10 months
"S” Fund	before 1/15/65	9 months
	1/15/65 to	
	12/31/75	10 months
“E" Fund = Employees Retirement Fund of the Electrical Manufacturing Industry.
’*F" Fund = Employees Retirement Fund of the i"| Innri nation
Products Industry.
"S” Fund = Employees Security Fund of the Electrical
Wholesalers Industry.
If you became a participant of the Employees Security Fund of the Electrical Products Industries on or after April 1, 1984, and you had participation in any one of the three (3) Funds prior to January 1, 1976, your Pension Credits will be calculated as if you had been a participant in the "E" Fund.
23
lew Are Vesting Credits Acoiwulated?
You earn one year of Vesting Service for each calendar ear in which you work at least 1,000 hours. You earn a onforfeitable right to a Vested Pension after you have arned ten (10) years of Vesting Service.
If you work for a contributing Employer in a ■osition not covered by this Plan after December 31, 975, and then move into a position of covered anployment with the same Employer, the noncovered hours dll be counted toward Vesting Service. The reverse is dso true. If you work in covered employment and then >ove into a noncovered position with the same Employer, you can get Vesting Credit for work in the noncovered rasition after December 31, 1975.
You are not eligible to earn Vesting Service for years before 1976 if you did not work at least 501 hours in 1975 or you did not work at least 1,000 hours in any year after 1975 before a permanent Break-in-Service has accurred as described below.
You are not eligible for Vesting Service for years Def ore 1971 unless, you accumulated at least three (3) years of Vesting Service after 1970.
Can You Lose Pension Credit and Vesting Service?
Yes, if you have a permanent Break-in-Service before you have earned at least ten (10) yearsof Vesting Service. A Permanent Break-in-Service occurred if you had a number of consecutive One-Year Breaks-in-Service which were equal to or greater than your years of Vesting Service. Beginning on January 1, 1987 you cannot have a Permanent Break-in-Service unless your number of consecutive One-Year Breaks-in-Service is at least five or is at least equal to your years of Vesting Service, whichever is greater.
A One-Year Break-in-Service occurred when, in any calendar year beginning with 1976, you worked less than 500 hours. If you work more than 500 hours in the two calendar years before you suffer a One-Year Break-in-Service, then your One-Year Break-in-Service is treated as a Temporary Break-in-Service. You will not lose your Vesting Service for years before any Temporary Break-in-Service. Here are some examples which illustrate this rule:
Example A: Brian worked over 1000 hours in 1984 and 1985. In 1986 he worked only 400 hours. In 1987 he worked over 1000 hours. Brian has three (3) years Vesting Service. In 1986 he suffered a One-Year Break-in Service, but he worked more than 500 hours in 1987, so he does not lose the Vesting Service he earned in 1984 and 1985.
24
Example B: Glenn worked 1000 hours in 1977, 1978, 197 and 1980. However, he left his job and did not work a— a Participant in 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1984. If Glen— returns and again works 1000 hours in 1985 he has on-year of Vesting Service. it the end of 1980 he ha<_ earned four (4) years of Vesting Service, but he ther-had four (4) consecutive One-Year Breaks-in-Service an<= so a permanent Break-in-Service occurred. If Glenr= returns to work now he becomes a new Participant ancB begins earning Vesting Service all over again.
Example C: Jerry earned four (4) .years of Vesting Service in 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983. He then worked less than 500 hours in 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987. In 1988 Jerry works 600 hours. Jerry has four (4) Years of Vesting Service. However, under the rules in effect as of January 1, 1987, Jerry does not lose his Years of Vesting Service because even though the number of his consecutive One-Year Breaks-in-Service are equal to the number of his Years of Vesting Service they are still less than five (5). Since Jerry works more than 500 hours in 1988 he keeps his four years of Vesting Service. Jerry does not earn a fifth year of Vesting Service in 1988 because he worked less than 1000 hours in that year.
How Does Military Service Affect Your Vesting Service or Pension Credits?
If you leave covered employment for up to five (5) years to enter active service in any branch of the United States Armed Forces, it will not be counted as a Break-in-Service, if you return to covered employment within 90 days after leaving military service. The years you spend in military service, for up to five (5} years, will count as years of Vesting Service,
Hom Does Maternity, or Paternity Leave, Affect Your Vesting Service?
Before January 1, 1987, you only earn Vesting Service for hours you actually work or for your time in military service. Starting in 1987 you will also be credited, with hours for Vesting Service purposes only, if you are absent from work by reason of pregnancy, birth, adoption placement or for purposes of caring for the newly born or adopted child in the period immediately following birth or placement. You will be credited with the hours of service you would have worked, (or eight (8) hours per day if the former can't be determined,) up to 501 hours in each calendar year so that a One Year Break-in-Service does not occur. The hours credited to you for maternity or paternity leave can only be used to avoid a Break-In-Service. They cannot be used to earn Pension Credits or years of Vesting Service.
Bom Does Vacation, Sickness, Disability or Sorters Conpensatioo Affect Your Vesting Service?
Starting in January 1987 an employee will be credited for hours of service for which he would have been paid, or entitled to payment by the Employer for reasons (such as vacation, sickness, disability or workers compensation) other than for the performance of duties. The total amount of time credited to an Employee for periods in which the non-performance of duties occur will be up to but not more than a maximum of 501 hours

DISABILITY PEHSIC9
When Are You Eligible For A Disability Pension?
You are considered disabled if, in the judgment of the Trustees, you are no longer employable in the Electrical Industry, or any other line of business.
To become eligible to receive a Disability Pension on or after April 1, 1984, you must:
• have at least 20 Pension Credits.
■ have 200 months of contributions to the Fund on your behalf in the last 20 years, and

■	be permanently disabled as defined above, and
■	be ineligible for a Standard Pension.
What Is The tarant Of Your Disability Pension?
The amount of the Disability Pension is the same as for the Standard Pension.
Your Disability Pension will continue for life, provided you remain permanently incapacitated or disabled.
WILL YOUR SOCHI. SECURITY BE AFFECTED BY THE PERS1CS
No, Social Security is separate. Your Pension Plan benefits are not affected by Social Security.
BOB ARE YOUR SURVIVORS PROTECTS!?
The Plan provides several types of protection for your survivors. If your retire, there are two (2) options available:
■	Husband-and-Wife Pension; or
•	36 Month Minimum Guarantee.
A lifetime benefit is provided both you and your surviving spouse under this option. You elect to have your benefit reduced during your lifetime. In return, upon your death 50% of the benefit amount you were receiving will be paid to your spouse for life. The amount by which your benefit is reduced, to provide payment to your spouse, depends on your age and your spouse’s age on the effective date of your Pension.
The Husband-and-Wife Pension is paid automatically unless you are not married or you and your spouse reject it by giving written notice to the Fund Office. If you decide you do not want your Pension in the form of a Husband-and-Wife Pension, you and your spouse must reject this option before Pension payments begin, or within ninety (90) days after you have been given a general description or explanation of the Husband-and-Wife option, (as opposed to the single-life Pension), by the Conmittee. In addition, eligibility for a Husband -and-Wife Pension requires a Participant to be married when the Pension Payments begin, and requires the Participant to be married for at least one full year before the Participant's death.
If your spouse dies, or you get divorced, before pension payments begin, the pension is then paid in the single-life, unadjusted amount.
When a Pension, granted before 1/1/B7, begins payment in the Husband-and-Wife form it cannot be changed even if there is a death or divorce. However, such form of Pension, granted on or after January 1, 1987 will include a "Pop-Op" feature. This feature will increase the amount of the Husband-and-Wife Pension (to the Single-Life amount) whenever the Spouse predeceases the Pensioner provided such occurrence is properly reported to the Fund Office.
29
The Husband-and-Wife Pension applies to a Disability Pensioner who begins receiving pension payment on or after January 1, 1985.
The percentage by which your Husband-and-Wife Pension is reduced from the full, single-life pension may be found in the following tables:

36 Month Guarantee
If you, as a Pensioner receiving the full, single life, unadjusted pension amount, die before receiving 36 monthly payments, then your beneficiary will continue to receive payments until a total of 36 monthly payments have been made. If you have already received at least 36 payments before the time of your death, there will be no farther payments to your beneficiary. The 36 month guarantee is not available to participants receiving a Vested Pension.

Your rviving spouse may elect to receive either a total of monthly pension payments at the full single life, adjusted amount, or the survivor’s lifetime annuity .d under the Husbaad-and-Wife Option. These payments 1 begin shortly after your surviving spouse applies this benefit.
31
Effective August 23, 1984, if you die after earning at least ten years of Vesting Service, but before reaching the minimum retirement age and are survived by a spouse, your surviving spouse will be eligible to receive the pension benefit which would have been available had you stopped working on your date of death, lived to reach the minimuni retirement age, retired at1 the minimum age having elected to receive a Husband-and-Wife Pension and then died. Your spouse may not begin to receive benefits until the first day of the month following the month in which you would have reached the minimum retirement age.

You should come to the Fund Office at least ninety (90) days before your retirement date. At such time you will again be advised of the Pension options available to you and how your choice will affect the pension you will receive. You will be given assistance to complete your application form. Such early filing will help in the processing of your application and the payment of your benefits.
WHEN DO PEHSI(S PAYMENTS BEGIN?
If all the requirements of the Pension Plan have been met, your pension will become effective on the first day of the month following either the date you last work or the date your application is filed in the Fund Office, whichever occurs last.

(i)	the monthly benefit shall be suspended for any month in which you return to work in disqualifying employment.
(ii)	in addition, the monthly benefits shall be suspended for the 6 consecutive months after any consecutive period of one or more months during which you return to disqualifying employment.
32
(ill)	if you misrepresented to the Plan with respect to disqualifying employment, the monthly benefit shall be suspended for an additional period of six (6) months. The Trustees may, for good cause, waive either or both of these additional periods of suspension.
(b)	After Normal Retirement Age:
(i)	The monthly benefit shall be suspended for any month in which you worked or are paid for 40 hours or more in disqualifying employment.
If you return to covered employment and complete a year of Vesting Service, your retirement benefit will be recomputed, four new benefit will be based on additional Pension Credits ' and your age upon subsequent retirement, reduced by the number of months for which you already received benefits.

Certain benefits to which you are entitled under the Pension Plan are insured by the U.S. Government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).

The amount of you pension that is guaranteed depends on your years of service and the level of your monthly benefit under the Plan. a benefit increase is guaranteed only after it has been in effect for five years. The PBGC guarantee may be higher for people who retired before Sugust, 1980.
For more information on the PBGC insurance protection and its limitations, ask your Plan Administrator (Fund Office) or the PBGC.
