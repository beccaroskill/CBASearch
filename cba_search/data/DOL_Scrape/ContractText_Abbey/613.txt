AGREEMENT
This Agreement made and entered into this 3rd day of August 2008 between Superfresh, Baltimore Division (hereinafter referred to as "Employer") and United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 27, chartered by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, (hereinafter referred to as the "Union").
This Agreement shall be binding on all signatories hereto, and their successors and assigns, whether such status is created by sale, lease, assignment or any other type transfer transaction. In consideration of the Union's execution of this Agreement, the Employer promises that its operations covered by this Agreement or any part thereof shall not be sold, conveyed, or otherwise transferred or assigned to any successor without first securing the Agreement of the successor to assume the Employer's obligation under this Agreement and to offer employment subject to the terms of this Agreement, to all of the Employer's then current employees, recognizing their accrued seniority for all purposes. Provided, that the Employer shall not be a guarantor or be held liable for any breach by the successor or assignee of its obligations, and the Union will look exclusively to the successor or assignee for compliance with the terms of this Agreement. The foregoing shall be applicable in cases only where the Employer sells or transfers more than 10% of the facilities covered under this Agreement, and shall not apply in cases of store closing.
GENERAL
The Employer and the Union each represents that the purpose and the intent of this Agreement is to promote cooperation and harmony, to recognize mutual interests, to provide a channel through which information and problems may be transmitted from one to the other, to formulate rules to govern the relationship between the Union and the Employer, to promote efficiency and service, and to set forth herein the basic agreement covering rates of pay, hours of work and conditions of employment.
The Union and the Employer agree to utilize a quality of work life structure to provide a mutual basis for problem solving. It is further agreed to utilize outside (neutral) sources to provide guidance and advice to increase the effectiveness of this program. Such QWL Program shall be implemented with the opening of the store or the conversion of a store to Superfresh. The resulting QWL Program will not become involved in disputes covered under the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure and will not conflict with any terms or conditions of this collective bargaining agreement and will not reduce any rights for or privileges of the employee or Employer.
ARTICLE 1	- MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY
The authority and responsibility for the management of the business, including but not limited to, the planning, direction and control of the work force shall remain exclusively in the Employer and its appointed representatives, subject to the provisions of this Agreement.
3
Should the Employer intend to substitute electronic checkout systems for existing equipment in any store, the Employer agrees to notify the Union in advance and to provide the Union a list of all employees regularly assigned to the store on the effective date of the utilization of said systems. Said employees shall not be removed from the Employer's payroll as a result of the installation of such a system. Employees may continue to be transferred, assigned to other work, or laid off in accordance with the seniority provisions of this Agreement provided the lay off is for reasons other than the installation of such a system.
ARTICLE 2	- RECOGNITION
Section 2.1 The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative for all of its employees (excluding Supervisory employees as defined in the NLRA) covered by this Agreement coming under the jurisdiction of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local 27. The Employer further agrees that if a new store or stores are opened within the jurisdiction of Local 27 this Agreement shall apply to such new store or stores.
Section 2.2 Employees who are hired and/or promoted into the Assistant Manager classification after ratification of this Agreement shall be exempt from the coverage of this Agreement. Employees classified as Assistant Managers as of the date of ratification shall have the option of either remaining in the bargaining unit or being exempt from coverage of the Agreement. This option shall be exercised before February 1, 1993.
Section 2.3 All work and services connected with, or incidental to the handling or selling of all merchandise offered for sale to the public in the Employer's retail establishments covered by this Agreement shall be performed only by employees of the Employer within the unit referred to above for which the union is recognized as the collective bargaining agency by the Employer except such work as may be performed at the point of delivery by Driver-Salesmen in servicing retail markets with perishable bakery products, greeting cards, magazines, beverages and potato and corn chips directly from the delivery vehicle. Further excepting that representatives of a company sponsoring special promotions may erect and stock initial special displays in connection with said special promotions. There shall be limitation of three (3) times per year for promotional programs using persons other than employees of the Employer, provided, however, that such special promotions must be area-wide promotions. The Employer shall notify the Union in writing prior to the beginning of any promotional program. The application of this provision shall in no way restrict the work which may be performed by the Store Managers, Supervisory Employees and Supermarket Services, Inc. for health and beauty aids and general merchandise.
Section 2.4 It is agreed that only meat employees covered by this Agreement shall handle meats, poultry, fish or delicatessen products, whether fresh, frozen or smoked. The Employer agrees that all such products will be cut, packaged, prepared and sold by employees under the jurisdiction of this Union and that these employees will continue to handle such items as had been customarily handled in the past and which had been prepared and packed on or off the premises. Likewise all such products which heretofore customarily come to the Employer
4
already packed by the producer or distributor shall be handled as heretofore. Greeting cards and Magazines may be serviced by outside salesmen and representatives.
The Employer further agrees that all fresh meat products will be cut, packaged, prepared and sold by the Meat Department employees in the stores covered by this Agreement. Exceptions may be made provided the Union is notified in advance and given written assurance that no member's job will be eliminated as a result of such exception. The Union agrees it will not withhold its agreement. For the purpose of this paragraph, "notified" shall mean a letter for each individual introduction of a class of product (e.g., boneless sub primal cuts of meat, deveined liver, rolled veal, etc.). The Union reiterates, therefore, its intention with respect to the "products clause," as follows: the Company may introduce new methods and new products (i.e., make exceptions) provided it does the following:
A.	Union must be notified in advance.
B.	Company will list all new products or new methods in a letter of notification.
C.	Company will give written assurance that no member's job will be eliminated.
If A, B, and C above are complied with, the Union will not withhold its agreement. As always, the Union reserves the right to discuss with the Company any new method or product for the purpose of making such new introduction more readily and smoothly acceptable to the customers and to the members.
Section 2.	5	The Employer shall notify the Union thirty (30) days prior to a store closing. The
Employer shall negotiate the effect on employees of the store scheduled to be closed.

Section 3.1 All employees shall, as a condition of employment, become and remain members of the Union on and after the thirty-first (31) day following the date of employment, or on and after the thirty-first (31) day following the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is the later.

Seniority shall not accrue to the probationary employee until completion of his ninetieth (90th) day of employment at which time the probationary employee's seniority shall become established as of the date of his employment. During the said ninety (90) day probationary period, probationary employees shall be subject to layoff, recall, discipline, or termination of their employment at the discretion of the Employer without being subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in this Agreement.
Section 3.6 In the interest of promoting cooperative relations, the Store Manager shall introduce each new employee in his store to the Union Shop Steward within one week after the new employee reports to work.

Section 4.1 Seniority for the purpose of this Agreement shall be calculated by continuous service from the last date of employment (except otherwise provided). Seniority list for all full time Grocery Department employees and a separate list for all part time Grocery Department employees, also a seniority list for all full time Meat Department employees and a separate list for all part time Meat Department employees shall be set up by the Employer and shall be furnished to the Union upon request. Seniority areas governing this Agreement are outlined in Schedule D attached hereto and made a part hereof and apply to employees with two (2) years or more seniority.
6
In connection with layoffs and store closings, seniority by classification will apply first to store then seniority area. When a full time employee is involuntarily reduced to part time, he shall continue to accrue seniority as though he was still full time. When a full time employee voluntarily reduces himself in writing, his part time seniority is dated from the original date of hire. Employees laid off due to store closings or reduction in employment shall be laid off as follows:
A.	The least senior full time employee in the job classification being reduced shall be laid off from his store. The full time employee so laid off shall have the right to displace the least senior employee of the same job classification within the seniority area. If there is no junior full time employee of the same job classification within the seniority area, any full time employee so laid off shall then have the right to displace the least senior part time employee of the same job classification within the appropriate seniority area, provided they can perform the available work.
B.	In recalling employees laid off and in placing employees who were reduced to part time back on full time, the ordinary rules of seniority shall prevail except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. In recalls from layoff, the Employer shall notify the employee by certified mail.
C.	Employees bumping as a result of layoffs, will be afforded the opportunity to return to their original store before a permanent employee of the same job classification is hired in said store.
Section 4.2 The Employer agrees to give a week's notice or a week's pay in lieu of a week's notice to full time employees with six (6) months service and three (3) days notice or three (3) days pay to part time employees with twelve (12) months service who are laid off due to lack of work. All employees likewise shall give a week's notice prior to intended resignation. It is mutually agreed that after termination notice has been given by either party, no new request for sick benefits shall be granted.
Section 4.3 Employees laid off due to the store closing or reduction of employment shall be laid off by order of the most recent hired and shall be rehired in the reverse order of the layoff, with due consideration given to job classification. Employees laid off and subsequently recalled within twelve (12) months will retain former seniority. After twelve (12) months all employees who have been laid off, bumped, or those affected by a store closing or sale, shall be put on a preferential hiring list and they shall be given the right to the next available job opening before any new hired employee.
Full time employees to be laid off shall have the option of part time employment, and shall be placed at the top of the part time seniority list, or may take a complete layoff. They shall have the right of recall on any full time opening, provided they can do the work. Full time employees reduced from full time to part time through no fault of their own will retain their Health and Welfare and Pension coverage for a period of six (6) months even if, they work fewer hours than specified in Article herein. The Employer will continue the full time Health and Welfare and Pension contribution for said period of time.
7
For the purpose of layoff and recall, Delicatessen Clerks, Weighers and Wrappers, Meat Apprentices and Seafood Clerks shall be considered in the same job classification and seniority group. First Cutters and Journeyman Meat Cutters shall be considered in the same job classification and seniority group for layoff and recall purposes. Before a Journeyman Meat Cutter can be reduced to part time or laid off within the store, all apprentices must be laid off within the store. Where the application of this provision creates a hardship or operational problem, the Union and the Employer agree to discuss and resolve the problem.
Section 4.4 The Employer recognizes the principle of seniority as being one in which the movement of an employee from one job to another or from one location to another through promotion, demotion, layoff, recall after layoff, or permanent transfer, shall be governed by the length of service of the employee. In the matter of promotions, where experience and ability are reasonably equal, seniority shall be the governing factor.
Section 4.5 The Employer agrees to advise the Union of all increases, all terminations, and of all the dates of hire on a monthly basis. The Employer will notify the Union of all promotions to Department Head classification.
Section 4.6 Part time employees desiring full time work, full-time Night Crew employees desiring full-time day positions and lower classified employees desiring to upgrade in classification shall be given preference for such work in accordance with the following procedure. Employees desiring such work shall notify the Employer in writing, with a copy to the Union, during the periods March 1st to March 21st and September 1st to September 21st each year. Such letters shall remain valid for eighteen (18) months. The Employer shall provide to the Union the request lists no later than April 11th and October 12th of each year. The first consideration for any such vacancies shall be given to employees with a current request in order of the employees seniority with ability to do the work to be considered first within the store then the seniority area specified in Schedule D. Full time jobs created as the result of new store openings will be filled on the basis of seniority from the request list in the seniority area specified in Schedule D. The Union shall be notified of all full time openings.
Section 4.7 Part time employees who are promoted to full time shall receive credit for time worked on the basis of one (1) full time week credit for every two (2) weeks of part time service and the employees full time seniority date will be adjusted accordingly.

Dear Mr. McGinley:
This will confirm our understanding regarding the following:
During the course of negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement for 2008-2012, it was agreed that where Superfresh voluntarily recognizes Local 27 as the collective bargaining representative of a unit of employees in a store not currently covered by our collective bargaining agreement and places the store under our agreement, it is not necessary for there to be a Dana posting in the store, and therefore there will be none. If the National Labor Relations Board or a State or Federal court or agency, issues a decision that would mandate that the application of this Agreement is contrary to such decision, then this Side Letter Agreement shall immediately be null and void.

Dear Mr. McGinley:
This will confirm our understanding regarding the following:
Pursuant to the agreement between Super Fresh and UFCW Locals #27and 400 to permit the health and welfare reserves in the FELRA Health and Welfare Fund to be drawn down to a 3-month level, the parties hereby agree that, following ratification of a successor collective bargaining agreement, Super Fresh shall participate in a Fund reserve "draw down" that will reduce its Health and Welfare Fund contributions by an amount that is proportionately equivalent to the draw down received by Giant/Safeway, as a percentage of contributions.
Calculations have been performed with the understanding that Super Fresh has already paid contributions for May-August 2008, and would begin taking a credit applied to health and welfare contributions in order to obtain the same draw down benefit as received by Giant/Safeway. To effectuate this "reserve draw down," the Fund Administrator has calculated all levels of Super Fresh's current monthly contributions shall be reduced to approximately 7.73% of their current rates (a reduction of 92.27%) for a period to be determined by the trustees, based upon a target three month reserve level, provided that the total draw down period and amounts will not be less than the period or amounts required to obtain a proportional draw down savings as the total savings received by Giant/Safeway.
The Fund shall verify all necessary contributions in order to implement this agreement.
The trustees have noted that they will reevaluate the credit process as reserves are reduced to a 4 month total.
Sincerely,
George Murphy, Jr.
