If the employee is recalled to a different job status than the one the employee held at the time of the RIF the employee will be offered the opportunity to change back to their prior status, if a position is available, prior to another employee being recalled. Recall rights shall only apply to the employee group which formed the basis for the RIF.

If the employee fails to return to work within the fourteen (14) day period, he/she will forfeit any future recall rights- The Employer is obligated to recall an employee only once during the recall period. Any subsequent interest in a vacant position must be initiated by the employee.
In the event that a recalled employee presents satisfactory written documentation from his/her then current employer that the employee is unable to return to work within fourteen (14) days of the initial contact because of the requirement to provide notice of termination to his/her then current employer, the employee shall be granted an additional seven (7) days to return to work-The employee must present the written documentation to the Employer within three (3) days of the initial contact to die employee that he/she is being recalled by the

Side Letter of Agreement No. 1 Patient Staffing Ratios
The Employer agrees to establish a group to discuss Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN and Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) Patient Ratios and to include the Union in such discussions.
Side Letter of Agreement No. 2 Retroactive Wage Increase Payout
Dimensions Healthcare System and 1199 SEIU United Healthcare Workers East agree on paying out retroactive wage increases to employees in the Healthcare Workers bargaining unit, per the following understandings:
The period for retroactive payment will be the pay period beginning June 19, 2005 through the pay period ending December 31, 2005 (“the retro-period”).
Except for those employees whose base hourly rate is less than $9.78 per hour, retroactive pay amount will be calculated based on the employee’s W-2 earnings for the retro-period. The percentage increase of 2.3% will be reduced by 4.3% to account for differentials that are not subject to the wage increase. Therefore the W-2 earnings for the retro-period will be multiplied by 2.21% to determine the total retroactive payment amount.
For those employees whose base rate is less than $9.78 per hour, their retroactive pay for the period will be the difference between their base rate of pay and $ 10.00 per hour, calculated on each individual employee’s hours worked or hours paid during the retro period and including the extra half time for overtime hours, but not including On-Call rates, Weekend Differentials, Shift Differentials, and/or Float Differentials.
The total retroactive pay amount for each employee will be paid out as follows:
1.	For bargaining unit employees with a date of hire prior to June 19, 2005, a payment of $100.00 retroactive pay will be made in the regular paycheck on December 23,2005, provided that the employee is actively employed as of December 4, 2005. For purposes of this Agreement “actively employed” means that the employee is on the payroll in any capacity and has not resigned his/her employment or been terminated. The payroll advice will have a separate line item marked “Retro.”
2.	The balance of the retroactive pay, and the retroactive pay for bargaining unit employees
hired cm or after June 19, 2005, will be paid in the regular paycheck on March 17,2006, subjec t to the condition that in order for the emplo yee to be eligible for the retroactive payment he/she must be actively employed as of February 26, 2006. For purposes of this Agreement “actively employed” means that the empk yee is on the payroll in any capacity and “ has not resigned his/her employment or been terminated. The payroll advice will have a separate line item marked “Retro.”
