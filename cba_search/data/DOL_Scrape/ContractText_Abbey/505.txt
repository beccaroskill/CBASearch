S n JOINT COMMITMENT STATEMENT
Today’s dynamic energy markets demand innovation and responsiveness. Ai the same time, Union members desire employment security, higher skilled jobs, and an improved standard of living. We believe the flexibility needed to be successful in this challenging environment can be attained when the Union is included in the planning processes and recognized as the collective force of NYSEG represented employees. As such, their institution and process of collective bargaining must be treated with dignity and respect.
As bargained, this Agreement contains the framework to transform the workplace through Union-Management involvement. It is a vision in which the Company becomes more customer-driven in outlook and operations, and the Union’s role is enhanced through involvement in decisions affecting their work.
We will expand relationships at three levels with standing joint committees: Leadership Committee (Executive/System Council level), Operating Committee (Generation, T&D, Customer Service, Administration/System Council designees), and Business Committee (Principal Managers/Local Union President and designees). Each level has a role in making this joint commitment a way of life at NYSEG.

AGREEMENT
Between
SYSTEM COUNCIL U-7 Consisting of LOCAL UNIONS
83,249,966, and 1143 of the
INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS (hereinafter called the Brotherhood)
and
NEW YORK STATE ELECTRIC & GAS CORPORATION (hereinafter called the Company) An Equal Opportunity Employer
ARTICLE I
Representation and Recognition
(A)	This Agreement is made for the purpose of establishing stabilized conditions of employment, including rates of pay and working conditions, facilitating the peaceful adjustment of differences that may arise from time to time between the parties hereto, and for promoting harmony and efficiency, to the end that the Company, the Brotherhood and the general public may mutually benefit.
It is agreed that in the event the Company should change its name or its ownership, this Agreement shall be binding on its successors or assigns.
The Brotherhood has proved to the satisfaction of the Company that it represents a majority of all production and clerical employees, as defined in Section (C) below, of the Company. Accordingly, the Company recognizes the Brotherhood as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining representative of the employees in the said bargaining unit and agrees to meet and treat with authorized representatives of the Brotherhood with respect to the rates of pay, hours of labor, and other conditions of employment of such employees.
2 ARTICLE I (A) - Continued
The several Local Unions of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, parties to this Agreement, have established a System Council for the purpose of dealing jointly with the Company in regard to matters covered by the terms of this Agreement. The Company hereby agrees to recognize and deal with said System Council for the purpose stated herein. In discussion of Job Specifications or in the adjustment of grievances applicable to this Agreement, or in the discussion of matters of mutual concern, the System Council U-7 shall appoint and normally be represented by a subcommittee of not more than four (4) members. One of the members of the subcommittee shall be the Secretary of the System Council U-7.
(B)	During the period of this Agreement, the Company will not meet nor treat with any other labor organization with respect to the employees in the bargaining unit hereby established and confirmed.
(C)	Production employees are defined as those whose work is chiefly of a physical character, who handle tools, operate machinery or equipment as evidenced by the schedule of jobs marked Exhibit “A” and attached hereto and made a part hereof.
Clerical employees are those in the classifications listed in Exhibit “B” attached hereto and made a part hereof, but excluding Secretaries and Human Resources Department employees.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the word “employees” shall apply to regular, full-time employees, who have successfully completed their probationary period, in the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement and shall include persons temporarily employed to replace employees within the bargaining unit, who have been granted a military leave of absence,
(D)	All employees within the bargaining unit who were members of the Brotherhood as of the effective date of this Agreement or who thereafter become members shall, as a condition of continued employment, remain members in good standing during the period of this Agreement. All persons newly hired on a permanent basis during the period of this Agreement for job classifications covered hereby or thereafter permanently transferred to job classifications within the bargaining unit shall, as a condition of employment, be required to make a bona fide application for membership in die Brotherhood on or after the 30th day after their date of employment or transfer or the effective or execution date of this Agreement, whichever is later. All persons not now members of the Brotherhood who were hired after January 1,1941, for classifications within the bargaining unit or subsequent to their employment transferred to classifications within the bargaining unit, shall be required to make a bona fide application for membership in the Brotherhood on or after the 30th day following their employ

ARTICLE 1 (D) - Continued 3
ment or transfer to a position within the bargaining unit or the effective or execution date of the Agreement, whichever is later. In the event that an employee covered hereby fails to comply with the requirements of this section, die Company shall, within thirty (30) day’s after receipt of written notice from the Brotherhood, discharge such employee.
(E)	Persons, except cooperative trainees and students hired between terms, hired for temporary bargaining-unit vacancies will be required to make application for membership in the Brotherhood on or after their 30th day of such continuous employment, and thereafter remain members in good standing during the period of this Agreement, if they continue to be employed in a job shown in Exhibits “A” and “B”. In the event that an individual covered hereby fails to comply with the requirements of this paragraph, the Company shall, within thirty (30) day’s after receipt of written notice from the Brotherhood, discharge him. These provisions in respect to the requirement of temporary people to join the Union do not -change their status under the definition of the bargaining unit in Article*! (C) which defines the “employees" represented by the Union as regular full-time employees in bargaining-unit jobs who have successfully completed their probationary period. Neither does it entitle the temporary personnel to any rights or benefits under the Agreement other than those explicitly provided for them in those portions of the Agreement which specifically refers to them.
(F)	It is agreed that persons temporarily employed in the classifications covered by the Agreement, except as provided in Section (C) of this article, shall work under the general rules with respect to hours of labor and rates of pay laid down in this Agreement for the period of their temporary employment. This paragraph shall be interpreted to require only that the Company pay to temporary persons not less than the qualifying rate of pay for the job to which assigned while so employed; and to pay the appropriate overtime rate for all hours worked in excess of eight per day, and for all rest day work, depending in each case, upon the schedule to which assigned and upon the character of the work to which assigned, as defined in Article VII, Section (B) hereof.
• (G) Temporary employees may be employed for work in Production jobs:
(1)	In any classification for a period not to exceed 15 days.
(2)	In the lowest job classifications in situations which it is anticipated will continue for nine (9) months or less.
(3)	In the higher job classifications in the event the provisions of Article XIV (B) (referring to filling of vacancies) fail to produce a

ARTICLE I (G) - Continued (•)
competent regular employee to fill a temporary vacancy in the higher job classification.
(4)	When a temporary’ employee is hired in one of the higher classifications under (G) (3), above, for a transmission construction pro-
ject which will last more than 12 months, the job such employee occupies will be posted at the end of 9 months under provisions of Article XIV, governing Vacancies and Promotions. If the job is filled by a regular employee the temporary employee will be displaced. If not, the job will again be posted after a second 9-month period, if the assignment will last 3 months beyond that, and bids from regular employees will again be considered in accordance with Article XIV.
Employment of temporary employees in the higher job classifications other than such long-term projects, shall not exceed 9 months unless the provisions of Article XIV (B) fail to produce a competent regular employee to fill a continuing vacancy when 9 months has elapsed. •
* For the purpose of Section (F), temporary employment, within the classifications covered by this Agreement, shall not exceed 9 months within a 12-month period. ★
If temporary employees are continued longer than 6 months they shall be entitled to the rates of pay, hours of labor, vacation benefits and holiday pay provided herein for regular employees.
Such temporary employment shall not result in the layoff, or loss of regular time, of any regular employee.
Temporary employees will have their date of employment adjusted to reflect all previous time worked where no break in service of 60 days or more has occurred.
ARTICLE II
Check-off of Union Dues
On presentation by the Brotherhood to the local Human Resources Department of Authorizations to Check-off Union Dues of members of the Brotherhood, the Company shall deduct weekly from the wages of such members the amount of dues provided for in the authorizations, (or as subsequently amended by the Local Union in accordance with its Constitution and By-Laws and certified to the Company by the Financial Secretary of the Local Union) and shall remit the same monthly within 10

ARTICLE II - Continued
5
day’s of the date of last deduction in the month to the Financial Secretary of the appropriate Local Union.
Such deductions shall be made from pay earned in each weekly payroll period if such earnings exceed the amount of the authorized dues deduction, after other deductions. If deductions cannot be made in any week the Local Union will be notified. The Company will deduct missed Brotherhood dues later in the same month in which an employee is absent, if possible.
Hie Company, in making these deductions, acts only as agent for the Union and shall not be responsible for errors or negligence in making or failing to make deductions.
The Company will terminate such deductions in the event that the employee's employment is terminated or the employee’s position is no longer subject to this Agreement. An employee can revoke his authorization by sending 30 days’ notice to cancel his dues deduction to the local Human Resources Department via certified mail.
ARTICLE III
Employer-Brotherhood Relationship
It is mutually understood and agreed by the parties to this Agreement that:
(A)	The management of the Company and the direction of the working forces, including the right to hire, suspend, discharge for proper cause, promote, demote or transfer, and the right to relieve employees from duty because of lack of work or for other proper and legitimate reasons is vested and reserved in the Company, subject, however, to the limitations provided in this Agreement.
(B)	There shall be no discrimination, interference, restraint or coercion by the Company or any of its agents against any employee because of his membership in the Brotherhood or because of any lawful activities on behalf of the Brotherhood.
(C)	The Brotherhood and the Company will continue to comply with applicable legal provisions regarding non-discrimination in employment based on race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, physical or mental disability, marital status, or veteran status.

•-Applies to Production	W-Applies to Clerical
6 ARTICLE III (D) - Continued
and advancing its welfare and prosperity providing, however, that such cooperation shall not be detrimental to the interest of the Brotherhood or its members in any manner.
(E)	It is further agreed that all questions of mutual concern and interest, not specifically or wholly covered by the terms hereof, arising during the term of this Agreement, shall become the exclusive concern of the International President of the Brotherhood and of the President of the Company, or of their specially authorized deputies, and their mutual decision in these matters shall be binding on all concerned for the period of this Agreement.

(I)	In view of these pledges, therefore, the terms of this Agreement are to be applied so as to pennit the Company to meet operating conditions arising out of small and scattered operations, without incurring unreasonable delay and expense. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as denying the right of the Company, within the limitations of this Agreement, to assign to such work whatever qualified employees may be available, as circumstances permit. In this connection, employees shall be expected to perform related work or less skilled work for which they are qualified if, in the opinion of the Company, it is necessary or advisable for them to do so.
(J)	(1) If any employee, covered by this Agreement, becomes elected or appointed to an office in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, requiring his absence from duty with the Company, he/she shall be permitted a leave of absence without pay, after reasonable notice to the Company, and shall continue to accumulate seniority with the Company throughout his/her term of office. Upon termination of his/her duties with the Brotherhood, he/she shall be reinstated to his/her former position, at the prevailing rate of pay for such position, or if it has been eliminated, to a position as nearly comparable as possible, together with all his/her seniority rights, provided he/she is then physically qualified to perform the duties of the job.
ARTICLE 111 (J) - Continued
7
An employee on leave of absence with the IBEW in accordance with this article shall be entitled to continue benefits as set forth in this provision, on the same basis as a regular full time employee but subject to the limitations noted in this provision, only when such leave has been predetermined not to exceed 12 months. Benefits will continue for 1 month for each full year of service the employee has completed when the leave begins, up to a maximum of 12 months. The parties may mutually agree to apply this provision to an employee for more than one leave of absence for Union business, but it is not intended to be renewed for consecutive leaves, such as might be granted to a Business Agent(s) elected or appointed from year to year.
The retirement plan, group term and paid-up life insurance and health insurance shall continue and the employee will accumulate credited service for pension purposes. He/she shall contribute to such plans on the same basis as an employee on regular status, at his/her rate of pay at the start of the leave, increased by general wage adjustments granted while he/she is on leave, or by rate increases resulting from reevaluation, but not by job progression increases he/she might have received in his/her Company job. He/she shall be entitled to improvements in such benefits which may be negotiated while he/she is on leave.
While on leave he/she will not earn vacation credits nor be entitled to compensation for lost time such as holidays, or other wage payments. If he/she is covered by IBEW insurance, the Brotherhood will be considered the primary employer for coordination of benefits purposes. If he/she becomes ill or disabled while on leave of absence for Union business, he/she shall not be entitled to benefits under General Bulletins No. 3 and No. 5. The parties will discuss the eligibility of an employee disabled while on such leave for benefits provided under General Bulletin No. 2 and the Disability Retirement Plan in each such case.
(J) (2) This provision shall govern leaves of absence for the full time Business Agent(s), only. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, the terms and conditions of (J) (1) shall be inapplicable to the Business Agentfs).
If any employee, covered by this Agreement, becomes elected or appointed as full time Business Agent(s) for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, requiring his/her absence from duty with the Company, he/she shall be permitted a leave of absence without pay, after reasonable notice to the Company. During such leave of absence an employee shall continue to accumulate seniority with the Company throughout his/her term of office for bidding rights, vacation entitlement, and General Bulletin No. 2 and No. 3 purposes.

The Company will require a physical examination, by a physician of its choosing, prior to the time when the employee returns to active service with the Company from a leave of absence to serve as Business Agent(s). In order to protect both the employee returning from leave and the Company employees, the returning employee will be required to satisfactorily complete a six month training and evaluation period to insure that his/her skills are consistent with Company standards.

If the employee does not return to active duty with the Company within thirty day's of the earlier of (a) tennination of his/her Business Agent(s) responsibilities, or (b) the expiration of his/her leave, the right to return will expire.

(4)	There will be no compensation paid to bargaining unit employees meeting with the Business Agent(s) with the exception of grievance meetings as provided for in Article XVII of the Labor Agreement.

ARTICLE IX (M) - Continued 29
(5)	Disability benefits are calculated on the basis of 5 day's in any one calendar week. If a holiday falls within a three-day sick-leave waiting period, the employee will receive full holiday pay. the day will count as a waiting day, and the employee will not be required to count the day as sick leave.

(A)	Effective upon ratification, the Company guarantees jobs, and no reduction in pay to regular, full-time employees with 10 or more years of continuous service whose jobs are eliminated by changes substantially within its control, such as introduction of new’ equipment, procedures or methods, or the planned retirement of obsolete facilities — as opposed to changes resulting from sudden technical, legislative, regulatory, environmental or economic events or conditions over which it has little influence.
The parties may mutually agree to apply this job security policy to elimination of jobs for any reason.
The Company will also endeavor but cannot guarantee to provide employment to employees with less than 10 years of service whose jobs are eliminated for the reasons stated above, at the prevailing rates of pay for available jobs and subject to the needs of job security employees with 10 or more years of service.

The employee’s right is to continuing employment, in any job and at any location that is available, and not to any specific job. The Company’s first endeavor will be to assign the eligible employee to a suitable job at a comparable rate at his present location by taking advantage of turnover, job vacancies, retirements, and the use of temporary employees. However, as such jobs may not be available, the Company has the unrestricted right to assign job security employees to any available jobs at any Company location without regard to any restrictive provisions of the Agreement. Jobs reserved for job security employees need not be posted.

However, the Company may subsequently, at its discretion, award jobs at a higher rate than the first job security assignment to an employee receiving a former rate that is higher than the rate for his present job, without posting, until he reaches the wage level of the job he held at the time he was assigned to job security.
Reassigned employees shall be given proper instruction and training on the job during the qualifying period.
(C)	Employees in the job Security Program with 10 or more years of service, and employees with less than 10 years of service who are displaced by senior employees, and employees with more than 2 but less than 10 years of service whose jobs are surplus because of factors within the Company’s control, shall have the option to take either the new assignment offered, or severance pay, as provided in General Bulletin No. 1. The provisions of General Bulletin No. 1 shall apply, except that such employees shall have the unrestricted right to severance pay.
(D)	Job Security employees who are offered a job which they do not want may displace employees with less than 10 years of service in their present location and in the same bargaining unit from jobs in the usual line of promotion to the job security employee’s present job or from jobs which he has formerly qualified for if, in the Company’s opinion, he is currently able and qualified to perform them. The job security employee exercising this option will take the rate for the job he is preempting. The option to displace employees with less than 10 years of service shall be available to job security employees in descending order of seniority.
42
ARTICLE XV (E)
(E)	Employees displaced by the above provision or employees with less than 10 years of service whose jobs are surpassed may displace junior employees in the same District, under the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, or accept severance pay.
Senior clerical employees can displace junior clerical employees in any job for which the job specifications require no previous experience. The classification of 1261 Laborer 1/C shall be considered a basic production job, common to all occupational groups for this purpose.
(F)	Job Security' employees assigned to jobs in a new District retain their seniority in the old District for a period equal to the amount of seniority' in the old District. Seniority in the new District includes seniority in the old District. If an employee is awarded a job in the old District by the bidding procedure within the specified period he recovers his seniority in that District and begins to accumulate additional seniority from the date of reporting to the job.
(G)	If the new job assignment of a Job Security Program employee with 10 or more years of service requires him to move, the Company will pay the mover’s bill. The Company will also pay the employee’s reasonable temporary' living expenses for up to 30 days prior to moving, and reasonable premove expenses associated with the search for a new residence.
(H)	If an employee is rolled back to a job in which he has not been fully qualified, he shall enter it at the fully qualified rate of pay or the rate of pay to which he is entitled as a result of 10 or more years of service, whichever is greater, but shall fulfill usual qualification requirements.
An employee who is assigned to a lower-rated job than the one in which he has been regularly assigned, because of a reduction in the work force, shall have a right superior to that of any other bidder to return to his former classification when it is posted if he is physically qualified. This shall apply only to the first posting of a permanent job and not to any subsequent posting.
Employees laid off because of lack of work shall be reinstated, within their respective Districts, in the reverse order of their layoff, if, within two years after layoff, need for their services arises and they are then found physically qualified to do the work. When the Company recalls a laid-off employee to work, it shall notify both the laid-off employee and the Brotherhood seven days in advance of a contemplated reinstatement. An employee who fails to report as directed for a job of like status shall forfeit all right to reinstatement.
ARTICLE XV (I)
43
(1)	The Vice President-Human Resources shall be advised as soon as possible of contemplated reductions in force where the Job Security Program would apply. The affected employees will be the most junior employees by classification, by division. The employees affected will be listed, giving location, name, present job, present rate, years of service, and date employee will be available. The list will be sent in duplicate to the Vice President-Human Resources who will in turn send it to the Secretary of the System Council U-7, with a copy to the President of the System Council, not less than 30 days prior to elimination of jobs. This shall constitute assigning the affected employees to the Job Security Program.
(J)	Situations that may arise in the administration of the Job Security Program not covered by this article will be considered on their merits.
ARTICLE XVI
Reductions in Force Not Covered by Job Security
(A)	When it is necessary to curtail forces in any District for reasons other than those covered in Job Security, Article XV, the Company will give to the Brotherhood 14 days advance notice of contemplated reductions of force within the bargaining unit, together with a list of employees affected. Rollbacks will begin with those employees having the least seniority. The junior employees in the classification in which the surplus exists shall be placed in the next lower classification in normal and usual line of promotion. If a surplus then exists in that classification the process shall be repeated until the lowest classification is reached. If a surplus then exists in the lowest classification the junior employees shall be laid off. The classification of 1261 Laborer 1/C shall be considered a basic production job common to all occupational groups for this purpose. No senior employee or the designated Local Representative of the Brotherhood shall be laid off as long as any work is being done by the junior employee which the senior employee or representative can reasonably be expected to do.
(B)	An employee who is assigned to a lower-rated job than the one in which he has been regularly assigned, because of a reduction in the work force, shall have a right superior to that of any other bidder to return to his former classification when it is posted if he is physically qualified. This shall apply only to the first posting of a permanent job and not to any subsequent posting.
(C)	Employees laid off because of lack of work shall be reinstated, within their respective Districts, in the reverse order of their layoff if, within two years after layoff, need for their services arises, and they are then found
44
ARTICLE XVI (C) - continued
physically qualified to do the work. When the Company recalls a laid-off employee to work, it shall notify' both the laid-off employee and the Brotherhood seven days in advance of a contemplated reinstatement. An employee who fails to report as directed for a job of like status shall forfeit all right to reinstatement.
ARTICLE XVII
Grievances and Arbitration
(A)	A grievance is hereby defined as an alleged violation of the law governing the employer-employee relationship, or an alleged violation of the terms of this Agreement, or any type of supervisory’ conduct which unjustly and unlawfully causes an employee to lose his job or any benefits arising out of his job.
(B)	If any dispute arises between the Brotherhood and the Company as to any unadjusted grievance or as to the rights of either party under this Agreement, both parties shall endeavor to settle such matter in the simplest and most direct manner. Both parties must adhere to the time limits set for in each step of the grievance procedure. If the Brotherhood requests a meeting and Management does not schedule one or obtain Brotherhood agreement to a time extension, within the time limit set for a step of the procedure, the grievance will proceed to the next step upon timely notice to Management by the Brotherhood. The procedure, unless changed, or any step thereof waived, combined or extended, by mutual consent, shall be as follows:
FIRST: Within 15 calendar days of the occurrence of the grievance, between the aggrieved employee and his supervisor. A Union representative may be present at the employee’s request. If not satisfactorily settled, then
SECOND: Within a further period of 18 calendar days after the written grievance has been submitted between a grievance committee of the Brotherhood (not exceeding three) and the supervisor concerned and the supervisor’s superior or the appropriate Manager. (A written grievance to be submitted within 10 calendar day’s after completion of the First Step.)
At the completion of this step, if not adjusted to the mutual satisfaction of the parties, then, within a further period of 5 working day’s after completion of the second step, a committee composed of one representative of the Local Union and one representative of the Company designated by the respective parties shall establish which facts and issues are agreed upon and which are in dispute; each conferring with the appropriate members of his own organization.
ARTICLEXVII (B)-Continued
45
THIRD; Within a further period of 40 calendar days between a System Council Committee (International Representative present at the discretion of the Brotherhood) and a Vice President or an authorized representative (or a representative of the President). (Also see: Article VII (H) regarding new work schedules; Article XIV (L) regarding suspension or discharge; and Exhibit “D” Common Training Provisions, paragraph 6 regarding training extensions.)
FOURTH: Within 10 days following the completion of the foregoing steps, the Brotherhood shall advise the Company that an acceptable solution to the question in dispute has not been attained. After December 17, 1999, for all cases where the System Council gives the Company notice that a case will proceed to arbitration, the System Council will have a period of one (1) year to request a Panel of Arbitrators. If the System Council requests a Panel within the one (1) year period, the parties must then select an arbitrator and proceed to arbitration. If the System Council does not request a Panel within the one (1) year period, the case will be deemed withdrawn, with prejudice.
For all cases on which arbitration has already been requested by the System Council prior to December 17, 1999, the System Council shall have a period of two (2) years to request a Panel of Arbitrators. If the System Council requests a Panel within the two (2) year period, the parties must then select an arbitrator and proceed to arbitration. If the System Council does not request a Panel within the two (2) year period, the case(s) will be deemed withdrawn without precedent or prejudice to any other case.
The Board of Arbitration shall be composed of one representative of the Company, one representative of the Brotherhood, and a third and impartial member to be designated by mutual agreement between the other two members. If such mutual agreement cannot be achieved within 10 days the third member must be designated by agreement between the Company representative and the Brotherhood representative from the arbitration panel of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The Board of Arbitration so constituted shall consider the merits of the question or dispute and shall render a decision thereon. A decision made by a majority’ of the members of the Board of Arbitration shall be binding upon the Company and upon the Brotherhood for the duration of the Agreement. The Board shall meet at any place chosen by mutual consent, each party bearing the expense of its own arbitrator and jointly bearing the expense of the neutral arbitrator.
46
ARTICLE XVII (C)
(C)	Employees acting as representatives of the Brotherhood, normally not exceeding three in number, may discuss grievances without loss of straight-time pay. At the Third and subsequent steps, the Brotherhood will be represented by not more than four members, one of whom will be the Secretary of the System Council U-7- But no employee shall be paid under this section for time spent in discussing grievances unless he is scheduled to work during the time in which the discussion lakes place, When discussing grievances with the Company, time off shall be granted upon prior notice to and consent of the immediate supervisor of the employee concerned.
(D)	No Board of Arbitration shall alter or annul or otherwise disregard any provision of this Agreement, nor shall it render any decision except in respect to whatever matter is specifically committed to it. However, in the event of the layoff or discharge of an employee, the Board of Arbitration may uphold the action taken, order the employee reinstated with full rights including restoration of lost pay, or direct that the penalty was too severe and order instead a suspension from employment without pay for a specified period.
ARTICLE XVIII
No Strikes — No Lockouts
The Brotherhood agrees that, during the period of this Agreement, there shall be no strikes, walkouts or other concerted cessation of work by the Brotherhood, and the Company agrees that there shall be no lockouts of the Brotherhood, it being the desire of both parties to provide uninterrupted and continuous service to the public.
ARTICLE XIX
Separability Clause
If the enactment of legislation, or a determination of a court of final jurisdiction (whether in a proceeding between the parties or in one based on a similar statement of fact) invalidates any portion of this Agreement it shall not affect the validity' of the rest of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force according to its terms in the same manner and with the same effect as if such invalid portion had not originally been included herein.
ARTICLE XX
47
ARTICLE XX
Term of Agreement
(A)	This Agreement, superseding all other agreements between the parties covering production and clerical employees, subject to the approval of the International President of the Brotherhood and the President of New York State Electric & Gas Corporation, the terms of which are separable and shall not be limited nor qualified unless by mutual written consent, shall become effective as of July 1, 2000, and shall continue in effect through and including June 30, 2005 and from year to year thereafter, unless either of the parties hereto shall, not less than 60 days prior to any July 1st date thereafter, notify the other party in interest of its desire to amend or terminate the Agreement effective July 1, 2005 or any subsequent July 1st. Changes in this Agreement, however, may be made at any time by mutual consent.
(B)	Inasmuch as System Council U-7 consisting of Local Unions 83,249, 966, and 1143 are a part of and are affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Company pledges its utmost good faith to the end that the terms of this, or of any other agreement, entered into between the Company and any affiliated Local Union of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, shall be strictly observed. Further, inasmuch as the operations of the Company in one area are affected by conditions in other areas, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers pledges its utmost good faith to the end that the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement between the Brotherhood and the Company shall be strictly observed. Accordingly, each party agrees that willful violations or unlawful refusals to abide by the terms of any of these agreements shall become the concern of the International President of the Brotherhood and the President of New’ York State Electric and Gas Corporation, mutually, and their mutual decision to amend or terminate or extend or limit this Agreement or any other agreement, or all of them, shall become binding upon all parties thereto.

5.	Trainees will be eligible to take a formal written test on each unit of training when they have fulfilled these two requirements: (1) the successful completion of the appropriate training units; and (2) a satisfactory Trainee General Appraisal on their job performance.
6.	If extended training is required and the trainee is not advanced, the Local Union President will be notified. When the extension is a result of a test failure, the job tests bearing a failing mark will be reviewed by a committee consisting of a member of Management and a representative of the Brotherhood. If this committee agrees that the trainee has failed the test, the provisions of this Agreement will apply. If agreement cannot be reached, the matter will be referred to the Vice President-Human Resources and the System Council President for review.

1. Apprentice Gas Fitters will be selected by the Company from those who show evidence of mental ability and physical ability and aptitude for the work as indicated by appropriate tests and other customary selection guides, including Article XIV,
2-8. See Common Provisions (paragraphs 2-8).
9 (a) For those apprentices entering the Gas Fitter Progression program prior to 1/1/98, at the end of the third sixmonth period, a Gas Fitter trainee wall be given a written test to determine his fitness to advance to the fully qualified second-class grade. He will again be tested al the end of the fourth six-month period, to advance to Qualified Helper with increased responsibility as set forth in the Job Specification for classification No. 1034, Gas Fitter 2/C.
If the Company elects to defer the promotion at the end of the fourth sixmonth period, it is understood that the employee thereafter will be expected to perform only those duties normally required of Gas Fitters 2/C below the Qualified Helper level. During this period of restricted duty, the employee will be subject to emergency callouts for such restricted duties.

Written and performance based tests will be given as follows. He will be given a test at the end of the sixth month to advance to qualifying fitter 2/C. He will be tested at the end of the twelfth month to determine his fitness to advance to the fully qualified fitter 2/C grade. He will again be tested at the end of the eighteenth month to advance to Qualified Helper with increased responsibility as set forth in the Job Specification for classification No, 10.34, Gas Fitter 2/C. Further testing will occur at the end of the twenty-seventh month and thirty-sixth month.
GAS DEPT. TRG. & PROG. - Continued 83
If the Company elects to defer the promotion at the end the eighteenth month, it is understood that the employee thereafter will be expected to perform only those duties normally required of Gas Fitters 2/C below the Qualified Helper level. During this period of restricted duty, the employee will be subject to emergency callouts for such restricted duties.
10.	Advancement to Customer Service Mechanic 1/C or Gas Welder shall not be included in the job progression plan, but shall depend on the existence of a vacancy, as determined by the Company
Gas Welders shall be selected from those who have had prior welding experience or training, when such employees are available, giving preference to Gas Fitters I/C who have completed the training program. They shall be given formal training during the six-month qualifying period and shall be made fully qualified at the Gas Welder rate, based on a satisfactory general appraisal and Welder qualification test, as provided in the job specifications.
If there are no qualified bidders among Gas Fitters 1/C who have completed the training program, preference will be given to Gas Fitters 2/C who are Qualified Helpers. If a Qualified Helper is awarded a Gas Weider job he will be advanced to the fully qualified rate upon successful completion of the usual qualifying period. However, he will be expected to complete the balance of the training program for Gas Fitter 1/C as described in this Memorandum. If he fails to do so, the Company may return him to the wage level and the point in the program from which he moved to the Gas Welder classification.
Gas Welders may be selected and trained from outside the Gas Department if there are no qualified bidders from within the department. Such employees shall remain at the wage level for Welder General while they are completing a concentrated two-year Gas Fitter training program. After two years they shall advance to the wage level for Gas Welder, based on satisfactory general performance appraisals over that period and a second welder qualification test.
11.	It is the policy of the Company to promote from within whenever possible. If a Gas Fitter 1/C, Gas Welder or Customer Service Mechanic 1/C vacancy exists, the job will be posted on a District and Area basis, stating the amount of training an employee must have completed to be considered eligible to bid for the vacancy.
12. If a vacancy is posted as provided in paragraph 11, and there are no
qualified bidders, the qualified employee with the least seniority in the

GAS DEPT. TRG. & PROG. - Continued
District where the vacancy exists may be placed in that job, and required to establish residence in or near that community within three months. The employee's moving expenses will be paid for by the Company.
13.	The Company may decide to selectively post the vacancy statewide before it requires an employee to fill the vacancy as provided in paragraph 12. In case there are two or more qualified bidders for a selective statewide posting, the bidder having the greatest total production unit seniority in one or more Districts will be awarded the job. If there are no qualified bidders on a selective statewide basis, the Company reserves the right to fill the vacancy as provided in paragraph 12.
14.	If there are no qualified bidders for the selective statewide posting, the Company may elect to attempt to hire from the “outside” before requiring an employee to fill the vacancy as provided in paragraph 1$ and 12. The “outside” person may start either as a first or second class, depending on previous experience. Advancement to first class, fully qualified, will require that the appropriate training program tests are passed.

SECT. OPERATORS TRG. & PROG. - Continued
2-6, See Common Provisions (paragraphs 2-6).
7.	The length of the training period will not be more than 3 years or less than one year, A trainee bidding from a job in which he has been paid a rate higher than Wage Uvel 13, but less than Wage Level 19, will be increased one wage level when he begins the job and will progress one wage level al the end of each six-month interval until he reaches Wage Level 20. Bidders from classifications paid at Wage kvel 13 and below, and new employees, will begin at Wage Level 14 and advance one wage level at the end of each of six six-month intervals. However, if preliminary training is accelerated so that the trainee is assigned to operate a section alone before progression as shown on the following chart has taken him to Wage Level 18, he shall be advanced immediately to Wage kvel 18 and shall then advance to Wage Levels 19 and 20 at six-month intervals. Each advancement will be based on a satisfactory’ performance appraisal or an appraisal and test, as shown on the following wage progression and testing schedule.
8.	A formal test (No. 1 on the following progression and testing schedule) will be given to ail trainees at the end of the first six-month period. This test shall be written and may include a performance test in which the trainee demonstrates aptitude in basic skills. Those who have a satisfactory performance appraisal and who achieve a passing test score in both skill and knowledge will advance a wage level unless already at Wage Level 20, as shown on the schedule. Those who fail to achieve a passing score will be returned to their former classification or assigned to such other work as may then be available. Once having failed the first six-month test, the employee will not again be considered for Section Operator training.
9.	After the first 6 months, training to the fully qualified level will continue as show on the following schedule, with satisfactory completion of each six-month interval established by a test and/or appraisal. The trainee may have a second chance to complete each six-month unit satisfactorily, with the exception of the first one. If the employee fails a test or receives an unsatisfactory’ appraisal, he will remain in the same wage level and will be retested or reappraised once only after an additional training period of six months. If he fails this retest or does not receive a satisfactory reappraisal, Management agrees to make a sincere effort to place him in an appropriate job, if available, for which he might be reasonably expected to qualify If such work cannot be found, Management will discuss the matter with the Brotherhood in an effort to arrive at a solution before any termination of employment becomes effective.
10.	Trainees entering the program at Wage Level 18 or higher will take tests 2 and 3 within the second six-month period. They may elect, with their
SECT. OPERATORS TRG. & PROG. - Continued 101
supervisor’s consent, to take test 2 at the end of the 9th month or to take it at the same time as test 3, at the end of the 9th month or to take it at the same time as test 3, at the end of the 12th.
11.	Trainees may reach Wage Level 20, as a result of bidding into the job from a higher wage level, before they have completed the training program and become fully qualified. The fact that they are at the “fully qualified rate" for the job will not diminish their responsibility to complete the training and become fully qualified as to skill.

EQUIPMENT OPERATOR CLASSIFICATIONS
April 27,1967
The rate of pay for Driver-Worker, Job No. 1285, dated December 15,1967, has been mutually agreed to as Wage Level 11 because the classification was created as an equal and parallel job to Driver-Worker-Line. The Driver-Worker-Line classification is restricted to the Line Department; the Driver-Worker classification may be used in any department.
An Equipment Driver/Operator “B” will not operate earth-boring equipment to dig holes, set poles, or load poles without qualified supervision.
The parties further agree that a Driver-Worker-Line or a Driver-Worker will be the minimum classification to drive and operate trucks of two-ton carrying capacity or more. A Driver-Worker will also be assigned to assist the Equipment Driver/Operator “A” when he is operating a pole hauler with self-loading equipment.	4 -1
A vacancy will be posted and awarded under Article XIV of the Agreement if a regular operator is to be assigned to equipment which has not previous

ly had a regular operator. A Driver-Worker-Line who has been regularly assigned to a pole hole digger or a line truck with a dangle digger but who has never or seldom operated the auger and who will be expected to operate it in the future, shall be trained to do so and reclassified to Equipment Driver/Operator “B” when trained. A Driver-Worker-Line who is not so reclassified will not be permitted to operate the auger.
If new types of equipment are acquired, the Company will discuss assignment of the appropriate Equipment Driver/Operator classification to operate them with the Brotherhood. Failure to reach agreement promptly shall not delay operations. In such cases, the Company will assign a classification to the new type of equipment, subject to completion of discussions and the grievance procedure.
GAS DEPARTMENT
CONTRACTING AND SUPERVISION
April 26,1967
A Chief Gas Fitter, or higher-rated Gas Department Supervisor, will supervise construction crews engaged in main and service work requiring several employees and a consequential amount of equipment. This will include new services on which the Company does the whole job, including excavation and backfilling. It will also include tie-ins to mains. A Chief working on several jobs in the same day will move various members of his crew and pieces of equipment from place to place for most efficient use of these resources.
A Fitter 1/C or Gas Welder will direct the work of one other employee in the same or lower classification directly assisting him in such work as gas main and service maintenance, leak repair and regulator maintenance. He may also direct employees performing such duties as equipment operation, digging and backfilling, directing traffic, restoration of grounds and clean up.

110 GEN, STATION TEMR ASSIGN.
GENERATING STATION EMPLOYEES
TEMPORAR1IY ASSIGNED TO
OTHER STATIONS RESCHEDULING AND PAYMENT OF EXPENSES
Revised July 1,1989
This Memorandum applies to employees assigned to work at stations other than their home base for periods which require one or more nights away from home. It modifies Articles VI (D) and (E) and VII (D). This Memorandum does not supercede, cancel, modify or interpret any other agreement, understanding or practice between the parties except as explicitly stated, and only to the extent stated, in this Memorandum,
The Company will continue to give preference to its employees in performing the type of generating station maintenance work they have done in the past, when feasible. Calls for temporary assignments to other stations for this purpose will be rotated among the stations, to the extent possible within the limitations imposed by the skills needed at the borrowing stations, and the operating and maintenance requirements of the loaning stations. If work skills and capacities are equal, employees at a loaning station who desire such assignments will be given preference before those at that station who do not seek such work are assigned. Such preference shall not reduce the opportunities for overtime work at the home base station that would be normally offered to the employees who receive more than the average number of temporary assignments at other stations because others prefer not to go or are unavailable.
A.	TEMPORARY RESCHEDULING OF DAY WORKERS
(1)	Day workers temporarily or regularly assigned to a station conducting a major overhaul (lasting more than two weeks on a day and night basis) may be rescheduled to a night schedule (on their regularly scheduled days) upon 72 hours advance notice, with the understanding that if an emergency arises, only 24 hours advance notice of change of schedule will be required. It is further agreed that where an employee, after change of schedule as above provided, reverts to his original hours of labor, no notice of reversion is required, provided 8 hours rest, between assignments, is granted.
(2)	Day workers rescheduled in accordance with the above paragraphs will be paid the basic rate plus, for the first 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week worked between 3:00 p.m, and 8:00 a.m., they will receive credit toward shift bonus (See Article VIII (B))_ Additional hours thereafter will be paid at the appropriate overtime rate.
GEN. STATION TEMP. ASSIGN. - Continued
111
B.	LIVING EXPENSES AND TRANSPORTATION
Employees temporarily reassigned to other stations will be paid a uniform per diem allowance to cover lodging, meals and local transportation, in an amount agreed upon between the Company and the System Council and reviewed not more frequently than annually. For the term of the present Agreement this per diem allowance shall be $95.00.
Employees temporarily assigned to other stations will be paid for mileage at die prevailing rale for one round trip for each assignment of any length if an overnight stay is required. Employees will be paid at the beginning and at the end of the temporary assignment. This will be done either by payment of overtime or by permitting them to travel within the scheduled workday.
LINE & UC&M DEPARTMENT MEMORANDA UC&M AND LINE PERSONNEL BURIED DISTRIBUTION WORK
March 8,1968
New technology has resulted in new methods for burying distribution circuits that customarily have been carried by overhead construction. This practice is becoming common in the electrical utility industry. It has been referred to as “URD”, “RUD", and “Buried Overhead Distribution”, without any common agreement as to precisely what these terms mean. This memorandum is to provide better definition of the new buried systems as contrasted to conventional underground installations, and to clarify the use of Company personnel in employing the new methods.
Conventional underground systems are defined as those in which rigid conduit connects manholes and vaults and contains lead-sheathed cable or other cable requiring customary wiping skills, and customary taping skills to distribute electrical stress, in making splices and terminations.
UC&M Department crews of varying size and composition will be utilized to install cable and equipment and make splices and terminations and to do dead and live maintenance work in conventional underground systems.
A UC&M or Line Crew or a combination crew, of varying size and composition at the discretion of operating supervisors, may be utilized to install buried distribution cables and equipment, to make splices and terminations and perform dead and live maintenance work outside of conventional underground systems and not involving lead-sheathed cable, wiping
112
LINE & UC&M - Continued
joints, or taping to distribute electrical stress. This work may include laying direct-burial cable, preconduitized cable and empty flexible conduit. Such crews may later install cable through such conduit. Sections of rigid conduit may be used under paved areas or other surfaces that cannot be distributed without considerable expense or inconvenience. The splices and fittings involved are largely prefabricated and are assembled by simple processes such as, but not limited to, bolting, snapping on or using pressure tools. They may involve preconstructed stress cones or insulating compound which is shaped by the design of the fitting or by a prefabricated mold or container. Taping for mechanical protection or mechanical strength may be required. Transformers and other electrical equipment may be buried, pad-mounted or pole-mounted.
As in the past, Line Department employees may assist UC&M Department crews in pulling cable and in other work not involving complex electrical skills on conventional underground systems. Equipment operators and other production employees may perform phases of work on conventional and other underground systems which do not exceed duties covered by their job classifications.
CHIEF LINE MECHANICS AND LINE MECHANICS 1/C ASSIGNED ADDITIONAL SUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITY
July 1, 1991
BONUS FOR MORE THAN FOUR EMPLOYEES
A Chief Line Mechanic (Job No. 222, Wage Level 20) regularly supervises not more than four other employees.
When a Chief Line Mechanic is assigned to supervise more than four employees in addition to himself for a period of five or more consecutive regularly scheduled workdays, he shall be paid at Wage Level 21 for the duration of such assignment. For such assignments for a lesser period, but lasting four hours or more, he shall receive an extra one hour’s straight-time pay for each day. He shall be paid at his regular rate for callouts or prearranged overtime periods unless he supervises more than four additional employees for four hours or more on such occasions.
SUBSTITUTION FOR CHIEF OR LINE SUPERVISOR
When a Chief Line Mechanic or Line Supervisor is absent, a Line Mechanic 1/C will normally be assigned in his place and paid under the provisions of
LINE MECH. - ADD. RESPONS. - Continued 113
the preceding paragraphs. However, another Chief Line Mechanic or Line Supervisor may be assigned to take over the crew of an absent Chief or Une Supervisor.
COMBINED CREWS
The provision for payment of a one-hour bonus or payment at Wage Level 21 to a Chief Line Mechanic for supervision of more than four employees in addition to himself will not apply if two or more crews are working independently on the same job, even if one Chief Line Mechanic coordinates material and paper work.
The bonus provision will apply if combining two or more crews under the supervision of one Chief Line Mechanic results in that Chief supervising more than four employees in addition to himself, which may include the Chief Line Mechanic (Line Mechanics) who would otherwise supervise the added employees, if they are designated by Management as subject to his supervision, for four consecutive hours or more.
Management shall designate which Chief Line Mechanic shall supervise such combined crews, guided by the following principles:
(1)	If one Chief is more capable of supervising the specific assignment, he shall be designated.
(2)	If ability to carry out the assignment is reasonably equal and both crews are from the same locality, the senior employee shall be assigned.
(3)	If ability is reasonably equal and one crew is from an area other than that in which the job is being performed, the Chief in whose area the work is being done shall be designated.
INSTRUCTORS FOR LINE TRAINING CREWS
The selection of a Chief Line Mechanic to be temporarily assigned as the instructor of an Apprentice Line Mechanic training crew shall not be subject to the posting and bidding procedure of the Agreement.
TEMPORARY LINE SUPERVISOR ON MAJOR CONSTRUCTION
A No. 221 Temporary Line Supervisor at Wage Level 21 may be assigned at Management’s option instead of a Chief Line Mechanic or Line Supervisor, to supervise Line crews for ten days or more on transmission or distribution construction projects.
Chief Line Mechanics will receive first consideration for such assignments, in order of seniority, and then Line Mechanics 1/C. Management shall have
114 LINE MECH. - ADD. RESPONS. - Continued
sole right of selection.
Employees so assigned will retain membership in the bargaining unit and return to it at the end of the assignment. They will retain their bargainingunit seniority' and will continue to accumulate such seniority' while on a Temporary' Line Supervisor assignment; they will not accumulate qualifying advantage for Chief Line Mechanic vacancies. During such assignments they will be removed from the call list.
TAKING CHAKGE OF EMERGENCY CALLOUTS
Unless a supervisory employee is present, a Line Mechanic 1/C shall be designated by Management to take charge of a line crew consisting of two or more employees called out for emergency work. If such work continues for four hours or more, his hourly rate shall remain unchanged but he shall receive in addition a bonus equal to one hour’s straight-time pay for each such separate callout.
MODIFICATION OF PRIOR AGREEMENTS
This memorandum interprets Article XIV 0) and Article X (B) as they apply to Line Mechanics 1/C and Chief Line Mechanics only. Article XIV is titled “Vacancies, Promotions, Reassignments and Discharges’’ and (J) refers to substitution bonuses; Article X is entitled “Emergency Callouts” and (B) covers supervision during emergency callouts. It also interprets the Preamble of the Production Job Specifications dated April 15, 1964 as it refers to the distinction between Chiefs and Foremen. This memorandum also supersedes and cancels the following previous agreements: the Memorandum titled “Premium Pay for Chief Line Mechanics Supervising Combined Crews”, dated January 25, 1962; the May 23, I960 letter from ER. Doughty to Managers covering Chief Line Mechanics instructing Apprentice Thaining Crews; Company item No. 13 of the Memorandum dated June 27, 1967, covering the negotiations settlement, as it relates to Temporary Line Foremen.
This memorandum does not supersede, cancel, modify or interpret any prior agreement, understanding or practice between the parties except those explicitly mentioned above, nor does it apply to or set any precedent for job classifications other than Chief Line Mechanics and Line Mechanics I/C.
UC&M COMBINED CREWS
H5
UC&M MECHANICS 1/C SUPERVISING
COMBINED CREWS
July 10,1963
New York State Electric & Gas Corporation and System Council U-7 of the IBEW agree that a UC&M Mechanic 1/C shall receive a substitution bonus or a temporary assignment when he is assigned to supervise two combined UC&M crews for four or more consecutive hours, if the total number of journeymen or qualified helpers in the combined UC&M crews is four or more journeymen or qualified helpers including himself, and if the UC&M Mechanic 1/C who would otherwise supervise the added employees becomes subject to his supervision.
When a UC&M Mechanic 1/C is temporarily assigned to supervise such combined crews for a period of five or more consecutive regularly scheduled workdays he shall be temporarily assigned to the classification of Chief UC&M Mechanic. For such assignments for shorter period, but for four consecutive hours or more, he shall receive an additional one hour’s straight time pay at his regular rate for each day in which such a period occurs.
In addition, a UC&M Mechanic 1/C shall receive a substitution bonus when assigned to supervise one or more UC&M Mechanics 1/C for four or more hours.
Management shall designate which UC&M Mechanic 1/C shall supervise combined crews, guided by the following principles:
(1)	If one UC&M Mechanic 1/C is more capable of sujxjrvising tire specific assignment, he shall be designated.
(2)	If ability to carry out the assignment is reasonably equal and both crews are from.the same locality, the senior employee shall be assigned.
(3)	If ability is reasonably equal and one crew is from an area other than that in which the job is*being performed, the UC&M Mechanic 1/C in whose area the assignment is being done shall be designated.
The provisions of this agreement will not apply if two UC&M crews are working in close proximity' to each other, such as in the same substation, but are not working jointly on the same assignment. They will not apply if two crews are working independently on the same job even if one UC&M Mechanic 1/C prepares or coordinates all the material requisitions and other paperwork.

15KV CLASS OF VOLTAGES GLOVING
15KVCLASS OF VOLTAGES
GLOVING
Renewed July 1,1991
The Joint Committee that has been studying and developing the techniques and practices for gloving up to the 15 KV class will remain as a Committee and will continue to develop procedures for gloving higher voltages up to the 15 KV class.
Management will continue and expand the established program for training Line Mechanics in gloving the 15 KV class of voltages, in Districts having such voltages.
Management states that during the Term of the Agreement effective July 1, 1991, it will not use the so-called “barehand maintenance” technique for performing work on energized electric lines or require gloving of energized circuits above 7,200 volts delta from a pole or a Line platform commonly referred to as a “board”, or gloving of energized spacer cable from pole, platform or bucket.
