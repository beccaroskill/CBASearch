ARTICLE VI Compensation and Hours of Employees
Section 1. Wage Scale and Rates.
(a) (1) Establishment. The wage rates for Head Janitors, Assistant Head Janitors, Helpers and other existing job classifications in which employees are presently employed have been negotiated and have become fixed contract rates applicable to such classifications. Such rates shall not be less than the minimum rates established for such jobs in this Agreement and may, in particular instances, be higher than the minimum rates. In no event shall existing rates which are higher than the minimum rate be reduced but, instead, shall be increased by the amounts specified in Subsection (a) of this Section 1. The increases shall not apply to Swimming Pool Attendants. The wage rates for such job classifications at premises not heretofore covered by this Agreement, or, if covered, for jobs not established at such premises, shall be the rates specified in this Agreement for such classifications or, where no fixed rate is established for a particular classification, shall be the rate established by negotiations between the parties, based upon the wages applicable to such jobs in premises of the same general type in the same general area. In respect to job classifications falling within Paragraph (a) (7) of this Section 1, it is recognized that no uniform rate for such job can be established in view of the non-uniform nature of their job content and it is, accordingly, agreed that the rate for each such job shall in each case be established by negotiations taking into account the particular duties to be performed by employees in each such job, provided that the negotiated wage rate for any Maintenance Employee shall be not less than the wage rate for a Helper A on the premises. Any controversy which arises in setting a wage rate under this Agreement which cannot be settled by negotiations shall be settled under the arbitration procedure set forth in Article XV.
Note: all pay increases take effect in the first full pay period after the dates stated.

Effective December 1, 2015, all such employees shall receive an increase of 2.0% over their wages in effect on November 30, 2015, except that in the case of gross hardship the increases to be effective may be the subject of negotiations with the Union Vacancies in such jobs shall be filled at a wage rate not less than the minimum of the rate negotiated with the Union for that job in effect at that time except that the rate for the job in effect at that time shall not apply when it was negotiated in respect only to a particular employee upon special facts applicable to such employee and/or the duties to be performed and which do not apply to the replacement for such employee. Effective December 1, 2016, all such employees shall receive an increase of 2.0% over their wages in effect on November 30, 2016, except that in the case of gross hardship the increases to be effective may be the subject of negotiations with the Union. Vacancies in such jobs shall be filled at a wage rate not less than the minimum of the rate negotiated with the Union for that job in effect at that time except that the rate for the job in effect at that time shall not apply when it was negotiated in respect only to a particular employee upon special facts applicable to such employee and/or the duties to be performed and which do not apply to the replacement for such employee.
(a) (7) Maintenance Employees. The monthly wage rate for any Maintenance employee shall be negotiated between the Union and the Employer pursuant to subsection (a) (1) of this Article VI, provided, however, that in no event shall the minimum monthly wage rate for any Maintenance employee be less than the wage rate for a Helper A on the premises.

(c) Parking Lots. Effective May 1, 1998, with respect to all buildings having parking lots adjacent thereto, no additional compensation shall be required for servicing such lots. However, all employees hired prior to May 1, 1998 who have performed such services under the Agreement effective from December 1, 1996 through November 30, 1998 and who were paid additional compensation for such services shall continue to perform such services and shall continue to be paid such additional compensation.
Section 2. Condominiums and Cooperatives. Wages for employees in cooperatively owned buildings or condominium apartment buildings shall be equivalent to the wages applicable to rental buildings of the same general type for the same general area.
Sections. Bonuses. Any payments made by the Employer which are in excess of the wage rates established under this Agreement and which are made at its discretion shall be considered as bonus payments and shall not be considered as a part of the established wage rate hereunder for that employee, provided, however, that such payments shall not be deemed to be bonus payments unless made with the knowledge and approval of the Union. Bonuses shall apply only to the individual employees who are receiving them. Bonuses for such individuals shall not be reduced by nor shall they be offset against any wage increases due under this Agreement. Bonus payments need not be included in computing sums due to the Local No. 1 Health, Training or Pension Funds.
Section 4.	Living Quarters. Head Janitors (and Assistant Head Janitors and other employees for whom it has been negotiated or who are otherwise being so provided, whether or not they are exclusive service janitors) shall be provided living quarters, rent free, with all such services as are customarily provided a tenant in the premises as part of such tenant's rent, including air conditioning. Such apartment shall be heated at the expense of the Employerand shall be decorated at least once every two (2) years at the expense of the Employer. In the event, however, that decorating services are not provided to tenants, such Janitors shall be provided with the necessary paint and other materials required to decorate the apartment and reasonable time off within which to perform that work. In any event, however, the apartment shall be decorated at the expense of the Employer when such janitor is replaced by another such janitor in the building. No Employer shall be required to furnish the Janitor more than one (1) apartment as living quarters but such apartment shall include one (1) bedroom if there is such an apartment in the building and shall be in good and habitable condition. No employee shall be required to post a security deposit for an apartment. No Employer shall be required to furnish living quarters for any Helper or other classification of employees or for relief janitors. It is expressly agreed, however, that the cost or value of any living quarters, decorating or any other tenant services provided in accordance with this Agreement shall not be considered or included as part of the wages paid to any employee covered by this Agreement, but shall be deemed only to be in addition to such wages, and for the convenience of the Employer. Nor shall the value of the living quarters be deemed, in whole or in any part, as an offset against overtime or any other pay which may otherwise be due to an employee.
17
An employee who is provided an apartment under the provisions of this Agreement may be required to sign a lease if the Employer requests the employee to execute such lease. However, such lease shall become operational and binding only on the effective date when the employee's right to occupy the apartment as an employee expires. Upon termination of the employee's rights to continue the occupancy of the apartment, whether such termination of the employee's occupancy rights have been effectuated by discharge for just cause by the Employer or voluntary termination of employment by the employee, shall any lease, regardless of the date of such lease, become effective. Upon termination of an employee who has not executed a lease, such employee's tenancy shall be considered month to month and shall be deemed covered by the terms and conditions of the most recent standard lease form used at the premises by the owner or manager. It is expressly understood that this Agreement takes precedence over such a lease and any provisions in a lease which are contrary to the provisions of this Agreement shall be invalid and unenforceable in a court of law or otherwise. No employee shall be entitled or permitted to sell, lease, or sublease any apartment, or other space, parking space, amenity or privilege of the employee to a third party. In the case where living quarters are provided which are in excess of what is required hereunder, a use and occupancy agreement may be entered into covering such arrangement.
No janitor shall have the right to refuse the occupancy of an apartment unless both the Union and the Employer shall mutually agree for good cause shown to excuse the janitor from such occupancy. However, in such a case, or if an apartment is not available or not furnished to the janitor for good cause shown, an apartment allowance shall be negotiated in lieu of the apartment based on the average fair market rental for a one- bedroom apartment in the area for purpose of insuring that the janitor will reside in a location convenient to the premises for which he has responsibility. An apartment allowance for janitors hired after December 1, 2008 who reside more than 10 miles from the building does not have to be negotiated
Section 5.	Work Week for Head and Assistant Head Janitors, The regular work week for Head Janitors and Assistant Head Janitors shall consist of forty (40) hours per week arranged to provide such employees with time off from the premises consisting of 48 consecutive hours each week; provided, however, that if another employee is not available for emergency service during such period either the janitor shall be available or provide a substitute approved by the Employer as a substitute for such period at no cost to the employer. Upon good cause shown and with the approval of the Union, the Employer may on a temporary basis adjust the regular workweek for Head Janitors and Assistant Head Janitors.
Section 6.	Work Week for Helpers and Other Employees. The regular work week for Helpers and employees in other job classifications specified in Sections 1(a) (4), 1(a) (5), 1(a) (7), 1(a) (8), and 1(a) (9) of this Article shall consist of five (5) consecutive days of eight (8) hours each comprising forty (40) hours per week. Upon good cause shown and with the approval of the Union, the regular workweek may be adjusted provided that all days within the regular workweek are scheduled to be worked consecutively.
Section 7.	Overtime. Sections 5 and 6 above are intended only to establish the regular work week of the employees covered thereby and do not prohibit the Employer from scheduling reasonable mandatory overtime on the sixth and seventh day of an employee's work week.
18
Hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours per week by employees in Section 5 of this Article shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (l-Z ) times such employee's regular rate of pay. Hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in one day (unless otherwise expressly agreed to by the Union) or forty (40) hours per week by employees in Section 6 of this Article shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1-/j) times his regular rate of pay. In no event shall time off be substituted for overtime pay in any case. No employee may work overtime without authorization of the Employer except in the event of an emergency.
If, at the request of the Employer, an employee does not work a holiday that would otherwise be a scheduled work day and is called back to work on Employee's day off within the same work week, the hours worked shall be compensated at the overtime rate provided that the Employee has worked all other scheduled hours during the work week.
Section 8. Wage Computations, The regular hourly rate of the employees specified in Section 5 and Section 6 of this Article VI shall, for all purposes including overtime, be computed by dividing the monthly rate by 173.33 hours. In no case shall time off or any other benefit whatsoever be substituted for overtime pay. The regular daily pay of an employee for an 8 hour day shall be equal to 4.62 percent of the monthly wage. The regular weekly pay for an employee for a 40 hour week shall be equal to 23.1 percent of the monthly wage. The regular bi-weekly pay for such employee shall be equal to 46.19 percent of the monthly wage. The regular semi-monthly pay for such employee shall be equal to 50.0 percent of the monthly wage.
Section 9.	Reporting Pay, In the event any employee is called back to work for an emergency, the employee shall be paid for all time worked at the appropriate rate (including the overtime rate when required by Section 7) plus one hour at straight time as travel time if the employee does not live on the premises.
Section 10.	Maintenance of Benefits. No benefits, privileges or other terms and conditions of employment heretofore in effect for employees covered by this Agreement which provide conditions more favorable than what is established under this Agreement shall be reduced or eliminated, but shall continue in full force and effect, except by express written agreement with the Union. This provision, however, shall not apply where such benefits are in contravention of this Agreement or were established and applied solely in respect to a particular employee/s based upon special facts applicable to such employee/s and such facts do not any longer apply to such employee/s or to the replacement for such employee/s.
Section 11.	Pay Discrepancies. Employers will make their best effort to issue pay checks for pay discrepancies within two (2) business days after being notified by employee or Union.
