PREAMBLE
This AGREEMENT, hereinafter referred to as the Agreement, entered into by the COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, hereinafter referred to as the County, and the INTERNATIONAL UNION OF OPERATING ENGINEERS, STATIONARY ENGINEERS, LOCAL 39, AFL-CIO, hereinafter referred to as the Union, has as its purpose the promotion of harmonious labor relations between the County and the Union; establishment of an equitable and peaceful procedure for the resolution of differences; and the establishment of rates of pay, hours of work, and other conditions of employment.
The term "agreement" as used herein means the written agreement provided under Section 3505.1 of the Government Code.
ARTICLE I RECOGNITION AND COVERAGE
1.1	RECOGNITION
a.	The County recognizes the Union as the exclusive negotiating agent for all employees in the Operations and Maintenance Unit.
b.	The Union recognizes the County Executive or his/her designee as the negotiating representative for the County and shall negotiate exclusively with him/her or his/her designee, except as otherwise specifically spelled out in this Agreement.
1.2	COVERAGE OF EMPLOYEES
a.	The Operations and Maintenance Unit consists of all employees as stated in the listing of classes set forth in Exhibit "A" of this Agreement.
b.	This Agreement applies only to employees in the above-described representation unit.
ARTICLE II UNION RIGHTS
2.1	UNION SECURITY
a.	It is the intent of this article to provide for payroll deductions of Union members to be deducted from their warrants insofar as permitted by law, and not to exceed $99.99 biweekly including dues. The County agrees to deduct and transmit to the Union all authorized deductions from all Union members within the foregoing units
1
who have signed an approved authorization card or cards for such deductions in a form agreed upon by the County and the Union. In the event the County misses one (1) or more dues deductions in a payroll period, due to no fault on the part of the Union, the County will correct the error in the next biweekly pay period if notified by the Union in writing within five (5) workdays of the initial transmittal to the Union.
b.	(1) The written authorization for Union dues deductions shall remain in full force and effect during the life of this Agreement between the County and the Union, unless canceled in writing.
(2)	The written authorization for approved insurance and benefit programs and the amount of dues deducted from Union members' warrants shall be changed by the County upon written request of the Union.
(3)	The Union agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the County harmless against any claims made of any nature and against any suit instituted against the County arising from its checkoff for the dues, insurance, or benefit programs of the Union.
c.	"Approved insurance and benefit programs" are those which the County has approved as being non-competitive or non-duplicative of County-offered programs. The County reserves the right to disapprove any insurance program, in advance, if competitive or duplicative; and to cancel all Union insurance and benefit program payroll deductions where they are established without prior County approval. It is understood that life insurance, except for accidental death and dismemberment, is competitive and duplicative of County-offered programs. It is understood that insurance programs offered by the Union to employees not eligible for enrollment in County insurance programs are "approved insurance and benefit programs."
d.	Solicitation and/or servicing of Union insurance and benefit programs shall not interrupt on-duty employees nor be conducted in County facilities without prior approval of the County.
2.2	UNION NOTICES AND MEETINGS
a.	The Union may use County conference rooms and similar building facilities for meetings with employees in the units it represents, may post materials on bulletin boards which have been provided for their use in the units it represents, and may visit work locations to confer with its members regarding grievances or other business within the scope of representation or otherwise provided for within this Agreement.
b.	Use of County meeting facilities requires at least twenty-four (24) hours advance notice to the appropriate County official and is subject to County use of such facilities; provided, however, that once scheduled, such Union meetings may not be canceled by the County except under emergency situations. The County may establish reasonable regulations governing the use of County facilities as provided by this section.
2
c.	The Union shall be entitled to the use of a bulletin board at each work location where they are established or where they may be reasonably necessary.
d.	Duly authorized representatives of the Union shall be permitted, at all times that employees in the units it represents are working, to enter offices to transact business within the scope of representation and to observe conditions under which employees are employed and carry out their responsibilities; provided, however, that the Union representative shall, upon arrival at the facility, notify the person in charge of the areas he wishes to visit. Access shall not be unreasonably denied. If denied, the reason or reasons for denial must be stated.
e.	The Union may transmit reasonable amounts of written materials through the County's departmental interoffice “Local 39 Business, Confidential” is to be delivered to the addressee unopened.

c.	The Union shall furnish the County with the names of designated representatives and shop stewards immediately after their designation. Shop stewards will not be recognized by the County until such a list is received by the County Executive and the department head involved.
d.	Upon the request of the aggrieved employee, a shop steward or representative of the Union may investigate the specified grievance provided it is in his or her assigned area of responsibility and assist in its presentation. Shop stewards who are full-time employees shall be allowed a reasonable time for this purpose during working hours without loss of pay, subject to prior notification of his or her immediate supervisor. If the shop steward requests to leave the work site, notification shall be in writing on a form prescribed by the County, which form will state the amount of time spent for the purpose. All shop stewards shall keep to a minimum the time spent in fulfilling their duties. The right to use County time as designated above will be limited to designated shop stewards only.
e.	It shall be the responsibility of all shop stewards to discuss first with their immediate supervisor any question regarding interpretation or application of this Agreement.

The Union agrees that during the term of this Agreement, neither it nor its officers, employees or members will engage in, encourage, sanction, support, or suggest any strikes, work stoppages, boycotts, slow downs, mass resignations, mass absenteeism, picketing or any other similar actions which would involve suspension of, or interference with, the normal work of the County.

4.2	DISCRIMINATION

The County and the Union shall share equally the responsibility for applying this provision of the Agreement.
ARTICLE V GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
5.1	PURPOSE
a.	This grievance and arbitration procedure shall be used to process and resolve grievances arising under this Agreement.
b.	The purposes of this procedure are:
(1)	To resolve grievances informally at the lowest possible level;
(2)	To provide an orderly procedure for reviewing and resolving
grievances promptly.
5.2	DEFINITIONS
a.	A grievance is a complaint of one (1) or a group of employees, or a dispute between the County and the Union, involving the interpretation, application or enforcement of the express terms of the Agreement.
b.	As used in this procedure the term "immediate supervisor" means the individual who assigns, reviews and directs the work of an employee.
c.	As used in this procedure the term "party" means an employee, the Union or the County.
6
d.	As used herein, “representative” or “Union representative”, if an employee of the County, refers to an employee designated as such pursuant to Section 2.3.
5.3	TIME LIMITS
Each party involved in a grievance shall act quickly so that the grievance may be resolved promptly. Every effort should be made to complete action within the time limits contained in the grievance procedure, but with the written consent of all parties the time limitation for any step may be extended.
5.4	PRESENTATION
The grievant or the Union representative or both may present a grievance while on duty. For purposes of this section, a Union representative is defined as a professional Union staff member or a Union steward, so long as said Union steward is a full-time or regular part-time employee.
5.5	EMPLOYEE RIGHTS
The employee retains all rights conferred by Section 3500, et seq., of the Government Code or Chapter 2.79 of the Sacramento County Code.
5.6	APPLICATION
Grievances as defined in Section 5.2 shall be brought through this procedure. The procedure adopted by the Board of Supervisors, effective October 1, 1969, shall not apply to employees covered by this Agreement for any purpose whatsoever.
5.7	INFORMAL DISCUSSION
a.	The grievance initially shall be discussed with the immediate supervisor. The employee may be represented by the Union representative.
b.	Within five (5) workdays, the immediate supervisor shall give his/her decision or response. If the immediate supervisor fails to respond to the informal grievance within five (5) workdays, the grievant shall have the right to initiate a formal grievance no later than ten (10) workdays after the event or circumstance occasioning the grievance.
5.8	FORMAL GRIEVANCE - STEP 1
a.	If an informal grievance is not resolved to the satisfaction of the grievant, or if there is reason to bypass the informal step, a formal grievance may be initiated. A formal grievance may be initiated no later than:
(1)	Ten (10) workdays after the event or circumstances occasioning the grievance; or
7
(2)	Within five (5) workdays of the decision rendered in the informal grievance procedure, whichever is later.
b.	However, if the informal grievance procedure is not initiated within the period specified in Subsection (1) above, the period in which to bring the grievance shall not be extended by Subsection (2) above.
c.	A formal grievance shall be initiated in writing on a form prescribed by the County and shall be filed with the person designated by the appointing authority as the first level of appeal. The employee may be represented by the Union representative.
d.	Within ten (10) workdays after the initiation of the formal grievance, the designee of the appointing authority at the first level of appeal shall investigate the grievance, and give his/her decision in writing to the grievant.
5.9	FORMAL GRIEVANCE - STEP 2
a.	If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision rendered pursuant to Step 1, he/she may appeal the decision within five (5) workdays to the appointing authority or his/her designee. The employee may be represented by the Union representative. If the appointing authority or his/her designee is the first level of appeal, the grievant may bypass Step 2.
b.	Within ten (10) workdays the appointing authority or his/her designated representative shall respond in writing to the grievance. If a meeting is held between the Union and the Step 2 designee, the appointing authority shall have ten (10) workdays from the date of the meeting to respond.
5.10	FORMAL GRIEVANCE - STEP 3
a.	The Step 3 appeal shall be considered a formal request for a meeting and a written decision by the County Executive or his/her designee. The meeting should be held within twenty (20) working days from receipt of the appeal to Step 3.
b.	The County and the Union agree to make every effort to schedule Step 3 grievance meetings twice a month. The intent of the parties is to hear all grievances within forty (40) working days of the appeal.
c.	There shall be two (2) tracks to solve the problem at Step 3. The Union shall reserve the right to choose either:
8
(1)	Mediation as described in Section 5.11; or
(2)	Third step appeal as described in Section 5.12.
5.11	MEDIATION
a.	Grievances appealed to Step 3 may be submitted by the Union to mediation. Mediation shall take place on the first and third Tuesday of each calendar month. Subsequent days for mediation will be scheduled, if necessary. The parties agree to mutually select a panel of mediators. If the parties are unable to select a panel of mediators, they shall utilize the State Mediation and Conciliation Service.
b.	Under no case shall the adjustment or resolution of the grievance at this level exceed forty (40) working days from the date of their appeal to Step 3, unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties. If not extended, the Union may appeal the grievance to arbitration.
c.	Mediators who have been selected by the parties to mediate grievance disputes will be scheduled on a rotating and available basis.
d.	The parties agree to meet annually in May to review the mediators listed above. The list of mediators for the subsequent year shall be mutually agreed upon, but should the parties be unable to agree on a new list, the previous list will continue until such time as a new list is agreed to or the State Mediation and Conciliation Service is utilized.
e.	All costs of the mediator, if any, shall be borne equally by the parties. No party shall purposely withhold information at this level but shall disclose all information relevant to the grievance for consideration by the other party.
f.	Mediation Procedures. The mediation procedure shall be entirely informal in nature. However, copies of exhibits upon which either party bases its case shall be shared with the other party. The relevant facts should be elicited in a narrative fashion to the extent possible, rather than through examination and cross-examination of witnesses. The rules of evidence will not apply and no record of the proceedings will be made. All persons involved in the events giving rise to the grievance should be encouraged to participate fully in the proceeding, both by stating their views and by asking questions of the other participants at the mediation hearing.
g.	The primary effort of the mediator shall be to assist the parties in settling the stated grievance in a mutually satisfactory fashion. In attempting to achieve a settlement, the mediator is free to use all of the techniques customarily associated with the mediation process, including private conferences with only one (1) party. If settlement is not possible, the mediator shall provide the parties with an immediate
9
bench opinion, based on the stated grievance and the Collective Bargaining Agreement, as to how the grievance would be decided if it went to arbitration. That opinion would not be final or binding, but would be advisory. It would be delivered orally and would be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the mediator's opinion. The advisory opinion may be used as the basis for further settlement discussions or for withdrawal or granting of the grievance. If the grievance is not settled, granted or withdrawn, the parties are free to arbitrate. If they do, the mediator shall not serve as arbitrator, and no offers or concessions made by the parties or the mediator during mediation can be used against a party during arbitration. Neither attorneys nor court reporters or any other type of note taker shall be allowed to be present at the proceedings.
h.	If the parties agree to be bound by a mediator's recommendation, the subsequent agreement shall be reduced to writing and signed by the parties.
i.	Any grievance not resolved within twenty (20) working days of the initial mediation session with no subsequent mediation session(s) scheduled and which the Union wishes to pursue may be appealed by the Union to arbitration within ten (10) working days.
5.12	HEARING AND RESPONSE-STEP 3
a.	If the Union grievant chooses not to utilize mediation and is not satisfied with the decision rendered pursuant to Step 2, he/she may appeal the decision within five (5) workdays to the County Executive. The employee may be represented by a Union representative.
b.	The County Executive or his/her designated representative shall, within ten (10) workdays of receipt of the appeal, schedule and conduct a grievance hearing unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties. The County Executive or his/her representative shall render a written response to the grievance within fifteen (15) workdays following the date of the grievance hearing unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties.
5.13	ARBITRATION - STEP 4
If the County Executive or his/her designated representative fail to respond in writing as provided in Step 3, or if the Union is not satisfied with the decision at Step 3, the Union shall have the right to refer the matter to binding arbitration. Such referral shall be made by written demand submitted to the County Executive within ten (10) workdays of receipt of his/her decision.
5.14	SELECTION OF ARBITRATOR
a.	An impartial arbitrator shall be selected jointly by the parties within ten (10) workdays of receipt of the written demand.
b.	(1) In the event the parties are unable to agree within the time stated, the arbitrator shall be selected from the following list of arbitrators:
10
Gerald McKay Alexander Cohn Jerilou Cossack Kenneth Silbert Leo Kanowitz
This list may be modified by mutual agreement of the parties.
(2)	Arbitration Selection: Where this section is used to determine the selection of an arbitrator, the arbitrator to hear a particular dispute shall be determined on a straight rotation basis, based upon the above listed order. If the next arbitrator on the rotation is unavailable to serve as the arbitrator, that arbitrator shall be bypassed and the next listed arbitrator shall be the selected arbitrator to be contacted. Either party shall have the right to declare an arbitrator as unavailable if the arbitrator cannot conduct the hearing within ninety (90) days of being contacted by the parties. If a party makes such a declaration, that arbitrator will be bypassed and the next listed arbitrator shall be the selected arbitrator to be contacted.
(3)	If none of the arbitrators are able to serve based upon this selection process, the parties may mutually select any arbitrator. If the parties are unable to mutually agree upon an arbitrator, a list of five (5) arbitrators shall be requested from the State Mediation and Conciliation Service. The parties shall alternately strike one (1) name from this list and the remaining name shall be the selected arbitrator.
c.	The County and the Union may use expedited arbitration. Expedited arbitration would include:
(1)	A requirement that the arbitrator selected render a decision within sixty (60) calendar days of the conclusion of the hearing.
(2)	Either side may request, at their cost, a court reporter.
(3)	No post hearing briefs unless mutually agreed by the parties.
d.	Either the County or the Union may require a full arbitration hearing on any grievance.
11
5.15	DECISION
a.	The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding.
b.	The arbitrator shall have no authority to add, delete or alter any provisions
of this Agreement, nor shall the arbitrator substitute his/her discretion in any case where the County is given or retains such discretion. The arbitrator shall limit his/her decision to the application and interpretation of the provisions of this Agreement.
5.16	COSTS
The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the court reporter, if required by the arbitrator or requested by a party, shall be shared equally by the parties.
5.17	WITNESSES
The County agrees that employees shall not suffer loss of compensation for time spent as a witness at an arbitration hearing held pursuant to this Agreement. The Union agrees that the number of witnesses requested to attend and their scheduling shall be reasonable.
5.18	RESPONSE
If the County fails to respond to a grievance within the time limits specified for each step, the grievant shall have the right to appeal to the next higher step up to Step 3.
5.19	COPY OF DECISION
At each step of the formal grievance procedure, a copy of the decision shall be sent to the Union at the same time as the decision is sent to the grievant.
5.20	GRIEVANCES/PERSONNEL FILES
Copies of grievances filed pursuant to this section will not be placed in personnel files as defined in Section 15.8-a.
ARTICLE VI HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
6.1	HOURS OF WORK
a.	The regular workweek shall commence Sunday and extend through
12
Saturday, eight (8) hours per day, five (5) days per week, for a total of forty (40) hours, which includes authorized absences with pay.
b.	The hours of work, including authorized absences with pay, of all part-time employees shall be established by the appointing authority but shall normally be less than eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week.
c.	Employees normally shall be allowed a lunch period of not less than thirty (30) minutes nor more than one (1) hour which shall be scheduled generally in the middle of the work shift.

e.	Lunch periods shall not be counted as time worked except for those employees for whom lunch periods include the actual performance of assigned duties such as employees who work a straight eight-hour shift.
f.	When an employee is ordered by the County to attend training, the time spent in training shall be counted as hours worked. Training which takes place during off-duty hours with attendance voluntary is not hours worked.
g.	Permanent employees shall be given at least five (5) workdays’ written notice prior to a permanent change in their assigned hours of work. The notice requirement shall not apply to temporary or emergency assignments.
h.	Notwithstanding a. above, employees of a specific section, unit, division, or department may work a modified biweekly pay period of less than ten (10) days, but not less than eighty (80) hours, subject to approval of the County and the Union.
6.2	9/80 WORK SCHEDULES
a.	An appointing authority, with prior approval of the County Executive, may approve individual requests of employees covered by this Agreement in their department to work a 9/80 work schedule. In addition, in recognition of the type and nature of work performed by many groups of employees covered by this Agreement, the appointing authority has the right to place, at their discretion, all employees in a work unit, section or division on a 9/80 work schedule.
b.	For employees who do not receive time and one-half overtime pay, the workweek will remain from 12:00 a.m. on Sunday to 12:00 a.m. the following Sunday, a period of seven (7) consecutive twenty-four hour periods.
(1)	For these employees, the 9/80 work schedule is a schedule which during one (1) week of the biweekly pay period the employee is
13
scheduled to work four (4) nine-hour workshifts for a total of thirty-six (36) hours, and during the other week of the pay period, is scheduled to work four (4) nine-hour workshifts and one (1) eight-hour workshift.
(2)	For these employees working the 9/80 work schedule who are eligible to earn straight-time overtime, overtime shall be earned when the employee is required to work in excess of nine (9) hours when normally scheduled to work the nine-hour workshift and in excess of eight (8) hours when normally scheduled to work the eight-hour workshift. Overtime shall also be earned when an employee eligible for overtime is required to work in excess of thirty-six (36) hours during the week the employee is scheduled to work thirty-six (36) hours, or in excess of forty-four (44) hours during the week the employee is scheduled to work forty-four (44) hours.
c.	For employees who do receive time and one-half overtime pay, the individual employee's workweek must be redesignated by the County so that it commences in the middle of the eight-hour workshift as described in Subsection b.(1) above. This redesignated workweek must be in writing and specifically state the day of the week and time of day that the workweek commences and the effective date of the redesignated workweek. This must be completed and approved prior to the employee working the 9/80 schedule and be filed in the employee's personnel file. This redesignated workweek must be changed prior to the employee altering the day of the week or time of day that the eight-hour workshift occurs; the redesignated workweek must always commence during the middle of the eight-hour workshift. This redesignated workweek must also be changed back to the standard Sunday through Saturday workweek upon the employee moving off the 9/80 work schedule.
(1)	For these employees, the 9/80 work schedule is a schedule in which during each redesignated workweek the employee works four (4) nine-hour workshifts and one (1) four-hour workshift. The two (2) four-hour workshifts are worked consecutively in a manner to constitute one (1) eight-hour work period, similar to the eight-hour workshift provided in Subsection b.(1) above.
(2)	For these employees overtime shall be earned when the employee is required to work in excess of nine (9) hours when normally scheduled to work the nine-hour workshift, and in excess of forty (40) hours during the redesignated workweek. Additionally, overtime will be earned when the employee is required to work more than four (4) hours when normally scheduled to work either of the four-hour workshifts.
d.	Employees working a 9/80 schedule shall take an unpaid meal period in the middle of their nine-hour and eight-hour workshifts, or between the two (2) four-hour workshifts, consistent with Section 6.1. Employees may receive one (1) rest period during the first half of the employee's nine-hour or eight-hour workshift and one (1) rest
14
period during the second half of the nine-hour or eight hour workshift, consistent with Section 6.7. Employees who work two (2) four-hour workshifts may receive one (1) rest period during each four-hour workshift.
e.	An employee shall be granted a holiday that falls on the employee's scheduled eight-hour workshift. If the holiday falls on the scheduled nine-hour workshift, the remaining hour must be taken off as leave first from accumulated compensating time off or holiday in lieu, and second from accumulated vacation time; and, if there are no leave balances, then leave without pay. If the holiday falls when the employee is scheduled to work the two (2) four-hour workshifts, then both four-hour workshifts shall be deemed to be the holiday. If a holiday falls on an employee's scheduled day off, the employee shall accrue eight (8) hours compensating time off.
f.	Full shift absences on vacation, sick leave, compensating time off, or holiday in lieu taken by employees on a scheduled nine-hour workshift shall result in the deduction of nine (9) hours from the employee's accrued leave balances. Full shift absences on the eight-hour workshift shall result in the deduction of eight (8) hours from the employee's accrued leave balances. Full shift absences from either four-hour workshift shall result in the deduction of four (4) hours from the employee's accrued leave balances.
g.	Employees may return to the standard five-day, forty-hour workweek upon the approval of their appointing authority.
h.	The appointing authority shall have the right to return employee(s) to the standard five-day, forty-hour workweek schedule after providing advance written notice of two (2) full pay periods to the affected employee(s).
i.	Employees covered by this Agreement who are assigned to the Traffic Signs and Signals Sections or Highway Maintenance Section of the Transportation Division within the Department of Public Works shall receive a paid lunch period when assigned to a 9/80 work schedule. This is in recognition that a lunch period is work time if an employee is required to perform duties while eating. Being ordered to remain with a vehicle while in the field during the lunch period is considered work time. In recognition that the employees described herein in Subsection i. work jobs that during the course of a workday move from site to site, have fluctuating work flow, may await material delivery, and may fill out paper work before and/or after completion of a job and recognizing employees described herein also receive a paid lunch, these employees shall not receive rest periods at regularly scheduled times as described in Section 6.7 of this Agreement.
15
j.	Employees in the Traffic Signs and Signal Sections of the Transportation Division who were on a 9/80 work schedule and working a "44/36" work schedule as outlined in Section 6.2 of the Operations and Maintenance Agreement of 1990-93, shall be covered by the 9/80 language described in Section 6.2 of this Agreement. The salary received by these employees for working eighty (80) hours in a two-week period shall be the same received when working eighty (80) hours in a two-week period under the previously described "44/36" work schedule.
6.3	AIRCRAFT RESCUE AND FIRE FIGHTING 24-HOUR WORK SCHEDULE
a. At such time that the County decides to implement a 24-hour work schedule in Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF), the parties agree that such 24-hour work schedule shall be administered in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)	Hours of Work:
(a)	The article on hours of work and overtime of this Agreement shall not apply to employees assigned a 24-hour work schedule.
(b)	All 24-hour employees shall be scheduled to work a total of nine (9) shifts within a 28-day cycle, for a total of 2,912 hours of work per year. Employees shall report for duty at 0800 and go off duty 24 hours later, at 0800 the following morning. Designation of shifts and assignment of personnel shall be at the discretion of the County.
(c)	Employees assigned a 24-hour work schedule shall be on duty at all times and prepared to perform airport emergency rescue and fire-fighting activities as required. Other duties such as general maintenance, equipment readiness, inspections, and related work shall normally be performed between 0800 and 1700 hours. Break times and meal periods shall be considered hours worked and will be arranged by the County as operations permit.
(2)	Salary:
(a)	The sections on night shift pay and incentive pay for fire operations workers of this Agreement shall not apply to employees assigned on a 24-hour work schedule.
(b)	The straight time hourly rate of pay for employees on a 24-hour work schedule shall be determined by dividing the employee’s annual base salary by 2,912 hours. The annual
16
base salary shall include Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) incentive pay and the total annual cost of night shift pay earned by employees pursuant to this Agreement but applied equally to all employees on a 24-hour work schedule.
(c)	Whenever an employee is reassigned from a 24-hour work schedule (2,912 hours of work per year) to a 40-hour work schedule (2,080 hours of work per year), the employee’s straight time hourly rate shall be determined by dividing the employee’s annual salary by 2,080 hours. As long as employees remain in ARFF job classifications while working a 40-hour work schedule, they shall not be eligible for night shift pay.
(3)	Overtime:
(a)	Overtime hours worked will be compensated at one and one-half (1->2) times an employee’s straight time hourly rate of pay. An employee shall be compensated at the overtime rate for all hours worked that are not part of the employee’s assigned work schedule. Leave time taken by an employee shall not be counted as time worked for overtime purposes.
(b)	The County has the right to require an employee to remain at work and perform work-related duties for the duration of the established overtime period.
(4)	Callback: Callback shall be paid at 1 -16 times the hourly rate of pay, for a period of two (2) hours or for hours actually worked, whichever is greater.
(5)	Leave Time:
(a)	Vacation, sick leave, and holiday-in-lieu time provided for in this Agreement shall be accrued by 24-hour work schedule employees (2,912 hours of work per year) at the current accrual rates, times a conversion factor of 1.4. For example, 40-hour work schedule employees (2,080 hours of work per year) accrue sick leave at the rate of 4.6 hours biweekly. Thus, 24-hour work schedule employees shall accrue 6.44 (4.6 X 1.4 = 6.44) hours of sick leave biweekly. Leave time accruals shall be decreased by the conversion factor of 1.4 whenever an employee is reassigned from a 24-hour work schedule to a 40-hour work schedule.
(b)	Leave time balances and “caps” (maximums) shall be increased by the conversion factor of 1.4 whenever an employee is reassigned from a 40-hour work schedule to a
17
24-hour work schedule. Leave time balances and caps shall be decreased by the conversion factor of 1.4 whenever an employee is reassigned from a 24-hour work schedule to a 40-hour work schedule.
(c)	Vacation, sick, and other leave time provided for in this Agreement shall be taken by 24-hour work schedule employees pursuant to existing provisions of this Agreement, except that leave time other than sick leave shall not be taken in blocks of less than four (4) hours, at the discretion of management.
(6)	General:
(a)	If the above provisions conflict with other terms of this Agreement, the provisions of this section shall prevail.
(b)	Whenever a term of this Agreement references a 40-hour work schedule, such term shall be increased, if applicable, by a conversion factor of 1.4 when it is applied to employees assigned a 24-hour work schedule.
(7)	The parties mutually agree to form a joint labor/management committee to discuss and make recommendations to the Director of Airports regarding the implementation of the Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting 24-Hour Work Schedule. The Labor/Management Committee will consist of three union representatives and three management representatives. The committee shall convene no later than December 31, 2001.
6.4	OVERTIME
a.	Employees will be compensated only for overtime ordered by designated supervisory personnel.
b.	Employees required to work in excess of eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week shall be compensated for such overtime with pay at one and one-half times the hourly rate or by compensating time off on the basis of one and one-half hours off for each hour of overtime worked. If the department is unable to schedule and grant time off within one (1) year from the date the overtime was performed, cash payment shall be made in lieu of compensating time.
c.	All paid leave except sick leave shall be counted as time worked. Time worked in excess of (8) eight hours in a day shall not be counted in determining whether an employee has worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a week.
d.	Part-time employees shall be compensated for overtime at their regular hourly rate or one (1) hour of compensating time off for each hour worked in excess of
18
their normal workday or week; provided, however, for work performed in excess of eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week, they shall be compensated as provided in Subsection b.
e.	Employees who work overtime shall promptly and accurately report such time in the manner prescribed by the County.
f.	Overtime shall be distributed fairly among employees insofar as circumstances permit.
g.

All overtime will be assigned at the beginning of the workday whenever reasonable and practical.
h.	Regular employees required to work on a holiday shall receive, in addition to straight-time pay for holiday work, overtime compensation with pay at one and one-half times the hourly rate or by compensating time off on the basis of one and one-half hours off for each hour of overtime worked. Employees who are granted one (1) day off every four (4) weeks (H-day) in lieu of prescribed holidays shall be compensated pursuant to this subsection if they are required to work on a day which has been scheduled as a day off (H-day) in lieu of prescribed holidays.
i.	The parties mutually agree that the appointing authority shall have the sole authority to schedule the use of accrued compensatory time off (CTO). Such scheduling shall be at the discretion of the division chief. The appointing authority will give employees five (5) calendar days' notice prior to scheduling CTO. The Department of Parks, Recreation and Open Space shall be exempted from the five (5) calendar days’ scheduling notice. Parks and Recreation employees covered by this Agreement who report for their regularly scheduled shift shall be paid a minimum of two (2) hours of straight time pay if sent home on CTO as outlined in this Section (6.4-i.)
6.5	POLICY FOR EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF OVERTIME, STANDBY AND CALL-BACK TIME

f.	Distribution: The distribution of overtime shall be equalized over each sixmonth period beginning on the first day of the calendar month following the effective date of this Agreement. It is understood that the nature of certain work assignments does not easily permit equal distribution of overtime, and in such cases exceptions may be made to equal distribution. Such exceptions are to be identified by the County for each activity. Any disagreement between the Union and the County regarding the exceptions shall be resolved pursuant to the grievance and arbitration procedure.
g.	Records:
(1)	Overtime records shall be made available to employees and authorized Union representatives.
(2)	Records shall show all hours worked during the preceding month and total cumulative hours.
(3)	Each activity, function, or organization element within which equal overtime distribution is considered feasible for identified groups of employees shall maintain appropriate records. The specific format of these records shall be determined by the appropriate level of management in charge of the activity but shall consist of a listing or
20
grouping of employees among which overtime is considered feasible or practicable.
6.6	STANDBY ASSIGNMENTS
a.	Any employee who is required to remain on standby for emergency work shall be paid the equivalent of two (2) hours straight-time pay for each standby shift, whether or not he/she is called to work. A standby shift shall be eight (8) or less hours.
b.	The employee who performs emergency work on standby duty shall be compensated therefore as overtime worked. A minimum of two (2) hours overtime compensation per shift shall be paid to an employee who is called back, in addition to the standby pay to which such employee is entitled pursuant to Subsection a. An employee who is notified of the need to respond to another emergency while still on-call shall be compensated as a continuation of time; it shall not be considered a second call-back subject to a separate two-hour minimum. If the employee has returned home and the two-hour minimum has elapsed, an additional call-back would be subject to a separate two-hour minimum. If the two-hour minimum has not elapsed, it will be considered a continuation of time, not subject to an additional two-hour minimum.
c.	Any regular employee not on standby called in to work shall be compensated a minimum of two (2) hours pay at the overtime rate.
d.	An employee on standby who is called in, while en route to work in a County vehicle, is not entitled to the two-hour minimum.

a.	All employees may be allowed rest periods not to exceed fifteen (15) minutes during each four (4) consecutive hours of work.
b.	An employee who misses a scheduled break may be allowed to take a break later during the four-hour work period. However, all rest periods shall be scheduled in accordance with the requirements of the department.

6.8	CHANGES IN SCHEDULED SHIFT OR DAYS OFF
Permanent employees shall be given at least five (5) workdays' notice prior to a change in their shift or days off. If an employee's shift or days off are changed without
21

Except as otherwise provided, any person appointed to a class shall receive the entry step of the ranges of such class and shall accrue other benefits as a new employee.
(2)	Transition of Employees in Salary Steps “2,” “3,” and “4”:
(a)	(i) Effective July 2, 2000, employees in salary Steps “2,”

(iii)	Employees in salary Step “4” will be moved to salary Step “6” with a new step increase date of July 2, 2000.
b.	Reemployment: Any person appointed in accordance with the rule governing reemployment following layoff shall receive compensation and benefits as though he or she had been on leave without pay.
c.	Reinstatement: Any person appointed in accordance with the rule governing reinstatement following resignation in good standing shall be considered a new employee. At the discretion of the appointing authority, a reinstated employee may receive a starting salary higher than Step "2", but not exceeding the step that he or she received at the time of resignation.
24
d.	Return to Former Class: An employee who is returned to a former class following promotion, transfer, or demotion due to layoff, shall receive that step of the range which he or she would have received had he or she never left the former class.
e.	Promotion: Upon promotion an employee shall receive the lowest step in the new class which provides an increase of at least five percent (5.0%). Extra-help employees shall be placed at the lowest step of the new class.
f.	Transfer: Upon transfer an employee shall receive the same step in the new range as he or she received in the former range. For purposes of this provision, a transfer is a change between classes when the maximum salary range of the class to which the transfer is made is less than five percent (5.0%) higher or is less than five percent (5.0%) lower.
g.	Demotion: A demotion is a change to a class which has a maximum salary rate which is at least five percent (5.0%) lower than the maximum salary rate of the former class. Whenever an employee is demoted due to layoff, without cause or inability on his or her part, his or her salary shall be that step in the new range which provides an equal salary, or in the absence thereof, the nearest lower salary, to that received prior to the demotion. In all cases of demotion for cause, the employee shall receive the same step in the lower range as he or she received in the higher range. An employee with permanent status in a class who, with the approval of the appointing authority, voluntarily demotes to a lower class shall receive the step in the lower range which provides an equal salary or, in the absence thereof, the nearest lower salary to that which was received prior to demotion.
h.	Return from Leave Without Pay: Return following leave without pay is not an appointment, but is a continuation of service; however, salary and benefits, other than employment status, shall be based on actual service. This provision shall not apply to employees returning from military leave.
i.	Y-Rate: The Board of Supervisors may adopt a Y-rate to apply to: (1)an employee who would suffer an actual decrease in salary as a result of action taken by the County, without fault or inability on the part of the employee, or (2) an employee who is changing from one (1) class series to another, as a normal consequent of career development through the County's upward mobility program, and the salary of the class the employee enters in the new class series is less than the salary the employee was receiving in the former class. A Y-rate means a salary rate, for an individual employee, which is greater than the established range for the class.
j.	Y-Rate Salary Increase: An employee for whom a Y-rate is established shall not receive any increase in salary until such time as his or her rate of compensation
25
is within the established range for his/her class, at which time the employee shall receive the highest step of the range. The employee shall receive a proportionate decrease in salary whenever a lower range is established for the class in the Agreement.
k.	Granting of Status: Whenever the Civil Service Commission or other appropriate authority grants an employee direct status in another class, the employee shall receive the step determined in accordance with the provisions of this section.
I.	Class Salary Range Changes: When the salary range for a class is changed in the Agreement, employees in the class shall change to the new range but shall remain at the same step. When changes in an employee's class or salary, or both, occur simultaneously with salary range adjustments in the Agreement, the employee changes shall precede the Agreement adjustments in application.
m.	Entry Step Adjustments: When the entry step for a class is adjusted to above Step "2" in the Agreement, the salary step for each employee in the class shall be increased in proportion to the change in entry step; provided, however, that no employee shall advance beyond Step "9".
n.	Biweekly Salaries: The pay period for all employees shall cover fourteen (14) calendar days, starting on a Sunday and ending with the second Saturday thereafter. Salaries shall be paid on the Friday following the end of the pay period; except that if Friday falls on a holiday, salaries shall be paid on Thursday. Salaries shall be computed as provided in this Agreement.
o.	Salary Computation: The regular salary for each employee shall be based on the actual number of days or hours worked in the pay period, including authorized absences with pay, multiplied by the employee's daily or hourly rate. Such payments shall not exceed the biweekly rate as determined by the employee's range and step.
p.	Special Pay: Special payment, including standby, overtime, premium, and other special payment, shall be calculated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.
g.	Payment in Full: Compensation paid pursuant to this Agreement shall be payment in full for services rendered in a County position. No employee shall accept any other compensation for services performed in such position.
r.	The salary level at which initial appointments are made to classes with more than one (1) salary level, and advancement from the lower to the higher salary level of such classes (for example, from Level I to Level II) shall be at the discretion of the appointing authority provided the minimum gualifications as stated in the class specifications as adopted by the Civil Service Commission are met. Advancement from the lower to higher salary level shall not be arbitrarily or capriciously denied. By virtue of
26
this provision, the Civil Service Commission is given the authority by both the County and the Union to determine the appropriate minimum qualifications for the salary levels of current and new classes. However, neither the Union nor the County have transferred or assigned any meet and confer rights or obligations regarding the establishment of minimum qualifications for salary levels to the Civil Service Commission.
7.3	SALARY STEP INCREASES
a.	Increase to steps above the entry step shall be based on performance and length of service. The employee must have earned the equivalent of at least twenty-six (26) biweekly pay period of full-time eligible service since his/her step increase date.
b.	Except as otherwise provided below, an employee's step increase date shall be the first day of the first full biweekly pay period in any class or the date of his or her last step increases, whichever is most recent.
c.	An employee's step increase may be deferred while he or she is in provisional or probationary status. Upon receipt of a deferred increase, the employee's step increase date shall be the same as it would have been had the increase not been deferred; and retroactive payment will be made.
d.	Upon change in class which results in a salary decrease, an employee shall retain the same step increase date.
e.	Upon promotion, an employee shall receive a new increase date when the salary increase is 9.5% or higher.
f.	An employee in Step "9" shall have no step increase date, and service in Step "9" shall not be considered as eligible service for future step increases.
g.	Continuous extra-help employment up to fifty-two (52) weeks of full-time service, or the equivalent, shall be considered as eligible service for a step increase for an employee who is appointed to a regular position without a break in service. Such extra-help employment shall be subject to all other provisions of this section governing step increases.
h.	Overtime work shall not be considered as eligible service.
i.	A step increase may be denied only for just cause.
j.	Temporary employees with no permanent status on June 27, 1981, who continue to be temporary employees thereafter with no break in service, will continue to be compensated at Step “7”. If there is a break in service and the former employee is reappointed to a temporary position or appointed to a permanent position, the employee will start at the beginning step of the salary range for the class in which the employee is appointed. If a temporary employee has no break in service and is appointed to a permanent position, the employee will start at the beginning step of the salary range for the class in which the employee is appointed except that continuous extra-help
27
employment up to fifty-two (52) weeks of full-time service or the equivalent, shall be considered as eligible service for a step increase for an employee who is appointed to a regular position without a break in service.

j.	Supervisors shall prepare and post for their organizational units a schedule of available vacation periods based on efficient staffing of the unit in relation to estimated workload. Each employee shall indicate by order of preference the vacation period(s) desired. If an employee requests that his/her vacation be taken in two (2) or more noncontiguous vacation periods, his/her seniority within current classifications shall apply to his/her first choice of vacation periods requested. Seniority shall also apply to second and subsequent choices in determinations involving employees' second and subsequent choices. Seniority shall be exercised only once by each employee in each successive choice of vacation periods.
k.	The supervisors shall review these requests, resolve any conflict in favor of employees with the greater seniority within current classification, and recommend the completed schedule to the appointing authority or his/her designee. After the vacation schedule has been approved by the appointing authority, an employee promoted into or transferred into a unit may not "bump" another employee's previously scheduled vacation period without that employee's consent.
I.	The supervisor shall post the unit schedules mentioned in Subsections j. and k. above by January 10th of each year. Employees shall submit their vacation request(s) no later than the close of business January 31st. The supervisor shall post the approved vacation calendar in an area easily accessible to employees by February 15th.
39
9.2	SICK LEAVE WHILE ON VACATION
An employee who while on vacation is incapacitated for one (1) or more days due to personal illness or injury may charge such days to accrued sick leave. In such event, the employee promptly shall notify his/her department, and upon return to duty shall substantiate the need for, and use of, sick leave.
9.3	SICK LEAVE
a.	Sick leave credits shall be earned by regular employees based on the equivalent of full-time service from the date of appointment. Sick leave credit shall accrue to the employee upon completion of the regular work assignment on the last day of the biweekly pay period in which it is earned. Sick leave credit shall accrue on the basis of four and six-tenths (4.6) hours per biweekly pay period of service, and may be accumulated without limitation.

(b)	Absence from duty for examination or treatment by a medical doctor or dentist, even though the employee is not quarantined or incapacitated. The employee shall give the immediate supervisor reasonable advance notice of such scheduled absences. The absence shall be permitted except when an absence at that time would unduly interfere with County operations. In all cases the employee shall attempt to schedule examinations at times that minimize interference with County operations.
(c)	Absence from duty to donate blood: Such an absence shall be scheduled at the discretion of the appointing authority, shall cover the time needed to donate blood but shall not exceed four (4) hours in any instance, and shall be approved only upon submission to the appointing authority of an official blood bank receipt reflecting the donation.
(3)	For family purposes, a regular employee may use leave credits for:
40
(a)	Attendance upon an eligible family member who is incapacitated because of illness or injury and definitely requires personal care. The length of such absence shall be limited by the appointing authority to the time reasonably required to either provide care or to make other arrangements for such care. For the purposes of this Subsection (3), an eligible family member is the employee's spouse, child, parent, or grandparent. Additionally, under this subsection, an eligible family member is any other close relative or child who resides with the employee.
(b)	To transport an eligible family member to and from a local hospital for medical treatment or operation, including child birth.

c.	If it is not practical to return an employee to work after a partial day's sick leave, the County may permit the employee to use sick leave for the entire day.
9.4	FAMILY DEATH LEAVE
a.	The County shall authorize family death leave with pay, for a regular employee, when needed, due to the death of his/her parent, spouse, child, grandparent, spouse’s grandparent, brother, sister, mother-in-law, father-in-law, grandchild, brother-inlaw, sister-in-law, or the death of any child or close relative who resided with the employee at the time of death. The employee shall give notice to his/her immediate supervisor in advance of taking such leave.
b.	Such absence for family death shall be limited to time which is definitely required and shall not exceed five (5) days for any one (1) death. Family death leave shall be prorated for part-time employees.
9.5	MILITARY LEAVE
Employees shall be granted military leave as required by statute.
9.6	DISABILITY LEAVE
a.	An employee who has suffered possible injury in the performance of assigned duties shall immediately undergo such medical examination as the appointing
41
authority deems necessary. He/she shall not be considered absent from duty during the time required for such examination.
b.	A regular employee who is unable to perform any appropriate work assignment because of disability incurred in the performance of assigned duties shall be entitled to the following disability leave benefits, in addition to those provided pursuant to the California Worker's Compensation Insurance Act:
(1)	During any period of disability for which payment is not provided under worker's compensation insurance, the employee shall be placed on disability leave with pay to the extent of any leave with pay which he/she has accrued. Such disability leave with pay shall be charged against the employee's accrued leave with pay;
(2)	During any period of disability for which payment is provided under Worker's Compensation Insurance, the employee shall elect to either:
(a)	Retain any worker's compensation benefits received during the pay period and receive full pay. The employee shall use their accrued sick leave, vacation, CTO and HIL on an hour-for-hour basis to cover all hours the employee is absent from duty due to the work-related disability during the applicable pay period. Or,
(b)	Retain any worker's compensation benefits received during the pay period and receive a partial paycheck in an amount so that the partial pay and the worker's compensation benefits added together are equivalent to the employee's full pay. The employee shall use their accrued sick leave, vacation, CTO, and HIL in an amount equal to one-half of the number of hours the employee was absent from work during the pay period due to the work-related disability. If, however, the amount of the worker's compensation benefits is subtracted from the employee's full pay for the time off due to the disability, and the remainder is less than one-half of the amount of such full pay, then only the number of leave balance hours necessary to equal that remainder shall be charged.
c.	All disability leave provisions of this section shall terminate when the employee uses all accrued sick leave, vacation, CTO, or HIL balances, or upon the date of the employee's recovery from disability, receipt of permanent disability under worker's compensation insurance, retirement, termination from County employment or death
9.7	JURY DUTY
42

9.8	TIME OFF FOR PROMOTIONAL EXAMINATIONS AND TRANSFER INTERVIEWS
a.	Regular employees shall be released from duty without loss of compensation while competing in County civil service examinations that are scheduled during duty hours.
b.	Whenever an employee has an appointment to appear for a transfer interview, the employee shall be released from duty without loss of compensation while being interviewed during normal work hours. Every effort should be made to schedule transfer interviews at times that minimize interference with County operations.
9.9	MATERNITY LEAVE OF ABSENCE
An employee's request for leave of absence without pay during or after childbirth shall be granted. Such leaves shall not exceed six (6) weeks from date of delivery unless otherwise medically determined.
9.10	ASSIGNMENT OF LEAVE FOR CATASTROPHIC ILLNESS AND OTHER PURPOSES
Regular employees shall be eligible to participate in the County's program of assignment of leave for catastrophic illness and other purposes. The County will provide the Union a copy of the standardized County Policies and Procedures regarding the implementation of this program.
43
9.11	PARENTAL LEAVE
a.	Each regular County employee with at least one (1) year of continuous service shall be entitled to schedule paid parental leave upon the birth of the employee's child or during the process of an adoption of a minor child by an employee. In the case of adoption, the entitlement shall arise upon both: (1) the placement of the child in the employee's home and (2) the employee initiating or having completed an adoptive home study for the adoption of the child. The purposes of parental leave are to facilitate parental bonding, family adjustment, and child care, and such leave shall be used consistent with these purposes.
b.	Parental leave shall be approved by the employee's appointing authority, except where the granting of the parental leave request would unduly interfere with or cause severe hardship upon department operations. Wherever possible, departments shall make reasonable accommodations to permit parental leave, either on a full-time or part-time basis.
c.	The maximum paid parental leave for full-time regular employees shall be 160 hours. Parental leave shall be prorated for part-time regular employees. Parental leave shall not extend beyond four (4) months from either: (1) the date of birth of the employee's child, or (2) in the case of adoption, the initial date of residence of such child with the employee. The maximum 160 hours shall apply to each birth or adoption, regardless of the number of children bom (twins, triplets, et cetera) or adopted.
d.	Parental leave is separate and distinct from the use of sick leave for pregnancy, since it is not based upon disability. Parental leave is available to be scheduled at the conclusion of the use of sick leave for pregnancy.
e.	Employees must make a written request to use parental leave. The written request shall be made at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the anticipated start of the parental leave, except in cases of an unanticipated early childbirth or adoption, in which case the employee shall make the written request with as much advance notice as possible. The written request shall also provide such information or substantiation as may be required by the Director of Personnel Services.
f.	An employee who while on parental leave is incapacitated for one (1) or more days due to personal illness or injury may charge such days to sick leave. In such event, the employee promptly shall notify their department, and shall submit substantiation of the need for, and use of, sick leave.
g.	Use of parental leave does not reduce or adversely affect the maximum one (1) year unpaid leave of absence that an employee may request for child care or family reasons following the birth or adoption of a child.
44
9.12	WELLNESS/SICK LEAVE INCENTIVE PROGRAM
a.	Effective with Pay Period #1, beginning January 1994, the County shall establish a Wellness Incentive Program. Eligible full-time regular employees who use twelve (12) hours or less of sick leave in Pay Periods #1 through #13 of any year shall receive a Wellness Certificate enabling them to take eight (8) hours off with pay during the following six-month period. Eligible full-time employees who use twelve (12) hours or less of sick leave in Pay Periods #14 through #26 of any year shall receive a certificate enabling them to take eight (8) hours off with pay during the following six-month period. The certificate shall have no monetary value.
b.	Regular employees must be continuously on the County payroll and eligible to earn and use sick leave during the entire 26-week period from Pay Period #1 through #13, and from Pay Period #14 through #26. Any employee on an unpaid leave of absence during a portion of the designated 26-week period is excluded for that time period. Any employee during the designated 26-week period who receives pay pursuant to Labor Code Section 4850 or who receives SDI integration pursuant to Section 10.4 or who selects the disability leave option pursuant to Section 9.7, is excluded from participation for that time period. Any employee who was temporary and transferred to a permanent position during the designated 26-week time period is excluded for that time period.
c.	Part-time regular employees who work forty (40) or more hours per pay period shall be eligible to participate in the Wellness Incentive Program. The same eligibility rules as outlined in Subsection b. above shall apply. However, the maximum amount of sick leave allowed for a part-time employee to use in Pay Periods #1 through #13, or in Pay Periods #14 through #26, shall be prorated. This means for a half-time employee the maximum sick leave that may be used is six (6) hours; for a four-fifths employee, the maximum would be nine (9) hours. The amount of time off received by the qualifying part-time employee shall also be prorated. This means a half-time employee would receive a certificate for four (4) hours time off, and a four-fifths employee would receive a certificate for six (6) hours time off.
d.	This program does not restrict an employee's ability to use sick leave as authorized by Section 9.3 of this Agreement.
e.	The County shall provide the Union with a copy of the County Policy and Procedure necessary to implement the County's Wellness Incentive Program as outlined above.
45
ARTICLE X HEALTH AND WELFARE
10.1	MEDICAL INSURANCE AND HEALTH PLAN
a.	The County shall pay for each full-time regular employee and each parttime regular employee who works forty (40) hours or more per biweekly pay period up to the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan premium for employee and dependent coverage. If the cost of the coverage exceeds the maximum County contribution, the employee shall pay the additional cost.
b.	The County contribution shall be applicable to either “employee and dependent” coverage or to “employee only” coverage. If the cost of the coverage exceeds the maximum County contribution, the employee shall pay the additional cost.
c.	The County shall provide employees with at least the following medical plan options:
Kaiser Foundation Health Plan VG2 A health maintenance plan
A health plan with a point of service (PCS) A catastrophic health plan
d.	Each medical insurance or health plan provides for coordination with Medicare coverage. An employee who participates in a plan is subject to the requirements of that plan, including provisions relating to Medicare. The County is not responsible for the replacement of benefits that may be reduced, eliminated, or made more expensive as a result of coordination with Medicare. County contributions are not payable toward contributions an employee is required to make to the Federal Government for Medicare coverage.
e.	Cash-Back Feature: Employees hired prior to October 11, 1998, with medical insurance or health plan coverage whose premium rate is less than the County contribution as set forth in Subsection a. above shall receive an additional cash payment. For such employees who are covered by social security (FICA), this cash payment will equal the amount of the applicable maximum County contribution set forth in Subsections a. above, minus the cost of the premium rate for the employee’s medical insurance or health plan coverage, minus a percentage equal to the County’s social security contribution rate on FICA taxable wages, and minus any County costs (excluding FICA) which are applicable to such cash payment, if any. For such employees who are not covered by social security, the cash payment will be calculated in exactly the same manner, except there will be no deduction of the percentage equal to the County’s social security contribution rate on FICA taxable wages. Employees hired on or after October 11,1998 shall not receive this additional cash payment. Employees eligible for cash back benefits shall be grandfathered for the duration of their continuous employment history with the County of Sacramento. Such cash back benefit shall be a vested right.
46
f.	The County shall have the right at its sole discretion, after notice to the Union, to move from a two to three-tier health insurance premium structure.
g.	The Union agrees with the Consultant’s recommendations in the 2000-01 Health and Welfare Review to increase the County-sponsored HMO’s to match the PERS 2002 HMO office visit and prescription drugs co-payments effective January 1,2002.
h.	The County shall have the right to further increase the HMO office visit and prescription drug co-payments effective January 1,2005, based on the accumulative percentage increase of premium increases for employees with dependent coverage for the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan for the period January 1,2002 to January 1,2005. (For example, if the accumulated percent increase on the Kaiser premium for the three-year period were 30% ($500 January 1, 2002 to $650 January 1,2005), a $10 copayment could be increased by $3 ($10 x 30%) to $13.)
10.2	DENTAL PLAN
a. The County shall provide at its expense to each regular employee who works forty (40) or more hours per pay period the following dental benefits for the employee and the employee's eligible dependents*:
(1)	A deductible of $25 per patient per calendar year. When three (3) members of a family have each met a $25 per patient deductible, no deductible shall be required of other family members during that calendar year. The deductible shall not apply to two (2) prophylaxes and one (1) dental examination per patient in any calendar year.
(2)	There shall be no deductible for any calendar year following two (2) consecutive calendar years during which such person is continuously eligible and in each of such years has utilized the prophylaxes benefits twice each calendar year.
NOTE: Dependents eligible for benefits are: (1) Lawful spouse; (2) Unmarried children (including step children, adopted children and foster children provided such children are dependent on the employee for support and maintenance) to their 19th birthday, or their 24th birthday if they are enrolled at an accredited institution of learning; (3) An unmarried child who has reached his/her 19th birthday but is incapable of self-support because of physical or mental incapacity that commenced prior to his/her 19th birthday, provided a physician's certificate of such incapacity is submitted to the County Insurance Administrator within six (6) months following his/her 19th birthday or the employee's date of eligibility in the County Dental Plan; (4) If both spouses are eligible employees they must each be enrolled as employees, and their children must be enrolled only under the parent whose birthday (excluding year of birth) occurs earlier in the calendar year; (5) Dependents in military service are not eligible.
(3)	Each calendar year thereafter, no deductible will be required for persons who qualified under Subsection a.(2) above, provided they continue to satisfy the preventive dental maintenance care of two (2) prophylaxes each calendar year.
47
(4)	Persons will be ineligible for the waiver of the deductible if they fail to have the prescribed maintenance care in any calendar year and must repeat the requirements as set forth in Subsection a.(2) to again qualify for no deductible.
(5)	The dental benefits payable are to be computed at 100% of the Table of Allowances. The Table of Allowances will be based on actual claims’ history of the previous period October 1 to and including September 30, and will represent approximately 80% of the overall average dental charges to persons covered under the County's dental program for that twelve-month period.
(a)	In order to preserve the 80% concept, the Table of Allowances will be reviewed annually and revised, if necessary, on an annual basis. Reviews will cover the annual period October 1 to and including September 30, and revisions will be effective the first of each calendar year thereafter.
(b)	The County may make necessary and appropriate adjustments to individual allowances for each procedure in order to preserve the 80% concept, except adjustments shall not be permitted below the first-year base.
(c)	If it is determined, after an annual review, that the County's Dental Plan paid less than 79% of the overall average dental charges to persons utilizing the Sacramento County Dental Plan, the revised Table of Allowances shall contain a penalty factor which would increase the Table of Allowances to reflect the same percentage points over 80% in direct proportion to the percentage points under 80% rounded to the nearest whole number. As an example, if the plan paid 74% for the period October 1 to and including September 30, the penalty factor would increase the revised Table of Allowances, effective January 1 of the following calendar year, to 86%. In the event the revised Table of Allowances did not reflect an 86% benefit as determined by the next annual review, the penalty factor would be adjusted in the next Table of Allowances to reflect the miscalculation, rounded to the nearest whole number. As an example, if the next annual review indicated the plan paid 83% rather than 86%, the next Table of Allowances would continue the penalty factor of 3% so that the plan would be designed to pay 83%. The penalty factor would continue in this manner until it is within 1% of the 80% concept. In no event will the penalty factor be used to reduce the Table of Allowances below 80%.
48
(6)	Additional dental benefits under the County's Dental Plan shall include the following:
(a)	The County will pay 50% of the total and actual costs of orthodontic care but not to exceed a County payment of $750 per-patient lifetime maximum.
(b)	Dental accidents paid at 100% of actual charges, without application of deductible and is not subject to the $1,500 maximum.
(c)	The plan contains a per-patient calendar year maximum of $1,500, except for the $750 per-patient orthodontic lifetime maximum and for the accident benefit.
(d)	Effective January 1, 1999, the per-patient calendar year maximum shall be $1,750, and the orthodontic lifetime maximum shall be $875. Effective January 1,2000, the perpatient calendar year maximum shall be $2,000, and the perpatient orthodontic lifetime maximum shall be $1,000.
(7)	The plan document was designed after the Valley Clerks Trust Dental Care Program.
(8)	Upon request, the County will make available to recognized employee organizations for inspection the actual dental claims experience used in the annual review or other pertinent periodic tabulations.
(9)	Dental benefits will be coordinated with dental benefits provided by any other plan under which the patient is insured, in accordance with the usual established rules covering coordination of benefits as outlined by the California State Insurance Commissioner.
(10)	It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that this section is a continuation of the pre-existing dental plan and that, under the said pre-existing dental plan, a penalty factor of 0% was in effect for the calendar year 1983. It is the intent of this Agreement to continue to make annual penalty factor adjustments, as may be necessary so as to preserve the intent of the original plan.
(11)	The County agrees to provide dental plan pamphlets, including the revised Table of Allowances, to the Union and all employees covered by the dental plan on an annual basis.
49
10.3	LIFE INSURANCE
a.	Basic Benefit: Effective the full pay period following Board of Supervisors’ approval of total tentative agreement, the County will increase the basic life insurance benefit from $2,000 to $15,000 for employees, and from $2,000 to $5,000 for dependents.
b.	Living Benefit: Effective the full pay period following Board of Supervisors’ approval of total tentative agreement the life insurance benefit will include a “living benefit”, the claimant must be under the age of 70; be diagnosed terminally ill (with life expectancy of 12 months or less); not have assigned his or her employee life benefits; and not have a court order in force which affects the payment of life insurance benefits.
c.	The life insurance benefit will pay a benefit of up to 50% of the combined basic and any supplemental life amounts. The maximum amount is $50,000 and the minimum is $7,500. Should the employee recover, the amount paid under this provision would be subtracted from the face amount of his/her full benefit at the time of death.
d.	The current premium rate schedule will be deleted from the Agreement. An updated rate schedule will be published annually by the County Insurance Office and made available to employees and employee organizations during the month of December.
e.	The County shall provide a second option to permit employees to elect a second additional amount equal to annual salary so that the total amount of provided and purchased life insurance will equal twice the total first option. Premium rates for the second option shall be determined by the County based on the quotation from the insurance carrier selected by the County to provide the life insurance.
f.	If employee selects the first option, $1,000 life insurance is provided for each dependent ($200 from age fourteen [14] days to six [6] months) in addition to the amount of insurance applying to the employee at no additional cost.
g.	The County may adjust insurance premiums and amount of insurance on a single date each year for all employees, rather than throughout the year as changes occur in age and salary.
h.	The County may agree with the life insurance carrier that the waiver of premiums for life insurance coverage of disabled insured persons, who otherwise maintain eligibility, shall be continued for one (1) year following the determination by the insurance carrier that the insured is totally disabled and entitled to such a waiver.
i.	The County shall have the right to modify the deductions for life insurance from each biweekly pay period (26 times per year) to the first two (2) pay days of every month (24 times per year). Should the County implement this deduction schedule, it will notify the Union thirty (30) days in advance of the new premium rates, and amend the schedule in Subsection a. accordingly.
50
10.4	STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE
a.	The County shall maintain State Disability Insurance, at employee cost, for employees in classes covered by this Agreement.
b.	Employees who are absent from duty because of illness or injury and have been authorized to use County-paid leave benefits, sick leave, vacation, compensating time off, holidays and holiday-in-lieu time, shall be eligible to integrate the payment of State Disability Insurance benefits with such County-paid leave benefits. No integration of County-paid leave benefits and State Disability Insurance shall occur unless the appointing authority has approved the use of the County-paid leave benefits by the employee requesting integration.
c.	Integration of County-paid leave benefits with State Disability Insurance will require detailed procedures which the County shall, in its sole discretion, implement to ensure the equitable application of the program consistent with this Agreement provision. Integration of County-paid leave benefits and State Disability Insurance is an exception to current County policy which otherwise requires that County-paid leave benefits be used to cover all hours of work an employee is absent from duty. In accordance with current County policy, integration of County-paid leave balances and State Disability Insurance shall not be paid in a retroactive manner.
d.	Integration of County-paid leave balances and State Disability Insurance shall take place subject to the following conditions:
(1)	The intent of this program and contract provision is to insure that those employees who participate in the program comply with all applicable laws, policies, and procedures established to provide integration of County-paid leave balances and State Disability Insurance so as to provide a combined biweekly adjusted net income equivalent to 100% of regular net income - gross income less required deductions, such as taxes, retirement, State Disability Insurance premiums, and other mandatory deductions - as long as such eligible disability qualifies and available leave balances are authorized by the appointing authority. Other employee authorized deductions shall be deducted from the resultant net pay. 100% integration will commence on August 12, 1990.
(2)	Upon approval of the use of County-paid leave benefits by the appointing authority and the employee's established eligibility for State Disability Insurance, the County shall make leave accrual payments to the employee in the usual manner except that the net pay, including State Disability Insurance benefits and net County pay, shall not exceed 100% of the regular net pay. If State Disability Insurance benefits equal or exceed 100% of the regular net pay, no County payment shall be made. County-paid leave benefits shall be
51
used in the following order: sick leave, vacation, compensating time off, and holiday-in-lieu time.
(3)	Special pay allowances not of a permanent nature, such as overtime compensation, standby, night-shift differential, call back or out-ofclass pay, shall not be counted in determining the employee's gross or net pay.
(4)	Sick leave, vacation, and holiday-in-lieu shall not accrue during any pay period in which the employee receives County-paid leave benefits integrated with State Disability Insurance payments, except that the employee shall accrue sick leave, vacation, and holiday-inlieu for any actual hours worked during a pay period in which integration occurs. Service credits toward seniority and step increase eligibility shall not be affected by any pay period during which an employee is on the integrated leave and State Disability Insurance Program.
(5)	When an employee exhausts all available County-paid leave balances, the employee shall either return to work or request an unpaid leave of absence from his/her appointing authority. Regardless whether the employee continues to receive State Disability Insurance payments, once all County-paid leave balances are exhausted, County compensation shall cease unless the employee returns to work.
(6)	The County shall continue its contributions towards the employee's health, dental, life and retirement contributions in accordance with established laws and practices during the pay periods which include County payment for integrated leave balances. The employee shall be responsible for payment of premiums required to maintain medical insurance coverages when County contributions cease.
(7)	Eligible part-time employees shall be included in this program on a prorated basis.
e.	In the event the County determines that legislative or judicial determinations cause changes which in any way restrict, reduce or prohibit this program operation, it shall immediately and automatically terminate without any further action by either party to this Agreement. In the event of such termination, the County will, upon the request of the Union, meet and confer to negotiate a mutually acceptable alternative.
10.5	EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
a.	The County will make an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) available to regular employees who normally are scheduled to work forty (40) or more hours per pay period. The EAP will provide personal counseling for employees and/or members of their immediate families. The counseling is intended to assist employees and family members
52
who are experiencing personal problems such as family/marital problems, personal/emotional problems, substance abuse problems, and work-related problems.
b.	"Members of employees' immediate families" consist of and are limited to the employee's spouse, the employee's or employee's spouse's children or adopted children who are unmarried and under the age of nineteen (19) who are covered under the County's Dental Plan.
c.	The County will pay the cost of the counseling it has made available, not to exceed 360 minutes (six [6] sessions of approximately one [1] hour each) per calendar year for each employee and each covered family member. Participation in the Employee Assistance Program shall be confidential unless written consent is given by the employee or family member.
d.	It is understood that the County intends to provide the service through an independent contractor. The County may from time to time in its sole discretion change from one contractor to another.
10.6	FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT
a.	The County will expand the Flexible Spending Account which currently provides employees with the options of Premium Reduction and Dependent Care Assistance, to include Unreimbursed Medical Expenses, with a calendar year maximum of $1,000.
b.	The County will offer the Unreimbursed Medical Expense feature following an open and public Request for Proposal (RFP) process which shall be conducted in the first quarter of 1998, with final implementation to be determined by the Board of Supervisors.
ARTICLE XI RETIREMENT PLAN
11.1	RETIREMENT PLAN MODIFICATIONS
a.	The County may any time after July 1, 1981, modify the current miscellaneous retirement plan to provide that:
(1)	New employees hired after a date to be established by the County shall have retirement benefits computed in accordance with Section 31462 of the County Employees' Retirement Law of 1937 which uses three-year final average salary figures.
(2)	The County may, for those same employees, eliminate the application of mandatory cost-of-living provisions in Article 16.5 of the Law. It is understood that from time to time when new
53
employees become eligible for benefits under the plan modifications the County Board of Retirement may, financial limitations permitting, grant a cost-of-living adjustment as they in their discretion deem prudent.
(3)	The County, may for those same employees, adopt the provisions of Section 31727.7 of the Law relating to a graduating benefit scale for non-service connected disability retirements.
(4)	The County may after July 1, 1981, on the date established for bringing new employees under the provisions of Section 31727.7 of the Law, also bring all employees in classes in the unit under the provisions of Section 31727.7 of the Law.
b.	The Union agrees to participate with the County in seeking legislative amendments to the County Employees' Retirement Law of 1937 which would result in saving through reductions in contributions to the miscellaneous plan.

(a)	1 year, 2 months
(b)	1 year, 3 months
(c)	2 years, 1 month
(d)	2 years, 8 months
(e)	2 years, 10 months
(f)	3 years
Employees (a) - (d) above would be assigned to back-up assignments. Employees (e) and (f) would not be assigned back-up assignments.
(6)	Employees assigned to back-up assignments pursuant to (1) - (5) above, stay in the assignments for a three-month period.
(7)	This procedure will become effective on December 1, 1993.
ARTICLE XVI SENIORITY, LAYOFFS AND REEMPLOYMENT
DIVISION A APPLICATION-PURPOSES-RIGHTS
16.1	PURPOSE
This article establishes layoff procedures and reemployment rights. The decision to reduce the number of positions in a class in a department and the reasons for any such reduction shall be within the sole and exclusive discretion of the County. However, the order of layoff and the identity of those employees to be laid off shall be governed by the provisions of this article. This article also establishes reemployment rights and the order of reemployment of employees who are laid off and provides for the resolution of any dispute which might arise respecting the order of layoff or reemployment of those employees who are laid off.
67
16.2	DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS
a. Words and terms used in this article shall have the same meaning as applies to their use in Chapter 2.78, Sacramento County Code, unless otherwise defined below:
(1)	Former class: A class in which an employee previously has held permanent status. An employee may have one (1) or more former classes. However, only those classes in which the employee has held permanent status during the current period of continuous service are eligible former classes in respect to a right to demote.
(2)	Layoff: The involuntary termination from a class of a permanent or probationary employee without fault on the part of the employee, because of lack of work, lack of funds, or in the interest of economy.
(3)	Limited-Term Employee: A person who accepts a limited-term appointment as defined in Section 7.7(f) of the Civil Service Commission rules. A limited-term employee is a temporary employee for purposes of this article. However, a permanent employee appointed to a limited-term position shall have return rights, within the same department, from the limited-term position to the permanent position.
(4)	Separation: Release from employment of a temporary employee or the return of a regular employee from a temporary upgrade to the immediate former class in which the employee held permanent status. Separation does not constitute a layoff.
(5)	Status: The employee's current appointment, such as permanent, temporary, provisional, or probationary. Temporary includes intermittent and limited term.
(6)	Temporary Employee: A person who has been appointed from a list of eligibles, or provisionally in the absence of a list, to a position which is other than a permanent position.
16.3	LAYOFF
a.	When it becomes necessary due to lack of work, lack of funds, or in the interest of economy, to reduce the number of employees in a department, the order in which employees will be laid off within each class which is affected by the layoff shall be based on seniority as provided in Section 16.5.
b.	Temporary and provisional employees in the class involved in the layoff shall be separated prior to the layoff of any probationary or permanent employees.
68
c.	Prior to the layoff of any probationary or permanent employee, any permanent employee who currently is serving in a temporary position in that class shall be separated and returned to the class in which the person holds permanent status in that department.
d.	Probationary and permanent employees shall be laid off in the inverse order of their seniority.
16.4	RIGHT TO DEMOTE
a.	Any employee who is scheduled for layoff shall have a right to demote within the department in which layoff will occur to a class in which the employee formerly held permanent status. If there is no authorized position in the department in the class to which the employee would otherwise have a right to demote, then this subsection shall not apply. The right to demote within the department to which the employee is assigned, shall be implemented as follows:
(1)	If there is only one (1) other lower salaried class within the department in which the employee formerly held permanent status, the employee shall be demoted to that class. If there is no vacancy in that class and the demoting employee has less seniority than all other employees within the department in that class, the demoting employee shall be laid off from that class and from employment.
(2)	If there are two (2) or more lower salaried classes within the department in which the employee formerly held permanent status, the employee shall be demoted to that class in which the employee formally held permanent status which has the highest salary. If there is no vacancy in that class, and the demoting employee has less seniority than all other employees within the department in that class, the above process shall continue until the demoting employee either reaches a class within the department in which the employee formerly held permanent status in which there is a vacancy or in which the employee is not the least senior employee within the department in that class, or the employee is laid off from employment.
(3)	An employee who is least senior in a class in which there is no vacancy and to which an employee demotes from a higher class within the department shall be laid off from that class, and shall have the same right to demote as does any other employee who is laid off.
(4)	An employee demoted under this procedure shall be deemed to have exercised the employee's right to demote and to have accepted each demotion, subject to the employee's right to resign from employment.
69
(5)	An employee who is demoted from a class in which the employee holds permanent status shall be deemed for all purposes to have been laid off from each class from which the employee subsequently demotes or is displaced, including classes which the employee passes through because of the absence of a vacancy and insufficient seniority to occupy a position.
b.	An employee who is scheduled for layoff, shall be entitled to request a demotion to another class in which the employee formerly held permanent status which is currently authorized in another department. Except as provided in (3) below, the right to request demotion to another department applies to any class in which the employee formerly held permanent status which has a lower salary than the class from which the employee was laid off, which is authorized in any department other than the department to which the employee was assigned prior to layoff.
(1)	The appointing authority of the department to which the employee requests transfer may, in the appointing authority's discretion, grant a request to demote if there is (a) a vacancy in the class within the department or (b) the requesting employee would not be the least senior employee in the new department within the class to which the request is made.
(2)	An employee whose request to demote to another department is granted, shall be deemed for all purposes to have been laid off from the class from which the employee demotes.
(3)	Such right to request demotion shall not apply to a class to which an employee is demoted within the same department. The purpose of the right to request a demotion to another department is to avoid layoff from employment.

DIVISION C REEMPLOYMENT
16.21	ENTITLEMENT
a. With respect to classes covered by this article, reemployment entitlements shall be as follows:
(1)	A person who held permanent status in the class from which the person was laid off shall, during the two-year period following the effective date of layoff, be entitled to be appointed from a departmental reemployment list to a vacancy authorized to be filled in that class within the department from which the person was laid off pursuant and subject to the provision set forth in this division.
(2)	A person who held permanent status in the class from which he/she was laid off, shall also, during the two-year period following the effective date of layoff, be entitled to certification from a County-wide reemployment list for a vacancy in the class from which the person was laid off, which is authorized to be filled, pursuant and subject to the provisions set forth in this division.
76
16.22	TYPE OF POSITION
The entitlement to appointment or certification applies whether the position in which the vacancy occurs is regular, temporary, or limited term.
16.23	LIMITED-TERM
Personnel serving under limited-term appointments shall not be entitled to reemployment rights or to placement on either a departmental or County-wide reemployment list, whether or not they held permanent status as limited-term appointees in the class from which they were separated.
16.24	DEPARTMENTAL REEMPLOYMENT LISTS
a.	The County shall prepare a departmental reemployment list for each class in each department in which an employee with permanent status in that class is laid off. As personnel are separated from a class in which they hold permanent status, their names shall be added to the list for the class and department in which the layoff occurs in the inverse order in which they are separated from service in that class.
b.	Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, the order of names on departmental reemployment lists shall be derived from (by inverting) the order of layoff prescribed by layoff lists, as the order of layoff may be modified by agreement between the parties or award under grievance-arbitration proceedings commenced pursuant to layoff under Division B, above. The purpose of this provision is to insure that disputes concerning the order of layoff and of departmental reemployment lists are raised and settled at or near the time of layoff, and not at the time reemployment is sought.
c.	At the time the class of Mail Messenger is consolidated with the class of Stock Clerk, the departmental reemployment list for Mail Messenger shall be abolished and the name of any person on that list shall be placed on a departmental reemployment list for the class of Stock Clerk. The amount of time the name of any person was on the departmental reemployment list for Mail Messenger shall be counted in determining the date the name is removed from the departmental reemployment list for Stock Clerk.
16.25	COUNTY-WIDE REEMPLOYMENT LISTS
a.	The County shall prepare County-wide reemployment lists for each class from which personnel with permanent status in the class were laid off. Each list shall constitute a merger of persons who were laid off from the class and who held permanent status therein. The order of personnel on each County-wide reemployment list shall be based upon seniority according to the date of original appointment to the class to which the list refers, as determined under Division A.
b.	At the time the class of Mail Messenger is consolidated with the class of Stock Clerk, the County-wide reemployment list for Mail Messenger shall be abolished
77
and the name of any person on that list shall be placed on a County-wide reemployment list for the class of Stock Clerk. The amount of time the name of any person was on the County-wide reemployment list for Mail Messenger shall be counted in determining the date the name is removed from the County-wide reemployment list for Stock Clerk.
16.26	APPOINTMENT AND CERTIFICATION PRIORITIES
a. The following priorities shall apply in relation to vacancies in classes to which the entitlement to appointment or certification is applicable:
(1)	A vacancy in a class shall be filled first from the Medical Center transfer eligible lists prescribed in Section 7.7(d) of the Civil Service Rules, as that section existed prior to August 15, 1974. If the vacancy is not filled by appointment from the Medical Center transfer eligible list, then;
(2)	The vacancy shall be filled from that departmental reemployment list for the class in which the vacancy exists and for the department in which the vacancy exists. Persons shall be appointed to vacancies in the order of the list.
(a)	One person shall be offered an appointment for each vacancy in accordance with the order of the list. If that person declines appointment, the next person in order shall be offered appointment.

(3)	No persons shall be certified for appointment from a County-wide reemployment list to a vacancy in a class until there are no longer any names on that departmental reemployment list for the class within the department in which the vacancy exists or all persons on that departmental reemployment list have declined appointment to that vacancy. In such event, the names of three (3) persons shall be certified from the County-wide reemployment lists for the class in which the vacancy exists in accordance with the order of the list. The names shall be certified to the appointing authority for the class in which the vacancy exists, who shall have discretion to offer the appointment to one (1) of the three (3). If there is more than one (1)
78
vacancy, an additional name shall be certified for vacancy in excess of one (1).
(a)	For each person who declines an offer of appointment, an additional name shall be certified.
(b)	A person on the County-wide reemployment list shall be deemed to have declined appointment under the same circumstances and in accordance with the same procedure as is specified in Section 16.26(2)(b).

16.27	REMOVAL FROM DEPARTMENTAL REEMPLOYMENT LISTS
a. The names of persons shall be deemed removed from departmental reemployment lists and their entitlement to appointment from such lists terminated, as follows:
(1)	Upon the expiration of two (2) years following the effective date of layoff of each person.

(Personnel shall not be deemed removed from such lists by virtue of appointment to any temporary or limited-term position in any class.)
(3)	Upon declination of appointment from the list, under the same circumstances and in accordance with the same procedure as is specified in Subsection 16.26(2)(b) except in instances where the person states in writing that he temporarily is medically incapacitated.

79
a. The names of persons shall be deemed removed from County-wide reemployment lists and their entitlement to certification from such lists terminated as follows:
(1)	Upon the expiration of two (2) years following the effective date of layoff of each person.
(2)	As a result of appointment to a regular position within the County service in a class which is the same as the one for which the list exists or which, at the time of appointment, is equal to or higher than the one for which the list exists in salary when measured at the top step of the salary schedule (Personnel shall not be deemed removed from such lists by virtue of appointment to any temporary or limitedterm position in any class).

(3) of Section 16.27 a person shall be authorized to decline appointment to a class to which the person has been certified by submitting a written statement which objects to the appointment on the basis of the identity of the department, geographical location of the job, or shift schedule of the job. Such a declination shall not result in removal of the person from the County-wide reemployment list. The person shall not thereafter be certified for appointment to a vacancy which falls within the description of the written objection.
16.29	EFFECT OF REEMPLOYMENT
When a person is reemployed from either a department reemployment list or a County-wide reemployment list, the period of unemployment following the layoff shall not be treated as an interruption of service for purposes of reestablishing salary, benefits, or seniority.

17.10	PROCEDURE FOR AGENCY SHOP PERSONNEL ACTION

(1)	The Union shall notify the employee (a copy to the appointing authority) of non-compliance by certified mail, return receipt requested.

The employee may appeal the order of termination to the Civil Service Commission.
(6)	The Union shall bear all costs of terminating the employee, including all costs of the County in defending any appeal of an employee from the County's termination of such employee for failure to pay a fair share service fee. Such reimbursed costs shall not include payment of the attorney selected by the County to prosecute and defend the termination action.
17.11	INDEMNIFICATION

The authorization for payroll deductions described in Section 17.10 shall specifically require the employee to agree to hold the County harmless from all claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability that may arise against the County for or on account of any deduction made from the wages of such employee.
17.13	VOLUNTARY PAYROLL AUTHORIZATION
It is agreed that agency shop fair share fees and charitable contributions specified herein shall be deducted from the salary of each employee covered by this article who files with the County written authorization requesting such deduction be made.
89
17.14	PRECONDITIONS TO IMPLEMENTATION OF AGENCY SHOP PROVISIONS
a. The provisions of this Agreement regarding agency shop are subject to the following conditions:

ARTICLE XVIII DISCIPLINE AND DISCHARGE
18.1	PURPOSE
It is the intent of the parties that the provisions of this article, shall substitute for any and all appeal procedures provided by the Civil Service Commission relating to the discipline, as defined in Section 18.2 below, of employees in a class included in the Operations and Maintenance Unit.
18.2	DEFINITION
a.	As used herein, "disciplinary action" means demotion, reduction in pay step in class, suspension or discharge of an employee with permanent civil service status.
b.	As used herein, "parties" means the County and Local 39. If an individual employee covered by this Agreement files an appeal of discipline and Local 39 does not
90
pursue such appeal, the employee may pursue such appeal and shall assume all of the rights and obligations of Local 39 in the appeal process pursuant to this article including costs as outlined in Section 18.17.
18.3	PERSONS AUTHORIZED TO INITIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION
The employee's appointing authority or the designated representative of the appointing authority may initiate disciplinary action against an employee.
18.4	APPLICATION
a.	This article shall only apply to employees with permanent civil service status.
b.	Probationary Status: This article shall not apply to an employee in probationary status who shall have no right to grieve or arbitrate release from such probationary appointment.
c.	Temporary Employee: An employee in a temporary position shall have no right to grieve or arbitrate release from such temporary appointment.
d.	Temporary Upgrade: An employee in a temporary upgrade status shall have no right to grieve or arbitrate release from such temporary upgrade status.
e.	Provisional Appointment: An employee with provisional status shall have no right to grieve or arbitrate release from such a provisional appointment.
18.5	CAUSE FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION
a. No disciplinary action shall be taken against a permanent employee without good cause. "Good cause" is defined as any facts which, based on relevant circumstances, may be reasonably relied on by the appointing authority in the exercise of reasonable discretion as a basis for disciplinary action. "Good cause" includes, but is not limited to:
(1)	Fraud in securing appointment.
(2)	Incompetency.
(3)	Inefficiency.
(4)	Inexcusable neglect of duty.
(5)	Insubordination.
(6)	Dishonesty.
91
(7)	Drunkenness on duty.

(10)	Conviction of a felony or conviction of a misdemeanor which is of such a nature as to adversely affect the employee's ability to perform the duties and responsibilities of the employee's position. A plea of guilty, or a conviction following a plea of nolo contendere is deemed to be a conviction within the meaning of this section.
(11)	Discourteous treatment of the public or other employees.
(12)	Political activity prohibited by state or federal law.

(18)	Any violation of Civil Service Commission Rule 6.6-a which prohibits the solicitation of waivers.
(19)	Failure to pay a service fee, or a contribution required in lieu of a service fee, pursuant to an agency shop provision in a labor agreement between the County and a recognized employee organization, where the disciplinary action in question is provided for in such agreement.
18.6	CAUSES FOR PERSONNEL ACTION DUE TO PHYSICAL OR MENTAL DISABILITY
For non-disciplinary reasons, a permanent employee's employment may be terminated or a permanent employee may be reduced in rank because of physical or mental disability which disability precludes the employee from the proper performance of the essential duties of his or her job. Any such action shall be subject to the same provisions of this article as are applicable to actions taken pursuant to Section 18.5.
92
18.7	NOTICE REQUIREMENT AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF ORDER
a.	The appointing authority or designee shall file a written proposed order and final order of disciplinary action with the Director of Labor Relations.
b.	A copy of the proposed and final notice of disciplinary action shall be served upon the employee either personally, or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the employee. The last known address shall be deemed to be the address which is within the personnel file of the employee within the department to which he or she is assigned. If notice is provided by mail, the employee should be deemed to have received notice five (5) days after the date of mailing.
c.	The order shall be approved as to form by the Office of Labor Relations and shall include:
(1)	A statement of the nature of the disciplinary action;
(2)	The effective date of the disciplinary action;
(3)	A statement in ordinary and concise language of all specified facts or omissions upon which the disciplinary action is based; and
(4)	A statement advising the employee of the right to appeal the action through the arbitration procedure of this article, of the manner and time of which said appeal must be made, and the required content of the appeal.
d.	The disciplinary action shall be effective on the date and time specified in the order of disciplinary action filed with the Director, provided notice is served as specified in this action.
93
18.8	APPEAL
a.	The employee who is subject to the disciplinary action shall have the right, within fifteen (15) calendar days after receiving the final order of disciplinary action, to appeal from such order by filing a written notice of appeal signed by the employee or the employee's representative with the employee's consent with the Director of Labor Relations. The notice of appeal shall contain the name and address of the person to whom all written communication regarding this appeal shall be sent.
b.	The Director of Labor Relations shall promptly provide the appointing authority with a copy of the employee's notice of appeal.
c.	An employee who files a notice of appeal as provided herein shall be entitled to a hearing, as provided in this article.
d.	An appeal of a disciplinary action is a complaint of a permanent employee with permanent civil service status regarding whether there was good cause for the disciplinary action taken against that employee.
e.	If the employee who has been served with an order of disciplinary action fails to file a notice of appeal within the time specified in Subsection a. of this section, the disciplinary action shall become final without further action.
18.9	MEDIATION OF A DISCIPLINARY ACTION
a.	Prior to the arbitration hearing the Union may request mediation. Mediation shall take place on the first and third Tuesday of each calendar month. Subsequent days for mediation will be scheduled, if necessary. The parties agree to mutually select a panel of mediators. If the parties are unable to select a panel of mediators, they shall utilize the State Mediation and Conciliation Service.
b.	Under no case shall the adjustment of resolution of the discipline at this level exceed forty (40) working days from the date of their appeal, unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties.
c.	Mediators who have been selected by the parties to mediate disputes will be scheduled on a rotating and available basis.
d.	The parties agree to meet annually in May to review the mediators listed above. The list of mediators for the subsequent year shall be mutually agreed upon, but should the parties be unable to agree on a new list, the previous list will continue until such time as a new list is agreed to, or the State Mediation and Conciliation Services are utilized.
e.	All costs of the mediator, if any, shall be borne equally by the parties. No party shall purposely withhold information at this level but shall disclose all information relevant to the appeal for consideration by the other party.
94
f.	The mediation procedure shall be entirely informal in nature. However, copies of exhibits upon which either party bases its case shall be shared with the other party. The relevant facts should be elicited in a narrative fashion to the extent possible, rather than through examination and cross-examination of witnesses. The rules of evidence will not apply and no record of the proceedings will be made. All persons involved in the events giving rise to the appeal should be encouraged to participate fully in the proceedings, both by stating their views and by asking questions of the other participants at the mediation hearing.
g.	The primary effort of the mediator shall be to assist the parties in settling the stated appeal in a mutually satisfactory fashion. In attempting to achieve a settlement, the mediator is free to use all of the techniques customarily associated with the mediation process, including private conferences with only one (1) party. If settlement is not possible, the mediator shall provide the parties with an immediate bench opinion, as to how the appeal would be decided if it went to arbitration. That opinion would not be final or binding, but would be advisory. It would be delivered orally and would be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the mediator's opinion. The advisory opinion may be used as the basis for further settlement discussions or for withdrawal or granting of the appeal. If the appeal is not settled, granted, or withdrawn, the parties are free to arbitrate. If they do, the mediator shall not serve as arbitrator, and no offers or concessions made by the parties or the mediator during mediation can be used against a party during arbitration.
h.	Neither attorneys nor court reporters or any other type of note-taker shall be allowed to be present at the proceedings.
i.	If the parties agree to be bound by a mediator's recommendation, the subsequent agreement shall be reduced to writing and signed by the parties.
j.	If the issue is not resolved during mediation, and in accordance with established timeliness the appeal shall move to arbitration.
18.10	ASSIGNMENT OF AN ARBITRATOR
a.	The parties to the hearing and to the selection of the arbitrator shall be the employee, who may be represented by Local 39 or independent counsel, and the County.
b.	In the event the parties are unable to agree on the selection of an arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be selected from the following list:
Gerald McKay
Alexander Cohn Jerilou Cossack Kenneth Silbert Leo Kanowitz
This list may be modified by mutual agreement of the parties.
95
c.	Arbitration Selection: Where this section is used to determine the selection of an arbitrator, the arbitrator to hear a particular dispute shall be determined on a straight rotation basis, based upon the above listed order. If the next arbitrator on the rotation is unwilling to serve as the arbitrator, that arbitrator shall be bypassed and the next listed arbitrator shall be the selected arbitrator to be contacted. Either party shall have the right to declare an arbitrator as unavailable if the arbitrator cannot conduct the hearing within ninety (90) calendar days of being contacted by the parties. If a party makes such a declaration, that arbitrator will be bypassed and the next listed arbitrator shall be the selected arbitrator to be contacted.
d.	If none of the arbitrators are able to serve based upon this selection process, the parties may mutually select any arbitrator. If the parties are unable to mutually agree upon an arbitrator, a list of five (5) arbitrators shall be requested from the State Mediation and Conciliation Service. The parties shall alternately strike one (1) name from this list and the remaining name shall be the selected arbitrator.
18.11	AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER
At any time after a hearing has commenced on a disciplinary action and prior to the time the appeal is submitted for decision, the appointing authority may, with the consent of the arbitrator, serve on the employee and file with the Director of Labor Relations an amended or supplemental order of disciplinary action. Consent is not required for an amended or supplemental order filed prior to commencement of the hearing. If the amended or supplemental order presents new causes or allegations, the employee shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to prepare a defense thereto. Any new causes or allegations shall be deemed denied and any objections to the amended or supplemental causes or allegations may be made orally at the hearing.
18.12	DISCOVERY
a.	Permissible discovery: Pursuant to the procedure set forth in Subsection c. below, any party to the arbitration hearing may obtain the following information in the hands of or which may reasonably be obtained by the responding party or the responding party's representative (As used herein, "responding party" shall mean the person of whom the information is requested.):
(1)	Those allegations in the order of disciplinary action which are admitted by the employee and those allegations in the order of disciplinary action which are denied by the employee.
(2)	The name, address and telephone number of each witness whom the responding party intends to call to testify at the hearing.
(3)	Copies of statements by any person whom the responding party intends to call as a witness.
(4)	All writing relevant to the issues involved in the appeal including, but not limited to, reports of mental, physical and blood examinations
96
which the responding party intends to introduce into evidence. "Writing" as used herein shall have the meaning defined in Evidence Code Section 250 which states: "Writing" means handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording upon any tangible thing any form of communication or representation, including letters, words, pictures, sounds or symbols, or combinations thereof.
(5)	A statement specifically defining the issues in dispute.
(6)	The foregoing does not apply to witnesses or exhibits used for impeachment or rebuttal.
b.	Confidential or privileged matter: If the responding party determines that the writing or other material requested is confidential or privileged, the response to the discovery request shall specifically so state, and shall set forth in detail the grounds upon which confidentiality or privilege is claimed. If the requesting party disputes the claim of privilege or confidentiality, the arbitrator shall resolve the claim. In resolving the claim, the arbitrator may order that the writing or other material be deposited with the arbitrator in a sealed container. In ruling on such claims, the arbitrator may grant or deny the claim of confidentiality or privilege in whole or in part. The arbitrator shall have no authority to resolve any claim concerning material which by statute may only be released by court order. If the arbitrator determines that the material is confidential, but limited disclosure is necessary, the arbitrator may impose conditions upon the use or disclosure of the item by the requesting party. If the arbitrator determines that the material requested is subject to an evidentiary privilege, the decision regarding disclosure of the matter shall be strictly governed by the provisions of the Evidence Code.
c.	Procedure for discovery:
(1)	Personal service: At any time after the hearing date has been set for an appeal, but in no event later than thirty (30) calendar days before the date set for such hearing, any party may personally serve a written request upon the responding party, or representative of record, for any or all of the information set forth in Subsection (a) above.
(2)	Service by mail: At any time after the hearing date has been set for an appeal, but in no event later than thirty-five (35) calendar days before the date set for such hearing, any party may serve, by first-class mail, a written request upon the responding party, or representative of record, for any or all of the information set forth in Subsection a. above. The effective date of service shall be the date of the postmark.
(3)	Response: Within twenty (20) calendar days of receiving the request mentioned in (1) and (2) above, the responding party shall prepare and serve a response to the request. Such response shall be served
97
upon the requesting party, or representative of record, by the same means as service of the request was made.
(4)	Request to be deemed continuing request: The discovery request is a continuing request, which requires a continuous response. Where new or additional information becomes available to the responding party, such information shall forthwith be furnished to the requesting party, or representative of record.
(5)	Negative response: In the event the responding party does not have an item of the information requested, the responding party shall give a written negative response as to that particular item within the time specified for response, but shall respond fully as to the information which the responding party does possess. The responding party shall comply with (4) above after such negative response.
(6)	Disputes: Any dispute between parties regarding discovery shall be resolved by the arbitrator.
(7)	Penalties for failure to comply: The arbitrator shall impose penalties for failure to comply with this subsection. These penalties shall be based upon the seriousness of the failure to comply, the good or bad faith of the non-complying party, and the extent to which the noncompliance results in surprise to the requesting party and handicaps the requesting party in preparing the case. The following penalties may be imposed:
(a)	Exclusion of evidence;
(b)	Continuing the hearing at any stage; or
(c)	Upon proof of a willful or repeated violation, the arbitrator shall determine the issue against the noncomplying party.
18.13	TIMING AND CONDUCT OF HEARING
a.	The arbitration hearing shall be held at the earliest administratively convenient date, taking into consideration the availability of the arbitrator and the availability of counsel and witnesses. The arbitration hearing shall be a private hearing.
b.	The employee shall be entitled to be represented by Local 39 and counsel chosen by Local 39; or, if the employee chooses not to be represented by Local 39, the employee may be self-represented. The employee has the further right to pay for and retain independent counsel for representation at the hearing.
c.	The employee shall be entitled to appear personally at the hearing and produce evidence.
98
d.	Local 39 shall have the right to attend the hearing if Local 39 is not chosen by the employee as his/her representative.
e.	The appointing authority may also be represented by counsel.
f.	At the hearing, the appointing authority shall have the burden of going
forward first with evidence in support of the allegations contained in the order of disciplinary action and shall have the burden of establishing the facts by a preponderance of the evidence. The arbitrator may administer oaths and take official notice of facts as authorized by law.
g.	Oral evidence shall be taken only on oath or affirmation.
h.	A court reporter shall take a transcript of the hearing.
i.	The arbitrator may consider the records or any relevant prior disciplinary actions against the employee which are final, and any records contained in the employee's personnel files if such records were introduced at the arbitration hearing.
j.	Each party shall have these rights: To call and examine witnesses; to introduce exhibits; to cross-examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues even though that matter was not covered in the direct examination; to impeach any witness; and to rebut evidence. The appellant may be called and examined as if under cross-examination.
k.	The hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions. Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence, but shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. The rules of privilege shall be effective to the extent that they are otherwise required by statute to be recognized at the hearing, and irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
18.14	SUBPOENAS
Before the hearing has commenced, or during the hearing, the arbitrator shall have the power to issue subpoenas in accordance with Section 1282.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
18.15	DECISION
a.	Following the hearing, the arbitrator shall promptly prepare and submit to the parties to the hearing a decision in the case within thirty (30) calendar days. The decision shall contain and be limited to specific factual findings relating to the facts alleged in the disciplinary order and any facts asserted by the appellant for purposes of
99
defense or mitigation; a determination of legal issues, if any; a determination of whether the facts found constitute good cause for discipline; and an order that affirms, modifies or sets aside the order of disciplinary action imposed by the appointing authority.
b.	In determining whether there is cause for discipline, the arbitrator shall independently review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the charges. If good cause for the disciplinary action is found under this independent review standard, the arbitrator shall not modify or reduce the penalty imposed by the appointing authority unless the arbitrator issues written findings demonstrating that there is clear and convincing evidence that the level of such discipline is improper.
18.16	FINALITY OF DECISION
The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding.
18.17	COSTS
The fees and expenses of the arbitrator, the court reporter, and the transcript, if any, shall be shared equally by Local 39 and the County. If an individual employee not represented by Local 39 files an appeal of discipline and he/she retains independent counsel, he/she shall be responsible for all costs of retaining said counsel and shall be responsible for sharing equally with the County the costs of the arbitrator, court reporter and transcript or any related costs for arbitration.
18.18	WITNESSES
The County agrees that employees shall not suffer loss of compensation for time spent as a witness at an arbitration hearing held pursuant to this article. The employee and Local 39 agree that the number of witnesses requested to attend and their scheduling shall be reasonable.
