ARTICLE 7 - LEAVES
Part 1 All Unit Members Excluding Adult Hourly Certificated
Leave is permission granted by the Board for unit members to be absent from assigned duties for a specific period of time. It is recognized that there are two types of leaves: paid and unpaid leave. All leaves shall comply with the Family Medical Leave Act and the California Family Rights Act.
7.1	Paid Leave
7.1.1.	Sick Leave
Every unit member employed five days a week shall be entitled to ten days leave of absence each year for illness, injury, mental health, or disability, including those caused or contributed to because of pregnancy, miscarriage, or childbirth. Childcare unit members who work more than the 179 workdays shall receive one day of sick leave for each additional month worked. The unit member employed for less than five school days a week shall be entitled, for a school year of service, to that proportion of ten days leave of absence for illness or injury as the number of days s/he is employed per week bears to five. If any unit member does not take the full amount of leave allowed in any school year under this section, the amount not taken shall be accumulated from year to year. The warrant stub of each unit member shall contain a statement of total accrued sick leave. Any error in reporting on the warrant stub shall not be subject to the grievance procedure, provided it is corrected on the next payroll cycle after the error becomes known. Any unit member who is absent for lengthy personal illness may not be paid for such absences beyond five consecutive working days unless he or she presents to the Superintendent/designee a written statement from a doctor verifying the illness, injury, or disability. A medical certificate will not be required to substantiate a request for approval of such leave for five consecutive days or less unless the unit member has been notified by his/her immediate supervisor on at least one occasion about excessive use or abuse of sick leave. When a unit member has been on an extended absence due to illness, injury, or disability, and has indicated his/her intent to return, the District may require certification by a qualified medical doctor mutually acceptable to the Board and to the unit member that the unit member is capable of performing his/her normally assigned duties. The cost of such examination shall be borne by the District. In the event that unusually large numbers of unit members do not report for work, the Superintendent may then declare that an emergency situation exists. With the declaration of such emergency and for the duration thereof, each unit member who is absent and who requests pay for sick leave must provide a written verification of illness or injury from a doctor for each day of absence. Prior
2002-05 Agreement
Page 40 of 100
written notice of such requirement shall be given to the unit member whenever possible.
7.1.2.	Long-Term Sick Leave
When a unit member who is absent from her/his duties on account of illness, injury, or disability including those caused or contributed to because of pregnancy, miscarriage, or childbirth, for a period of five (5) school months or less, whether or not the absence arises out of or in the course of the employment of the unit member, the amount deducted from the salary due him/her for any month in which the absence occurs shall not exceed the sum which is actually paid a substitute employed to fill the position during his/her absence or, if no substitute was employed, the amount which would have been paid to the substitute had s/he been employed. The deduction will not be greater than 50% of the absent unit member's regular per diem rate of pay. These provisions shall not apply to the first ten (10) days of absence on account of illness or accident, providing the unit member has 10 days of accumulated regular sick leave. If the unit member has less than 10 days of regular sick leave accumulated, long-term sick leave shall begin the day after regular sick leave is exhausted.
7.1.3	Industrial Accident or Illness Leave
If a unit member incurs an industrial injury or illness in the line of duty, s/he is entitled to receive compensation insurance payments with verification by a licensed medical practitioner for each day of absence. The following regulations apply:
7.1.3.1	Allowable leave shall be for not more than 60 days during
which the schools of the District are required to be in session or when the unit member would otherwise have been performing work for the District in any one fiscal year for the same accident;
7.1.3.2	Allowable leave shall not be accumulated from year to year;
7.1.3.3	Industrial accident or illness leave shall commence on the
first day of absence;
7.1.3.4	When a unit member is absent from his/her duties on
account of an industrial accident or illness, she/he shall be paid such portion of the salary due him/her for any month in which the absence occurs as when added to his/her temporary disability
2002-05 Agreement
Page 41 of 100
indemnity under Division 4 or Division 4.5 of the Labor Code, will result in a payment to him/her of not more than his/her full salary; the phrase "full salary" as utilized in this subdivision shall be computed so that it shall not be less than the unit member's "average weekly earnings" as that phrase is utilized in Section 4453 of the Labor Code. For purposes of this section, however, the maximum and minimum average weekly earnings set forth in Section 4453 of the Labor Code shall otherwise not be deemed applicable.
7.1.3.5	Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one
day for each day of authorized absence regardless of a temporary disability indemnity award;
7.1.3.6	When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the unit member shall be entitled to only the amount of unused leave due him/her for the same illness or injury. Upon termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, the unit member shall be entitled to use accumulated sick leave and the benefits provided previously for long-term sick leave. For the purposes of these sections, the absence shall be deemed to have commenced on the date of termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, provided that if the unit member continues to receive temporary disability indemnity, s/he may elect to take as much of his/her accumulated sick leave which, when added to his/her temporary disability indemnity, will result in a payment to him/her of not more than his/her full salary. During any paid leave of absence, the unit member shall endorse to the District the temporary disability indemnity checks received on account of his/her industrial accident or illness. The District, in turn, shall issue the unit member appropriate salary warrants for payment of the unit member's salary and shall deduct normal retirement and other authorized contributions. Any unit member receiving benefits as a result of this section shall, during periods of injury or illness, remain within the State of California unless the Governing Board authorizes travel outside the State.
7.1.4.	Personal Necessity Leave
A unit member of the District may use accumulated sick leave in cases of personal necessity. The unit member shall not be required to secure advance permission for leave taken for any of the following reasons:
7.1.4.1	Death or serious illness of a member of his/her immediate family. The immediate family is as defined under Bereavement Leave. Days taken under this term may be added to days taken
2002-05 Agreement

ARTICLE 11 - PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION OF UNIT MEMBERS
This process applies to all unit members except as noted in Sections 11.3 and 11.4.
11.1	Purpose of Evaluation - The primary purpose of evaluation of unit members is to improve the instructional process and/or the educational services provided to students. Each teacher is a unique personality and achieves rapport with students through that personality or "style." The unique contribution that each teacher brings is valued and is intended to be enhanced rather than inhibited by the evaluation process. Evaluation is a continuing, dynamic process during which a written report is compiled at certain pre-determined times.
11.2	Evaluation Frequencv/Process
11.2.1	Every unit member shall be evaluated annually under evaluation Process A, except for permanent unit members whose most recent final evaluation contains an overall performance rating of “satisfactory.”
Permanent unit members whose most recent final evaluation contains an overall performance rating of “satisfactory” shall be evaluated every other year under Process S. However, Process A shall be utilized for unit members in their second year of permanent status and/or unit members who change job categories.
Two major evaluation procedures are self-evaluation and classroom observations by the evaluator.
11.2.2	Process A
No later than October 15, the evaluator and the unit member shall jointly select three standards from the six California Standards for the Teaching Profession and complete the appropriate form (Attachment 2a). The evaluator and the unit member shall jointly create three objectives, one for each of the standards jointly selected. In the event the parties cannot agree on three objectives, each party shall select two (2) objectives for a total of four (4) objectives.
The evaluator and the unit member shall also jointly determine which objectives will be emphasized at the first formal observation. The objectives to be observed may be changed by mutual agreement.
The final evaluation shall be based on at least two (2) formal observations of the unit member. The first formal observation shall occur no later than December 1. The second formal observation shall occur no later than March 1.
2002-05 Agreement
Page 72 of 100
At the post-observation conference following the first formal observation, the evaluator and the unit member shall jointly determine which objectives will be emphasized at the second formal observation. The objectives to be observed may be changed by mutual agreement.
11.2.3	Process B
No later than October 15, the evaluator and the unit member shall jointly select one standard from the six California Standards for the Teaching Profession and complete the appropriate form (Attachment 2b). The evaluator and the unit member shall jointly create one objective. In the event that the parties cannot agree on one objective, each party shall select one (1) objective for a total of two (2) objectives.
The written evaluation report shall be based on self-evaluation and may include classroom observation(s) and/or other mutually acceptable evaluation techniques. If classroom observation(s) are used as the basis for the evaluation report, the observations shall comply with the standards defined in Process A except that the parties may agree to a different number of observations and a different timeline for the observation(s).
11.2.4	Manager Initiated Movement Between Processes
To initiate movement of a unit member from Process B to Process A, the unit member must receive written notice from the manager prior to his/her last workday. The notice shall include:
