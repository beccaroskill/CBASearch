ARTICLE 8	OVERTIME
Section 1.	Compensation
The parties agree to jointly recommend to the County's Board of Supervisors that overtime shall be compensated as follows:
A.	Non-Exempt Employees
The County will pay overtime for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) in one week. "Hours worked" will be calculated as provided for by the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. §201, et seq. Hours worked do not include time for which persons are compensated but do not actually work, including but not limited to, sick leave and vacation pay, with the exception that those hours paid during a workweek for a regular County holiday will be counted in calculating hours worked for overtime purposes. Effective April 1,1988, those hours paid during a workweek for compensatory time off will also be counted in calculating hours worked for overtime purposes for employees in classes in the Probation Department.
The County will pay employees for any overtime worked at a rate of one and one-half (1 %) times his/her regular rate of pay. Regular rate of pay shall be calculated as provided for by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
17
701 DLW
B.	Exempt Employees
Employees considered to be "Exempt," as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act, shall receive compensatory time off at the straight time rate for all hours worked after forty (40) hours in one week, except as provided in Section 5.
"Hours worked" shall be calculated as provided for by the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. §201, et. seq. Hours worked do not include time for which persons are compensated but do not actually work, including but not limited to, sick leave and vacation pay, with the exception that hours paid during a workweek for a regular County holiday will be counted in calculating hours worked for overtime purposes. Effective April 1, 1988, those hours paid during a workweek for compensatory time off will also be counted in calculating hours worked for overtime purposes for those employees in classes in the Probation Department.
Section 2.	Usage of Compensatory Time - Exempt Employees
A.	An exempt employee, as defined under the Fair Labor Standards Act, shall not be directed by management to take compensatory time off without at least ten (10) business days prior notice nor be denied a timely request to carry over or take such time off.
18
701 DLW
B.	The employee may accumulate compensatory time off. With prior approval of departmental management, accumulated compensatory time not used during the calendar year in which it is earned may be carried over one (1) additional calendar year during which it must be taken.
Compensatory time not used within the above period shall be paid to the employee at the straight time rate rather than lost.
C.	The overtime rate for employees in this unit is the premium rate which is one and one-half (1 %) times the regular rate for employees whose regular rate of pay is $1822 per month or less; $15.71 per hour for employees whose regular rate of pay is more than $1822, but less than $2734 per month; and the straight time hourly rate for persons whose regular rate of pay is $2734 or more per month.
Effective July 1, 1990, the premium rate shall be one and one-half (1 %) times the regular rate for employees whose regular rate of pay is $1931.00 per month or less; $16.65 per hour for employees whose regular rate of pay is more than $1931.00, but less than $2897.00 per month; and the straight time hourly for persons whose regular rate of pay is $2897.00 or more per month.
19
701 DLW
The computation of the premium rate shall be based on the employee's regular rate of pay calculated as provided for by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Section 4.	Saving Clause
If, during the term of this agreement, the Fair Labor Standards Act is delayed by law or is determined not to be applicable to all or any classification of public employees or public agencies through legislation, regulation, or court decision, the overtime provisions of the 1983-85 MOU shall be reincorporated into this MOU and applied in this Unit and any contrary language shall be deleted subsequent to the effective date of such action.
Section 5.	Department Head Authority
Department Heads may pay overtime to exempt employees in lieu of compensatory time off when the Department Head deems it essential to the effective operation of the department and its mission, subject to approval of the Chief Administrative Office.
Section 6.
For the purpose of this Article:
(1)	Hours required to be worked are hours which department management directs the employee to work.
20
701DLW
(2)	The parties agree that two 8-hour periods of sleep time, as defined under the FLSA, will not be calculated as hours worked for overtime purposes for employees on a 56-hour work schedule.
