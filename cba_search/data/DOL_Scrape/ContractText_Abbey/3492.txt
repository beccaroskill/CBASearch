PREAMBLE
This Agreement entered into by the Municipality of Anchorage, hereinafter referred to as the "Municipality" or "Employer" and the Anchorage Police Department Employees Association, hereinafter referred to as the "Association," has as its purpose the promotion of harmonious relations between the Municipality and the Association; the establishment of an equitable and peaceful procedure for the resolution of differences; the establishment of wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment to encourage a more efficient and effective service in the public interest.
ARTICLE I
RECOGNITION AND BARGAINING UNIT
Section 1.	Recognition.
The Municipality of Anchorage hereby recognizes, during the term of this Agreement, the Anchorage Police Department Employees Association, as the exclusive bargaining agent for all employees of the Police Department whose job classifications are listed in Article XVI of this Agreement.
Section 2.	Membership.
All employees covered under the terms of this Agreement shall make application to join the Association within thirty-one (31) calendar days following the date of employee's hire or signing of this Agreement, whichever is the latter, and must maintain membership in good standing, as uniformly required by the Association, for the life of this Agreement and any renewal thereof.
Refusal to join the Association or to maintain membership in good standing shall be grounds for dismissal. If the Association fails to admit such an employee into the Association membership, this shall not be cause for his/her dismissal. The Association shall advise the Municipality in writing within thirty (30) days of any individual who has failed to make application under the terms of this section. The Association agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and pay all costs and attorney's fees which may arise from any claim and/or liability of the Municipality for terminating an employee in good faith pursuant to this section.
Section 3.	Non-Discrimination.
It is hereby agreed that there shall be no discrimination by the Municipality against any employee because of race, color, creed, age, sex, disability, recognizing bona fide occupational qualifications, national origin, or because of membership in or lawful activity on behalf of the Association. It is hereby agreed that there shall be no discrimination by the Association against any employee or any employee desiring to be a member because of race, color, creed, age, sex, disability, or national origin. The
1
provisions of the Agreement shall be applied equally to all employees without discrimination as to age, sex, marital status, race, color, creed, handicap, national origin, or political affiliation. The Municipality shall bear responsibility for defending against allegations of violations of this section on the part of the Municipality; the Association shall bear responsibility for defending against alleged violations on the part of the Association. Further, the Municipality is committed to positive, practical efforts in employment, promotion, and administration of personnel actions pursuant to this Agreement to ensure equal employment opportunity to all employees at all job levels. The Association recognizes and supports that commitment.
All reference to employees in this Agreement designate both sexes, and wherever the male gender is used, it shall be construed to include male and female employees.
Section 4.	Notice of Hire.
The Municipality will advise the Association in writing of all new Police Department employees and their date of hire within fourteen (14) days of employment.
Section 5.	Initial Probationary Period.
Each new sworn employee, community service officer which is required to be APSC certified and each new communications clerk shall be hired as a probationary employee until the end of a probationary period of one (1) year. The probationary period will end twelve months following the conclusion of the employee’s field training or equivalent training, but no longer than eighteen (18) months from the employee’s day of hire, except by letter of agreement between the Association and Chief. Each non-sworn employee, except communication clerks and community service officers, shall serve a probationary period of six (6) months. These periods may be extended for thirty (30) day periods by mutual consent of the Association and the Chief.
The Municipality's decision to terminate a new-hire probationary employee cannot be overturned unless it is found to be arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory or made in bad faith.
Section 6.	Promotional Probationary Period.
Employees who have fulfilled the probationary period described in Article I, Section 5 shall receive permanent status and shall not be subject to any extended period of probation or additional probation for any reason, except that any employee who has been promoted to a higher rank shall be placed on an additional six-month promotional probationary period.
Non-sworn employees who have been transferred shall serve a sixty (60)-day transfer probationary period. If any employee fails to successfully complete the promotional or transfer (for non-sworn employees) probationary period or voluntarily wishes to be demoted back to their previous position, said personnel shall be permitted to do so without any loss or break in position seniority as described in Article IX, § 2, except an
2
employee shall not continue to accumulate position seniority for any time served in another position.
Non-sworn personnel who are promoted or transferred to sworn personnel status shall serve the probationary period as described in Article I, Section 5.
In the case of a transfer or promotion to the Communications Center, the employee shall serve the probationary period as described in Article I, Section 5.
In the case of a transfer or promotion to a community service officer, the employee shall serve the probationary period as described in Article I, Section 5.
No employee who is on probation may be promoted until the probationary period has been completed.
Section 7.	Personnel Regulations.
Where this Agreement is silent, pursuant to A.O. 3.70.170 the Municipality of Anchorage Personnel Regulations shall apply to employees represented by the Anchorage Police Department Employees Association.
Section 8.	Contracting.
A.	Parking Enforcement Contracting.
It is and has been the policy of the Municipality to make every effort to utilize its employees to perform work when they are qualified to do so, but the Municipality reserves the right to contract out parking enforcement.
In its exercise of this right, the Municipality agrees that subcontracting will be limited to parking enforcement, and that it will not contract or subcontract work regularly performed by other employees. The Municipality further agrees that it will not lay off any employee because of its exercise of its contracting rights here.
B.	Other Contracting.
1.	Pursuant to the terms and conditions in this article, the Municipality shall be allowed to subcontract the following: Prisoner transport, subpoena service, the service of civil warrants, non-injury accident investigations, vehicle towing, and the preparation of transcripts.
2.	Any cost savings from subcontracting shall be used to provide additional staffing and/or equipment for the Anchorage Police Department. The Department agrees to meet and confer with the Association if equipment purchases are more than 10% of the ratio of staffing costs to equipment purchases which existed for the Anchorage Police Department in 1995.
3.	No member of the APDEA shall be laid off or otherwise lose their job at the Anchorage Police Department as a result of subcontracting.
3
4.	Before subcontracting, the Municipality will conduct a study to determine the cost\benefit of subcontracting. No subcontracting shall be undertaken unless to do so produces savings to the Municipality. The APDEA shall be informed of any report or study, shall be allowed input regarding the same, and will be provided with a copy of any final report or study.
5.	Before subcontracting is implemented, the APDEA will be given an opportunity to present an alternative means of accomplishing the work proposed to be subcontracted which does not involve subcontracting and which maintains the work as bargaining unit work. The APDEA's proposal must be presented within fourteen (14) days of the receipt of the Municipality's final report or study. If, in the reasonable opinion of the Municipality, the APDEA's proposal meets or exceeds the savings expected to be achieved by subcontracting, as set forth in the Municipality's final report/study, the APDEA's proposal shall be implemented in lieu of subcontracting.
6.	At the conclusion of a subcontracting contract, if the Municipality proposes to continue the subcontracting, the provisions of Section 5 shall be applied again. In so doing, the APDEA proposal, if submitted, will be judged against the new, proposed subcontract.
7.	Where subcontracting involves access to confidential information or to law enforcement investigations, the individuals used for the subcontracting will be subject to the same background investigation, as permitted by law, as may be applicable to APDEA members.
C.	Citizen’s Academy.
Though ordinarily the making of follow-up telephone calls to crime victims would be work performed by the APDEA, notwithstanding the other provisions of this article, the Municipality shall be allowed to have volunteers from the Citizens’ Academy make such follow-up telephone calls, and perform such other work as shall be agreed to by the Chief and the APDEA.
D.	Port Security.
1.	The Municipality shall be allowed to subcontract security work at the Port of Anchorage so long as the work duties and assignments of the contract are restricted to the following: Limiting access of unauthorized persons to the Port, ensuring that authorized persons do not bring unauthorized property into the Port, and ensuring compliance of authorized persons with the Port’s safety and security regulations pursuant to the Marine Transportation Security Act of 2002.
2.	In order to facilitate cooperation between APD and the Port, the sergeant assigned to Community Liaison or designated by the Chief will regularly meet with a security officer of comparable rank to discuss issues that may interfere with the cooperation between APD officers and security guards and to insure that the information necessary to the conduct of effective police and security activities in the Port are efficiently communicated to the APD officers and security guards who need the information.
4
3.	The Municipality recognizes that law enforcement on Municipal streets is a function of the Anchorage Police Department.
4.	The Municipality and the APDEA agree that the Port Security Contract will not be expanded to permit security guards to perform work traditionally performed by APDEA members at other locations or facilities within the Municipality. This agreement has no impact on current contracts for private security guards at certain Municipal buildings.
ARTICLE II
SCOPE OF AGREEMENT
Section 1.	Management Rights.
It is recognized that the Municipality retains the right, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, to manage the affairs of the Municipality and direct its work force.
Section 2.	Change of Operations.
Where new types of equipment are used which change the operations of the Department, new classifications are created, or the duties of an existing classification are substantially changed, the wages, hours, and working conditions covering such operation or classification shall be negotiated between the parties. In the event that negotiations cannot be finalized to the satisfaction of both parties, the issue shall be submitted to the Classification and Pay Section of the Municipality for its determination. Rates agreed upon or awarded shall be effective as of the date the job classification becomes effective. The establishment of wages rates under this section is subject to grievance and/or arbitration.
Section 3.	Notices.
All notices required by either party in this Agreement shall be in writing to the President of the Association, Municipal Labor Relations Director, and Chief of Police.
Section 4.	Computation of Time.
References to a day or timeframes in day segments shall be counted as calendar days except where otherwise stated in this Agreement.
Section 5.	Meet and Confer.
The parties agree that they will meet and confer in good faith at reasonable times and places concerning this agreement, and its interpretation or any other matter of mutual concern to employee representatives and the municipality. The parties further agree that either party may request, in a writing delivered to the other, that the parties confer within 14 days after the date of delivery of the request, which request shall specify the matter to be discussed. An unexcusable refusal to meet and confer in response to such request shall be a violation of this agreement. There shall be no obligation on the part of
5
either party to reopen, modify, amend or otherwise alter the terminology or interpretation of this agreement or to make any other agreement as a result of any such conferences nor shall the requirement for such conferences alter the rights or obligations of the parties under this agreement.
ARTICLE III
NO STRIKE CLAUSE
During the term of this Agreement, the Association, for itself and for all employees covered by this Agreement, hereby agrees that no employee covered by this Agreement shall exercise any unlawful means which the Association or employees may possess against the Municipality nor shall the Association or employees engage in any unlawful job action or unlawful conduct which has as its purpose to influence the employer or other Municipal employees with respect to wages, benefits, working conditions, or other incidents of employment with the Municipality of Anchorage. If any of the unauthorized conduct, above specified, should occur, the Association will immediately notify the employees engaging in the unauthorized activities to cease and desist, and will publicly declare that such conduct is illegal and unauthorized. Any employee engaging in such conduct shall be subject to immediate dismissal by the Municipality. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to abridge any right of the Association or an employee granted under the United States and/or Alaska constitutions.
ARTICLE IV
CHECKOFF
The Municipality, upon receipt of a written authorization signed by the employee (such authorization shall not be revocable for the term of this Agreement) shall deduct from such employee's wages, employee's initiation fee and Association dues. Association dues will be deducted from the employee's wages each pay day. The Municipality will remit same to the duly authorized representative of the Association, together with a list of the names of the employees from whose pay deductions were made. The Association agrees to pay the costs of the defense of the Municipality and to hold the Municipality free from all liability in connection with dues collection except for ordinary diligence and care in transmittal of the monies to the Association.
ARTICLE V
BILL OF RIGHTS AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 1.	Bill of Rights.
Individual rights of employees in the Anchorage Police Department shall not be violated. To insure this, the following shall represent the Employee's Bill of Rights:
A.	An employee shall be entitled to representation from the Association or its designee at each step of the Grievance Procedure set forth in this Agreement.
6
B.	An employee shall be entitled to representation by the Association or its designee at each stage of a disciplinary proceeding brought against an Association member. Disciplinary proceeding is defined as any action taken against an employee by a superior officer, that may affect his working conditions, integrity, hours or wages, and which results in oral reprimand, written reprimand, suspension, discharge, demotion or disciplinary transfer.
C.	No employee shall be required by the Municipality to submit to an interrogation in a disciplinary proceeding unless he is afforded the opportunity of having an Association representative or its designee present. If the Employer has reasonable cause to question an employee's fitness for duty, the Employer may require the employee to undergo a physical or mental examination to determine continued fitness for duty. If the employee disagrees with the results of such examination, or the results of the first examination indicate that a further examination is required, then either the employee or Employer may require a second examination. Should the findings and recommendations of the examining physicians significantly differ, a third opinion from another qualified physician selected jointly by the two physicians shall be obtained. The third opinion shall be followed by the Employer, the Association and affected employee. The first and, where applicable, third examination shall be paid for by the Employer and the second examination shall be paid by the employee (to the extent that such examination is not paid for through the Health and Welfare Plan) if the employee requests the examination, or the Employer if the Employer requires the second examination.
D.	In all disciplinary hearings, the employee shall be presumed innocent until proven guilty. This presumption does not increase the Employer's burden to establish just cause in any disciplinary action.
E.	An employee shall not be coerced or intimidated or suffer any reprisals either directly or indirectly that may adversely affect his hours, wages, or other terms and conditions of employment as a result of the exercise of his rights under this Agreement.
F.	When an employee is (a) under investigation, and (b) subjected to interview by the Department, (c) which could lead to disciplinary action (which is defined as oral reprimand, written reprimand, suspension, discharge, demotion or disciplinary transfer), the interview shall be conducted under conditions listed in this Section.
G.	The following provisions shall apply to such interviews:
(1)	Interviews shall be conducted at a reasonable hour, preferably when the employee is on duty, unless the seriousness of the investigation requires otherwise.
(2)	Employees shall be compensated if the interview occurs off-duty, at the appropriate overtime rate of pay.
(3)	Employees under non-criminal investigation shall be informed of the nature of the investigation and provided a copy of the written complaint, if one exists, within four (4) working days of when the complaint is received. Employees on leave status shall be
7
notified within four (4) working days of returning to duty. Where known, employees shall be advised of the name of the complainant. Employees shall be informed of all details of the investigation which are necessary to reasonably apprise the employee of the factual background of the complaint. When, in the reasonable judgment of the Chief of Police, disclosure of the complaint will seriously jeopardize an investigation of the complaint, the notice requirement under this provision shall not apply.
(4)	Interview sessions shall be for a reasonable period and under reasonable conditions. Save when in the reasonable judgment of the Chief of Police prior notice of an interview will seriously jeopardize an investigation, an employee under investigation for a non-criminal offense shall be provided with a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours notice of any non-criminal interview.
(5)	Employees being interviewed shall be informed that failure to answer questions directly related to the investigation can result in disciplinary action, which includes discharge, unless the incident is being investigated as a criminal act, in which case, no employee shall be required to answer any questions and no disciplinary action can be taken for failure to answer under these circumstances. No promise of reward shall be made as an inducement to answering questions.
(a)	If the incident may result in either a civil suit and/or a criminal action, the employee may have an attorney, at his own cost, in addition to an Association Representative, be present at all steps of the investigation, provided the attorney does not obstruct the course of the investigation.
(6)	The interview may be recorded, and if it is, the employee shall have access to the tape, if any further proceedings are contemplated, or prior to any further interviews at a subsequent time. The employee that is being interviewed shall also have the right to bring his own recording device and record any and all aspects of the interview and, if he does, the employee shall provide access to the tape to the Municipality. No recording device may be used by any party unless the Association and the Municipality are made aware of the fact prior to such interview. Employees shall be entitled to a transcribed copy of any notes made by a stenographer.
(7)	If prior to or during the interview of an employee, it is determined that he may be charged with a criminal offense, he shall immediately be informed of this fact.
(8)	Interviews shall be conducted under circumstances devoid of abuse.
H.	All disciplinary matters will be removed from the personnel file at the following times and under the following conditions:
Oral Reprimand, Written Reprimand, Suspension, Demotion or Disciplinary Transfer: One year after the date of imposition of an oral reprimand or written reprimand, and two (2) years after the imposition of a suspension, demotion or disciplinary transfer. Any similar violations occurring during the above time periods will cause the existing disciplinary action(s) to be maintained in the personnel file for an additional one (1) year period.
8
At any time after the effective date of this Agreement, employees shall have the opportunity to notify the Municipality of any disciplinary records that are subject to the provisions of this section. In all cases where the Municipality receives such notification, and in all cases where discipline is imposed after the effective date of this Agreement, the Municipality shall remove the disciplinary matters from the employee’s file on the time schedule set forth in this section, and shall provide the employee with the original of the documents removed from the file.
I.	Unless otherwise described herein, all investigations will be conducted in accordance with State and Federal law.
J.	Except where obligated by law or with prior written consent of the affected employee, the Municipality will not release information which is not otherwise a public record from an employee's personnel file to any third party not associated with or acting on behalf of the Municipality. Where release is required by law, the employer will make a reasonable effort to notify the employee prior to release of the information.
Section 2.	Grievance Procedure
A.	A "grievance" is defined as any dispute between the Employer and an employee or the Association regarding the interpretation or violation of this Agreement which has not been resolved by prior submission of the problem through the chain of command, and which has been accepted as a grievance by the Executive Board of the Association. A “grievance” shall not include challenges based upon the Municipal Personnel Rules promotional process or promotional decisions.
B.	An employee who believes he or she may have a grievance is encouraged to attempt to informally resolve the matter through the chain of command.
C.	The grievant shall report to the Shop Steward or such other Association representative as may be designated by the Association, any grievance that may arise between the employee and the Employer. The designated Association representative will attempt to resolve the matter by consulting with the employee's shift supervisor.
D.	Step 1. If the grievance cannot be resolved, the designated Association representative shall report the matter to the Association, and the Association representative shall present the matter in writing to the Chief, or his/her designee. The grievance filing must specify the Article or Articles allegedly in dispute. All grievances shall be presented to the Chief, or his/her designee, with a copy to the Employee Relations Department as soon as practicable after the occurrence upon which the grievance is based, but in no event later than thirty (30) calendar days if the same is a termination grievance, or sixty (60) calendar days if the grievance arises from other causes from the date on which the grievance arose or the date on which the grievant should reasonably have learned of the grievance save that a grievance which involves a change or alleged change in current policy or procedure shall be dealt with solely under the terms of paragraph N of this section. The Chief, or his/her designee, must give a written response to the grievance within seven (7) working days of a termination
9
grievance and fourteen (14) working days for all other grievances from receipt of the grievance.
E.	Step 2. Failing to settle the grievance in accordance with paragraph D, above, the appeal must be presented in writing by the Association to the Mayor or the Mayor's designee within ten (10) working days after the response from the Chief is due or received. The Mayor or the Mayor's designee shall respond in writing to the Association with a copy to the employee within five (5) working days.
F.	The Employer may file a grievance against the Association by giving written notice to the Association president, or his/her designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the event giving rise to the grievance. The Association must give a written response to the grievance within fourteen (14) working days from receipt of the grievance.
G.	Step 3. If the grievance cannot be resolved within the time frames above, the Employer or the Association may request arbitration. The request for arbitration must be made in writing within twenty (20) working days from the date of receipt of the Mayor's or the Mayor's designee's or Association's response given under Section 2, paragraphs E or F, above, as may be applicable.

The Municipality further agrees that with the exception of drunkenness, dishonesty, or gross disobedience, all regular employees shall be given two (2) weeks notice or two (2) weeks pay prior to discharge. For the purposes of section, "gross disobedience" shall mean willful refusal to obey a reasonable order.

Prior to discharge of an employee for disciplinary reasons, the employee shall be given notice of the reason(s) for discharge and an opportunity to respond to the stated reasons for the discharge. Should the employee request an opportunity to be heard, the hearing shall be informal and shall be conducted by the Chief or his/her designee. The employee may be represented by counsel, at his/her own expense, and/or by a representative from the Association. A final determination regarding discharge shall not be made until such a hearing has been conducted. Prior to a hearing, an employee may be suspended, with or without pay, as Employer may determine.

9.	The Department may not use its rights under this section to change the shifts of more than four employees at any one shift rotation.

Section 14.	Job Assignment Promotions, and Involuntary Transfer.
A. Job Assignments. Job assignments shall be made on the basis of qualifications, as determined by the Employer. Qualifications being substantially equal job assignments shall be made on the basis of department seniority.
Qualifications. Section 3.30.045 of the Municipality’s personnel rules shall not apply to automatically disqualify an APDEA member from job assignments and promotions; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall prevent the Municipality from taking into account the factors listed in Section 3.30.045 of the Municipality’s personnel rules, where appropriate under the circumstances, in making a promotional or job assignment decision.
An employee may be involuntarily transferred for non-disciplinary reasons to a different job assignment within a division under the following circumstances: (1) based upon the needs of the Department as determined by the Chief of Police, or his/her designee, no more than once each calendar year or (2) in an emergency. An employee who is being involuntarily transferred for other than an emergency shall be given at least thirty (30) days notice before the transfer is affected.

An employee who is unable to perform the duties of his/her classification because of medical reasons shall be immediately placed on light duty status and assigned to duties, at the discretion of the Chief or his/her designee, providing the physician's medical limitations are met, Sections 13 and 14 of Article VI notwithstanding. If the light duty assignment is less than 40 hours in length, there shall be no involuntary change in shifts or days off. If the employee’s regular shift made the employee eligible for shift differential, the employee shall be entitled to continue receiving shift differential for the duration of the light-duty assignment, even if the employee is changed to a different shift while on light duty.
16
Section 16.	Health Promotion.
The Association recognizes that the provision of the safe work environment and promotion of a healthful workforce is the right and obligation of the Municipality. The Association agrees to cooperate with the Municipality in its exercise of the obligation so long as no right guaranteed under this Agreement is violated and with the recognition that participation of its members in any or all health promotion programs made available by the Municipality shall solely be on a voluntary basis on the part of the member(s).
Section 17.	Supervisory Ratio For Special Events.

HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
Section 1.	Workweek.
The workweek for regular employees shall consist of either five (5) consecutive days of eight (8) hours per day or four (4) consecutive days of ten (10) hours per day. By mutual written agreement, the parties may agree to alternate shift schedules.
Section 2.	Overtime.
All work in excess of eight (8) hours per day or in excess of ten (10) hours per day for those working four-tens (4-10's) or forty (40) hours per week shall be paid for at the overtime rate of pay of one and one-half (I-/) times the regular rate of pay.
If the employee works overtime on the second (2nd) day off, the employee shall be paid at (2) two times the regular rate of pay, Two times pay applies only on the second (2nd) day off. Where training assignments are posted at least five days in advance, employees attending training as students during their off-duty hours shall receive time
17
and one-half for the hours spent in training, regardless of which day of the workweek on which the training occurs.
Voluntary overtime, for work outside of normal shift, with advance notification of not less than five (5) days, shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (I-/) times the regular rate of pay for hours worked, regardless of which day of the workweek the voluntary overtime occurs.
Overtime shall be paid for all work performed outside the regularly scheduled shift. If overtime performance is less than one-quarter (1/4) hour, the time shall be considered at one-quarter (1/4) hour and paid accordingly. If overtime performance is more than one-quarter (1/4) hour, but less than thirty (30) minutes, the extent of time will be considered as thirty (30) minutes and paid accordingly.
The employee may elect to receive compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay. All overtime shall be multiplied by the appropriate rate for that overtime day, or that overtime work, to determine the number of compensatory hours granted. Compensatory time provisions will apply in accordance with current law. An employee may accumulate a maximum of two hundred forty (240) compensatory hours, which will be treated in the same manner as annual leave.
There shall be two types of compensatory time off: (1) Compensatory time off earned as a result of hours worked which constitute overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which shall be referred to as “FLSA Compensatory Time”; and (2) Compensatory time off for overtime hours worked which do not constitute overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which shall be referred to as “Non-FLSA Compensatory Time.” The usage standards for FLSA Compensatory Time shall be those established by the Fair Labor Standards Act. Non-FLSA Compensatory Time may be used by the employee subject to the Municipality’s reasonable operating needs. The Municipality retains the discretion to deny a request to use Non-FLSA Compensatory Time if it would be required to replace the employee desiring to use compensatory time with another employee on an overtime basis.
For purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act, a “reasonable period” of time in which to request the use of FLSA Compensatory Time is 14 days in advance of the requested use. If a request for FLSA Compensatory Time is not made 14 days in advance of the requested use, the Municipality retains the discretion to reject the request. For purposes of the compensatory time off provisions of this agreement, the parties acknowledge that the Municipality may utilize the partial overtime exemption found in Section 207(k) of the FLSA.
An employee’s compensatory time off must be exhausted before the employee may use paid leave.
18

When an employee is on Court Duty outside his regular shift, he shall receive court duty compensation at the appropriate overtime rate and shall be guaranteed a minimum of three (3) hours overtime pay. In the event that an employee is required to work more than three (3) hours, said employee shall be paid on an hour-for-hour basis at the appropriate overtime rate.
B.	Any court time within one (1) hour of employee's duty time shall be paid at the appropriate overtime rate for the time worked. Periods of more than one (1) hour will be paid in accordance with Section "A" above.
19
Section 7.	Call Back/Call In.
A.	When an employee has completed his regularly scheduled shift and is called back to perform work within four (4) hours after his regular shift, he shall receive a guaranteed minimum of four (4) hours pay at the appropriate overtime rate.

C.	When an employee is called to work prior to his regularly scheduled starting time, and continues to work into the regular shift, he shall be paid for the time worked at the appropriate overtime rate.

20
Section 11.	SWAT Team.
Hours of work and shifts for those positions assigned to the SWAT team as their primary duty may be established and adjusted as required to effectively respond to crime patterns and time.

All other SWAT team members shall work their normal duties and shall bid for shifts and days off on the roster based upon position seniority.

Section 13.	Canine Demonstrations.
The Municipality shall have the exclusive right to determine whether an APD employee shall participate in a canine demonstration. If APD decides that an employee will participate in a canine demonstration, and if the demonstration occurs outside normal shift hours, the selection of the employee(s) to conduct the assignment shall be subject to the normal overtime assignments provisions in the collective bargaining agreement.
Without regard to the previous paragraph, if a canine handler is asked to perform a canine demonstration for the organization that purchased the canine, the handler may perform the demonstration without regard to the normal seniority/assignment process. If a canine handler is honored in an awards ceremony and is asked to perform a canine demonstration as part of that ceremony, the handler will be allowed to work the demonstration without regard to the normal seniority/assignment process. If a canine handler is asked to perform a canine demonstration for school functions or youth activities in which the canine handler’s child, family or friends are directly involved, the handler may be allowed to do so without regard to the normal seniority/assignment process.
If a canine demonstration occurs during an employee’s normal shift hours, no additional compensation shall be paid to the employee beyond the employee’s normal compensation. If a canine demonstration occurs outside an employee’s normal shift hours, the employee shall be compensated at the overtime rate on an hour-for-hour basis for the time spent in the demonstration.

SENIORITY
Section 1.	Department Seniority.
Department seniority shall be established as follows: the regular employee having the longest continuous term of service with the Police Department shall be number one on the seniority list and all other regular employees likewise shall be listed according to length of continuous service with the Police Department. Such list shall be updated and posted quarterly and shall include the date of position seniority.
Section 2.	Position Seniority.
Position seniority shall be established as follows: the regular employee having the longest term of service within a position classification shall be number one on the seniority list for that classification and all other regular employees within that classification likewise shall be listed according to length of service within that classification.
A.	Position seniority shall not in any way affect the employee's overall department seniority for the purposes of leave accrual and/or other fringe benefits.
B.	Whenever an individual is promoted or demoted into a position classification that they have previously occupied, the time in which they had previously occupied the position shall be counted towards their position seniority (provided there has been no break in seniority pursuant to Article IX, Section 10). Any time in another position shall not be counted.
C.	When two or more individuals are hired into a non-sworn classification on the same date, their pre-hire screening scores will be used to determine seniority. The individual with the highest score shall be placed above the individual(s) with the lower score(s). If there is no pre-hire screening score in a particular classification, seniority shall be determined by the Association.
23
D.	When sworn personnel are hired on the same date, academic standing within the academy shall be used to determine the individual with the highest seniority. Scores from the academy shall be carried to the fourth decimal point for the purpose of determining academy score for seniority purposes. When sworn personnel are hired between academies, the sworn personnel so hired shall all be considered to have been hired on the same date for purposes of this section, and shall have a position seniority date of the first day of the Academy they attend. Position seniority for police officers who are unable to finish the Police Academy and later complete the subsequent Police Academy shall be set at the last day of the Initial Police Academy. Ties in seniority among police officers who are unable to finish the Police Academy and later complete the subsequent Police Academy shall be broken by academic standing in the subsequent Police Academy. When sworn personnel are promoted on the same date, scores on the promotional examination shall be used to determine the individual with the highest seniority.
Section 3.	Use of Position Seniority.
A.	For purposes of shift preference, days off, layoff, and rehire, position seniority shall govern. For the purposes of preference of days off and preference of shifts, position seniority will prevail and changes will be allowed at the beginning of each four-month period if the requested change is made by the fifteenth (15th) day of the month two months prior to shift change and will be allowed within position classification. The first four-month period shall commence on February 1 of each year, with requested changes due no later than December 15. At least five days before shift bids are due, the Municipality shall notify employees as to the anticipated staffing on each shift and the days off blocks for each shift. The Municipality shall post the result of the shift bid by the fifteenth day of the month preceding the change. The change of days off and shifts other than at the beginning of each four-month period shall be allowed with the approval of the Association and the Chief of Police.
B.	For the purposes of annual leave preference only, position seniority will prevail for annual leave requests submitted more than ninety (90) days in advance of the scheduled annual leave. The Municipality shall approve or deny such leave requests no less than seventy-five (75) days before the dates requested off for leave. After that time, the first request received will be honored except where requests for annual leave are received on the same calendar day. In that case, position seniority will prevail.
C.	If an employee has leave approved and voluntarily changes shifts or assignments, he/she must resubmit a leave slip to his/her new shift commander, and it shall be treated as a new request at that time.
Section 4.	Notice of Layoff
