The term "Contract" as used herein means the written agreement provided under Section 3517.5 of the Government Code.
ARTICLE 1	- RECOGNITION

C.	Area of Representation - A Union steward's "area of primary representation" is defined as an institution, office, or building. However, the parties recognize that it may be necessary for the Union to assign a steward an area of representation for several small offices, department, or buildings within close proximity. Disputes regarding this paragraph may be appealed directly to the DPA Step of the Grievance Procedure.
2.2	Access
A.	Union stewards, Union staff, and/or elected bargaining unit council representatives may have access to employees to represent them pursuant to Section 2.1 A. above. Access shall not interfere with the work of the employees. Union stewards, Union staff, or elected bargaining unit council representatives seeking access to employees must notify the department head or designee in advance of the visit.

B.	The Union may, before or after work hours or during meal and rest periods, distribute Union literature. Distribution of Union information shall not be unreasonably denied or disrupt the work of others. However, if access for distribution of information is restricted for safety, security, or patient care including patient privacy, other reasonable accommodation will be made in accordance with department procedures.
C.	The Union may continue to use existing employee mailboxes and in-baskets for distribution of literature. Such information will be distributed to departmental employees based on the department's policies and procedures in distributing other non-business information.
D.	The Union agrees that any literature posted or distributed on site will not be libelous, obscene, defamatory, or of a partisan political nature.
E.	The Union shall be permitted incidental and minimal use of State electronic communication systems for communication of Union activities as the departments permit for other non-business purposes.
F.	The use of electronic communication systems (devices) are not considered private or secure information and are subject to being monitored by the department.

Requests for use of such State facilities shall be made in advance to the appropriate State official. When required in advance, the Union shall reimburse the State for additional expenses, such as security, maintenance, and facility management costs or utilities, incurred as a result of the Union's use of such State facilities.
2.6	Steward Time Off
Upon request of an aggrieved employee, a steward shall be allowed reasonable time off during working hours, without loss of compensation, for representational purposes in accordance with Section 2.1 A. of this Contract, provided the employee represented is in the steward's designated area of representation. Release time for these purposes is subject to prior notification and approval by the steward's immediate supervisor. Upon mutual agreement of the parties, a reasonable number of additional stewards can also be granted reasonable time off under this section.
12

A.	Upon initial appointment to any position as a probationary or permanent employee, the employee shall be informed by the employer that the Union is the recognized employee organization for the employee in said classification. The State shall present the employee with a packet of Union information which has been supplied by the Union.
B.	The packet of information provided by CSEA shall include a pre-addressed, stamped postcard that the employee may use to notify CSEA of a new appointment.

2.12.4 Designation of Confidential Positions Unit 4
A.	“Confidential employee” is defined as any employee who is required to develop or present management’s positions with respect to employer-employee relations or whose duties normally require access to confidential information contributing significantly to the development of management positions (Government Code Section 3513 (f).
13
BU 4
03-05
B.	Performance of the following work tasks does not in and of itself justify/qualify for confidential status:
1.	Processing grievances
2.	Processing Workers’ compensation claims, appointment papers, Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) applications and policies; examination design and execution, training of employees; handling post and bid programs.
C.	The State may designate up to five hundred (500) Unit 4 positions as confidential. All incumbents in confidential positions shall remain in those positions. The 500 number shall be reached through attrition. This limit shall include positions already designated by the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB). Each appointing power may have at least one position designated as confidential.

E.	The State agrees that no Union officer, bargaining unit council member, or job steward shall be involuntarily transferred, assigned or designated into a confidential position.
F.	The State agrees to provide the Union with a list of incumbents in confidential positions by department; including names, classification positions numbers; no later than thirty (30) days after ratification of this Contract.

Effective with the beginning of the first pay period following ratification of this Contract by the Legislature and the Union, the State agrees to calculate, deduct, and transmit to the Union, Fair Share fees from State employees who do not have membership dues deductions for the Union, based upon an amount or formula furnished by the Union for Fair Share fees deductions. The State further agrees to recalculate, deduct, and transmit Fair Share fees to the Union based upon any revised amounts or formulas furnished by the Union for Fair Share fees deductions during the term of this Contract. The State and the Union agree that a system of authorized dues deductions and a system of Fair Share fee deductions shall be operated in accordance with Government Code Sections 3513(h), 3513(j), 3515, 3515.6, 3515.7, and 3515.8, subject to the following provisions:
1.	When Fair Share fees are in effect, an employee may withdraw from membership in the Union by sending a signed withdrawal letter to the Union with a copy to the State Controller at any time. An employee who so withdraws his/her membership shall be subject to paying a Fair Share fee, if such a fee is applicable.

BU 4

ARTICLE 8	- LEAVES
8.1	Vacation Leave
A.	Employees shall not be entitled to vacation leave credit for the first six (6) months of service. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of six (6) qualifying monthly pay periods of continuous service, all full-time employees covered by this section shall receive a one-time vacation bonus of forty-two (42) hours of vacation credit. Thereafter, for each additional qualifying monthly pay period, the employee shall be allowed credit for vacation with pay on the first day of the following month as follows:
7 months to 3 years
37 months to 10 years
121 months to 15 years
181 months to 20 years
20 years and over
7 hours per month
10 hours per month
12	hours per month
13	hours per month
14	hours per month
An employee who returns to State service after an absence of six (6) months or longer, caused by a permanent separation, shall receive a one-time vacation credit on the first monthly pay period following completion of six (6) qualifying pay periods of continuous service in accordance with the employee's total State service before and after the absence.
B.	A full-time employee who has eleven (11) or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall earn vacation credits as set forth under Item A. above. Absences from State service resulting from a temporary or permanent separation for more than eleven (11) consecutive working days which fall into two consecutive qualifying pay periods shall disqualify the second pay period.
C.	Employees working less than full-time accrue vacation in accordance with the chart shown in Section 7 L. of this Contract.
D.	Vacation credits may be taken in fifteen (15) minute increments.

F.	Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for accrued vacation credits for all accrued vacation time.
G.	Subject to operational needs, the time when vacation shall be taken by the employee shall not be unreasonably denied. Employee vacation requests shall be submitted and granted or denied in writing in a timely manner. Vacations can only be cancelled when unanticipated operational needs require it.
H.	Vacation requests must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on this subject. However, when two (2) or more employees on the same shift (if applicable) in a work unit (as defined by each department head or designee) request the same vacation time and approval cannot be given to all employees requesting it, employees shall be granted their preferred vacation period in order of seniority (defined as total months of State service in the same manner as vacation is accumulated). When two (2) or more employees have the same amount of State service, department seniority will be used to break the tie. Vacation schedules, which have been established in a work unit, pursuant to the seniority provisions in this Article, shall not be affected by employee(s) entering the unit after the schedule has been established.
I.	By June 1 of each calendar year those employees whose vacation balance exceeds, or could exceed by December 31, the vacation cap of Section 8.1 J. must submit to their supervisor for approval a plan to use vacation to bring their balance below the cap. If the employee fails to submit a plan, or adhere to an approved plan, the department head or designee has the right to order an employee to take sufficient vacation to reduce the employee's vacation balance or potential balance on December 31 below the cap specified in Section 8.1 J.
J.	If an employee does not use all of the vacation that the employee has accrued in a calendar year, the employee may carry over his/her accrued vacation credits to the following calendar year to a maximum of 400 hours. A department head or designee shall permit an employee to carry over more than 400 hours of accrued vacation leave hours if an employee was unable to reduce his/her accrued hours because the employee: (1) was required to work as a result of fire, flood, or other extensive emergency; (2) was assigned work of a priority or critical nature over an extended period of time; (3) was absent on full salary for compensable injury; (4) was prevented by department regulations from taking vacation until December 31 because of sick leave; or (5) was on jury duty.
8.2	Sick Leave
A.	As used in this section, "sick leave" means the necessary absence from duty of an employee because of:
1.	Illness or injury, including illness or injury relating to pregnancy;
2.	Exposure to a contagious disease which is determined by a physician to require absence from work;
34
BU 4

4.	Absence from duty for attendance upon the employee's ill or injured mother, father, husband, wife, domestic partner (as defined in accordance with Family Code Section 297), son, daughter, brother, sister, or any person residing in the immediate household. Such absence shall be limited to six (6) workdays per occurrence or, in extraordinary situations, to the time necessary for care until physician or other care can be arranged.
B.	A full-time employee who has eleven (11) or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall be eligible for up to eight (8) hours of sick leave credit. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each qualifying pay period of service, each full-time employee shall earn eight (8) hours of credit for sick leave with pay.
C.	Credit for less than full-time employees shall be computed as follows:
1.	Part-time employees: On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each monthly pay period of continuous service, each part-time employee shall be allowed, on a pro rata basis, the fractional part of his/her appropriate accrual rate of credit for sick leave with pay in accordance with the schedule in Article 7.
2.	Multiple positions under this rule:
a.	An employee holding a position in State service in addition to the primary full-time position with the State shall not receive credit for sick leave with pay for service in the additional position;
b.	Where an employee holds two (2) or more "less than full-time positions," the time worked in each position shall be combined for purposes of computing credits for sick leave with pay, but such credits shall not exceed the amount earned for (8 hours per pay period) full-time employment credit.
D.	An employee may be required to provide a physician's or licensed practitioner's verification of sick leave when:
1.	The employee has a demonstrable pattern of sick leave abuse; or
2.	The supervisor has good reason to believe the absence was for an unauthorized reason. A supervisor has good reason if a prudent person would also believe the absence was for an unauthorized reason.
E.	An employee will not be denied the right to use sick leave or be subject to any type of corrective or disciplinary action, or in any manner discriminated against for using or attempting to exercise his/her right to use sick leave based solely on the amount of use.
35
BU 4
03-05
F.	The department head or designee shall approve sick leave only after having ascertained that the absence is for an authorized reason and may require the employee to submit substantiating evidence including, but not limited to, a physician's or licensed practitioner's verification. The State recognizes the confidential nature of the relationship between the health care provider and patient. However, such substantiation shall include, but not be limited to, the general nature of the employee's illness or injury and prognosis (i.e., the anticipated length of the absence, any restrictions upon return to work that prevent the employee from performing the full range of his/her normal work assignment and anticipated future absences). If the department head or designee does not consider the evidence adequate, the request for sick leave shall be disapproved. Upon request, a denial of sick leave shall be in writing stating the reason for denial.
G.	Sick leave may be accumulated without limit.
H.	Sick leave may be requested and taken in fifteen (15) minute increments.
I.	A full-time employee whose continuity of employment is broken by a permanent separation of six (6) months or longer and is subsequently reemployed cannot be credited with any unused sick leave accumulated prior to the employee's separation and the full-time employee must complete one month of continuous service before being granted one day of sick leave credit. In addition, when a full-time employee has a break in the continuity of employment because of a permanent separation of less than six (6) months or because of a temporary separation, the full-time employee's prior unused sick leave balance is restored.
J.	When an employee's sick leave balance is zero, other leave credits such as vacation, CTO, PLP, personal holiday, or holiday leave may be substituted with the supervisor's approval, and shall not be unreasonably denied.
8.3	Bereavement Leave
A.	A department head or designee shall authorize bereavement leave with pay for a permanent or probationary full-time State employee due to the death of his/her parent, stepparent, spouse, domestic partner (as defined in accordance with Family Code Section 297), child, grandchild, grandparent, brother, sister, stepchild, or death of any person residing in the immediate household of the employee at the time of death. An intervening period of absence for medical reasons shall not be disqualifying when, immediately prior to the absence, the person resided in the household of the employee. Such bereavement leave shall be authorized for up to three (3) eight-hour days (24 hours) per occurrence. The employee shall give notice to his/her immediate supervisor as soon as possible and shall, if requested by the employee's supervisor, provide substantiation to support the request upon the employee's return to work.

C.	If the death of a person as described above requires the employee to travel over 400 miles one way from his/her home, additional time off with pay shall be granted for two (2) additional days which shall be deducted from accrued leave. Should additional leave be necessary, the department head or designee may authorize the use of other existing leave credits or authorized leave without pay. Any such request shall not be arbitrarily or unreasonably denied.
D.	Employees may utilize their annual leave, vacation, CTO, or any other earned leave credits for additional time required in excess of time allowed in A. or B. above. Sick leave may be utilized for Bereavement Leave in accordance with the sick leave provision of this Contract in Section 8.2. Any such request shall not be arbitrarily or unreasonably denied.
E.	Fractional time base (part-time) employees will be eligible for bereavement leave on a pro rata basis, based on the employees' fractional time base. (See schedule in Article 7.)

Such pay shall be in the amount of the difference between the employee’s regular pay and any amount he/she receives for such appearance. In no case shall this amount exceed the employee’s regular pay.
B.	In the event an employee is a party to a legal action, the employee shall, upon reasonable notice and the approval of the immediate supervisor, be granted the use of his/her accrued CTO, PLP, annual leave, vacation or unpaid leave.
C.	Upon request, and subject to operational needs, an employee on an alternate work schedule or shift other than Monday - Friday, 8am to 5pm may be placed on an existing work schedule or shift that coincides with the time he/she is required to be available in accordance with the provisions of A. above.
8.14	Jury Duty

BU 4

B.	If payment is made for such time off, the employee is required to remit to the State jury fees received. If an employee elects to use accrued vacation leave or compensating time off while on jury duty, the employee is not required to remit jury fees. For the purposes of this section, "jury fees" means fees received for jury duty excluding payment for mileage, parking, meals, or other out-of-pocket expenses.
C.	For an employee summoned to jury duty during hours other than the employee's regular and customary shift, management will endeavor to temporarily reassign the employee to a work shift that more closely coincides with the hours the employee is required to serve on jury duty, including any necessary travel time, subject to the following:
1.	The department already maintains an appropriate work shift that utilizes the employee's classification; and
2.	The operational needs of the department permit such reassignment.

Concurrence will not be unreasonably withheld.
8.15	Personal Leave Program: 1992

B.	At the discretion of the State, all or a portion of unused Personal Leave credits may be cashed out at the employee's salary rate at the time the Personal Leave payment is made. It is understood by both parties that the application of this cash-out provision may differ from department to department and from employee to employee. Departments shall consider an employee's request to retain leave credits for future use rather than have the leave cashed out. Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for unused Personal Leave credits in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Cash-out or lump-sum payment for any Personal Leave credits shall not be considered as "compensation" for purposes of retirement. If funds become available for the Personal Leave Program, departments will offer employees the opportunity to cash out accrued Personal Leave.
43
BU 4

C.	If any dispute arises about this Personal Leave section, an employee may file a grievance and the decision reached at Step 3 (Department of Personnel Administration) of the grievance procedure shall be final and not subject to the arbitration clause of this Contract.
D.	Personal Leave credits shall not be counted towards the 1,734/1,934 hours of compensation for Special School employees subject to the State Special Schools 10-Month Compensation Agreement.
8.16	Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
A.	The State acknowledges its commitment to comply with the spirit and intent of the leave entitlement provided by the FMLA and the California Family Rights Act (CFRA) referred to collectively as "FMLA”. The State and the Union recognize that on occasion it will be necessary for employees of the State to take job-protected leave for reasons consistent with the FMLA. As defined by the FMLA, reasons for an FMLA leave may include an employee's serious health condition, for the care of a child, spouse, domestic partner (as defined in Family Code Section 297), or parent who has a serious health condition, and/or for the birth or adoption of a child.
B.	For the purposes of providing the FMLA benefits the following definitions shall apply:
1.	An eligible employee means an employee who meets the eligibility criteria set forth in the FMLA;
2.	An employee's child means any child, regardless of age, who is affected by a serious health condition as defined by the FMLA and is incapable of self care. "Care" as provided in this section applies to the individual with the covered health condition;
3.	An employee's parent means a parent or an individual standing in loco parentis as set forth in the FMLA;
4.	Leave may include paid sick leave, vacation, annual leave, personal leave, catastrophic leave, holiday credit, excess hours, and unpaid leave. In accordance with the FMLA, an employee shall not be required to use CTO credits, unless otherwise specified by Section 8.8 of this Contract.
a.	FMLA absences due to illness and/or injury of the employee or eligible family member, may be covered with the employee's available sick leave credits and catastrophic leave donations. Catastrophic leave eligibility and sick leave credit usage for a FMLA leave will be administered in accordance with Sections 8.8 and 8.2 of this Contract.
b.	Other leave may be substituted for the FMLA absence due to illness and/or injury, at the employee's discretion. An employee shall not be required to exhaust all paid leave, before choosing unpaid leave, unless otherwise required by Section 8.8 of this Contract.
44
BU 4
03-05
c.	FMLA absences for reasons other than illness and/or injury (i.e., adoption or care of an eligible family member), may be covered with leave credits, other than sick leave, including unpaid leave, at the employee's discretion. Except in accordance with Section 8.8 of this Contract, an employee shall not be required to exhaust all leave credits available before choosing unpaid leave to cover an FMLA absence.
C.	An eligible employee shall provide certification of the need for an FMLA leave. Additional certification may be requested if the department head or designee has reasonable cause to believe the employee's condition or eligibility for FMLA leave has changed. The reasons for the additional certification request shall be provided to the employee in writing.
D.	An eligible employee shall be entitled to a maximum of twelve (12) workweeks (480 hours) FMLA leave per calendar year and all other rights set forth in the FMLA. This entitlement shall be administered in concert with the other leave provisions in Article 8 of this Contract. Nothing in this Contract should be construed to allow the State to provide less than that provided by the FMLA.
E.	On January 1 of each year, FMLA leave shall be recorded in accordance with the calendar year. Each time an employee takes an FMLA leave, the remaining leave entitlement is any balance of the twelve (12) workweeks that has not been used during the current calendar year. Employees who have taken FMLA leave under the previous 12 month rolling period, shall be entitled to additional leave up to a total of 12 weeks for the current calendar year.
F.	An employee on FMLA leave has a right to be restored to his/her same or "equivalent" position (FMLA) or to a "comparable" position (CFRA) with equivalent pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment.
G.	For the purposes of computing seniority, employees on paid FMLA leave will accrue seniority credit in accordance with the Department of Personnel Administration Rules 599.608 and 599.609.
H.	Any appeals regarding an FMLA decision should be directed to the department head or designee. FMLA is a Federal law and administered and enforced by the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division. The State's CFRA is a State law which is administered and enforced by the Department of Fair Employment and Housing. FMLA/CFRA does not supersede any Article of this Contract which provides greater family and medical leave rights. This section is not subject to grievance or arbitration.
8.17	Mentoring Leave
A.	Eligible employees may receive up to forty (40) hours of "mentoring leave" per calendar year to participate in mentoring activities once they have used an equal amount of their personal time for these activities. "Mentoring leave" is paid leave time which may only be used by an employee to mentor. This leave does not count as time worked for purposes of overtime. "Mentoring leave" may not be used for travel to and from the mentoring location.
45
BU 4
03-05
B.	An employee must use an equal number of hours of his or her personal time (approved annual leave, vacation, personal leave, personal holiday, or CTO during the workday and/or personal time during non-working hours) prior to requesting "mentoring leave”. For example, if an employee requests two (2) hours of "mentoring leave”, he or she must have used two (2) verified hours of his or her personal time prior to receiving approval for the "mentoring leave". "Mentoring leave" does not have to be requested in the same week or month as the personal time was used. It does, however, have to be requested and used before the end of the calendar year.
C.	Prior to requesting mentoring leave and in accordance with departmental policy, an employee shall provide his or her supervisor with verification of personal time spent mentoring from the mentoring organization.
D.	Requests for approval of vacation, CTO, and/or annual leave for mentoring activities are subject to approval requirements in this Contract and in existing departmental policies. Requests for approval of mentoring leave are subject to operational needs of the State, budgetary limits, and any limitations imposed by law.
E.	In order to be eligible for "mentoring leave", an employee must:
1.	Have a permanent appointment;
2.	Have successfully completed their initial probationary period; and
3.	Have committed to mentor a child or youth through a mentoring organization that meets the quality assurance standards in accordance with the California Mentor Program Directory, under the guidance of the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, for a minimum of one school year. (Most programs are aligned with the child's normal school year, however, there may be some that are less or more. Department management may make exceptions to the one school year commitment based on the mentor program that is selected.)
F.	An employee is not eligible to receive “mentoring leave” if:
1.	He or she is assigned to a “post” position in the Departments of Corrections or Youth Authority; or
2.	He or she works in a level of care position in the Departments of Developmental Services, Mental Health, Education or Veterans’ Affairs.
G.	Permanent part-time and Permanent Intermittent employees may receive a pro-rated amount of mentoring leave based upon their time base. For example, a half time employee is eligible for twenty (20) hours of mentoring leave per calendar year, whereas an intermittent employee must work a qualifying monthly pay period (equivalent to 160 hours) to earn 3.3 hours of mentoring leave.
H.	Any appeals and/or disputes regarding this section shall be handled in accordance with the Complaint procedure specified in Article 6 of this Contract.

However, use of such leave shall not diminish an employee’s entitlement under the Family School Partnership Act (Labor Code Section 230.8) to, upon reasonable notice to the employer, use up to eight (8) hours per month but not to exceed forty (40) hours per calendar year of accrued leave credits (vacation, annual leave, personal holiday, holiday credits, CTO) for the purpose of attending school or preschool related activities in which the employee’s child is participating.

If the employee has exhausted available leave credits, the employee may request unpaid leave.
Family is defined as the parent, stepparent, spouse, domestic partner (as defined in accordance with Family Code Section 297), child, grandchild, grandparent, brother, sister, stepchild, or any person residing in the immediate household.
If eligible, any family crisis leave that meets the definition of serious health condition will run concurrently with Section 8.16 of this Contract, Family and Medical Leave Act.
The State shall consider requests from employees to adjust work hours or schedules or consider other flexible arrangements consistent with a department’s operational needs and the provisions of this Contract.
Employee requests related to family crisis or domestic violence shall be in accordance with departmental procedures and, except in emergencies, shall be made with reasonable notice to the employee’s immediate supervisor.

In exchange 8 hours of leave will be credited to the employee's Personal Leave Program monthly.
C.	Personal leave shall be requested and used by the employee in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Requests to use personal leave must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on vacation and annual leave. Personal leave shall not be included in the calculation of vacation/annual leave balances pursuant to Article 8 (Leaves) and Sections 8.1 (Vacation Leave) and 8.19, (Annual Leave).
D.	At the discretion of the State, all or a portion of unused personal leave credits may be cashed out at the employee's salary rate at the time the personal leave payment is made. It is understood by both parties that the application of this cash out provision may differ from department to department and from employee to employee. Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for unused personal leave credits in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Cash out or lump sum payment for any Personal Leave credits shall not be considered as "compensation" for purposes of retirement. If funds become available, as determined by the Department of Finance, for the Personal Leave Program, departments will offer employees the opportunity to cash out accrued personal leave. Upon retirement/separation, the cash value of the employee’s personal leave balance may be transferred into a State of California, Department of Personnel Administration Deferred Compensation Program as permitted by federal and state law.

G.	The Personal Leave Program shall not cause a break in State service, a reduction in the employee's accumulation of service credit for the purposes of seniority and retirement, leave accumulation, or a merit salary adjustment.
H.	The Personal Leave Program shall neither affect the employee's final compensation used in calculating State retirement benefits nor reduce the level of State death or disability benefits the employee would otherwise receive or be entitled to receive nor shall it affect the employee's ability to supplement those benefits with paid leave.
I.	Part-time employees shall be subject to the same conditions as stated above, on a prorated basis.
J.	The Personal Leave Program for intermittent employees shall be prorated based upon the number of hours worked in the monthly pay period.

Employees must have sufficient leave earned and available to cover the time requested, prior to beginning their vacation.
When two (2) or more employees on the same shift (if applicable) in a work unit (as defined by EDD) request the same vacation time and approval cannot be given to all employees requesting it, employees shall be granted their preferred vacation period in order of seniority (defined as total months of State service in the same manner as vacation is accumulated). When two (2) or more employees have the same amount of State service, department seniority will be used to break the tie. After review of State service and departmental seniority a tie will be broken by lot. Vacation schedules, which
49
BU 4

have been established in a work unit, pursuant to the seniority provisions, shall not be affected by employee(s) entering the unit after the schedule has been established.
There are two periods during which vacation leave requests may be submitted:
1.	A defined filing period.
2.	Outside a defined filing period.
Defined Filing Period
Bargaining Unit 4 employees shall be offered the opportunity to submit vacation requests during a defined filing period which shall be the mid month of each quarter of the year. Quarters are defined as January through March, April through June, July through September, and October through December. Requests may apply to leave to be taken during any of the four (4) quarters following the quarter in which a request is filed.
Employees may submit their vacation leave requests during the first ten working days of the mid month of each quarter.
EDD management will, within fifteen working days after close of the filing period, post vacation leave approvals by work unit with an attached waiting list (if any) based on seniority. This information will be posted in a location accessible to employees. The waiting list shall be used to grant further vacation leave as operational needs permit.
When an employee who was granted vacation leave cancels that leave, or will not have sufficient leave credits to cover the leave, the first person on the waiting list, if any, shall be awarded that vacation leave time.
Once an employee’s vacation request submitted during a filing period is approved, the employee cannot be bumped by a more senior employee submitting a request outside a filing period or making a request during a later filing period.
Outside a Defined Filing Period
An employee may request vacation at any time outside a defined filing period to cover unplanned or unanticipated needs for vacation leave. Such leave requests will be limited to leave to be taken prior to the end of the next quarter.
When an employee requests vacation leave outside a defined filing period, the employees vacation leave request shall be granted on a first come, first served basis.
EDD management will notify an employee requesting vacation leave outside a defined filing period in a timely manner.
When two (2) or more employees request vacation for the same period on the same day, ties will be broken based upon seniority as defined above.

An employee is not eligible for a second disability benefit due to the same or related cause or condition unless they have returned to their regular time base, and work for at least ten (10) consecutive workdays. Paid leave shall not be used to cover the ten (10) workdays.
C.	The employee shall serve a ten (10) consecutive calendar day waiting period before NDI payments commence for each disability. Accrued vacation or sick leave balances may be used to cover this waiting period. The waiting period may be waived when the employee is a registered bed patient in a hospital or nursing home, or receives treatment in a hospital or surgical unit or licensed surgical clinic. Procedure rooms and doctor's offices are not included.
D.	If the employee elects to use vacation, annual leave, personal leave, or sick leave credits prior to receiving NDI payments, he/she is not required to exhaust the accrued leave balance.
E.	Following the start of NDI payments, an employee may, at any time, switch from NDI to sick leave, vacation leave, annual leave, personal leave, or catastrophic leave but may not return to NDI until that leave is exhausted.
F.	In accordance with the State's "return to work" policy, an employee who is eligible to receive NDI benefits and who is medically certified as unable to return to full-time work during the period of his or her disability, may upon the discretion of his or her appointing power work those hours (in hour increments) which, when combined with the NDI benefit, will not exceed 100 percent (100%) of their regular "full pay". This does not qualify the employee for a new disability period under B. of this section. The appointing power may require an employee to submit to a medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the Director of the Employment Development Department for the purpose of evaluating the capacity of the employee to perform the work of his/her position.
G.	If an employee refuses to return to work in a position offered by the employer under the State's Injured State Worker Assistance Program, NDI benefits will be terminated effective the date of the offer.

J.	Upon approval of NDI benefits, the State may issue an employee a salary advance if the employee so requests.
K.	All appeals of a denial of an employee’s NDI benefits shall only follow the procedures in the Unemployment Insurance Code and Title 22.

Such injury must have been directly and specifically caused by an assault by a resident, patient, student, client, or member.
C.	The EIDL benefits will be equivalent to the injured employee’s net take home salary on the date of occurrence of the injury.

B.	In the event that the disability exceeds twenty-two (22) workdays, the employee will receive 66 and 2/3 percent of gross pay from the twenty-third (23rd) workday of disability until the end of the fifty-second (52nd) week of disability. No IDL or payments shall be allowed after two (2) years from the first day (i.e., date) of disability.
C.	The employee may elect to supplement payment from the twenty-third (23rd) workday with accrued leave credits including annual leave, vacation, sick leave, or compensating time off (CTO) in the amount necessary to approximate the employee's full net pay. Partial supplementation will be allowed, but fractions of less than one (1) hour will not be permitted. Once the level of supplementation is selected, it may be decreased to accommodate a declining leave balance but it may not be increased. Reductions to supplementation amounts will be made on a prospective basis only.
D.	Temporary Disability (TD) with supplementation, as provided for in Government Code Section 19863, will no longer be available to any State employee who is a member of either the PERS or STRS retirement system during the first fifty-two (52) weeks, after the first date of disability, within a two (2)-year period.

E.	If the employee remains disabled after the IDL benefit is exhausted, then the employee will be eligible to receive Temporary Disability benefits as provided for in Government Code Section 19863.
F.	In the event that an employee is determined to be "permanent and stationary" by his/her physician before the IDL benefit is exhausted, but is unable to return to work, he/she must agree to participate in a vocational rehabilitation program. Refusing to participate will result in immediate suspension of the IDL benefit.
G.	All appeals of an employee's denial of IDL benefits shall only follow the procedures in the Government Code and Title 2. All disputes relating to an employee's denial of benefits are not grievable or arbitrable. This does not change either party's contractual rights which are not related to an individual's denial of benefits.

ARTICLE 11	- SALARIES
11.1	Salaries
Notwithstanding any other Contract provision to the contrary, the general salary rates of July 1, 2003 shall remain in effect for the term of this Contract unless amended pursuant to Article 22, Section 22.2 B.
11.2	Salary Definitions
Units 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 hereby agree to support putting the following changes to Article 5 of the Department of Personnel Administration regulations into effect provided all bargaining units agree to the same.
As used in this Article, terms are defined as follows:
A.	“Salary range” is the range of rates between, and including, the minimum and maximum rate currently authorized for the class; Top Step Rounding: Classes shall be adjusted to reflect 5 percent increments between the minimum and the maximum salary rates. Each 5 percent shall be calculated by multiplying by 1.05 and rounded to the nearest dollar. To calculate 5 percent for daily and hourly rates multiply by 1.05 and round to the nearest dollar and cents amount, subject to the availability of funds.
B.	“Step” for employees compensated on a monthly basis is a five percent (5%) differential above or below a salary rate rounded to the nearest dollar and for employees compensated on a daily or hourly basis is a five percent (5%) differential above or below a rate rounded to the nearest dollar and cents amount. One-step higher is calculated by multiplying the rate by 1.05 (e.g., $2,300 x 1.05 = $2,415). One-step lower is calculated by dividing the rate by 1.05 (e.g., $2,415 + 1.05 = $2,300).
C.	“Rate” for employees compensated on a monthly basis is any one of the full dollar amounts found within the salary range and for employees compensated on a daily or hourly basis is any one of the dollar and cents amounts found within the salary range.
D.	“Range differential” is the difference between the maximum rate of two salary ranges.
E.	“Substantially the same salary range” is a salary range with the maximum salary rate less than two-steps higher than or the same as the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
F.	“Higher salary range” is a salary range with the maximum salary rate at least two-steps higher than the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
G.	“Lower salary range” is a salary range with the maximum salary rate any amount less than the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
70
BU 4
03-05
Unless otherwise provided, the lowest salary range currently authorized for the class is used to make salary comparisons between classes except for deep classes. Any rate falling within the salary range for a class may be used to accomplish appropriate step differentials in movement between classes and salary ranges.

When a regular paycheck is late for reasons other than 1. above (e.g., AWOL, late dock), a salary advance of no less than 50 percent (50%) of the employee's actual net pay will normally be issued within five (5) workdays after payday. No more than four (4) salary advances per calendar year may be issued under these circumstances;

F.	Any performance evaluation conducted of an employee who is a participant in the Union/State Collective Bargaining negotiations shall recognize the employee's frequent absence from his/her State job and the impact of such absences on the employee's performance.

Duties that are appropriately assigned to incumbents in the employee's current classification are not out of class. Duties appropriately assigned are based on the definition and typical tasks enumerated in the California State Personnel Board specification.
Training and Development assignments are not out-of-class work.

a.	Is of unusual urgency, nature, volume, location, duration, or other special characteristics; and,
b.	Cannot feasibly be met through use of other civil service or administrative alternatives.
2.	Departments may not use out-of-class assignments to avoid giving civil service examinations or to avoid using existing eligibility lists created as the result of a civil service examination.

4.	Out-of-class work may be discontinued by departments at any time; however, departments may not rotate employees in and out of out-of-class assignments to avoid payment of out-of-class compensation.
5.	Out-of-class pay shall not be considered as part of the employee's base pay when computing the rate due upon promotion to a higher level.
C.	Out-of-Class Grievances and Allocation Appeals
1.	The grievance and arbitration procedure described in subsection D. below shall be the exclusive means by which alleged out-of-class assignments shall be remedied, including requests for review by the Department of Personnel Administration referenced in Government Code Section 19818.16 or the State Victims Compensation and Government Claims Board.
2.	The grievance and arbitration procedure described in this section shall be the exclusive means for appealing position allocation or reallocation referenced in Government Code Sections 19818.6 and 19818.20.

Upon request, within thirty (30) calendar days of the Union’s receipt of the notice, the State shall meet and confer with the Union over such assignments.
14.8	Contracting Out
A.	Purpose
The union has presented evidence that State departments are presently contracting out work appropriately done by Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees, and that said contracting results in unnecessary additional costs to the State. Thus, the purpose of this section is to guarantee that the State does not incur unnecessary, additional costs by contracting out work appropriately performed at less expense to the State by Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees, consistent with the terms of this section. In achieving this purpose the parties do not intend this section to expand the State’s ability to contract out for personal services. The parties agree that this section shall not be interpreted or applied in a manner which results in a disruption of services provided by state departments.
B.	Policy Regarding Personal Services Contracts and Cost Savings
Except in extremely unusual or urgent, time-limited circumstances, or under other circumstances where contracting out is recognized or required by law, Federal mandate, or court decisions/orders, the State must make every effort to hire, utilize and retain Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees before resorting to the use of private contractors. Contracting may also occur for reasons other than cost savings as recognized or required by law, Federal mandate, or court decisions/orders.
98
BU 4
03-05
C.	Information Regarding Contracts To Be Let
1.	Departments will provide CSEA’s designated representative with copies of Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and Invitations for Bid (IFBs) for personal services contracts when released for publication if they call for services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications.
2.	To the extent that a department is preparing to enter into a contract (or amend a contract) and it does not require an RFP or IFB, the department shall provide CSEA’s designated representative with a copy of the Standard Form 215 (or its departmental equivalent) if and when the Form 215 is completed but no less than five (5) business days thereafter provided the contract is/will be for services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications. If the Form 215 contains confidential or proprietary information, it shall be redacted as discussed below in subsection D(2).
3.	The purpose of this subsection (C) is to provide CSEA with notice and an opportunity to present alternatives which mitigate or avoid the need for contracting out, while still satisfying the needs of the State to provide services. Directors (or their designee) shall therefore meet with CSEA for this purpose, if requested by CSEA.
D.	Labor/Management Committee To Review Personal Service Contracts In Existence
1.	A State Joint labor/management committee shall be established. It shall consist of representatives of CSEA, the Department of Personnel Administration, the Department of Finance and affected departments. The first meeting of this committee shall occur no later than 10 working days from ratification of the MOU, and shall be for purposes of determining the procedures by which the committee will operate. An initial review of all currently existing contracts as requested by the committee shall be completed within six (6) months from ratification of this agreement. However, if this deadline cannot be met due to the number or complexity of existing contracts for review, the committee may mutually agree to extend this deadline.
99
BU 4
03-05
2.	Upon request of the committee (or either party on the committee) each department shall submit copies of any or all personal services contracts that call for services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications. For each contract, departments shall provide additional documents establishing the number, scope, duration, justification, total costs of all such contracts, and payment of all overhead and administrative costs paid through each contract, provided it does not disclose confidential or proprietary information, in which case it shall be redacted as discussed below. The requested contract and related information shall be provided as soon as reasonably possible. The parties expect that this shall be provided no more than 21 calendar days following the request by the joint labor/management committee, or longer if approved by the committee. This shall include contracts that may otherwise be protected from public disclosure, if they provide for services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications. However, the State may redact those portions of protected contract(s) that are proprietary, necessary to protect the competitive nature of the bid process, and that which does not pertain to the costing of personnel services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 classes. The goal shall be to protect against disclosure of information which should remain confidential, while at the same time providing the committee with sufficient information to determine whether unnecessary, additional costs are being incurred by contracting out work found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications. Costing information provided to the committee for protected contracts shall include total personnel costs for personnel services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 classifications plus any overhead charges paid to the contractor for these services, provided such disclosure does not breach confidentiality requirements or include proprietary information.
3.	Within 10 workdays after receipt of the personal service contracts and associated documents as provided for in paragraph D (2) above, the committee shall begin reviewing the contracts. The committee shall examine the contracts based on the purpose of this section, the terms of the contracts, all applicable laws, Federal mandates and court decisions/orders. In this regard, the committee will consider which contracts should and can be terminated immediately, which contracts will take additional time to terminate, which contracts may continue (for how long and under what conditions) and how (if necessary and cost effective) to transition contract employees or positions into civil service. All determinations shall be through express mutual agreement of the committee. Committee determinations regarding contracts let by the Department of Corrections shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in subsection F below.
4.	The committee will continue to meet as necessary to examine personal services contracts which have been let.
5.	If savings are generated by the termination of personal service contracts under this provision, it is the intent of the State to implement findings of the committee for utilization of said savings. Such findings may include:
a.	Contributing toward position reductions which would otherwise be accomplished by the layoff, salary reduction or displacement of Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees.
100
BU 4
03-05
b.	Enabling the employment of Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees for services currently performed by contractors;
c.	Enabling of the conversion to Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 civil service employment of qualified contract employees who wish to become State employees, as otherwise permitted by law, regulations, provisions of the contracts and resolutions by the State Personnel Board.
d.	Providing timely, adequate and necessary recruitment efforts. These efforts may include focused recruitment, publicizing in professional journals, use of the media, job fairs, expedited hiring, expedited background checks, spot testing authorized by the SPB, State employee registries, and recruitment and retention incentives.
e.	Such other purposes as may be mutually agreed upon by the joint labor/management committee.
E.	Displacement Avoidance
1.	The objective of this subsection is to ensure that Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees have preference over contract employees consistent with, but not limited to the following principles.
a.	The duties at issue are consistent with the Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee’s classification;
b.	The Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee is qualified to perform the job; and, c. There is no disruption in services.
2.	To avoid or mitigate Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee displacement for lack of work, the appointing power shall review all existing personal services contracts to determine if work consistent with the affected employee’s classification is being performed by a contractor. Displacement includes layoff, involuntary demotion, involuntary transfer to a new class, involuntary transfer to a new location requiring a change of residence, and time base reductions. If the joint labor/management committee that reviews personal services contracts determines that the terms and purpose of the contract permit the State to assign the work to a Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee who would otherwise be displaced, this shall be implemented consistent with the other terms of this section. The State and CSEA shall meet and confer for purposes of entering into an agreement about the means by which qualified employees are notified and provided with such assignments. This shall include developing a process that ensures that savings realized by terminating the contract and reassigning the work to a Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee to avoid displacement, are utilized to offset that employee’s moving and relocation costs, the amount of which shall be consistent with Section 12.2 Moving/Relocation of the parties’ collective bargaining agreement.

BU 4

F.	Department of Corrections
1.	This section shall not be applicable to the Department of Corrections until such time as it has been approved by the Federal court special master(s). Nothing in this section shall be interpreted or applied in such a manner as to interfere with Federal court orders, the authority of the Federal court or the authority of the special masters.
2.	The Department of Corrections shall present this section to the special master(s) immediately in writing upon ratification of this agreement. The parties agree to make themselves immediately available to meet with the special master, on a schedule determined by the special master.
3.	No contract for services by the Department of Corrections shall be prohibited, modified, restricted or terminated by virtue of this memorandum of understanding or by operation of the joint labor management committee established by this memorandum of understanding without approval of the Special Masters in Madrid v. Alameida et al (as it pertains to contracts effecting Pelican Bay State Prison), and/or the Special Master in the Coleman litigation (as it pertains to contacts effecting Coleman class members), and/or counsel for the parties in the Plata litigation or the Plata court (as it pertains to contracts effecting medical care for Plata class members).
4.	If this section is not approved by the special master the parties agree to reopen negotiations for the purpose of agreeing on an alternative contracting out provision, with the goal of satisfying the concerns of the Federal court and CSEA.
G.	Relationship Between This Section And Related Statutes
The State is mindful of the constitutional and statutory obligations (e.g., Govt. Code § 19130) as it pertains to restriction on contracting out. Thus, nothing in this section is intended to interfere with pursuit of remedies for violation of these obligations as provided by law (e.g., Public Contract Code § 10337).
ARTICLE 15	- TRANSFER
15.1	Appeal of Involuntary Transfer
A.	The State shall make reasonable efforts to avoid involuntary transfers. An involuntary transfer which reasonably requires an employee to change his/her residence may be grieved under Article 6 only if the employee believes it was made for the purpose of harassing or disciplining the employee. If the appointing authority or the Department of Personnel Administration disapproves the transfer, the employee shall be returned to his or her former position; shall be paid the regular travel allowance for the period of time he/she was away from his/her original headquarters; and his/her moving costs both from and back to the original headquarters shall be paid in accordance with the Department of Personnel Administration laws and rules.

B.	An appeal of an involuntary transfer which does not reasonably require an employee to change his/her residence shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure. It shall be subject to the complaint procedure if the employee believes it was made for the purpose of harassing or disciplining the employee.
C.	The State shall provide a minimum of sixty (60) days written notice for an involuntary transfer which reasonably requires an employee to change his/her residence.
D.	Employees, who are unwilling to accept the geographical transfer required by their current department, may pursue other options, such as but not limited to voluntary transfer, voluntary demotion, reduced work-time program, authorized partial service retirement, or voluntary retirement or resignation. Such employees who meet the Department of Personnel Administration, State Restriction of Appointments (SROA) definition, shall be considered surplus. The department head or designee shall make job opportunity bulletins and materials available to all eligible surplus employees. Eligible surplus employees shall be permitted to apply and compete for vacant positions of their current class or other classes to which he/she can transfer, pursuant to the SROA Process. Article 16 shall govern employee rights and appeals under these conditions.
E.	With prior supervisory approval, employees shall be allowed a reasonable amount of State paid time to participate in employment interviews associated with the efforts described in paragraph D. above.
F.	When a department has two or more employees in a class who are subject to an involuntary transfer which reasonably requires an employee to change his/her residence consideration shall be given for the affected employee’s seniority in accordance with Government Code Section 19994.2.
15.2	Hardship Transfer
The State and the Union recognize the importance of hardship transfers as a way of dealing with Work and Family issues. An employee experiencing a verifiable hardship, e.g., domestic violence, mandatory job transfer of a spouse or domestic partner as defined in Family Code Section 297, family illness, serious health condition, injury or death of family members, may request a transfer to another geographic area to mitigate the hardship.
The State shall endeavor to reassign the employee to a comparable or lesser (if comparable is not available) position in the requested geographic area. If the employee accepts a position in a lower paid classification, the State shall endeavor to reinstate the employee to their former classification and comparable salary level.
Transfers under this section shall be considered voluntary and any associated relocation costs shall be subject to the applicable Department of Personnel Administration laws and rules.
A department shall provide in writing the reason(s) for the inability to grant the transfer.
This section is not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of this Contract.

19.8	Work In Multiple Time Zones
When traveling into a different time zone, the first day's time is computed using the time zone in which the employee started.

Side Letter #10.4 - California State Lottery (CSL) Scratcher Sales Bonus
CSL reserves the right to manage the variety and quantity of Scratcher products offered for sale in order to stay within its budgetary and legal mandates.
The classifications of Lottery Ticket Sales Specialist (LTSS) and Lottery Ticket Sales Senior Specialist (LTSSS) shall be eligible to receive sales bonuses as governed by the following provisions:
133
BU 4
03-05
A.	The sales bonus shall be based solely on sales of Scratcher products. Scratcher product sales are defined as only those packs that have been financially settled by retailers. Prior to the beginning of each new quarter of the fiscal year, the CSL Director or designee shall set a statewide sales goal for Scratcher products. The statewide sales goal is then broken down into "market shares" for each individual "retailer assignment." Individual achievement for bonus eligibility is measured against the "marked share" established for the individual retailer assignment.
B.	CSL Sales Department shall issue a quarterly report showing the percentage of statewide sales (commonly referred to as "market share”) for Scratcher products for each retailer assignment. The market share of each sales area is defined as the percentage contribution of the employee's retailer assignment to actual statewide sales during the quarter ending one quarter prior to the "goal quarter," also identified as the "quarter before last."
Example: The goal of Quarter 1 of FY 99-00 is based upon market share from Quarter 3 of 98/99.
C.	Upon completion of each quarter and a qualifying period as defined in subsection G., if the retailer assignment achieves at least the first level sales goal in Scratcher products, the eligible employee receives the appropriate bonus award for that level. Subsequent awards are based upon achieving greater sales levels for the Scratcher-only products.
Example: If a retailer assignment achieves Level 1 goal in Scratcher sales, the participant receives Level 1 bonus.
D.	Bonus levels and corresponding dollar awards attributable to each level are listed below:
BONUS LEVEL % OF SALES GOAL ACHIEVEMENT	LEVEL 1 102%	LEVEL 2 105%	LEVEL 3 108%	LEVEL 4 112%
Lottery Ticket Sales Specialist	$300	$600	$900	$1,200
Lottery Ticket Sr. Sales Spec.	$300	$600	$900	$1,200
E.	Each eligible employee described below shall be required to work a qualifying period as defined in subsection F. to be eligible for a bonus.
1.	A full-time employee who works a qualifying period and who works a single regular retailer assignment during the quarter shall be eligible for the appropriate level bonus achieved by that retailer assignment during that quarter.
2.	An intermittent employee who works a qualifying period and who works a single regular retailer assignment during the quarter shall be eligible for the appropriate level bonus achieved by that retailer assignment during that quarter.
134
BU 4
03-05
3.	An intermittent employee who works a qualifying period and who works more than one retailer assignment in either the North or the South region during the quarter shall be eligible for the appropriate level bonus achieved by that region.
4.	An intermittent employee who works a qualifying period and who works more than one retailer assignment in both the North and South regions during the quarter shall be eligible for the appropriate level bonus achieved by the State.
5.	A part-time employee who works a qualifying period shall be eligible for a percentage of the bonus dollar amount consistent with the employee's time base. The qualifying period as defined in subsection F. shall be prorated to the time base.
Example: A % time employee who work's a qualifying period and who achieves Level 1 sales shall be eligible to receive % of the dollar amount for that level. The qualifying period for eligibility is proportionately reduced by 25 percent (25%).
F.	For purposes of this bonus provision, the following definitions shall apply:
1.	"Qualifying period" is defined as actually working a regular retailer assignment no less than 65 percent (65%) of actual available work hours in a quarter, excluding holidays and weekends.
Formula: Thirteen weeks (91) days less weekends (26 days) multiplied by eight hours a day less holiday hours multiplied by 65 percent (65%) equals a qualifying period.
Example: A qualifying period in a thirteen (13) week quarter with no holidays would require the participant to work a regular retailer assignment 338 hours. A qualifying period in a quarter that has one holiday would require the participant to work a regular retailer assignment of 333 hours.

1.	The Special Schools shall guarantee the opportunity for ten (10) months of compensation (as defined by State Personnel Board Rule 9) to permanent, full-time Special Schools’ employees except when budgetary or program considerations preclude it. Budgetary or program considerations are those which are mandated by the Legislature, Governor, or Superintendent of Public Instruction. This means that these employees may be scheduled either for work, CTO, holiday credits, paid or unpaid leave; so, that when all of these are considered in total for the year each employee at the California Schools for the Deaf and California School for the Blind receives a minimum annual compensation equivalent to approximately 1,734 hours of the employee’s regular (straight-time) rate of pay. Employees at the Diagnostic Centers will receive a minimum annual compensation to approximately 1,934 hours of the employees’ regular (straight time) rate of pay based upon their 25-day extended work year. The Special Schools may provide an annual compensation greater than 1,734 hours, (1,934 hours for Diagnostic Center’s employees) subject to budgetary and program considerations. If an employee chooses not to work, the School’s obligation to provide a minimum opportunity for ten (10) months compensation shall be reduced accordingly.
During recess periods, the Special Schools may utilize any combination of work, training, vacation, CTO or dock. Priority consideration will be given first to regular work assignments, second to training, and third to work not associated with their normal duties.

Employees may request training that enhances the Special School program.
2.	Employees covered by this Agreement:

145
BU 4
03-05
d.	The 70 hours of vacation leave credit (and pro-rated amount for permanent, part-time employees) is contingent upon an employee’s continued employment for a minimum ten (10) qualifying pay periods beginning with the employee’s first qualifying pay period of the school year. If an employee terminates employment prior to this ten (10) qualifying pay period duration and the Special School is unable to adjust the employee’s vacation and/or CTO credit balances in order to reflect the proper vacation leave credit balance, the employee shall reimburse the Special School for the amount that is outstanding.
3.	Work scheduled during school recesses may include training and other work assignments which may involve duties not normally associated with their normal and regular duties. These assignments which involve duties not normally associated with their regular duties shall only occur during recesses.
4.	The Special Schools have total discretion to determine the school year including recesses as long as the provisions of this Contract are met.
5.	During school recess periods, the Special Schools may schedule work, training, paid leave (e.g., CTO or vacation) or place employees on dock. During recesses it is the intent of the Department that all employees covered by this Contract shall be scheduled the same number of vacation days based on the minimum accrual rate for ten (10) month employees plus or minus two (2) days.
6.	Employees who have taken a leave of absence without pay, who have been charged with an AWOL, or who have been “docked” will not be extended compensation opportunities to the extent that they would benefit over other employees from such docks.
7.	The Special Schools shall provide eligibility for medical and dental benefits during the months of July and August by scheduling a minimum two (2) days work, training, vacation, or CTO in July and a minimum two (2) days of work, training, vacation, or CTO in August.

Time off for Victims of Domestic Violence
State of California

Email: CharlotteGehringer@dpa.ca.gov
The purpose of this memo is to notify departments of an addition to existing law regarding time off for an employee who is a victim of domestic violence.
Effective January 1, 2001, Assembly Bill 2357 added Section 230.1 to the Labor Code to specify that employers with 25 or more employees may not discharge or in any manner discriminate or retaliate against an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, as defined in Section 6211 of the Family Code, for taking time off to seek medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, obtain psychological counseling related to an experience of domestic violence, obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program, or rape crisis center, or to participate in safety planning to increase safety from future domestic violence.
As a condition for taking time off, the employee shall give the employer reasonable advance notice of the employee’s intention to take time off for any of the purposes summarized above, unless advance notice is not feasible. When an unscheduled absence occurs, the employer may require the employee to certify that the absence is a result of domestic violence in the form of a police report, a court order, or medical documentation. An employer would be required to maintain the confidentiality of any employee’s request for time off pursuant to provision of this law.
148
BU 4

PML 2001-025 June 20, 2001 Page 2
The law does not require an employer to compensate an employee for the time taken off under these circumstances, but the employee may use vacation, personal leave, or other compensating time off that is otherwise available to the employee.
An employee whose rights are violated under this section may be entitled to lost wages and reinstatement. An employer who willfully refuses to reinstate an employee under this section may be guilty of a misdemeanor. This law also allows an employee to file a complaint with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement of the Department of Industrial Relations.
This section does not create a right for an employee to take unpaid leave that exceeds the unpaid leave time allowed under, or in addition to the unpaid leave time permitted by, the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
The provisions of this bill apply to the State as an employer and to State employees. The entitlement of any employee under this law shall not be diminished by a collective bargaining agreement.
If you have any questions, please contact Charlotte Gehringer at (916) 323-6938.
