Dear Member:
Enclosed herewith is a copy of your revised Union Agreement presently in effect with your Employer. The many benefits contained in this Union Agreement are a direct result of many years of contract improvements through the collective bargaining process among the concerted efforts of the affected membership, the Executive Officers and the representatives on behalf of the members of Local No. 1099.
As a member, you should familiarize yourself with the contents of this Agreement in order for you to obtain and receive the many benefits as provided for therein. Keep this Agreement handy so that you can refer to it in the event any questions may arise as to your rights under the Agreement. Should you have any questions regarding any part of this Agreement, please feel free to contact your assigned business representative, and he/she will be happy to assist you whenever and wherever possible.
Every non-union store and non-union employee are a threat to any future improvements in your Union Contract. If you know a person working in a non-union store, please contact your Local Union's Organizing Department (ext. 3040) with pertinent demographic information on this person.
Only regular attendance at Union meetings can you hope to gain the knowledge necessary to win further gains in wages, working conditions and other conditions of employment. General membership meetings are held at 7:00 p.m. on the third Wednesday of January, April, July and October (unless otherwise noted in the Local Union’s newsletter), and New Member Orientation Meetings are held promptly at 5:00 p.m. on the third Tuesday of every other month beginning with January (unless otherwise noted in the Local Union's newsletter). These meetings are held at the UFCW Assembly Center, 913 Lebanon Street, Monroe, Ohio.
Remember - it doesn't cost, it pays to belong to the UFCW!
MEMBERS' RIGHTS
The Court held that an employer's denial of an employee's request that the union steward be present at an investigatory interview, which the employee reasonably believed might result in disciplinary action, constituted a violation of the National Labor Relations Act. This means that an employee has a right to have the union steward present when the employee is being interviewed on a matter which might result in disciplinary action. In the absence of the steward, employees may request any member of the bargaining unit to be present at any investigatory meeting.
The stewards should, therefore, not fear to insist to the employer that they honor the employee’s request for representation in such cases. Each steward should advise each member/employee working in the store(s) to request union representation during any employer investigatory interview which could lead to disciplinary action.

Article VI - Seniority
Section 1.	New employees shall be considered as probationary employees for their first ninety (90) calendar days of active service. There shall be no seniority among probationary employees. Probationary employees may be discharged at any time at the Employer's sole discretion, and the employee shall have no recourse through the Grievance Procedure. The Employer shall have no responsibility to recall or reemploy any probationary employee laid off or discharged during this probationary period. Seniority shall mean length of continuous service in the Meijer combination store and/or Distribution Center operation of the Employer and upon completion of the probationary period shall be dated from the first day worked.
Section 2.	Seniority shall be of two types, full-time and part-time. Full-time seniority shall be convertible to part-time. Full-time seniority shall not accumulate during periods of part-time jobs and shall not be convertible to full-time seniority if a part-time employee becomes full-time. Part-time seniority shall not be lost by transfer to full-time work. Part-time employees shall not accumulate seniority over full-time employees. If two (2) employees have the same full-time seniority date, part-time seniority will determine who is more senior. When two (2) or more employees have the same seniority date, the most senior employee(s) will be determined by the lowest last four digits of their social security number.
When a part-time employee averages more than thirty-six (36) hours per week for two (2) consecutive individual accounting quarters in one (1) department, classification and in any single unit, he shall be awarded full-time status. Hours worked in replacement of an employee on Workers’ Compensation or sickness, accident, or other approved leave, will not be considered in computing the thirty-six (36) hour average. Hours credited are those hours actually worked.
It is further understood that employees awarded such jobs must be fully available and will remain on such shift assignment in which their seniority allows until management determines an alternate shift is open on a full week and permanent basis. In the event of such an opening, the opening will be offered in line of seniority.
When a full-time employee averages less than thirty-six (36) hours per week for two (2) consecutive individual accounting quarters, he may be reclassified to part-time status. Hours credited are those hours actually worked. Hours paid as fringe time will be considered as hours worked for the computation of the thirty-six (36) hour average. Approved leave weeks will not be considered in computing the thirty-six (36) hour average.
Section 3.	A regular employee’s seniority shall be broken if he quits, if he is discharged for cause, if he fails to report for work for three (3) consecutive work days without notifying the Employer, or if an employee is laid off continuously for twelve (12) months. A regular employee's seniority shall be considered broken if he fails to report for work while on layoff within seven (7) calendar days after being notified to report unless extended by mutual agreement.
Section 4. Where there are open jobs for permanent full-time vacancies, the Employer will survey part-time employees in line of seniority, within the department, classification in that facility where the opening exists. The most senior employees indicating, in writing, a desire for the job in that department will receive the job, provided such employee is fully available and medically able for full-time work. The foregoing shall not apply to change in assignments within a job classification. However, in cases of the Meat Department, if a journeyman's job is not filled by the procedure
8
above, it will be offered to the most senior full-time apprentice meat cutter then to the most senior part-time apprentice meat cutter if they have the skill and ability to perform the job.
In the event there is no interest within the department and classification in that facility, the job will be posted for a seventy-two (72) hour period in that facility and the most senior part-time employee bidding within that unit and lines area where the full-time opening exists (hardlines, fashion area, foods, service) will receive the job.
If the job is not filled in accordance with the above, it will be posted for a seventy-two (72) hour period in that facility and the most senior part-time employee bidding within that facility will receive the job provided they are fully available for full-time work.
In the event no Distribution Center employee is awarded the posted full-time positions in the Distribution Centers, bargaining unit employees with more than three (3) years seniority from Stores #101, #102, #103, #106, #107, and #112 who have expressed their interest in writing to transfer to Tipp City, will be considered for such positions. Management will determine the appropriateness of transferring any employee to such positions.
An employee who transfers to a higher-rated classification shall receive the next higher rate from their existing rate in the new classification. After this rate adjustment, the employee will progress within the new classification after completion of the proper additional time interval in the new classification. An employee who transfers to a lower-rated classification shall be placed at the next lowest rate in the new lower-rated classification and will have their automatic review date reset.
Employees awarded jobs under this provision shall be given up to a ninety (90) day, but not less than thirty (30) day break in period to familiarize himself with the job duties by which time the employee will be required to perform the job at a satisfactory level. The employee, at his option may return to his original job anytime during the first thirty (30) day period. If, for justifiable reasons, the Employer feels an employee cannot perform the job at a satisfactory level, the employee shall be returned to his original job. The Employer may disqualify an employee from the award of a job, transfer, or promotion (including part-time to full-time) if the Employer demonstrates justifiable reasons why such employee should be disqualified.
Full-time employees with one (1) or more years of full-time seniority may indicate their interest in transfenring to any full-time position within their store, by submitting and having a valid transfer request on file with the Store Director. The Employer will review such requests and may offer such transfers before the application of Section 4.
Section 5.	Employees who receive full-time jobs will have full-time shifts consisting of afternoon and/or evening and/or early morning schedules. It is understood that these full-time openings will include Friday, Saturday, and Sunday work in most cases. Employees receiving full-time jobs under this section will remain on such weekly shift assignment until the Employer determines a permanent full-time opening exists on days. Once the Employer has made this determination, the full-time employees on afternoon and/or evening and/or early morning schedules will be surveyed in line of seniority by department and classification for the opening.
9
Section 6.	An employee who is represented by the U.F.C.W. in Local 1099’s jurisdiction who is transferred by the Employer from one facility to another shall retain past seniority and shall continue to accumulate seniority in the new facility. An employee who is transferred by the Employer within the operation shall retain past seniority and shall continue to accumulate in the new department.
Section 7.	Promotional Opportunities. When management determines there is a part-time opening in the Cashier and Food Clerk classifications, consideration will be given to the most senior active part-time employee in the highest classification that has signified their interest in writing within the last six (6) months from the time of the opening, has one (1) year of active service, and has no disciplinary record, before hiring from the street.
Employees awarded jobs under this provision shall be given up to a ninety (90) day, but not less than thirty (30) day break in period to familiarize himself with the job duties by which time the employee will be required to perform the job at a satisfactory level. The employee, at his option may return to his original job anytime during the first thirty (30) day period. If, for justifiable reasons, the Employer feels an employee cannot perform the job at a satisfactory level, the employee shall be returned to his original job. The Employer may disqualify an employee from the award of a job, transfer, or promotion (including part-time to full-time) if the Employer demonstrates justifiable reasons why such employee should be disqualified.
Section 8, Any and all employees classified as full-time are required to be fully available for work on any day of the week, including but not limited to Friday, Saturday and/or Sunday. No applicant or full-time employee shall have the right to rely upon any representation to the contrary made during the application process or at any time during their employment.
10
Article VH - Layoff And Recall
Section 1. Layoffs. Layoffs for the purpose of this section shall mean the displacement of an employee for lack of work or other reasons that require reductions in the number of employees as determined solely by management. The Employer shall determine the number and type (full-time or part-time) of employees to be affected by a layoff.
Layoffs shall be made in inverse order of seniority at each facility by classification within department. The full-time employee affected by such a layoff shall be a full-time employee who can no longer be maximized up to forty (40) hours per week. Employees with one (1) year of seniority are entitled to one (1) week advance notice of layoff. This notice shall not apply to an employee who is bumped by a more senior employee who has been laid off. Following notification of layoff, employees with seniority may exercise their seniority in the following manner
Full-time employees with more than one (1) year of seniority must:
a.	accept part-time hours within their department and classification and shall maintain full-time status until the end of the month following the month in which the layoff occurs, at which time, the employee shall be reclassified to part-time status with no recall rights to full-time.
b.	or bump the least senior employee within his classification and facility in his expanded department;
c.	or bump the least senior full-time employee in the next lower classification in his department (hourly rate commensurate with seniority);
d.	or accept a layoff to the street.
Full-time employees with less than one (1) year of full-time seniority will be reclassified to part-time status, and based on their seniority, will be given part-time layoff options.
Part-time employees with more than one (1) year of seniority must:
a.	bump the least senior employee within his classification and facility in his expanded department.
b.	or bump the least senior part-time employee in the next lower classification in his department (hourly rate commensurate with seniority);
c.	or accept a layoff to the street.
Expanded departments for the purpose of layoff are:
1.	Grocery, Produce, Foods Night Stocking
2.	General Merchandise, GM Night Stocking
3.	Bakery, Food Service and Deli
4.	Gas Station, HBC, Photo, Receiving, Planogram/Replenishment, Starbucks and all other departments will be treated as individual departments.
11
Al! employees exercising bumping rights under this section must be able to perform the duties necessary to the job function in order to displace another employee.
If requested to do so, the Employer will meet with the Union to discuss alternatives during an abnormal reduction in the work force or restructure at a facility.

Article VID - Hours of Work
Section 1.	In all payroll computations, the payroll week shall be a seven (7) day period beginning on Saturday midnight and ending on the following Saturday at midnight. However, a scheduled work week may overlap payroll weeks. The payroll week will be calculated separately from the scheduled work week.
Section 2.	The Employer will post weekly work schedules by 3:00 p.m. on the Friday prior to the scheduled work week constructed by department(s). In constructing a weekly work schedule, the Employer will determine first the needs of the department based on the requirements of the business.
(a)	Full-time employees will regularly be scheduled and must be available for forty (40) hours per week (thirty-two (32) hours during a holiday week) excluding holiday hours with one (1) day off per week. (The foregoing is not to be construed as a forty (40) hour guarantee.)
The Employer agrees to offer at least eighty percent (80%) of the most senior full-time employees in each department, classification, and job assignment a minimum of forty (40) hours per scheduled work week. In cases where the application of this percentage results in a fraction, such fraction will not apply. The guarantee of this provision excludes holiday weeks and will not apply during a layoff situation.
(b)	All full-time and part-time employees must be available for weekend work. The parties agree to support a rotation concept for weekend scheduling of employees within their departments as business conditions permit.
During the week (Monday through Thursday), if requested, the Employer will endeavor to give full-time employees, by seniority, the same day off from week to week as business conditions permit.
In the event the application of this language results in unresolved concerns, the parties will meet and discuss those concerns in a timely fashion in an effort to resolve any outstanding issues.
(c)	There shall be no mandatory split shifts.
(d)	The posted straight time hours of full-time employees will be maximized up to forty (40) hours per week (thirty-two (32) hours during a holiday week) with one (1) day off per week.
The Employer will schedule a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the most senior full-time employees by department, classification, and job assignment, their full-time work week in five (5) days, not necessarily consecutive, four (4) days during a holiday week, not necessarily consecutive unless the employee volunteers for an alternate schedule.
(e)	Part-time employees must be scheduled and must be available to work for a minimum of twelve (12) hours per week excluding holiday hours.
13
(f)	Nonrestricted part-time employees will be scheduled on a weekly basis within their classification, department and job assignment such that senior employees’ weekly scheduled hours shall exceed or equal the weekly scheduled hours of junior part-time employees. An employee's scheduling limitations may affect the Company’s ability to give that employee equal or more hours than less senior employees. Full-time and part-time employees in each department will be scheduled by job assignment grouping (e.g. cash office, U-Scan, service coordinator, guest convenience, paperwork processor, central salvage, order writer, etc.). In the event the work schedule is not believed to be in conformance with an employee's seniority and the other provisions of this Article, the employee shall have until Saturday, 3:00 p.m. to bring the matter to the department manager's attention so that adjustments can be made if needed. In the event the employee fails to bring the matter to the supervisor’s attention by Saturday, 3:00 p.m., the schedule will be deemed acceptable and not subject to the grievance procedure.
(g)	The Employer will recognize seniority for preferential daily work shifts, (i.e„ if there are starting limes with the same number of consecutive hours on a scheduled day, but one (1) starting time is earlier in the day, the more senior employee will be given the earliest start time) by department, classification and job assignment. The obligation to schedule equal or more hours than less senior employees at the end of the week shall be the first consideration in case of conflicts and the Employer retains the right to designate the starting limes of each employee’s work day.
(h)	In the event the Employer schedules full-time employees or part-time employees ten (10) hour days, these schedules will be offered to volunteers in line of seniority by status, department, classification and job assignment grouping,
(i)	The employees referenced in Article Vm, Section 2, paragraph (f) will be scheduled according to the requirements of the job assignment but will not be scheduled more total hours than their seniority will allow.
Section 3. The Employer reserves the right to create new or expand and/or reduce the structure of departments for scheduling purposes as business conditions warrant,
Section 4. If additional hours which are not on the posted schedules become necessary, these additional hours will be offered in line of seniority within the department, and classification, first to available fulltime employees who are scheduled less than forty (40) hours then to available part-time employees up to forty (40) hours per week subject to the Employer's ability to contact those employees. To be eligible for such additional hours part-time employees must indicate, in writing, their availability for additional hours on a daily basis and submit their written availability for additional hours to the immediate supervisor by 3:00 p.m. on Saturday. It is understood that such additional hours must consist of at least the minimum call-in guarantee to be offered to off-duty employees. If additional work is less than the call-in guarantee, it will be offered by department, and classification in line of seniority and required in inverse order of seniority to employees at work. It is understood that employees must be qualified to do the work to be offered any such additional hours.
14
Section 5.	The Employer retains the right to assign and adjust the hours and schedules to be worked by employees, and to achieve a reduction in hours worked by adjusting the schedule of active full and part-time employees, layoff of active employees, or any combination of the two according to the terms of this Agreement.
In order to be mandatory, the Employer must notify the employee of any schedule change if it occurs after 3:00 p.m. Saturday. In the event employees are sent home early within a department, this will first be offered to volunteers in line of seniority and required in inverse order of seniority by classification and job assignment within the group affected.
Section 6.	Rest Periods.
(a)	Employees working six (6) hours or more in any one day shall receive two (2) uninterrupted fifteen (15) minute paid rest periods during that day; one rest period shall be scheduled in the first part of the work day and one rest period shall be scheduled in the second part of the work day.
(b)	Employees working at least three (3) hours but less than six (6) hours shall receive one (1) uninterrupted fifteen (15) minute paid rest period during such working period.
Section 7.	Lunch Break. For each employee who is scheduled for more than a six (6) hour shift, thirty (30) minutes on the employee's own time shall be allowed for lunch on each working day. This lunch period shall not be scheduled until an employee has worked two and one-half (2 1/2) hours. The lunch period may be extended or waived by mutual agreement.
Section 8.	Employees who are scheduled and report to work shall be guaranteed a minimum of three (3) hours work or pay in lieu thereof. This clause shall not apply when the Employer schedules employees for meetings, but employees will be paid for the time spent in meetings. The Employer may assign any work available.
Section 9.	Overtime. Overtime work will be offered in line of seniority in the department by classification and job assignment and required in inverse order of seniority in the department by classification and job assignment to those available at work when such work is required. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the Employer’s right to require overtime work. Overtime shall not be paid more than once for the same hour of work. It is understood that employees must be qualified to do the work to be offered any such overtime hours.
Section 10. All employees are to receive one and one-half (1 1/2) times the regular hourly rate for all hours actually worked over forty (40) hours in any one week, or over eight (8) consecutive hours in any one shift but not both. Unpaid lunch breaks shall not be considered to break the consecutive hours and a break between shifts of less than five (5) hours shall not constitute a break in consecutive hours.
Employees who are scheduled to work ten (10) hour day($) as part of their basic work week will receive the daily overtime rate for hours worked over ten (10) hours daily and forty (40) hours weekly.
15
In any week in which a paid holiday falls, any full-time employee who is mandatorily assigned to work a fifth day in addition to the holiday (or fourth day in the case of a ten (10) hour employee) will be paid time and one-half (1-1/2) his regular hourly rate for hours worked on this day unless the employee volunteers for such work.
Under no circumstances may an employee through any privileges set forth in this entire Agreement force the existence of any time and one-half hours.
There will be no pyramiding of overtime.
Section 11.	Premium Hours. The Employer will survey full-time and part-time employees on a quarterly basis for purposes of indicating their desire for holiday work. Such work, when needed, will be scheduled in line of seniority by classification within each department and job assignment first to employees that indicated, in writing, a desire to work on holidays. It is understood that employees must be qualified to do the work to be offered any such premium hours.
It is understood that if a sufficient number of employees are not available on the basis of the survey, the Employer may require employees to work, in inverse order of seniority by department and classification.
(a) Holidays - For work performed on a holiday as defined in this Agreement, permanent employees will receive one and one-half (1-1/2) times their basic hourly rate for hours actually worked on the holiday.
Section 12.	These provisions shall not apply in circumstances beyond the control of the Employer, such as fire, flood, civil disturbance, power and equipment failure, or acts of God. If an employee is notified not to report before he leaves home, the Employer shall not be required to pay call-in pay. Same applies if the Employer attempts to notify an employee by last phone number or address on Employer records and it is incorrect due to change not recorded by employee.
Section 13.	Employees shall perform any work which a manager may direct with the understanding that when an employee is assigned a job with a lesser rate, he will be entitled to his regular rate of pay unless he has been assigned to a lower rated job and desires to retain such job rather than accept layoff. If an employee is assigned to a higher rated job for a period of thirty (30) minutes or more, he will receive a premium of twenty-five (25(S) cents per hour for the time worked in that higher classification that day.

1.	Effective April 1, 2005, an employee must also satisfy an annual minimum average hours worked per week requirement to enroll in and qualify for Employer contributions for the CHP, a CHP Alternative Medical Plan (such as an HMO offered by the Employer), the MMP, and/or the Dental/Optical Plan. Part-time employees may enroll in the PCMP without meeting this requirement, but will not be eligible for the Employer’s contribution for the cost of this coverage. The minimum average weekly hours requirements are listed below:
Full-time employees	36 hours / week*
Part-time employees	24 hours / week
*As defined in subsection 10.1 F 4 below.
The minimum average weekly hours requirements for enrollment and/or eligibility for Employer contributions is calculated by taking an employee’s total Active Service Hours (ASHs) paid for actual work, Paid Days Off, Holiday pay, Jury Duty Pay, and Bereavement Leave pay and dividing these total hours by the number of the employee’s Active Service Weeks (ASWs) during the previous payroll calendar year. An ASW is any week for which an employee receives pay as described above.
2.	Employees must also maintain the minimum average weekly hours requirement to continue their participation in these Health Plans. Employees participating in and qualifying for Employer contributions for any of the available Health Plans will have their average weekly hours computed, at the end of each Payroll accounting quarter. This .will be computed by taking the total (ASHs) paid during the Payroll accounting quarter for actual work, Paid Days Off, Holiday pay. Jury Duty pay, and Bereavement Leave pay and dividing these total hours by the number of the employee's ASWs during the Payroll accounting quarter.
3.	Employees who do not maintain the minimum average weekly hours requirement during two (2) consecutive Payroll accounting quarters will not qualify for Employer contributions for health coverage and will be subject to a cancellation of coverage on the last day of the month in which the second consecutive quarter with insufficient hours ends. Employees losing coverage as a result of this provision may become eligible for coverage again on the first day of the month following the completion of one accounting quarter during which
27
the employee has maintained the required minimum average weekly hours, provided the employee is on active status on that date.
4.	The minimum hours requirement for the health coverage that is applicable to full-time employees is based on the hours requirement to maintain full-time status as defined in Section 6.2 of this Agreement. Therefore, while an employee is in a full-time status pursuant to Section 6.2, the minimum average hours requirement is satisfied for the purposes of eligibility for Health Plans, the coverage available to full time employees, and the continuation of that coverage. Employees who lose the coverage that is available to full-time employees, because they have lost full-time status, will become eligible for such coverage again on the first day of the month following a return to full time status.
5.	Employees who have had health coverage canceled because the minimum average weekly hours requirements were not maintained as defined in this subsection 10.IF, may reinstate their coverage, without lapse, pursuant to the COBRA guidelines for continuation of coverage, as described in subsection 10.11. Employees who want to continue coverage under this provision must provide timely notification to the Employer of their intent to continue coverage and must make timely payments of the COBRA premiums, as defined under Federal COBRA legislation and regulations. The duration of continuation coverage will also be consistent with the Federal COBRA law.
G.	Contribution Requirements. The employee’s weekly pre-tax contribution required for participation is determined by the established cost of the Plan and the employee/dependent coverage category elected, less the amount the Employer will contribute to the cost of this coverage, as described in subsection lO.lJlc, 10.1J2b, 10.1J3b, and 10.1J4b.
The cost of the various plans have been established on the basis of the actual cost experience of previous claims, adjusted by an actuarial projection of future claims and costs, the benefit coverage levels provided, plus administration expenses. The established cost for some of the plans (such as an HMO or other Alternative Medical Plans) is the actual insurance premium charged for the coverage.
H.	Termination of Coverage. Health coverage under any of the Health Plans available from the Employer will terminate as follows:
1.	If an employee fails to make the required contributions to the cost of any of the Health Plans elected, coverage will terminate as of the last day of the calendar month for which all required contributions were made.
2.	If an employee fails to maintain the required minimum average weekly hours, coverage will terminate as described in subsection 10.1 F.
28
3.	If the employee retires and is eligible for a normal or early retirement benefit, health coverage will terminate on the last day of the calendar month prior to the month in which the employee’s retirement benefits could begin.
4.	If the employee terminates because of his death, and if he had dependent health coverage, such dependent coverage will terminate on the last day of the calendar month following the month in which the employee died.
5.	If the employee's employment is terminated on any other basis, health coverage will terminate on the last day the employee works prior to such termination of employment. This date will not be extended by any paid days off.
An employee whose coverage terminates for any reason is to return all Health Benefits Identification cards to the Employer immediately. In addition, if an employee owes the Employer any amount for unpaid employee contributions toward health coverage, for benefits paid in error, or for any other reason, the Employer may deduct such amount owed by the employee from the employee’s accrued unpaid wages and benefits.
I.	Continuation of Health Coverage during I paves / Layoff. The following rules apply to an employee on an approved leave of absence or layoff who was a participant in a Health Plan as of the date of the leave or layoff:
1.	The Employer contribution to health coverage which is not financed by
employee pre-tax contributions shall continue to be made until the end of the month following the month in which the approved leave or layoff begins, provided the employee contributions are made on a timely basis.
2.	If the employee is on an approved leave which qualifies as covered under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the Employer contribution described in subsection 10.11] (above) will continue as required by this Act.
3.	When continuation of Employer contributions for health coverage are no longer required under the terms of the Family and Medical Leave Act, the employee may elect coverage at his expense pursuant to the applicable requirements as defined by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA).
4.	If the employee's weekly pre-tax contributions are not made because of an absence of wages during a layoff or leave, the employee may purchase coverage in the plan on an after tax basis. To the extent that the Employer contributions are provided as described in subsections 10.111 and 2, the required employee contribution will be equal in amount to the pre-tax contributions made by the employee before the layoff or leave. After the period in which the Employer
29
contributions are provided, the required employee contribution will be the total cost of coverage for the plans elected, as defined under COBRA, This coverage may continue for the duration of the period required by COBRA, provided the employee remains eligible for such coverage as defined by the COBRA law,
5,	An employee on an approved leave of absence or layoff, who has continued his health coverage by paying the full monthly cost in advance or whose coverage has stopped, will be eligible for reinstatement of Employer contributions for such coverage as of the first day of the calendar month following the day the employee returns to work, so long as the employee is otherwise eligible for such benefits and is on active status. The employee's pre-tax contributions shall resume as of the first day of the calendar month following the date the employee returns to work. Pursuant to the FMLA, an employee on a qualified FMLA Leave will be provided with reinstatement of health coverage upon the employee's timely return to work as required by this Act.

For each Plan Year, the participant may contribute up to 4% of their pay and the Company will match 50% of the first 2% and 25% of the next 2% of the amount contributed by the participant. However, the matching contribution will be made only if the participant:

10.6 Paid Time Off Benefits
A.	The Benefits described in this Section 10.6 have been modified as of April 25, 2004, of this Agreement. For employees hired prior to April 25, 2004, benefit improvements to Jury Duty (10.6E) and Bereavement Leave (10.6F) will take immediate effect. However, the eligibility requirements for all Benefits described in this Section will change for all employees covered by this Agreement on an employee’s next anniversary date commencing on or after April 25, 2005. As of that date, an employee must have earned a minimum “fringe day hours average” of 4.8 hours from the previous anniversary year (requires 1,248 ASHs) to be eligible for any paid time off provided by these Benefits during the subsequent anniversary year. The “fringe day hours average” is defined in subsection 10.6B below.
B.	For the purpose of calculating benefits that are based on an employee’s “fringe day amount,” this is calculated by taking the employee's total active service hours (ASHs) during the previous anniversary year, divided by fifty-two (52) weeks, and then divided by five (5) days. There will not be a maximum applied to this calculation. This equals the “fringe day hours average.” The “fringe day amount” is equal to the “fringe day hours average" times the employee's rate of pay in effect when the benefit is payable. An “active service hour” (ASH) js any hour that the employee is paid for active work, Holiday pay, Paid Days Off, Bereavement pay or Jury Duty pay.
48
For the purpose of using the “fringe day amount" for benefits paid during the first year of employment, an employee’s “fringe day amount” will be calculated after the completion of three (3) months (thirteen (13) weeks) of service, based on total ASHs at that time, divided by thirteen (13) weeks, divided by five (5) days. Therefore, on and after April 25, 2005, an employee, who has less than one (1) year (12 months) of service, must have earned a minimum “fringe day hours average” of 4.8 hours (requires 312 hours) during the employee’s first three (3) months of service to be eligible for these Paid Time Off Benefits during the employee’s first year of employment.

Employees who are not eligible for leave, do not qualify for family care leave, or have exhausted the leave time available under the Act, will not be granted a family care leave. In such cases, the employee may apply for a personal leave as described in Section 11,1.

The administration of such leaves would be consistent with the provisions contained in Section 11.1.
In all cases of approved leave of absence which are qualified as covered under the Family and Medical Leave Act, such leaves will be administered according to the actual terms and conditions of the Act.
