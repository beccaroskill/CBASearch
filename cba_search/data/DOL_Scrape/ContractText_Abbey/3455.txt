e.	The parties agree to set up a labor-management study committee to discuss and review processes for the contracting-in of public services. The study committee will consider:
i.	the conditions under which "contracting in" should be considered and the method by which it should be determined that City services should be contracted in;
ii.	the establishment of pilot projects in mutually agreed upon targeted areas to determine the feasibility of providing such services in-house; and

e.	In order to manage change, the parties commit to ongoing consultation, problem solving, and discussion between management and the Union and among employees at all levels. As part of these consultations, management is committed to providing the Union and employees with the opportunity to participate in decisions related to these changes.
f.	In accordance with the worker empowerment provisions of this 1995 MCMEA, an oversight committee shall be created, and shall include representatives of the Coalition of Municipal Unions and the City.

Re: 1995 MCMEA Funding Issues
Dear Mr. Hill:
This is to confirm certain mutual understandings and agreements regarding the above captioned Agreement.
1.	The Unions have provided or shall provide additional funding in order to advance the effective date of the 3 percent to the general increase set forth in Section 4(b)(i) from the first day of the 28th month to the first day of the 25th month. The value of the funds shall equate to three (3) months of payroll costs including wages, FICA, and associated "spin-off costs.
2.	The Unions have provided or shall provide the funding necessary to effectuate the application of the general increases to the additions to gross set forth in Section 4 (d)(i). The value of this advance is 0.02 percent, which is to be charged against the entire compensation package of the 1995 MCMEA.
3.	The Unions have provided or shall provide the funding necessary to advance the funds available for the one month contract extension from the first day of the 60th month to the first day of the 51st month. The value of this advance is 0.02 percent, which is to be charged against the entire compensation package of the 2995 MCMEA.
Page 1 of 2
4.	The annuity fund set forth in Section 6(a) is funded from the 1.52 percent available on the first day of the 51st month. In addition, the Additional Compensation Fund set forth in Section 6(b) funded from the 1.52 percent is available on the first day of the 60th month. The net value of the availability on the 1st day of the 60th month of the Additional Compensation Fund is 0.03 percent, which is to be charged against the entire compensation package of the 1995 MCMEA, and is reflected in the 1.52 percent funds available.
5.	Funding was not provided to permit the application of the general increases to the 15 year longevity increments provided in various separate unit agreemennts. Therefore the provisions of Section 4(d)(i) of the 1995 MCMEA shall not apply to such longevity increments.
If the above accords with your understanding, please execute the signature line provided below.

Re: 1995 MCMEA — Provisions in Lieu of Section 13 for HHC Employees
Dear Mr. Hill:
This is to confirm certain mutual understandings and agreements regarding the above captioned Agreement.
The City and the Unions recognize that in addition to sharing the burdens of the City’s fiscal difficulties, the changing nature of funding for health care and the restructuring of the Health and Hospitals Corporation ("HHC") presents HHC with major reductions in resources. The parties agree that involuntary separations should be a last resort action and will take steps to mitigate staff reductions if required.
In the event that staff reductions are required, HHC and the City agree they will try to redeploy employees within HHC, the City, and other covered agencies that may have vacancies.
The parties will also discuss alternative or internal funding sources, severance, early retirement, and/or worker retraining or educational programs.
If involuntary separations occur the parties will abide by State civil service law and related regulations and procedures.
The parties hereby agree that nothing in this letter agreement shall constitute a waiver of the Unions’ rights under the New York City Collective Bargaining Law or any other applicable law to bargain over the Employer’s decision to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any public health care facility, or to bargain over the effects of such a decision on their members’ rights, or the Unions’ continued status as their exclusive bargaining representative. This will also constitute no waiver of rights by HHC’s or the City’s decision to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any public health care facility.
If the above accords with your understanding please execute the signature line provided below.

Re: 1995 MCMEA — Applicability of Section 13 to NY CHA Employees
Dear Mr. Hill:
This is to confirm certain mutual understandings and agreements regarding the above captioned Agreement.
Any Housing Authority employee covered by this 1995 MCMEA shall be subject to the job security provisions set forth in Section 13. However, the parties recognize the potential for major Federal funding reductions. If such reductions take place which lead to the involuntary separation of employees, the parties will meet to determine if alternative or internal funding sources can be utilized to avoid involuntary displacement, attempt to redeploy those affected within the City or other agencies where vacancies exist, and discuss severance, early retirement, and/or employee retraining and education programs.

11	. Any newly hired employee appointed before who was appointed at a
"frozen" hiring rate mandated by Section 5(b)(iv) of the 1993 Municipal Coalition Agreement (the "old hiring rate") shall upon completion of one year of service be paid the indicated minimum for the applicable title as set forth in the applicable Successor Separate Unit Agreement that is in effect on the one year anniversary of the employee’s original date of appointment.
1	2. a. The appointment rate for any employee newly hired on or after shall
be the applicable "new hiring rate" set forth in the applicable Successor Separate Unit Agreement as mandated by Section 5(c) of the 1995 MCMEA. Upon completion of two (2) years of active or qualified inactive service, such employee shall be paid the indicated minimum (set forth in the applicable Successor Separate Unit Agreement) for employee’s title that is in effect on the two year anniversary of the employee’s original date of appointment.
b.	The "new hiring rates" listed the Successor Separate Unit Agreements will be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(c) of the 1995 MCMEA.
i.	Effective, the "new hiring rate" for a covered title shall be the applicable minimum salary rate for said title that was in effect on the date of termination of the applicable predecessor separate unit agreement.
ii.	The general increases provided for in Sections 4(b) of the 1995 MCMEA shall be applied to the "new hiring rate" as set forth in Paragraph 2(b)(i), above.
c.	For a title subject to an incremental pay plan, the employee shall be paid the appropriate increment based upon the employee’s length of service. The Successor Separate Unit Agreements will reflect the correct amounts and will be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(c) of the 1995 MCMEA.
d.	Employees who change titles or levels before attaining two years of service will
IM/ -1
be treated in the new title or level as if they had been originally appointed to said title or level on their original hiring date.
e.	The First Deputy Commissioner of Labor Relations may, after notification to the affected union(s), exempt certain hard to recruit titles from the provisions of Section 5 of the 1995 MCMEA.
1	3. For the purposes of Paragraph 2, employees who were in active pay status prior to the date of execution of the 1995 MCMEA who are affected by the following personnel actions after said date shall not be treated as "newly hired" employees and shall be entitled to receive the indicated minimum salary rate set forth in the applicable Successor Separate Unit Agreement.
a.	Employees who return to active status from an approved leave of absence.
b.	Employees in active status (whether full or part time) appointed to permanent
status from a civil service list or to a new title (regardless of jurisdictional class or civil service status) without a break in service of more than 31 days.
c.	Employees who were laid off or terminated for economic reasons who are appointed from a recall/preferred list or who were subject to involuntary redeployment.
d.	Provisional employees who were terminated due to a civil service list who are appointed from a civil service list within one year of such termination.

g.	A provisional employee who is appointed directly from one provisional appointment to another.
h.	For circumstances that were not anticipated by the parties, the First Deputy Commissioner of Labor Relations may elect to issue, on a case-by-case basis, interpretations concerning the application of Section 5 of the 1995 MCMEA. Such interpretations shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 16 of the 1995 MCMEA.
1 4. a. Upon completion of four (4) years of active or qualified inactive service, an employee appointed pursuant to the provisions set forth in Paragraph 2 shall receive a one-time lump sum payment calculated by taking the difference between the "hiring rate" received by the employee and indicated minimum for the applicable title set forth in the applicable Successor Separate Unit Agreement that was in effect on the one year anniversary of the employee’s original date of appointment to their title. Such one-time lump sum payment shall be equivalent to the difference between the annual salary rate the employee would have actually earned during the employee’s second year of service had the higher salary rate been in effect and the annual salary rate they did earn.
IM/ -2
b.	The intent of this Paragraph 4 is to treat the employee as if the employee had moved to the higher minimum salary rate after one year of service rather than after two years. Only the difference between the applicable minimum and the "new hiring rate" is guaranteed and any differentials, merit increases, or similar additions-to-gross payments are not to be included in the calculation of the onetime lump sum payment.
c.	Any overtime, night shift differential, or other percentage based premium payments received by an employee during the second year of service will be included in the calculation of the lump sum payment.
d.	For a title subject to an incremental pay plan, the one-time lump sum payment \ shall be calculated by taking the difference between the "new hiring rate" received by the employee and the increment (for employees hired before) that was in effect on the one year anniversary of the employee’s original date of appointment to their title. The Successor Separate Unit Agreements will reflect the correct amounts and will be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(c) of the 1995 MCMEA. In the case where there are increments payable between the employee’s first and second anniversaries, the lump sum will be prorated to reflect such increments.
e.	Employees who change titles or levels before attaining two years of service will be treated in the new title or level as if they had been originally appointed to said title or level on their original hiring date and the lump sum will be prorated to reflect such change(s).
5 5. For the purposes of Paragraphs 2 and 4, "qualified inactive service" is defined to include the following employees:
a.	those who are on preferred or recall lists; or
b.	those who are on the following approved leaves:
i.	matemity/childcare leave;
