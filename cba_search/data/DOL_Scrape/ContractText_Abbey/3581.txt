PROMOTIONS
-41 The Employer will make promotions within occupational series within the bargaining unit on a seniority basis to its employees whose work performance has been satisfactory and who possess the general physical qualifications for the opening as well as the special qualifications and training necessary for the regular opening under consideration.
-42 A "promotion" is defined as the transfer of an employee to a classification in the same occupational series assigned to a higher pay grade within the seniority unit. A regular opening is one which is expected to continue indefinitely until discontinued by the Employer and shall not include any opening which is limited in duration, or occasioned by absences for whatever the reason, or an incident of work assignment shifting. A promotion in the maintenance occupational series may occur through progression or through the filling of a vacancy.
a.	A Progression is defined as a transfer of an employee to a higher paying classification within his current work crew where no vacancy exists. (i.e. PP Mechanic I to PP Mechanic II).

If there are no qualified applicants from within the bargaining unit, the vacancy may be filled from other qualified applicants.
-44 A promotion or filling of vacancy may be questioned through the Grievance and Arbitration Procedures, but only by an employee in the seniority unit in which the opening occurs who has requested on a form provided by the Employer that he/she be considered for promotion to the classification in question and either (1) has greater unit seniority, or (2) is assigned to a classification in a higher pay grade than the employee selected for the promotion.
-45	No employee within the bargaining unit will be required to downgrade and assume the
duties of a person in training for a higher classification.
a.	Stationary Engineer, 2nd Class: From the date of ratification of this contract between Michigan State University and Local 324, International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO, all employees entering into the classification of Stationary Engineers, 2nd Class, will be required, as a condition of employment, to enter into the classification of Stationary Engineer, 1st class, when there is a position opening, if qualified.
b.	Boiler Operator Trainee Classification: If a Boiler Operator Trainee is temporarily assigned as a Boiler Operator for more than 50 hours in any calendar quarter, the employee shall be advanced two pay grade levels in the Boiler Operator Trainee classification. In no case, however, shall the regular hourly rate for any trainee exceed the maximum regular hourly rate of the Boiler Operator Trainee classification.
-	46 In operations classifications, the Employer will make promotions by selecting the applicant with the highest step up-seniority and who has demonstrated satisfactory job performance. If applicants from more than one classification are qualified, applicants in the highest classification shall be given preference.
-	47 Stationary Engineer 1st class will be considered on an evaluation status for six (6) months after selection to this classification. Either the Employer or the employee can request an evaluation review during this period. During the evaluation period the employee may be returned to Stationary Engineer 2nd class based on unsatisfactory job performance. The employee may voluntarily return to Stationary Engineer 2nd class during the evaluation period.
-	48 Operators will be considered for qualification for the desired classification designation (A,B,C,D) by submitting a request in writing, to the Operations Supervisor that they are prepared for a qualification review. Such review will be completed within thirty (30) calendar days of the request. The thirty (30) day period may be extended by mutual consent of the parties. An unreasonable delay in the process will be subject to review by the Director of Utilities.
-	49 The board review phase of a qualification review will be performed by a committee of five employees, three from Power and Water management and two from the Local Operating Engineers Union (The two shall be from the ranks of the Stationary 1st Engineers and/or those Stationary 2nd Engineers who have been qualified as Stationary 1st Engineers.). The committee will conduct a board review and make a recommendation to the Director of Utilities. The Director will retain the right of final approval or rejection. Candidates who do not pass the board
11
review shall be given a written statement with a description of the reasons for the failure and suggested methods for correction and/or improvement.
-	50 The prerequisites to advance to the board review phase of a qualification review are as follows:

6)	Attendance
7)	In addition, following a successful qualification review, qualified Stationary Engineers 2nd Class will be required to attend additional technical and human resources training within 12 months of obtaining this classification. Failure to participate in continuing education is a basis for unsatisfactory job performance.
For other classifications:
1)	Successful completion of the O.J.T. qualification standards and a minimum six (6) months of experience in the current classification
2)	Demonstrated skill in operating and knowledge of the plant systems for that classification

Candidates who do not pass the qualification review shall be given a written statement with a description of the reasons for the failure and suggested methods for correction and/or improvement.
-	52 Operators who successfully complete the qualification review to the higher classification will receive the appropriate designation (A,B,C,D) rate within their current classification.
-	53 The Employer and the Union shall adhere to the non-discrimination policies adopted by the Board of Trustees and to applicable federal, state, and local non-discrimination laws and regulations.

E.	Retirement for Employees Hired Prior to January 1, 1973
-186 Effective January 1, 1973, the University Retirement Program ceased to exist.

-	187 Those persons employed prior to January 1, 1973, who were 55 years of age or older and/or had 25 years of service on January 1, 1973, could elect to remain subject to the improved University Plan formula described below.
-	188 The formula governing the old Retirement Plan was improved by basing pensions on an amount, equal to the highest three (3) year average earnings, multiplied by 2% for each year of service, with a $3,600 ceiling.
-	189 For employees participating in TIAA-CREF and/or other retirement programs made available through the University with a University contribution, this new formula will be applied for each employee at retirement and will become the minimum received by the employee.
-	190 The annuity purchased by MSU's contributions to TIAA-CREF and/or other retirement programs made available through the University will be compared to the pension amount as computed in paragraph 188 above, and the employee will receive the larger of the two figures. Employee contributions (retroactive to 1-1-73) will be available as an additional annuity provided the employee meets the minimum retirement requirements.
-	191 Those employees not participating in TIAA-CREF and/or other retirement programs made available through the University will have their retirement figured solely on the improved formula plus a 10% addition added to the base pension prior to actuarial reduction or the selection of a survivor option.
-	192 Employees who terminate without meeting the minimum provisions for retirement will receive a retirement pension solely from the contributions made to their individual TIAA-CREF annuity contract and/or other retirement programs made available through the University, consistent with the provisions of those contracts.
F.	University Retirement
-	193 University Retirement Defined - University retirement shall be defined as 1) attainment of age 62 with 15 years of employment, or 2) at any age with 25 years of employment.

-	194 Employees participating in the Employee-Paid Life Plan at the time of retirement and who were enrolled prior to July 1, 1976, shall receive a $2,000 life insurance benefit fully paid by the Employer.
-	195 An employee who retires under the definition in paragraph 193 shall be paid for fifty (50) percent of his/her unused sick leave, but not to exceed a maximum of twelve hundred (1200) hours as of the effective date of separation.
-	196 An employee who does not meet the definition of University Retirement in paragraph 193 but has at least five (5) years, but less than ten (10) years of continuous service and has attained 65 years of age at the time of his/her separation shall be paid fifty (50) percent of
35
his/her unused sick leave as of the effective date of separation. An employee who does not meet the definition of University Retirement in paragraph 193 but has at least ten (10) years of continuous service and has attained 65 years of age at the time of his/her separation shall be paid one hundred (100) percent of his/her unused sick leave as of the effective date of separation but not to exceed a maximum of one hundred (100) days, unless he/she has received a University contribution to TIAA-CREF in which case he/she will be paid as in paragraph 195 above.

It has been the intent of the Employer to perform maintenance and operating functions within the Power Plants with bargaining unit personnel. The exceptions to this policy in the past have been during emergencies and overhaul of Plant components when other personnel were utilized as necessary to meet required schedules.
The Employer is willing to continue the policy of performing maintenance and operating functions with 324 personnel as long as work can be completed within required time frames.
It is not the intent of these parties to utilize part-time employees to perform bargaining unit work.
In the event the University should decide to utilize part-time employees, to perform the work of this bargaining unit, the University and the Union shall meet to negotiate the terms and conditions under which said person or persons may be employed.

East Lansing, MI 48823-5239

NOTE: These rules are intended to accomplish the equitable distribution of overtime by establishing the order in which overtime is offered and should not be interpreted so as to prevent anyone from being contacted for work when plant needs dictate.
Therefore it is understood that “eligibility” as it is used in the context of this document is intended to identify,
1.	Where a person is in the normal rotation to be contacted for work and,
2.	When a person can be charged for turning down work when contacted.
ELIGIBILITY RULES
1.	Scheduled overtime will be offered to eligible employees in classifications where vacancies occur, who are capable of doing the work, starting with the employee who has the least accumulated overtime. When an employee within classification is not available to perform overtime work, qualified employees in other classifications will be offered the work subject to the conditions in the paragraphs.
2.	Overtime eligibility for an employee temporarily assigned to a higher or lower classification will be determined by assigning the employee the greatest number of overtime hours of any other employee in the assigned classifications. Overtime hours charged during the temporary assignment will carry forward to the employee’s regular classification at the end of the temporary assignment.
3.	An employee is not eligible for overtime:
a.	When on sick leave, funeral leave or when using personal time for a full day or at the beginning or end of a shift.
b.	For maintenance series; 24 clock hours, eight (8) before and sixteen (16) following a call in for the use of vacation or personal time of eight (8) hours.
c.	For operation series; 36 clock hours, twelve (12) before, twenty-four (24) following a call-in for the use of vacation or personal time of twelve (12) hours.
d.	When using a total of twenty four (24) hours of vacation or personal time concurrent with scheduled days off in any combination or split.
e.	For the sixteen (day shift) or twelve (operations) hours preceding or following personal time used;
1.	in increments of less than eight (day shift) or twelve (operations) hours and, 2. when used to start a shift late or end a shift early.
MSU is an affirmative-action,
equal-opportunity employer.
47
Exceptions:
a.	During emergencies an employee may be called at any time, charges will be for overtime actually worked.
b.	An employee may be offered overtime on scheduled days off preceding or following vacation only after all other employees in the same classification have been offered the overtime. In such case, overtime turned down will not be charged.
c.	When sick leave is used for pre-scheduled medical appointment.
d.	When using a total of twenty four (24) hours of vacation or personal time
concurrent with scheduled days off in any combination or split, one will be ineligible during scheduled days off.
4.	In the Operating series, in the event relief is not immediately available, the employee on duty will remain in the job until appropriate relief is obtained, regardless of the number of hours worked. First Engineer, at his discretion, may assign this overtime to another member of the shift.
5.	Employees in the Maintenance series, working on an assigned task that requires overtime continuous to regular working hours, will be first eligible regardless of accumulated overtime hours.
6.	Qualified Mechanics, Technicians, Fuel Systems, Water Works and Operators in that order, will be first eligible in the other series for overtime work that is not filled from within the series.
7.	An employee off sick/injured for a period of five days (5) or more may, at his/her option, elect to turn down overtime for a period of time equal to the period of absence without charge. At the end of that time (or before, if the employee declares eligibility) he/she will have their hours adjusted and be charged in accordance with the guidelines.
8.	An employee in the operating series who turned down overtime on a specific shift is not eligible for other overtime in another position on the same shift.
CHARGING OVERTIME
1.	For the purpose of equalizing overtime, equivalent overtime hours will be charged when:
a.	Overtime is refused.
b.	Overtime is refused because of an unreported illness.
c.	An employee does not respond after a message is left through a personal contact on a telephone answering device on the home phone. A maximum of twelve (12) hours a day (operations) or eight (8) hours (Maintenance) will be charged providing contact is made each day.
2.	An employee will be charged only for overtime actually worked, when recall results in subsequent acceptance of the same overtime initially refused. All other employees contacted before or after the initial refusal will be charged on the normal manner.
3.	There will be no overtime charge for an unanswered telephone call except for operations personnel when a 2nd or 3rd engineer has verified that a call was placed.
48
4.	An employee electing to split a period of overtime with another employee will be charged for the full period of the overtime.
5.	For the purposes of overtime equalization holiday pay will be considered to be a premium and not overtime worked subject to charge.
6.	An employee shall not be charged when turning down overtime offered on a designated holiday as defined in Article 21.
7.	An employee using vacation, personal or sick time on their scheduled overtime day will have the time charged as offered/refused.
8.	In the operations series, operators will be charged in the following manner regardless of if the hours paid are paid as overtime or straight time.
a.	If asked to work on a normally scheduled 48 hour week, operators are charged for each hour offered and/or scheduled to work beyond 40 hours of their work week.
b.	If asked to work on a normally scheduled 24 hour week, operators are not charged for the first additional 16 hours of work offered. However, they will be charged for any additional hours offered beyond the first 16.
c.	If asked to work on a normally scheduled 36 hour week, operators are not charged for the first additional 4 hours of work offered. However, they will be charged for any additional hours offered beyond the first 4.
d.	Any time an employee works over a 12 hour shift, all hours beyond the first 12 will be charged regardless the number of regular hours scheduled in the pay week.
MISCELLANEOUS
1.	Employees will be allowed a reasonable time to return a call for overtime.
2.	Employees will be given as much advance notice as possible for both scheduled and
unscheduled overtime.
3.	Acceptance of scheduled overtime is implicit unless a written refusal is made within twenty four hours of the time it is reasonable to assume that the employee became aware of the notification.
4.	Seniority will not be considered when making temporary assignments.
5.	Operators may be moved from one shift to another to fill vacant positions when the vacancy is expected to extend three or more days.
6.	Filling out and posting overtime replacements for vacation, personal and sick time requests will be done not less than seven days prior to the time requested. When requested within seven days of the time off, posting will be done immediately by the first engineer presented the request.
49
7.	For turning down work on a holiday, employees are not released from their obligation to work until a replacement is secured through the normal overtime procedures and the operations supervisor has been notified.
8.	Eligible employees will be charged for offers refused when contacted, regardless of the methodology.
9.	If when returning to work from sick leave or on an unpaid leave of absence over 30 calendar days an employees overtime equalization hours are lowest in their classification, they shall be charged an amount of hours equal to the lowest employee in the same classification.

It is not the intent of the University to introduce for the first time in its history mass layoffs or reductions of hours.
If, due to conditions beyond the control of the University, it becomes necessary to reduce Employees’ working hours, the University agrees to meet with the Union in order to affect a mutually agreeable settlement. If no agreement can be reached at that meeting the proposed reduction can then be implemented and the dispute may then be arbitrated on the basis of the questions put before the arbitrator by both sides. Temporary or part-time persons shall not be used to perform work of the bargaining unit while a reduced hour schedule is in effect.

In a pay week where all of the following three (3) conditions are met...
1.	Hours are reported on an “unscheduled day”*or on the scheduled overtime day of an Operator’s 48 hour week; AND
2.	Paid absences are reports; AND
3.	Daily premium is earned
.the potential “loss” of overtime eligibility due to use of paid time off may be offset, either fully or partially, by allowing daily overtime hours to be counted toward the forty (40) hour worked threshold for earning weekly overtime.
