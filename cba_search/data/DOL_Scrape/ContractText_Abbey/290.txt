Credit for previous related experience in military service, an apprentice training program, or a skilled trades classification in any plant, may be given up to the total time required on any phase of the apprentice shop training or related schooling schedules. Credit for such previous experience shall be given the apprentice at the time he has satisfactorily demonstrated that he possesses such previous experience and is able to do the job. Related schooling credit shall be given the apprentice at the time that he has demonstrated that he possesses the educational knowledge for which he is requesting credit under the related schooling schedule. At the time such credit is given, the apprentice's wage rate shall be correspondingly adjusted within the apprentice rate schedule based on the amount of credit given toward completion of the shop training schedule. Any dispute over such credit shall be referred to the Joint National Apprentice Committee for decision.
(79)	Sections. Term of Apprenticeship
The term of apprenticeship shall be nominally four (4) years in length , but shall be based on the number of hours actually worked. The shop schedule shall be divided into eight periods of 920 hours each. The present shop and related schooling schedules will remain in effect unless replaced by revised schedules. If local plant requirements indicate deviation should be made in such shop
61
or related schooling schedules, proposed changes must be referred to the Joint National Apprentice Committee, together with the reasonforrequestingthedeviationforconsideration.
Given the major investment related to ’	apprentice training each apprentice will be
asked to sign an agreement (Apprentice Program Loan and Repayment Agreement) confirming the individual’s commitment to remain employed by the Company for eight years following program completion and if the apprentice leaves sooner to reimburse the Company for training expenses.
There will be provisions within the above referenced agreement which will serve as an authorization for the deduction of Company apprentice training expenses in the event that the individual voluntarily terminates, or retires following the completion of the apprenticeship. Such deduction will be made from the individuals final pay and any other checks due the apprentice, with no maximum, until such costs have been folly reimbursed. This reimbursement is as follows:
1)	1 yearor less of completion of the program=$6.000
2)	More than 1 year But Less than 2 years of completion of the program=$4.000
3)	2 years But Less than 3 years of completion of the program =
$2.000
4)	3yearsButLessthan4yearsofcomDletionoftheprogram= $1.000
5)	4 years or more-S 0.
The apprentice will be required to directly reimburse the Company for training expense; which exceed the amounts the Company owes the apprentice at the termination date.	.
No reimbursement would be required after (4) or more years.
62
(80)	Section 6. Probationary Period
The first three (3) months or 500 hours including related schooling hours, whiche v er occurs first, of employment in the Apprenticeship Program shall be considered a probationary period during which time the trainee must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Apprentice Supervisor and the Joint Local Apprentice Committee that he is making acceptable progress in his shop assignments, is in regular attendance at his classes for related studies, and is earning passing grades therein. Failing such progress or regularity of attendance, the apprentice may be dropped from the program at the discretion of the Apprentice Supervisorand the joint Local Apprentice Committee.
(gl) Section?. Hours of Work .
The standard work week for apprentices, including time spent in connection with related schooling shall be forty (40) hours. Apprentices may be assigned to overtime work when all journeymen on the shift in the equalization group with which the apprentice in the course of his training is currently associated, are either scheduled to work overtime or have had the opportunity to work overtime, except where the local plant Agreement provides otherwise for weekend overtime only. Individual apprentices will not be assigned to work overtime for the purpose of completing their apprentice training ahead of other apprentices in like circumstances in the trade. When an apprentice works overtime, he shall receive credit on'the term of apprenticeship on a straight time basis for the actual hours of overtime work.
For the safety of apprentices, for the safety of all workers in the Plant, and to insure apprentices steady progress toward full qualifications, there must be a proper training of apprentices by journeymen.
(82)	Sections, Ratio
The number of new apprentices who may be enrolled shall be determined on the basis of the number of journeymen employed for the program averaged over the preceding three (3) months. The ratio of apprentices in training to journeymen should
63
not exceed one (I) apprentice to eight (8) journeymen. However, the Union agrees that local Management can establish a ratio of apprentices to journeymen in excess of one (1) to eight (8) ratio, but not to exceed a ratio of (1) apprentice to five (5) journeymen. Deviations below the one (1) to five (5) ratio may be agreed to by the Joint Local Apprentice Committee. Favorable consideration will be given to requests for deviations below the one (1) to five (5) ratio in instances in which it is anticipated the impact of early retirement will create a skilled manpower shortage. Disputes concerning such deviations will be referred to the Joint National Apprentice Committee for decision, tn the event of a reduction of force, the apprentices in excess ofthe one(11 to eight (8j ratio will be laidoffbefore any journeymen in that trade is laid off. The ratio of apprentices in training to journeymen will be based on the average number of journeymen employed for the program computed on the last Monday of each of the three (3) preceding months. The average thus computed shall remain in force until a new computation is made on the last Monday of the next succeeding month. If, during periods when journeymen are laid off, any monthly computation results in a ratio in excess of one (1) apprentice to eight (8) journeymen, such excess apprentices will be laid off by the end of the pay period during which the last Monday of the month falls except that a minimum of one apprentice may be retained in each trade, [n the event the reduction in force is due to unusual circumstances, including, but not confined to: a transfer or discontinuance of an operation, major technological developments, the elimination or consolidation of classifications, the discontinuance of a shift, ora drastic reduction in the level of work resulting in a heavy reduction in the skilled work force; the Joint National Apprentice Committee may mutually agree to an acceptable layoff and recall plan.
Upon an increase of the work force in each apprenticeable trade, apprentices who are laidoff must be recalled in trade seniority order in reverse of the procedure established in the preceding paragraph.	.
Apprentices must be recalled to maintain the ratioof one (I) Apprentice for each eight (8) Journeymen recalled or up to such higher ratio as may have been in effect at the time the layoff
64
I	occurred. For example, if when the layoff occurred one
;	apprentice was laid off for each eight Journeymen laid off; when
j eight Journeymen are recalled the Company will recall one apprentice, if when the layoff occurred one apprentice was laid off for each fifteen Journeymen laid off; when fifteen Journeymen are recalled the Company will recall one apprentice.
(83)	Section 9. Discipline
The Apprentice Supervisor shall have the authority to discipline an apprentice and to cancel the Apprentice Training Agreement of the apprentice at any time for the following causes pertaining to his apprentices!! ip:
a.	Inability to learn.
b.	Unsatisfactory work.
c.	Lack of interest in his work or education, or failure to maintain required school attendance.	'
.	Prior to implementing such action, the
' Apprentice Supervisor will lay the facts of the contemplated action before the Joint Local Apprentice Committee with the objective of resolving the problem. If no resolution is made by the Joint Local Apprentice Committee, the matter will be referred to the Joint National Apprentice Committee. If no resolution is agreed upon by the Joint National Apprentice Committee, the matter will be referred to the terminal point of the grievance procedure under this National Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section shall limit the right of the Company to discipline an apprentice for cause for reasons not related to the three items listed in this Section. Such discipline by the Company shall be subject to the grievance procedures in accordance with the collective bargaining agreements.

Time spent by the apprentice in connection with related schooling shall not be considered time worked under this Agreement; nevertheless, time spent by the apprentice in taking required related schooling shall be paid for at the apprentice's straight time hourly rate.
The Company agrees to pay, on behalf of apprentices covered by this Agreement, registration fees and/or tuition and necessary textbooks required in connection with related schooling under the apprentice program.
67
Within a reasonable period after a laid off apprentice has been recalled to work, such apprentice will be paidan incentive bonus in recognition of satisfactory completion of any related training courses in which the Employee was enrolled at the time of layoff. This incentive bonus will amount to a figure to be arrived at by multiplying the number of class hours in each course times the apprentice's straight-time hourly rate less the amount paid to the apprentice for such related training prior to layoff.

Total points will be computed for each applicant from all six factors except that an applicant who attains less than twenty-five (25) points on Factors A through D of the Selection Procedure will not be interviewed. Since an applicant may have expressed
78
interest in more than one trade, he likewise may have more than one total point score—one for each trade in which he expressed an interest. An applicant must score a minimum of thirty-five (35) points to be ranked in any trade.
If the applicant requests, he will be told his exact rank (as of the time of the request) among other applicants for each trade in which he expressed an interest and will be informed ofhis right to re-apply after one year. A rejected applicant may re-apply in less than one year after presenting evidence of completion of additional, appropriate education.

(If© 1.	Ranking of Candidates
Appointments to the apprentice program will be based upon the number of points received as computed in accordance with the Point Rating System, with the applicant with the highest number of points having first choice for openings in the skilled trade for which he has expressed an interest. Under this procedure, if, for example, an opening was available for a Tool & Die apprenticeship, the qualified applicant who had expressed a preference for Tool &. Die and who earned the most points under the Point Rating System, would be selected. Other apprenticeships would be handled on the same basis, with the first choice for an opening going to the applicant with the greatest number of points with an expressed interest in the trade for which applications are being taken.
In the event more than one non-employee applicant is tied at the highest rating, the non-Employee applicant with the earliest dated Apprentice Application would be selected. In the event more than one Employee applicant is tied at the highest rating, the Employee applicant with the longest plant seniority would be selected, tfthere are openings in different trades at the same time, and the same applicant has the highest score in each, and has expressed an interest in both of them, the applicant will be allowed to take his choice between the two.
79

Coincident with the re-ranking of the Candidate Pool, placements wilt start with the Employee applicant list for each apprenticeabletrade. For the purpose of th is Selection Procedure, an applicant must be a seniority Employee in the Bargaining Unit and Plant where he made application for apprenticeship on the last working day prior to his date of placement tn the program in order to qualify as an Employee applicant.
(1071 K. Candidate Pool
As selections are made, the remaining applicants will represent the Candidate Pool from which future openings will be filled in the same manner as described in (1) above. However, as new applications are processed these applications will be added to the bottom of the existing list. Applicants will remain in the Candidate Pool for two (2) years unless they are selected for an apprentice opening or unless they request withdrawal of their application prior to the two (2) years. ■■ •	■

Dear Ms. Bunn:
During the courseof the current negotiations, the Union
has expressed concern regarding certain activities undertaken by local management opposing the Union's efforts to organize Office, Professional and Technical Employees at some of out plants.
Over the years Budd has developed constructive and harmonious relationships based upon trust, integrity, and mutual respect with Che various unions which currently represent its Employees. These relationships date back, in the case of the UAW, nearly 40 years. Budd places high value on the continuation and improvement of constructive relationships with these unions as well as with all of its Employees, union and nonunion alike.
In situations where the UAW seeks to organize Employees not presently represented by a union, Budd management will neither discourage nor encourage the Union’s efforts in organizing Office, Professional and Technical
121
Employees traditionally represented by the Union elsewhere in Budd, but will observe a posture of neutrality in these matters.
For its part, Budd expects that the Union will conduct itself in such organizing campaigns in a constructive and positive manner which does not misrepresent to Employees the facts and circumstances surrounding their employment

Dear Ms. Bunn:
In the course of the 2000 negotiations of the National Agreement, you requested a letter concerning relationships at certain Budd facilities in which the Employees are not represented by any union.
Over the years, Budd and the United Auto Workers have developed a constructive relationship based upon trust, integrity and mutual respect. Our Management is dedicated to an autonomous organizational structure for our various divisions. However, we recognize that certain matters cut across divisional Jines and require a Corporate position.
Our Corporate position regarding union representation is as follows:
We believe that our Employees should exercise free choice and decide for themselves by voting on whether or not they wish to be represented by the UAW or any other labor"? organization.
124
We have no objection to the UAW becoming the bargaining representative of our people as a result of such an election.
Where the UAW becomes involved in organizing our Employees, we intend to continue our commitment of maintaining a neutral position on this matter. The Company and/or its representatives wili communicate with our Employees, not in an anti-UAWmanner, but in a positive pro-Budd manner.
If a majority of our Employees indicate a desire to be represented by die UAW, we will cooperate with all parties involved to expedite an NLRB election.
In addition, we reserve the right to speak out in any manner appropriate when undue provocation is evident in an organizing campaign.
We trust this wilt help clarify our position regarding this subject.

Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Ms. Bunn:
Men and women enter the work force today with little or no knowledge of what is expected of them as Employees and as Union members in a unionized, industrial plant community. Many of them have not been adequately prepared to cope with industrial situations in which they suddenly find themselves.
New Employees come to The Budd Company with little or at best incomplete information about their employer and their Union. They have little knowledge of the extensive economic benefits available to them as agreed upon in collective bargaining between the UAW and The Budd Company over a period of more than thirty years.
Many new Employees may be unaware of the commitment of Budd and the UAW to fair employment practices and to the application ofthe National Agreement to all Employees without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex or national origin.
126
They are not familiar with basic contract provisions covering such subjects as transfers, promotions, shift preference and seniority. They may be unaware of the opportunities for advancement to highly paid skilled trades jobs through the Apprentice and training programs. Theytendtobeunfamiliarwiththeobligations of the Employee to his job, to the Union and to his employer. Many are unaware of the importance of regular attendance, ■ quality workmanship and the need for cooperation by all in getting the job done. Too often they are unacquainted with the various procedural matters related to their job and their relationship to their Union and their employer.
New Employees usually have little knowledge of the long history ofthe UAW and of the administrative structure of the UAW at the International and local Union levels. They do not understand about their relationship to the Union, about the initiation fees and dues requirements and their rights within the Union contained in the UAW Constitution and guaranteed by right of appeal to the Union's Public Review Board.
Frequently, they have never seen the inside of a manufacturing plant before and are unfamiliar with the operations, the nature of the product and how it is used.
You have underscored these realistic considerations in our recent discussions. You have indicated that this may explain to some extent the high turnover and absenteeism being experienced in industry today among the new work force. And you have suggested that a properly developed and conducted orientation procedure designed to create an "awareness of the dynamics of the labor-management relationship, and the years long effort to build a community of interest in resolving labormanagement problems through orderly procedures. , might serve the best interest of the Employees, the UAW and The Budd Company.
Accordingly, pursuant to the Union's suggestion, the Company will, in cooperation with the International Union, encourage continuation of a joint orientation program to be presented to new job applicants prior to the time they start their jobs.
127
The orientation program will not be subject to the grievance procedure and can be terminated at any plant by either the International Union or the Company, in the event that the program at that plant is not being carried on in a manner consistent with rhe purpose and intent of the program as established by the national parties. The joint orientation program will be limited to those subjects agreed to by the Company and the International Union and the establishment of such a program will not limit any other communication by Management with its Employees or by the Union with its members.

Dear Ms. Bunn;
Upon his making application for employment, the Company will give preference over other applicants to a seniority Employee who is laid off from one of the plants covered by this Agreement at another plant covered by this Agreement, provided the layoff is the result of an indefinite discontinuance of the Employee's former job or the result of an indefinite reduction in force.
Applicants for employment under the above must meet all of the local plant's hiring eligibility requirements, and if hired will be subject to all provisions ofthe Local Collective Bargaining Agreement at the new plant, except that they shall be probationary Employees until they have been on the active payroll for a period of thirty (30) days, at which time they will establish seniority as of their date ofhire at the new plant.
Employees hired in accordance with this lettershall be eligible for the economic fringe benefits in the plant where they
129
are hired based upon their unbroken company service. Employees shall have only the seniority accrued at the new plant for purposes of applying the seniority provisions of the new plant Collective Bargaining Agreement.
An Employee hired under the terms of this letter shall not, because of such hiring, be eligible for Moving Allowance (Article XI of the 2000 National Agreement), except as provided tn the following paragraph.
When a plant covered by this Agreement is expected to experience a significant, permanent reduction in force due to a transfer of work from such plant or the permanent shut down of facilities at such plant, a representative of the Company’s Corporate Labor Relations Department will meet with representatives of the UAW-Budd Department and the affected Local Unions, as far in advance as practicable of the expected reduction in force date, to discuss preferential hiring as it applies to the Employees who are expected to be laid off or affected in such reduction of force. An Employee who accepts work at a new plant under the procedure outlined in this paragraph shall be eligible for a Layoff Moving Allowance in accordance with the provisions of Article XI, B. Layoff Moving Allowance, provided he meets the eligibility requirements contained therein.
A distinctive application form in duplicate and a listing of all job classifications shall be available at each location. Applicants must indicate thereon which job classification(s) they wish to be considered for preferential hire,	'
An eligible Employee may obtain a preferential hire application at his home plant if he wishes to make application by mail and may take the required pre-employ ment physical in his home plant area.
Applications will remain on file until an Employee is offered work of his selection or for a maximum period of one (1) year, whichever occurs first.
A verified copy of the application form shall be given to the Employee and the Local Union Presidents at the Employee's home plant and rhe plant to which the Employee is applying.
130
When openings occur, the Employee(s) who have applied for work in accordance with the terms of this Preferential Hiring Letter shall be considered for employment before any new (to The Budd Company) Employees are hired. However, the Company reserves the right of selection of applicants to fill whatever openings are a vailable.
When an Employee quits his new job, such action shall be considered as a local action only, and this shall not terminate Company-wi de service.
An Employee who is notified of an offer of work in accordance with this letter must reply to the Personnel Department of the plant from which such offer was made within three (3) working days from the date such notice was sent by the Company, Such Employee must report for work within seven (7) calendar days dating from the Company’s sending of such notice. An Employee who fails to reply or report as described above shall forfeit all preferential hiring consideration at the plant from which the offer of work was made and must reapply in accordance with this letter in order to reestablish preferential hire consideration.
A laid off National Agreement plant Employee whose plant has been closed and who has been denied employment after having made application in accordance with this document may appeal such denial. The appeal must be made, in writing, by the UAW-Budd Department to the Company's Manager of Labor Relations within 30 calendar days after receipt of denial by the Employee. After investigation, and, if required, discussions with the UAW-Budd Department, the Company's Corporate Manager of Labor Relations or his designee will provide a written response to the appeal within 15 calendar days after receipt of such appeal.
Such appeal shall be considered settled on the basis of the Company's written response, unless within 30 calendar days the case is appealed to the Permanent Arbitrator appointed under the National Agreements by so indicating in a letter from the UAW-Budd Department to the Company's Manager of Labor Relations. Such appeal to the Permanent Arbitrator shall be heard by him as promptly as possible at a mutually agreeable location in
131
Detroit, Michigan, using the rules of the American Arbitration Association to govern the proceeding.

8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit,Michigan 482)4
Dear Ms. Bunn:
- During the course of our negotiations leading to the 2000 Budd-UAW National Agreement, we discussed at great length the relationship of The Budd Company and the UAW and the effect upon that relationship of any new manufacturing facilities which we might establish in the future.
We advised you that we have a working relationship with other labor organizations and to grant automatic recognition and/or preference to your union at new facilities over the others, would be illegal. However, we confirm the following commitment for the term of the 2000 Budd-UAW National Agreement;
. A. Should we open any new manufacturing operations to produce products the same as those being produced at manufacturing plants covered by' this National Agreement, the Company shall grant preferential hiring to
133
those Employees from plants producing the same product who wish to be transferred.
B. During the first 24 months after production begins in the aforementioned new plant, any Employee covered by this National Agreement with one or more years of service who has been on a layoff for a continuous period of six months, and who continues on layoff, shall be granted preferential hiring rights at such new facility, over non-Budd people.
The Company will provide to eligible Employees the following uniform method of making opportunities for pre ferential hiring available;
A.	An Employee interested in being considered for employment at a new facility should request and complete a Preferential Hiring request at his home plant. The Personnel Department will forward the request to the designated plant(s) of the Employee's choice. Such transfer will be given preference over non-Budd people. The request will be valid for a period of six months from date of filing and the Employee must re-apply in order to extend the six month period.
Employees will be given preference in ■	accordance with the date of receipt of the
application, provided the Employee is qualified and is available for work,
B.	If an applicant accepts a position at the new facility, he will be considered a voluntary quit at his home facility upon completion of the normal probationary period at the new facility, and his name will be removed from all other plant transfer request listings.
134
C.	If an applicant refuses an offer of employment after having made application, his name will be removed for a period of one (l)year from the list of those Employees who have applied for preferential consideration at any new facility.

Dear Ms. Bunn:
This letter is to confirm certain agreements reached by The Budd Company and the International Union, UAW, regarding the calculation of the Cost-of-Living Allowance pursuant to Article XIII of the Collective Bargaining Agreement dated November 1.2000.
In applying the provisions of Article XIII, Paragraph 168) of the Agreement, the Company shall prepare a notification letter to the Union setting forth the Consumer Price Index for each of the three months calculated in accordance with the provisions of this Letter of Understanding. This letter will be prepared and sent to the Union after publication of the appropriate Consumer Price Index for the third month used for each adjustment period in accordance with Article XIII, Paragraph (67) ofthe Agreement.
If the Union claims that the Company's calculations in any particular instance were not made in accordance with the terms of this Letter of Understanding, i t may refer t he matter to the Arbitrator under the Grievance Procedure as set forth in Article VIII.
138
For Cost-of-Living Allowance adjustments effective on December 4.2000. and ending with the adjustment effective September 5,2005. the table in Article XIII, Paragraph <681 will be extended so that it provides for one (t) cent adjustments in the Cost-of-Living Allowance sequentially, for each0.3,0.2,0.3,0.2 and 0.3 change in the Three-Month Average Index, and so forth, with that sequence of the five changes being repeated thereafter in the table so as to produce an average adjustment over time of one (1) cent for each 0.26 change in the Three-Month Average Index. Following the adjustment effective September 5. 2005. the table in Article Kill, Paragraph (68) shall be reconstructed in accordance with Article XIII, Paragraph ($8). The table shall have the May, June and July, 2005 Three-Month Average Index equal to the reduced Cost-of-Living Allowance in a bracket that is comparably positioned in the above sequence.
The total Cost-of-Living Float was transferred to the base rate or incentive add effective on the effective date of the 2000 National Agreement. During the term of the 2000 National Agreement, in the event a decline in the Consumer Price Index requires a reduction in the Cost-of-Living Allowance and the Float is less than the amount of the reduction required, the base rate or incentive add dien in effect may be reduced by up to the amount of the Cost-of-Living Allowance reduction or five (5) cents, whichever is less.

Engineering Method of Rounding
Re: Consumer Price Index
The following rules of rounding shall apply to the determination ofthe Consumer Price Index:	’
1.	If the leftmost of the digits discarded is less than 5, the preceding digit is not affected, for example, when rounding to four digits, 130.646 becomes 130.6.
2.	Ifthe leftmost of the digits discarded is greater than 5, or
is 5 followed by digits not all of which are zero, the preceding digit is increased by one. For example, when rounding to four digits, 130.557 becomes 130.6.
3.	If the leftmost of the digits discarded is 5, followed by zeros, the preceding digit is increased by one if it is odd and remains unchanged if ii is even. The number is thus rounded in such a manner that the last digit retained is even. For example, when rounding to four digits, 130.5500 becomes 130.6 and 130.6500becomes 130.6.

DearMs. Bunn;
During the 2000 negotiations, the Company and the Union reviewed the evolutionary development of employee involvement processes and organizational structure changes at the plants. The parties discussed problems and successes alike, and reiterated their commitment to continued progress and renewed the 1991 letteron th is subject which reads as follows;
The Budd Company and the UAW recognize the desirability of mutual effort to improve the quality ofwork life for the Employees. The voluntary Employee Involvement Process in operation at all National Agreement Plants, as well as projects and experiments which may be undertaken in the future are designed to improve the quality of work life and the Company's competitive position, thereby advantaging the worker by making work a more satisfying experience, advantaging the Company by leading to a reduction in Employee absenteeism and turnover, advantaging the consumer through improvement in the quality
141
and productivity of the products manufactured and increasing job security through improved productivity.
As a result of discussions during the course of the current negotiations for a new Collective Bargaining Agreement, the parties have decided that a Committee to Improve the Quality of Work Life composed of representatives of the International Union and The Budd Company will be continued at the national level.
This Committee will meet periodically and have responsibility for:
1.	Reviewing and evaluating programs of the Company which involve improving the work environment of Employees represented by the UAW.
2.	Developing experiments and projects in that area.	-
3.	Maintaining records of its meetings, delibera-
tions and all experiments and evaluations it ‘ conducts. '
4.	Making reports to the Company and the Union on the results of its acti vtties.
5.	Arranging for any outside counseling which it
feels is necessary or desirable with the expenses thereof to be shared equally by the Company and the Union.
■	6. Assuming a leadership role in sustaining and ’
‘ 1 defining the Process.
7. Meeting at least once with each plant's Joint -	Steering Committee during the term of the
' current collective bargaining agreement.
142
The Company will encourage its plant managements to cooperate in the conduct of such experiments and projects, and recognizes that cooperation by its plant floor supervision is essent ial to success of this program.
The Union agrees to request and encourage its members
and their local union representatives to cooperate in such experiments and projects, and recognizes that the benefits which can flow to Employees as a result of successful experimentation is dependent on die cooperation and participation of those Employees and the local union representatives.

Equal Application Committees
THE BUDD COMPANY
CORPORATE OFFICES * TROY, MICHIGAN 48007-2601

Ms. Elizabeth Bunn
Vice President and Director
UAW-Budd Department
Solidarity House
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, MI 48214
DearMs. Bunn:
During the course of the current negotiations The Budd Company and the International Union, UAW discussed and reaffirmed their commitments to equal application principles and have agreed to continue their arrangement which provides for National and Local Equal Application Committees.
For many years the Company and your Union, in their respective fields, have been leaders in adopting and effectuating policies against discrimination because of race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, and disability status, veteran status.Qr unigrtaaivity tgHie.extenl?uch status or activity is defined and protected by applicable state or federal law and to this endtheparties have expressly incorporated in their Agreement an "Equal Application" provision that both insures adherence to that principle in all aspects of employment at Budd and provides the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure for the resolution ofalleged violations of that principle.
144
The parties now recognize the desirability of increased communication and cooperative effort on this subject (i) to encourage Employees and grievance representatives to use the grievance and arbitration procedure as the exclusive contractual method for the prompt resolution of all claims of denial of equal application rights, (ii) to determine the cause of such claims in orderto reduce the probability of these claims arising or recurring, and (iii) to maintain liaison with appropriate federal and state civil rights agencies for the following purposes: (a) to increase understanding, (b) to promote and encourage the use of the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation in many forums simultaneously which is frequently time consuming, contradictory and hence, nonproductive to relieving Employee problems, (c) to seek solutions to mutual problems, (d) to relieve tensions in this area, and (e) to exchange information, expertise and advice.
Accordingly, the parties agree to establish within thirty (SO) days of the ratification of the National Office Agreement dated today a National Equal Application Committee and Local Plant Equal Application Committees,
The National Equal Application Committee will be composed of two (2) representatives of the Internationa) Union, one of whom will be a member ofthe International Union's Civil Rights Committee, or his designee, and two (2) representatives of the Company, one of whom will be active in the Company's equal employment opportunity programs. The National Committee will meet as frequently as is mutually deemed desirable or necessary and its functions shall be the following:
a.	Review and discuss ways and means of encouraging Employees and grievance representatives to use the grievance and arbitration procedure as the exclusive contractual method to resolve claims of denial of equal application rights.
b.	Advise and counsel Union and Company representatives on grievances alleging such claims.
145
c.	Conduct or arrange for investigations and/or studies into the cause of equal employment opportunity and discrimination problems and tensions in an attempt to prevent such problems from arising or recurring.
d.	Maintain liaison with appropriate federal and state agencies for purposes set forth in the second paragraph of this letter.
e.	. Review and discuss ways and means of implementing Company policy regarding employment of the handicapped set forth in the letter from William M. Kroger, Jr. to the International Union setting forth this policy.
f.	Advise and counsel Local Plant Equal Application Committees.
At each plant or facility that the National Office Agreement covers, a Local Plant Equal Application Committee will be established consisting of two (2) representatives of the Local Union and (2) representatives of the Company. The two (2) representatives of the Local Union shall consist of die Local Union President, or his designated representative, and the Chairman of the Civil Rights Committee of the Local Union. The two (2) representatives of the Company shall be the Plant Manager, or his designated representative, and the Company official at the plant active in the Company's equal employment opportunity program. Local Plant Equal Application Committees will meet on a scheduled quarterly basis, during non-working hours, and shall have the following duties:
a.	Recommend to the National Committee ways ■	and means of promoting use of the grievance
procedure as the exclusive contractual method for resolving claims of dental of equal application rights.
146
b.	Suggest guidelines for Union and Company
representatives active in the grievance procedure in the proper and prompt handling of grievances alleging such claims,
c.	Recommend to the National Committee means for determining the cause of equal employment opportunity and discrimination problems and tensions in the plant.
The parties continue to recognize their legal and moral responsibility for assuring that alt Budd Employees have equal employment opportunities and freedom from discrimination as set forth in the National Office Agreement. Consequently the function of the National Equal Application Committee and Local Plant Equal Application Committees shall be advisory, consultative and cooperative. While the Company and the Union will welcome the recommendations the Committees may make, the Committees may not commit either party to a specific course of action. However, the Union agrees that it will discourage its members from bypassing the grievance and arbitration procedure with respect to any claim or complaint against the Company which may be made the subject of a grievance under the contract.
The parties discussed the subject of harassment based on the sex of an individual and agreed that such subject could be discussed by the Equal Application Committees.

Reinstatement of Grievances

UAW-Budd Department

Dear Ms. Bunn:
During the negotiations of the current National Agreement, the parties acknowledged the desirability of ensuringprompt, fair and final resolution of Employee grievances. The parties also recognized that the maintenance of a stable, effective and dependable grievance procedure is necessary to implement die foregoing principle to which they both subscribe. Accordingly, the parties view any attempt to reinstate a grievance properly disposed of as contrary to die purpose for which the grievance procedure was established and violative of the fundamental principles of collective bargaining.
However, in those instances where the International Union, UAW, by either its Executive Board, Public Review Board, or Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee has reviewed the disposition of a grievance and found that such disposition was improperly effected by the Union or a Union representative involved, the Budd Department of the International Union may inform the Company's Corporate Manager of Labor
155
Relations in writing that such grievance is reinstated in the grievance procedure at the step at which the original disposition of the grievance occurred.
h is agreed, however, that the Company will not be liable for any claims for damages, including back pay claims, arising out of the grievance that either are already barred under the provisions of the aforementioned National Agreement or bocal Agreements, at the time of the reinstatement of the grievance or that relate to the period between the time ofthe original disposition and the time of the reinstatement as provided herein. It is further agreed that the reinstatement of any such grievance shall be conditioned upon the prior agreement of the Union and the Employee or Employ ees in vol ved that none of them will thereafter pursue such claims for damages against the Company in the grievance procedure, or in any court or before any federal, state, or tn uni c ipal agency.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a decision of the Permanent Arbitrator or any other arbitrator on any grievance shall continue to be final and binding on the Union and its members, the Employee or Employees involved and the Company and such grievance shall not be subject to reinstatement.
This letter is not to be construed as modifying in any way either the rights or obligations ofthe parties under the termsof the aforementioned National Agreement or Local Agreements, except as specifically limited herein, and does not affect sections thereof that cancel financial liability or limit the payment or retroactivity of any claim, including claims for back wages, or that provide for the final and binding nature of any decisions by the Permanent Arbitrator or other grievance resolutions.
It is understood this letter and the parties obligations to reinstate grievances as provided herein can be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days notice in writing to the other.
156
It is agreed that none of the above provisions will be applicable to any case settled prior to the effective date of this letter.

Dear Ms. Bunn:
Re:	Separate Payments for Vacation, Grievance Award and
PAA Payments and Federal Income Tax Withholding
This is to advise you of our understanding with the UAW-Budd Department during current national negotiations regarding the issuance of separate payments in the following instances:
Vacation payments for vacation time taken off and PAA days, when the payment is for 40 or more hours.
Pay in lieu of vacation payments and PAA days of 40 or more hours during the vacation year or for any amount at the end of the vacation eligibility period. However, when the pay in lieu payment is made in connection
158
with a payment for vacation time taken off, only one-payment.wil) be issued.
•	Grievance awards, whether written or oral, in
excess of $100.
Federal, IngomeJaxJWjthholdinf
This will confirm our understanding of the methods to be used by Payroll Services in regard to withholding of Federal income tax from Employee’s wages attributable to grievance awards, whether written or oral, vacation pay, pay in lieu of vacationand PAA days from Employees' wages.
Grievance awards, whether written or oral, in excess of $100.00, but involvingperiods of less than one calendar year, will be treated as supplemental wages and income tax withholding will be calculated using a flat 28%_without regard to any withholding allowances to which the Employee may be entitled.
Likewise, pay in lieu of vacation also will be treated as supplemental wages and income tax withholding will be at the 28% level.	■
It should be noted that the 28% withholding only covers the Federal withholding amount. An amount for F1C A taxes and state or local income taxes, where applicable, will be in addition to the 28% withheld for Federal income tax.
Grievance awards, whether written or oral, which are less than $ 100,00, will be aggregated with the regular payroll and the income tax withholding will be calculated on (he total amount.
If a grievance award, whether written or oral, is made for a period of more than one calendar year, the income tax withholding will be calculated as if the payment were for a single annual period. Thus, in such situations. Payroll Services will use the annual percentage table to calculate the income tax withholding for such awards. This method would be the same as considering the award as having been paid equally over the preceding 52 weeks.
159
For vacation payments made for time away from work, such payments will continue to be treated as a regular wage payment; i.e., income tax withholding will be calculated as if the vacation payment represented a regular weekly wage payment.
The above methods are dictated by Federal Income Tax Regulations. Therefore, any change or amendment to such Regulations will, ofnecessity, have to he reviewed for compliance with the above changes.
Formal procedures to effect these changes are being communicated to Payroll Services by separate letter, with instructions to make these changes as soon as practical.

Dear Ms. Bunn:
During the current negotiations, the Union expressed concern regarding the rights of Employees to review their personnel records.
This will confirm that the right to review individual personnel records has been extended as a matter of pol icy to Budd Company Employees throughout the United States.
With respect to medical records, Employees upon written request may see and obtain a copy of their medical record except in the rare circumstance in which the Company physician believes that medical reasons make it advisable that the Employee's private physician determine what information should be given the Employee and how best to do it. Examples of such situations are psychiatric illness, cancer or prognosis of terminal illness. In cases where the Company physician will provide an Employee with a copy of the record, the Company physician may state a preference for either explaining the record to the Employee
161
or having the Employee authorize release of the record to the .personal physician.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT ON
U.S. FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT
THE BUDD COMPANY
CORPORATE OFFICES * TROY,. MICHIGAN 48007-2601
November 1, 2000
This Memorandum of Agreement effective November I, 2000 between The Budd Company (Company) and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (Union), describes the joint understandings of the parties regarding implementation oftheU.S. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for employees covered by the Budd-UAW National Agreement. This Memorandum of Agreement shall be considered part of the National Agreement.
Eligibility
As provided by the FMLA, employees covered under the National Agreement shall be eligible for leave entitlements under the FMLA after being employed for 12 months and if actively at work at least 1250 hours in the 12 months prior to requesting a leave.
Qualifying Events for a Leave
As provided by the FMLA, an employee covered under the National Agreement may request a leave under the following situations:
•	Upon the birth of a child of the employee and to care for the child.
166
•	. Upon the placement of a child with the employee for
adoption or foster care and to care for the child.
•	In order for the employee to care for the employee's spouse; biological, adopted or foster child who is under age 18, or over age 18 and disabled; or parent, any of whom having a serious heal th condition (parents-in-law are not included). ■
•	A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform essential job functions, ( A serious health condition includes the need for prenatal care, a physical or mental incapacity requiring inpatient, outpatient, hospice or residential medical care, an incapacity requiring absence from work for three or more days and continuing treatment by a health care provider, or continuing medical treatment for a chronic or incurable health condition.)
•	As used above, "serious health condition" shall have the same meaning as under the FMLA.
Twelve Week Maximum Leave Period
Under the FMLA, an employee is entitled to a maximum of 12 weeks of leave in any 12 month period. This means that an employee is entitled to no more than 12 weeks of leave in any roiling 12 month period oftitne. This 12 week leave period can be applied to one or more qualifying events.
In the case where both spouses work for the employer, they are entitled to a total 12 weeks between them following the birth ofa child, for the placement of an adoptive or foster child, or for leave to care for a seriously ill parent. Each spouse remains entitled to a full 12 weeks of leave for his/her own serious health cond ition, or that of a chi Id, or rhe other spouse.
For leaves resulting from the birth, adoption or foster placement o f a child, the leave must be taken within 12 months of such event and must be taken all at once, unless management approves an intermittent or reduced leave schedule (reduced workday or workweek). For all other qualifying events,
167
including a serious health condition of the employee or family member, leave can be taken intermittently and even for less than a day, if necessary as in the case of an employee requiring medical treatment, or on a reduced leave schedulefreduced workday or reduced workweek).	■
Requesting a Leave and Returning to Work
Employees seeking a leave under the FMLA must provide the plant Human Resources Department with notice at least 30 calendar days before the leave if the leave is foreseeable. If the need for such leave is not foreseeable, the employee must provide notice as soon as possible. Such notice must state the reason for the leave, the period for which the leave is requested, and when the leave will begin. Failure to provide the notice tn advance canresult in a postponement ofthe leave.
The Company has the right to verify the reason for the leave by requesting medical certification within 15 calendar days, as well as medical opinions. With respect to the employer's right to verify the need for the leave, if the employer requires a second opinion, it must be at the employer's expense and the health care provider may not be employed by or in a regular contractual relationship with the employer. If the first and second opinions differ, the employer may require a third opinion, also at the employer's expense from a health care provider agreed upon by the employer and employee/union. The third opinion is final and bindingonthepanies. ■	■	.
• In scheduling leaves under the FMLA, employees must make a reasonable effort to schedule medical treatment for themselves and their family members to minimize work disruption. The Company may require that employees furnish periodic reports regarding retum-to-wotk status.
An employee returning from a leave under the FMLA will be reinstated to the same job or an equivalent job with the equi vai ent pay rate and other terms and cond i tions of employ ment, subject toj existing procedures on- retum-to-work medical examinations. However, if an employee's job is
168
eliminated because of a layoff or reduction-in-force while the employee is on leave or when the employee returns, the employee will be placed on layoff pursuant to the applicable Local Agreement.
An employee who fails to return to work at the expiration of a leave under the FMLA will be considered to have resigned employment.
Wages and Benefits While on Leave
The wages of employees will not continue during the leave period. However, employees on leave remain eligible for group health, Life and AD&D insurance benefits pursuant to the provisions of the Budd-UAWNational Insurance Agreement.
Upon an employee's return to work, time spent on leave will be credited towards seniority, up to a maximum of 12 weeks in any 12 month period. Pension accruals for leaves under the FMLA will be determined by the language of the Budd-UAW Consolidated Retirement Benefit Agreement.
An employee may elect to use vacation and PAA benefits provided under the Budd-UAW National Agreement, as part of the leave under the FMLA,
If an employee suffers a disability co vered by the ShortTerm Disability program, all such lime spent away from work will be counted against the employee's 12 week leave maximum under the FMLA.
Local Agreement Issues
The Local Union committee and management at each plant with employees covered by the National Agreement will discuss all Local Agreement issues impacted by the implementation of the FMLA,
169
Certain requests for leave under the FMLA may also be covered by state laws. In such cases, leave taken under the FMLA reduces the length of leave available under applicable federal and state laws.
Employees will be advised of their entitlements under the FMLA. No employee will be subjected to discipline, retaliation or discrimination, as a result of requesting or taking a leave under the FMLA.
Nothing contained in this Memorandum of Agreement on the U.S. Family rind Medical Leave Act is intended to reduce existing contractual benefits. FMLA disputes are subject to rhe grievance procedure contained in the collective bargaining agreement and complaint resolution procedures contained in the benefit agreements.

Dear Ms. Bunn:
During the 1987 contract negotiations, the parties discussed at great length the need for a process by which the Company and the International Union could jointly improve the effectiveness of the committees that have been established under the terms of the National Agreement and discharge other obligations required under the documents accompanying the National Agreement.
In addition, it is the intent of the parties that this process serve as a mechanism for a routine, planned, sharing of information about the business and the markets in which we operate. It is intended to provide an opportunity forthe Company to receive information about its Employees; their accomplishments; problems and needs.
As a result of our discussions, the parties have agreed to esrablisb a National Joint Committee on Qualify and Accountability. This six member Committee will be made up of
171
three (3) representatives from the International Union, UAW-Budd Department, one of whom will be the Vice President and Director of the UAW-Budd Department and three (3) representatives fam the Corporate Human Resources staff, one of whom will be the Vice President of Human Resources. AU members of the joint national committees established under the National Agreement shall be appointed from the membership of the National Joint Committee on Quality and Accountability except where certain members requiring specialized skill or training are specified to be members of a joint national committee. Each party will make available necessary members of their respective organizations who bring specified skills or insights to the Committee.
The National Joint Committee on Quality and Accountability shall meet on a quarterly basis to review Joint National Committee plans and activities and to discuss or review such other matters which have been referred for placement on its agenda.

Dear Ms. Bunn:
During the current contract negotiations, the Company and the Union extensively discussed Quality Assurance, Capital Investments and Employee Training Programs which are designed to maintain and enhance the Company's competitive position and thereby promote job security for all Employees. These discussions produced the following understandings.
The parties reaffirm their belief that job effectiveness and efficient operations producing the highest quality product are the only true source of job security in the supplier industry in which Budd and its UAW-represented Employees participate. Budd and its UAW-represented personnel have a recognized reputation for producing sophisticated, high quality parts. In spite ofthis, during the term of the past agreement, the Company and its people have experienced the loss of significant numbers of jobs to its own customers and to offshore producers' operations which have been newly created in this country. The marketplace promises to
174
become more competitive as a result of our major customers’ cost reduction efforts,
The Company has reaffirmed its commitments to continue efforts to improve the quality of all products and services offered by the Company and its Employees. The parties have agreed to work together to become Quality Leaders in the marketplace by developing, producing and delivering quality products on time at the lowest possible cost. In order to meet this goal and future business challenges, the parties further agree that all Employees should participate in and promote Quality Assurance programs at each of our facilities. The Company commits to continue to provide and enhance quality training activities in all of its facilities. Further, the Company stressed the importance and desirability of seeking Employee and Union suggestions and ideas to support the vitally important goal of continuous quality improvement.
Significant capital investments are forecasted by the Company for each of its facilities. The parties recognize that this capital investment will enhance the Company’s ability to provide quality products at a competitive price through a highly trained workforce, [hiring the negotiations, division management reviewed with the bargainers capital expenditure plans for National Agreement fee i lities. These plans are, of course, subject to business conditions. This forecasted investment is an indication of our firm commitment to keep our plants technologically in step with the markets they must serve.
While these disbursements are forecasted, a significant portion has not yet been budgeted. As we have discussed, and the Union agreed, during this bargaining, forecasts have to be responsive to changed market and business condi tions.
In anticipation of new or advanced technology, methods and processes that may affect the operational effectiveness of our facilities, the Company and Union are jointly committed to
175
encourage and support Employee training and retraining ellbrts that will upgrade the skill level of Budd Employees.

Dear Ms. Bunn:
Laid off Employees from a plant covered by the National Agreement may make application at the Shelbyville Plant by mail. An eligible Employee may obtain an application from his home plant Personnel Department which will also provide the Employee with the address of the Shelbyville Plant. The Employee will be able to take a pre-employment medical examination in the home plant area.
An applicant for employment in Shelbyville will be required to take pre-employment tests and to complete the assessment center process. However, such an applicant shall not be disqualified solely on the basis ofthe tests or assessment center results. The testing and assessment center process is administered jointly by Budd and the State of Kentucky.
In the event that an applicant's prior work history with The Budd Company indicates the applicant will be an unsuitable candidate for employment, the applicant will be notified of such
177
rejection in writing by the Company. Such an applicant may avail himself of the appeal procedure contained in Document No. 8, Preferential Hiring.
Applicants for employment at Shelbyville will be required to complete the pre-employment training administered by the State of Kentucky for The Budd Company. This training is required of all candidates for employment at the Shelbyville facility. The applicant’s lack of success in the training shall not be used by the Company to bar the applicant from employment in Shelbyville, provided the Employee has completed all the segments ofthe pre-employment train ing.

Dear Ms. Bunn:
During the 2000 negotiations, we discussed the possibility of declining employment at National Agreement facilities. We have agreed that in the event new business is not secured, some Employees may have to prepare themselves for subsequent employment. The parties recognize that in this circumstance the determination of job-relatedness under the educational aid program may require liberalization. Therefore, during the term of the 2000 National Agreement, in determining whether educational programs are job-related, programs which qualify the Employee for any job, whether or not with The Budd Company, will be considered job-related. Courses taken for recreation, entertainment or hobby purposes will not be considered job-related.

A & S and Workers Compensation Payment
THE BUDD COMPANY
CORPORATE OFFICES * TROY, MICHIGAN 48007-2601
November 1,2000
Ms. Elizabeth Bunn -
Vice President and Director
UAW-Budd Department
Solidarity House
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, MI 48214
Dear Ms. Bunn;
We have for a considerable period of time been involved in discussions about the Company’s policy tti situations in which an Employee applies for Weekly Accident and Sickness Wage Replacement Benefits or Extended Disability Benefits and indicates on the claim form that the disability is a result of an occupational injury or illness. This letter will communicate a change in die Company's policy.
In the past, in circumstances in which an individual requested Accident and Sickness Benefits or Extended Disability Benefits but insisted the disability was work-related, Company policy has been to deny Accident and Sickness Benefits or Extended Disability Benefits, and in the same circumstances, if the Company believed the Employee had riot suffered a work-connected disability, the Company did not pay Workers’ Compensation. Thus, the Employee received benefits from neither source until such time as die issue of whether or not the disability was work-related was resolved.
181
The Company's obligation to pay Weekly Accident and Sickness Wage Replacement Insurance or Extended Disability Benefits is contractually limited to non-occupational accidental injury or illness unless A & S or EDB is greater than Workers' Compensation payments in which case an A & S or EDB supplemental payment is made. However, without changing any other contractual commitments in regard to such insurance for disabilities which arise on or after November 4, 1991, the Company will follow the procedures described below:
In those cases in which the Employee provides proof of disability and in which the Employee contends his disability arises from an occupational cause but the Company believes that the disability is not work-related, the Company will pay Accident and Sickness Benefits or Extended Disability Benefits provided the Employee first signs an agreement to repay to the Company 100% of any Accident and Sickness Benefits or Extended Disability Benefits received, which would not have been paid except for this policy change, should he subsequently receive Workers' Compensation, Lost Time, Redemption, Settlement or Commutation Benefits for the same time period.
, In the event the law, or any change in the law, prevents 100% recovery of A & S or Extended Disability payments or otherwise makes this policy unworkable or unenforceable, the Company will, after prior notice and discussion with the Union, reinstitute its policy of not making Accident and Sickness or Extended Disability payments to claimants who allege their disability is work-related.	.
To resolve a disputed claim of disability with potential workers compensation liability the parties adopted the following rules in the settlement of National Step Grievance 158-93, Philadelphia,February*), 1995:
When these three conditions are present:
I.	An employee has filed an A & S claim form asserting continuing disability; and
2.	The employee has checked "yes" to answer the question "is this condition due to a work related injury or
182
disease" and has signed the Special Agreement appended to Document No. 29; and
3.	' The Company has taken the position that the
employee is medically able to work;
The A & S claim will be processed for payment in the usual and customary manner.
The Company will schedule a medical examination under Section VTT, C.6.b, of the Insurance Plan in accordance with the procedure contained in Article V, Paragraph (29) 4. and 5. of the National Agreement. Ifthe examination subsequently reveals the employee was medically able to work, the employee shall be returned to work and the employee shall repay the A & S overpayment in accordance with Section XIV, E. of the Insurance Plan.

STATEMENT GF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE BUDD COMPANY AND UAW TO ASSIST EMPLOYEES REPRESENTED BY THE UAW IN RECOVERING FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE
The Budd Company and the International Union express their joint determination to deal cooperatively and constructively with the problem of substance abuse among Budd workers represented by the UAW.
Alcoholism and drug dependency is recognized by medical, public health authorities, The Budd Company and the UAW as a disease. Excessive use of alcohol or other drugs by workers impairs their ability to function, contributes to increased absenteeism and tardiness and the violation of shop rules. This in turn disrupts work schedules with consequent dissatisfaction among the majority of workers who are sincerely trying to do conscientious jobs. The combination of factors is recognized as having a potentially damaging effect on plant efficiency and endangers the job security of the worker.
The causes of alcoholism and drug dependency are not well understood and cures are difficult. Nonetheless, The Budd Company and the UAW believe that constructive measures are possible to deal with the problem which is a major cause of family breakdown and is related io personal breakdown and violence in the cotnununity.
1.	Objective
The objective of this joint effort is to help Employees who become afflicted with alcoholism or drop dependency. Joint effort by The Budd Company and the Internationa) Union is designed to establish a system ^or early identification of these problems in an
188
Employee, referral of the Employee for proper treatment, and concerned followup.
The Budd Company and the International Union acknowledge that neither local management nor the local union working alone can always provide the level of motivation required by the alcoholic or drug dependent Employee. As a result, mutual cooperation is imperative in encouraging the Employee to seek treatment, as needed, to respond successfully to treatment, and Io maintain a resolve to avoid alcohol or drugs following treatment.
II.	Guidelines for Administration
The Budd Company and the International Union will engage in a cooperative effort and function administratively in consulting with and seeking the cooperation of local management and local union personnel. Inthis regard it is important to:
1.	Generate a climate at the plant level which will eliminate the effects of the social stigma associated with alcoholism and drug dependency, which act as a barrier to constructive corrective action;
2.	Encourage the local management and the local union at all levels to exercise their best efforts toward the objective of early identification and motivation of the Employee to seek treatment and rehabilitation;
3.	Assure confidentiality in working with the Employee;
4.	Assure the Employee of a sympathetic understanding of his problem; and
189
hl
5.	Assist in developing educational and informational materials for use at the plant level. These may be supplemented by materials which either The Budd Company or the International Union may wish to issue separately.
Loca I Su bsta nee A buse Co mmittee
The Budd Company and the International Union may respectively designate one representative of local management and one representative ofthe local union to work cooperatively outside the grievance procedure on these problems. Such representative shall incur no loss of pay for time lost from work when such lost time is the result of a request by the Plant Medical Director/Human Resources Manager that such representative perform duties in connection with the responsibilities of the Local Substance Abuse Committee. Among the responsibilities ofthe local committee will be to:
L Survey community resources to determine the availability of appropriate treatment facilities and the cost of treatment. "Where facilities are inadequate or unavailable, undertake efforts to improve the situation.
2.	Develop ways whereby the disease is . identified in its early stages, and whereby the
Employee is encouraged and assisted to obtain treatment without delay. It is recognized that the Employee can be dealt with most effectively on a cooperative management-union basis.
3.	Help the Employee understand that he may consult on a confidential basis with the Plant
, Medical Director or an outside qualified facility or agency, concerning his problem without fear of disciplinary action based on
190
I
such discussion. Information derived solely from such discussions shall not be used by either the Company or the Union in connection with any step of the Grievance Procedure. Information obtained by the Company from other sources such as personnel records, ■ insurance forms and independent investigations shall not be considered confidential within the meaning of this sub-paragraph.
4.	Arrange for the local insurance program administration or a local union representative to be available to explain to the Employee and others who may be involved the extent to which recommended treatment qualifies for payment under the Budd Insurance Program.
The Budd Company and the International Union acknowledge that:
1.	Nothing in this statement is to be interpreted as constituting any waiver of management's responsibility to maintain discipline or the right to invoke disciplinary measures in the case of misconduct which may result from or be associated with the use of alcohol or drugs, the union may exercise its right to process grievances concerning such matters in accordance with the Budd-UAW National Agreement;
2.	During or following treatment the Employee
should not expect any special privileges or exemptions from standard personnel practices; and
191
When a leave of absence is necessary so that , an Employee may undergo medical treatment for alcoholism or drug dependence in or from an appropriate facility in accordance with this program, and when the Employee has voluntarily submitted himself for such treatment and his seniority has not already been broken, he will be granted a sick leave of absence and he will be eligible for benefits in accordance with the Budd Insurance Program as negotiated with the International Union.

Dear Ms. Bunn,
During the term ofthe 1977 National Agreement, the Company and the International Union established several Joint Substance Abuse Recovery Programs on a pilot basis with the cooperation of local Management and local Union personnel. These programs were established in locations where effective treatment facilities and competent and interested personnel at the plant level were available.
The problem of substance abuse is complex and there are many unanswered questions. We believe the pilot programs might help us find these answers. We are willing to continue these programs and to extend them as appropriate in accordance with the attached "Statement of Cooperation Between The Budd Company and UAW to Assist Employees Represented by the UAW in Recovering from Substance Abuse."

Dear Ms. Bunn:
During these negotiations, the Company and the Union have discussed at length and in depth a desire to have the most healthful and safe work place possible, consistent with business requirements.

The Director, UAW-Budd Department, or her designated representative, shall - give written notice to the Company's Manager of Labor Relations appealing the grievance to the National Step grievance procedure within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of the final management decision at the Local level. A good faith attempt to resolve the problems will be made immediately. Furthermore, the Company agrees that the International Union will request the Company to permit its health and safety technician to visit a plant to investigate the grievance with the understanding that such technician will promptly thereafter supply to The Budd Company Human Resources Department a written report of his findings concerning the grievance. Arrangements for visits and suitable escort will be made between the International Union and The Budd Company Corporate Human Resources Department. Within ten (10) days of the receipt by the Company of the written report of the technician's findings, a National Step grievance meeting will be scheduled and thereafter the grievance shall be processed in accordancewith the provisions of ArticleIX ofthis Agreement.
It is expected that the Union will encourage its members to adopt and maintain healthful work habits in all areas and to work safely as instructed by their supervisors and/or the Safety Departments.

Clear Ms. Bunn:
During the current national negotiations the parties discussed at length the concern both the Company and the UAW have for assuring reasonably safe and healthful working conditions for Employees during their working hours. Tothis end, it was acknowledged that current contractual commitments and other arrangements are satisfactory for dealing with local health and safety issues. In these same discussions it was concluded that it may; be desirable for the parties to meet periodically at the national level to discuss matters ofmutual interest which pertain to Employee health and safety.
Accordingly, this letter will confirm the Company's willingness to meet from time to time upon request of the UAW-Budd Department to discuss such matters.
Among those matters that would be appropriate for discussion in such meetings would be significant developments of a mutual interest in the health and safety fields, changes in the
196
Company's health and safety programs due to legal requirements or Company policy revisions, and review ofthe meaningful injury and illness experience ofthe Company's plants.
In addition, we assured you that the arrangements we have made in the past for professional health and safety representatives of the Internationa) Union to visit Company plants in con nection w ith particular health and safety problems would be continued.

Dear Ms. Bunn:
During the current negotiations the parties discussed the Company's program with respect to periodic safety talks with Employees. These talks which are usually conducted by members of plant supervision serve the purpose of reminding Employees of the importance of safe work practices and encourages awareness to potential hazards in the workplace. Both parties share the view that conditions, equipment and processes differ by plant and that safety talks must of necessity be handled on a plant-by-plant basis.
The parties are aware that many individual plants and divisions have developed safety talk procedures which are effective in their design and manner of presentation and which in some cases, make use of recording and Other mechanical devices. The review of these programs is a proper subject for discuss ion by
198
the National Committee so that this information may be communicated io other Budd plants for their evaluation.

DearMs. Bunn:
During the 2000 negotiations, the Company and the Union agreed that the continuing problem of Employee absenteeism must be addressed in a cooperative and constructive manner. The parties recognized that high levels of absenteeism are disruptive to plant performance and efficiency and have a detrimental effect on the responsible majority of Employees who report for work on a regular basis.
The parties agreed that they have a joint responsibility to provide positive leadership on this matter.	'
The parties also agreed that an Employee has the responsibility to attend work regularly in return for the benefits of employment and security afforded by the Budd-UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement.

Dear Ms. Bunn:
When a grievance which does not involve the application or interpretation of the National Agreement, but only involves application or interpretation of a clause^) of a Local Agreement has progressed through the local grievance procedure to a point where it may be appealed to arbitration, the local procedure notwithstanding, it may be appealed to the Permanent Arbitrator serving under this National Agreement who shall then serve as arbitrator for the case. In such case all procedural matters in connection with the arbitration contained in the Local Agreement (such as time limits, witness pay, etc.) shall be observed except for the appeal to and selection of the Permanent Arbitrator already provided for in this paragraph.
Where the parties have an agreed on local procedure for expedited arbitration, or in any unusual case which the parties
208
agree locally should be handled as an expedited arbitration case, including discipline and discharge cases, the parties shall select a mutually agreed on arbitrator if the Permanent Arbitrator is unable to meet the time limits imposed by such expedited procedure.

DearMs.Bunn:
I
During these contract negotiations, the Company and the Union have discussed at length the subject of subcontracting 1 skilled maintenance work and the disputes that have arisen in connection therewith. The following is a statement of the Company's policy in this area.
While we do not have the equipment or personnel to do all the skilled maintenance work in our plants, it is our intent and desire to utilize our own skilled maintenance Employees to do the kind of work they have customarily done in our plants in the past, to the extent that it is practicable and economical to do so.
The decision as to whether a given project can be done by our Employees or subcontracted, shall he made by Management upon the basis of a sound judgment giving full consideration in the application of our policy, to the economic and practical consequences, such as, the requirements to meet production schedules, model changes, timetables for plant rearrangement or installation of equipment as well as the necessity to contract our work requiring specialized tools or equipment or special skill, and the necessity for the installation of
212
equipment by vendors as a condition of guaranteeing proper performance.
The Company will provide advance notice in writing, except where lime and circumstances prevent it, to the local union ofthe Company's plan to let a particular contract involving skilled maintenance and construction work. The written notice will describe the project's general nature, scope (including estimated trades and manpower involved), the approximate dates within which the work is expected to be performed, and why the service of an outside contractor is being contemplated. At such times, Company representatives are expected to afford the Union an opportunity to comment on the Company's plans and to give appropriate weight to those comments in the light of all attendant circumstances. It is expected that the local union representative consulted will reply in a prompt and timely manner. ■ .	• ■.
The application of this policy shall not affect any contract agreements presently in effect at any local plant if it has been agreed to continue such agreement under the new Local Collective Bargaining Agreement.
In the event of disputes ari sing in the appl ication of thi s policy, the facts should be reviewed promptly between proper representatives of the Company and the Union and if necessary the matter may be the subject of the grievance procedure.

UAW-Budd Department

Dear Ms. Bunn:
You have discussed with us at great length the possible effect on our skilled tool and die Employees (including patternmakers) of decisions of the Company to buy some of its tools and dies, rather than make them.
As we have pointed out to you in current negotiations, there are many and varied factors that may influence any particular decisions to make or buy. We do not believe it is feasible to list general criteria. However, the Union has stated in our discussions that it recognizes a number of them, such as the need, among other things, to contract work that requires specialized tools and equipment and special skills and the necessity of meeting production schedules, /model changes and rearrangement deadlines.
In view of the foregoing, we have advised you that the Company cannot agree to any limitations or restriction on its right and responsibility to decide whether to make tools, dies and patterns or to buy them. However, we wish to make it clear to you that it
214
is our policy, in making such decisions, to give proper consideration to the operating needs of the business, the efficiencies and economics involved and all other relevant considerations, including the effect the decisions on work opportunities of tool, die and patternmaker Employees.
Where the Company considers that work practices or provisions of local agreements in its Tool, Die (including Pattemmaking) Departments may be having an adverse effect on the Company's ability to compete in this field effectively, it will discuss such matters on a timely basis with the Local Union and explore with it fully the possibilities of taking practical steps with respect to such matters to the end of improving the employment opportunities of such Employees.
In the event that a decision is being contemplated to place work covered by this letter outside, local management will, except where time and circumstances prevent it, have advance discussion with local union representatives concerning the nature, scope and approximate dates of the work to be performed and the reasons why management is contemplating utilizing a non-Company source. At such times, Company representatives are expected to afford the Union an opportunity to comment on the Company's plans and to give appropriate weight to those comments in the light of all attendant circumstances. It is expected that the local union representative consulted will reply in a prompt and t imely manner.
At each plant, the manager responsible for the tool room (Tool & Die Plant at Philadelphia) will meet with the designated union representative on a monthly basis to discuss, and provide information relative to, plans the Company is formulating and decisions it is contemplating concerning tool, die and pattern contracting on a plant basis.
For purposes of this letter only, wherever used herein, the term "tool and die Employees" shall be deemed to include skilled jig and fixture Employees and the term "tools and dies" shall be deemed to include jigs and fixtures.
In the event of disputes arising in the application of this policy, the facts should be reviewed promptly between proper
215
representatives of the Company and the Union and if necessary the matter may be the sub) ect of the grievance procedure.

During the 2000 negotiations, the parties discussed the necessity to keep local union o fficials apprised of product plans for their facility and the impact of those plans on their membership. There was agreement that advance knowledge of changing product plans and their impact upon the work force is beneficial to our relationship. During the term of the 1991 agreement, the National Joint Committee on Quality and Accountability met several times to review the Company's product plans. It is anticipated that such meetings will continue during the term of the 2000 agreement. However, the parties recognize that additional communication is necessary at the plant level.
The president ofthe Stamping and Frame Division will meet with local union officials in their division not less than twice each yearduring the term ofthis agreement to discuss product plans and (heir impact on employmentat the plant. Special emphasis will be given to assessing the impact
217
of product plans on employment. In addition, they will discuss with local union leadership product opportunities which may be placed outside the plant for business reasons that include situations where the plant is not capable or competitive in the particular product. The objecti ve of such discussions will be to encourage plant personnel to seek ways of securing or retaining work. Local plant management will meet with local Union officials on product planning matters as required.

Dear Ms, Bunn:
During the recently concluded negotiations, we discussed at length the problems attendant to ineffective communication in regard to the subject of outside contracting of skilled maintenance work or tool, die and pattern contracting. As a result of those discussions, the President of the Stamping and Frame Division of the Company has agreed to send the following letter to the plant managers of plants covered by the National Agreement:
"During the 1995 contract negotiations, the Union explained to the Company that significant problems were experienced with outside contracting at some point during the term ofthe 1991. labor agreement. In many of the instances to which it refers, the root cause of the problem was lack of effective communication. The spirit of the commitments made by the Company in the Budd-UAW
219
National Agreement requires timely comm unication in advance of decisions to subcontract work covered by Document Nos. 41 and^Zofthe Agreement."
"The Division intends to achieve worldwide competitive status utilizing not only the skills of our Employees but also the suggestions and -ideas of the people and the Unions as to how work can best be accomplished at the lowest possible cost with the highest possible quality and on time.
This approach to managing the business should 1 be used throughout the Division at all levels: production, skilled and technical. Obviously, discussions about outside contracting should be held in a timely manner with appropriate Union and Management personnel to be consistent with this approach.
There are numerous examples where complete, advance communication with the Union and the skilled trades Employees has resulted in important projects being completed on a competitive basis in terms of quality, cost and timeliness. The result has been a feeling of pride of accomplishment shared by the Union, Employees and Management.
Plant relationships can only be improved by open, frank communications in all areas, particularly in cany ing out our outside contract ing responsibi lities.
1 am requesting that you give extraordinary attention to your responsibilities in this area and that you require the same of those in your organization who have responsibilities in this area."
220
As indicated during our negotiations, we are jointly committed to improving this communications process. The active support expressed in the above letter will, I am confident, provide a good start for this improvement effort which wilt be monitored by the National Joint Committee on Quality and Accountability.

Dear Ms. Bunn:
During the 2000 negotiations, we spoke at length about the potential impact of plant make or buy decisions on the jobs of skilled maintenance Employees. We agree we should utilize the ideas and talents of our people to the maximum possible advantage in our efforts to improve plant operations. We also agreed that input from the Union or Employees can often provide information that is needed to assure the best plant make or buy decision is made.
Over the many years of our joint relationship, plant personnel and equipment capabilities have changed significantly. The price and availability of maintenance materials changes frequently. New materials and methods become available virtually daily. Plant operations often dictate immediate needs for maintenance materials. Manpower is not always available in the time frame in which the maintenance materials must be obtained. These are but a few of the many factors which influence the plant
222
decision to make or buy materials for use by our skilled maintenance Employees.
In general it is our policy to utilize our skilled maintenance Employees to produce maintenance materials regularly and routinely fabricated by them in the past to the extent it is sound business practice and provided they ate available, possess needed skills and equipment and can do work competitively in quality, cost and time. At times the Company does not deem it advisable doing the work itself, and it must, as in the past, reserve to itself the right to decide whether it will make or buy any particu lar item of maintenance material.
To secure the desired Employee input, Management will meet with local union representatives at least monthly, if requested.
While the provisions of this letter are not subject to the grievance procedure, any disagreements may be considered by the National Joint Committee on Quality and Accountability.

No Employee who receives any Regular Benefit or Separation Payment shall for that reason be deemed an Employee of the Company during such period, and he shall not thereby accrue any greater right to participate in, accrue credits or receive benefits under any other Employee benefit plan to which the Company contributes than he would if he were not receiving such Regular Benefit or Separation Payment. ’

Dear Ms. Bunn;
During these negotiations, the Union indicated that under certain conditions the time limits for filing SUB claims may be inadequate since Employees may not have received a State System Benefit within 60 days after the end of the Week for which an application is made fora Regular Benefit.
Currently, there is no requirement under the Plan that an Employee must have received a State System Benefit for a Week prior to filing a SUB claim forthat Week. Company offices which process SUB applications will be advised that Employees are not required to have received a State System Benefit to file a SUB claim and applications should be accepted from Employees who wish to file such claims to meet the time limits under the Plan.
319
Such claims will be retained for three months by the facility and no determination will be made regarding the Employee’s entitlement to such Benefit until the Employee furnishes the information required by Article V, Section 1(b)(2) of the Plan.

Dear Ms. Bunn:
During the current national negotiations the Union expressed some concern regarding a possible interpretation ofthe provisions of Article I, Section 3(bX4K0 of the SUB Plan which could result in denying a Benefit to an otherwise eligible Employee who is claiming a benefit under a Workers' Compensation law while not totally disabled. This is to advise you that the provisions of Article I, Section 3(bX4Xi) ofthe Plan will not be interpreted to disqualify an Employee on layoff from Benefits solely because he is eligible for or claiming a permanent partial or scheduled loss benefit under a Workers' Compensation law or other law providing benefits for occupational injury or disease so long as the iryury or disease does not prevent die Employee from working.

Dear Ms. Bunn:
The 2000 Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan does not provide for the payment of Separation Payments to Employees who are terminated at or after age 60, and who are not eligible for retirement benefits under the Retirement Plan established by agreement between the Company and the Union. The arrangement described below, therefore, is hereby adopted with respect to such Employees. Any term which is defined in the Plan and which is used in this letter shall have the same meaning in this letter as it has in the Plan.
An Employee who is terminated at or after age 60, who had one or more years of seniority on the last day he was on the active employment toll, who is not eligible for a Separation Payment under Section 1 a. of Article IV ofthe Plan, and who does not have the requisite years of credited service for eligibility under said Retirement Plan, will receive a lump sum payment in the same amount and on the same basis that would apply if Section 1 a. of Article IV of the Plan were applicable, except that Section 1 f. thereof and the requirement that Seniority be unbroken on the date application is made shall not apply. Notwithstanding any possible implication to the contrary, the
322
Employee shall make application within 24 months from the date of his termination.
Lump sum payments which may become payable under this letter agreement will be paid by the Company. Company contributions required under Section 5 of Article VII of the Plan shall be reduced by any lump sum payments paid hereunder. 1 fcontributions are not required under the Plan for any period, or if the contributions required are less than the amounts to be offset, then any subsequently required contributions shall be reduced by the amount of lump sum payments not previously offset against contributions. The amount of lump sum payments which could not be offset against contributions will be deducted from the market value of assets in the Fund in determining the Trust Fund Position under Section 3 of Article VII of the Plan and in determining whether the fund equals or exceeds Maximum funding under Section 2 of Article Vil.

Dear Ms. Bunn:
During these negotiations, the Union indicated that under certain conditions the time limits for filing SUB claims may be inadequate since Employees may not have received a State System Benefit within 60 days after the end of the Week for which an application is made fora Regular Benefit.

Dear Ms. Bunn:
During the current national negotiations the Union expressed some concern regarding a possible interpretation ofthe provisions of Article V, Section 2,b.5. of the SUB Plan which could result in denying a Benefit to an otherwise eligible Employee who is claiming a benefit under a Workers' Compensation law while not totally disabled. This is to advise you that the provisions of Article V, Section 2 .b,5. of the Plan will not be interpreted to disqualify an Employee on layoff from Benefits solely because he isetigible furor claiming a permanent partial or scheduled Joss benefit under a Workers' Compensation law or other law providing benefits for occupational injury or disease so long as the injury or disease does not prevent the Employee from working.
Very truly yours,
