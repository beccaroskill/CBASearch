EXHIBIT III
PROCESS FOR LAYOFF DISPUTE RESOLUTIONS
In lieu of the traditional process for handling grievances, the following process is recommended for handling specified disputes related to the layoff process.
Step One: Research and Discovery
1.	Employee contacts Human Resources regarding concern. Employee fills out a form describing issue and requesting research.
2.	Human Resources researches concern, and, based on data, makes a decision.
Step Two: Review and Resolution
If the employee is not satisfied with Human Resources’ ruling, and the issue is appealable through the dispute process, the employee can request an additional review by the Director of Employee Relations or designee and a Union Representative (Business Agent or high ranking Officer).
1.	Employee contacts their Union regarding the concern.
2.	The Union notifies Employee Relations of the situation.
3.	Employee Relations schedules a meeting date in Human Resources to review documents in question.
4.	The Director of Employee Relations or designee, Union Representative and employee meet in the Human Resources Department to review documents. An Human Resources representative is available for background and information.
5.	Based on data, and after discussion and consultation the Union representative, the Director of Employee Relations or designee makes a bench decision. If the Union does not agree with the decision, the issue can continue through the dispute process and appeal may be filed to Step 3.
Step Three: Appeal Process
If the employee is still not satisfied, and the issue is appealable through the dispute process, the employee can appeal to a Review Board. The Review Board is comprised of:
•	Director of Employee Relations or one designee.
•	One Union Representative - Business Agent or high ranking Officer (one from each affected Union).
•	One Outside Neutral Party (same individual for all cases to ensure consistency).
The outside neutral party will decide the final ruling only if the Director of Employee Relations or designee and Union Representative have opposing positions. All Review Board rulings are final.
1.	Employee contacts Union regarding appeal.
2.	Union notifies Employee Relations of situation.
3.	Employee Relations schedules hearing date with outside neutral party.
4.	Employee presents their case to the Review Board.
5.	Human Resources presents their case to the Review Board.
6.	Review Board hears testimony, reviews document, and makes a final bench decision.
