INTRODUCTION
The management of Guide Corporation recognizes that it cannot get along without labor any more than labor can get along without the management. Both are in the same business and the success of that business is vital to all concerned. This requires that both management and the employees work together to the end that the quality and cost of the product will prove increasingly satisfactory and attractive so that the business will be continuously successful.
Guide Corporation holds that the basic interests of employers and employees are the same. However, at times employees and the management have different ideas on various matters affecting their relationship. The management of Guide Corporation is convinced that there is no reason why these differences cannot be peacefully and satisfactorily adjusted by sincere and patient effort on both sides.
PREFACE
Guide Corporation and the UAW recognize their respective responsibilities under federal, state, and local laws relating to fair employment practices.
The Company and the Union recognize the moral principles involved in the area of civil rights and have reaffirmed in their Collective Bargaining Agreement their commitment not to discriminate because of age, race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability or sexual orientation.
AGREEMENT
Entered into this 21st day of March, 2004, between Guide Corporation, hereinafter referred to as the Corporation, and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, hereinafter referred to as the Union, as representing the production and maintenance employees and the mechanical employees in engineering shops in certain of the Corporation’s plants.
RECOGNITION

(2)	In case the UAW shall be certified as the bargaining representative for any additional bargaining units, or if recognition is extended without formal certification, the matter of including such unit under the terms of this Agreement shall be negotiated between the Industrial Relations Department of the Corporation and the International Officers of the Union; it being understood that plants producing automotive parts similar to the material now being produced by plants covered by this Agreement, shall be included after giving due consideration to any local wage classifications, rates, understandings or practices as may exist.
1

<4j> A properly executed copy of such “Authorization For Check-Off Of Dues” form for each employee for whom Union membership dues are to be deducted hereunder, shall be completed by the employee and submitted to the Local Management before any dues deductions are made, except as to employees whose authorizations have heretofore been delivered to Local Management. Deductions shall be made thereafter, only under the applicable “Authorization For Check-Off Of Dues” forms which have been properly executed and are in effect. Local Management shall deliver to the Local Union an “Application for Membership” form for each employee for whom Union membership dues are to be deducted under the provisions of the Check-Off except as to employees whose authorizations have heretofore been delivered.
[Sec Par. (4d)J
(4k) Check-Off deductions under all properly executed “Authorizations For Check-Off Of Dues” forms which have been delivered to the
7
respective Local Managements on or before the effective date of this Agreement, shall begin with the first month following the effective date of this Agreement,
[See Doc, 8] [SeeCSAtfll]
(41) The initial monthly dues deduction from the pay of an employee who completes an “Authorizations For Check-Off Of Dues" form shall be made from the second pay received by the employee following the date on which the authorization was executed. It shall be presumed that employees owe initiation fees, unless they had previously executed an “Authorizations For CheckOff Of Dues" form at that plant, and such initiation fees will be deducted simultaneously with the initial deduction as specified tn this paragraph. Thereafter, the Union membership dues for each succeeding calendar month shall be deducted as follows:
[See Par. (4d)]
(4IXa) The deduction for monthly dues will be made from the first pay received following the first payroll period ending in the calendar month. All payroll periods ending in a calendar month will constitute, in the aggregate, the dues deduction month. Regular monthly dues and past dues or initiation fees, if any, will be deducted provided the employee has sufficient net earnings to cover the deductions. In the event there are insufficient net earnings, the deductions will be made from the
8
subsequent pay or Regular Benefit received by the employee that is sufficient to cover the deductions. Any liability will be carried forward until the employee has sufficient net earnings to cover the deduction or breaks seniority, whichever occurs first. However, deductions will only be made from Regular Benefits provided the employee has an applicable “Authorization For Check-Off Of Dues” form in effect as of the date the deduction is made. In the event an employee has a past dues or initiation fee liability and receives a payment for the unused portion of Vacation Entitlement, such liability may be deducted from such payments.
(4l)(b) The dues deducted from an employee’s earnings will be a sum equivalent to two (2) hours straight time pay and will be based upon the employee’s hourly wage rate including cost of living allowance but excluding all other premiums for the job classification of record held by the employee during the pay period to which the deduction applies.
In the event of a retroactive change in an employee’s job classification of record for the pay period in which dues have been deducted, there will be no retroactive adjustment in the check-off of Union membership dues.
(4l)(e) The amount deducted from an employee’s pay pursuant to these provisions shall be in addition to an amount which may be authorized by a Local Union pursuant to the Constitution and By
9
Laws of the Union and of which the Local Union has given notice to Local Management.
(41)(f) In the event an employee does not receive a paycheck for a payroll period ending in a dues deduction month prior to the receipt of a Regular Benefit applicable to any such period, union dues in the amount of five dollars ($5.00) or such other amount as may be established as dues shall be deducted from the Regular Benefit, provided the employee has the applicable “Authorizations For Check-Off Of Dues” form in effect as of the date the deduction is made. In the event such an employee subsequently receives a paycheck for a payroll period ending in the same dues deduction month, the difference between the amount of union dues paid and the amount then owing will be deducted from such paycheck.
(4m) In the case of employees rehired, or returning to work after layoff or leave of absence, or being transferred back into the bargaining unit, who previously have properly executed “Authorizations For Check-Off Of Dues” forms, deductions will be made for membership dues as provided herein.
(4n) In cases where a deduction is made which duplicates a payment already made to the Union by an employee, or where a deduction is not in conformity with the provisions of the Union Constitution and By-Laws, refunds to the employee will be made by the Local Union,
10
r
[See Par. (4o),(4p),(4q)J
(4o) Dues deductions shall be remitted to the designated financial officer of the Local Union once each month as soon as available but no later than 10 days after the regular deduction date. Any deductions made from subsequent payrolls or from Regular Benefits paid during payroll periods that end in the calendar month shall be included with the remittance for the following month. Local Management shall furnish the designated financial officer of the Local Union, monthly, with the names, social security numbers, department numbers and clock numbers of those for whom deductions have been made, the amounts of the deductions and the amounts deducted, by employee and in total, respectively, for initiation fees, regular monthly dues, and S U B. dues. Regular monthly dues and S.U.B. dues shall be identified as to the period to which such deductions apply. This information should be furnished along with the dues remittance. The designated financial officer will be advised of the order in which the names wifi be listed and of any future changes in the order of the listing as far in advance as possible. The foregoing notwithstanding, deductions made on a declining balance basis, deductions of a past dues or initiation fee liability from a Regular Benefit and deductions from pay for a liability incurred more than six (6) months prior to the actual deduction date will not be identified to a specific deduction month.
11
[See Par. (44), (4n>[ [See Doc. 8,9 J
(4p) Any dispute which may arise as to whether or not an employee properly executed or properly revoked an “Authorizations For Check-Off Of Dues’’ form, shall be reviewed with the employee by a representative of the Local Union and a representative of Local Management. Should this review not dispose of the matter, the dispute may be referred to the Arbitrator, whose decision shall be final and binding on the employee, the Union and the Corporation. Until the matter is disposed of no further deductions shall be made.
[See Par. (4n)[
(4q) Neither the Corporation nor the Trustee of the Guide-UAW Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan Fund shall be liable to the International Union or its locals by reason of the requirements of this Section for the remittance or payment of any sum other than that constituting actual deductions made from employee wages earned or from Regular Benefits received.
[See Par. (4n)j
fSeeCSA#6]	■
(4r) In the event net earnings are sufficient to cover union membership dues for only one dues deduction month and an employee has a dues liability for more than one (I) month, the deduction will be for the current dues deduction
12
month. In such situations membership dues for the past dues liability will be deducted from the next earnings received in that month or in a succeeding month in which the employee has sufficient net earnings to cover such union membership dues.
[See Par. (4d)]
(4s) In the event an employee receives a back pay settlement or award for any calendar month for which no dues deduction has been made, a deduction for each such month shall be made from such settlement or award.
[See Doc. 8]
(5)	The purpose of this Agreement is to provide orderly collective bargaining relations between the Corporation and the Union, to secure a prompt and fair disposition of grievances, to eliminate interruptions of work and interference with the efficient operation of the Corporation’s business.
[See Par. (19).(34)]
[See Doc. 1,26]
(5a) If either party at a particular location believes that the provisions of this Agreement are being administered in a manner inconsistent with orderly collective bargaining relations, the circumstances will be discussed between the designated representative of local Management and the Chairperson of the Shop Committee in an effort to resolve the problem. If the problem is not resolved locally, it will be reviewed by
13
the Corporation’s Vice President of Industrial Relations and a representative of the Guide Department of the International Union. If the problem is not resolved after exhausting the above procedure, the Corporation's Executive Vice President of Human Resources or the Director of the Guide Department of the International Union may request, in writing, a meeting of their designated representatives to discuss the problem and take appropriate action.
[See Par.(88),(2l5)]
(6)	The Corporation will not interfere with, restrain or coerce employees because of membership or lawful activity in theUnion, nor will it by discrimination in respect to hire, tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment, attempt to discourage membership in the Union,
(6a) It is the policy of Guide Corporation and the UAW that the provisions of this Agreement be applied to all employees covered by this Agreement without discrimination based on age, race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability or sexual orientation as required by appropriate state and federal law. Any claims of violation of this policy, claims of sexual harassment or of any laws regarding discrimination or harassment on account of disability may be taken up as a grievance.
When a grievance containing a claim of violation of this paragraph is appealed to the Shop Committee the Chairperson of the Shop Committee
14
may refer the claim to a designated member of the Civil Rights Committee of the Local Union for a factual investigation and report. Neither the Chairperson of the Civil Rights Committee, nor the member of the committee that the Chairperson may designate to investigate such a claim in the Chairperson’s place, shall receive pay from the Corporation based solely on any activity arising pursuant to this paragraph.
The grievance and arbitration procedure shall be the exclusive contractual procedure for remedying such discrimination claims.
[See Par. (37)]
[See Doc. 13,14,15,16,52,57]
(7)	The Union agrees that neither the Union nor its members will intimidate or coerce employees in respect to their right to work or in respect to Union activity or membership, and further that there shall be no solicitation of employees for Union membership or dues during working time. The Union further agrees that the Corporation shall take disciplinary action for any violations of this provision.
(8)	The right to hire; promote; discharge or discipline for cause; and to maintain discipline and efficiency of employees, is the sole responsibility of the Corporation except that Union members shall not be discriminated against as such. In addition, the products to be manufactured, the location of the plants, the schedules of production, the
15
methods, processes and means of manufacturing are solely and exclusively the responsibility of the Corporation.
REPRESENTATION
(9)	The Union shall be represented in each bargaining unit as follows:
In the ratio of not to exceed one district committeeperson for each two hundred and fifty employees covered by this Agreement.
District Committeepersons
(10)	Each bargaining unit will be districted by agreement between the local Plant Management and the Shop Committee so that insofar as practicable each district on each shift shall contain approximately two hundred and fifty employees. Each committeeperson shall have a definitely defined district. The members of the Union in each such district shall select a committeeperson who is working in that district to represent the employees in that district. An alternate district committeeperson in each district, whose duties shall be the same as those of the regular district committeeperson for that district while the regular committeeperson is absent from the plant, may be selected by the members of the Union. The total number of employees receiving a regular payroll check for work performed (plus employees who did not receive a regular payroll
16
check who are on an approved vacation or leave of absence pursuant to Paragraphs 103 and 109 - short term) during a week representative of normal operations, mutually selected by the Plant Management and Shop Committee, will be the number used for redistricting. Plants shall be redistricted not more frequently than at six-month intervals, upon request of either the Plant Management or Shop Committee, when there is a change in the number of employees equal to two hundred and fifty or five percent, whichever is greater. Thereafter, redistricting shall be accomplished within twenty working days of such request

Meetings of Shop Committees
(15)	Each plant shall have a regularly scheduled meeting between representatives of the Local Management and the Shop Committee weekly, unless otherwise agreed between the Local Management and the Shop Committee to extend the time between meetings, at a time to be mutually agreed upon between the Committee and the Local Management. Emergency meetings will be arranged by mutual agreement. Regularly scheduled meetings should not be cancelled or rescheduled except where necessary.

(2)	Other legitimate representation functions are defined as normal in-plant
20
activities pertaining to the administration of the National Agreement and written local agreements including, but not limited to, participation in joint programs such as health and safety programs, product quality initiatives, skill development activities, etc.; and, provided such activities do not interfere with the work of other employees, supervision or the efficiency of operations.
(3)	Or in another zone when designated by the Chairperson if the regular Zone Committeeperson for that Zone is absent from the plant.
(4)	Shop Committeepersons attending Management-Shop Committee meetings on shifts other than their regular shift will be paid for time spent in such meetings, with the understanding that their total hours paid for the day in question will not exceed their regularly scheduled shift hours for that day and such changes in shift hours for this purpose will not result in the payment of overtime	premium	[pursuant to
Paragraph	(85)(a)].	It is further
understood that the above will not result in any increase in representation being furnished as a result of the Zone
21
Committecpersons not working a full shift on their regular shift.
[See App. 1]
(17)	Individuals shall not be eligible to serve as committeepersons unless they are employees and until their names have been placed on the seniority list and they are working in the plant.
[See App. I] [See Doc. 2]
(18)	It is mutually agreed that the prompt adjustment of grievances is desirable in the interest of sound relations between the employees and the Management.
[See Par. (5),(34)J [See App. 1] [See Doc. 1,26)
(19)	The prompt and fair disposition of grievances involves important and equal obligations and responsibilities, both joint and independent, on the part of representatives of each party to protect and preserve the grievance procedure as an orderly means of resolving legitimate grievances.
Committeepersons acting properly in their official capacity should be free from orders by supervision which, if carried out, would impair the orderly investigation and presentation of grievances.
22
Actions which tend to impair or weaken the grievance procedure, whenever they occur or in whatever manner or form, are improper.
Committeepersons have a responsibility to the Union and the employees they represent to conduct themselves in a businesslike manner and shaft conform to the shop rules. The normal standard of conduct applicable to all employees shall be applied to committeepersons.
[See Par. (5)]
[See Doc. 2]
(20)	Upon entering a department in the fulfillment of their duties, committeepersons shall notify the supervisor of that department of their presence and purpose or give the supervisor a copy of the written complaint if one has not already been provided.
(20a) In the event an employee requests representation prior to being notified of a temporary transfer to another district, the coinmitteeperson for the employee’s regular district may respond to the request, providing the districts involved are in reasonable proximity and there is no change of shift.

23
1.	AH regular hours up to eight that their district is scheduled to operate, on their respective shifts.
2.	Other than regular hours (including overtime, part time or temporary layoffs, shutdown for model change, inventory or plant rearrangement) when ten (10) or more of the people they normally represent are working in their district on their respective shift. Employees on continuous seven-day operations or operations manned by rotating or alternating shifts will not be considered in applying this provision

[See Poc. 2J
(21a) The shift starting and ending time for committeepersons will be the starting and ending time of the majority of the employees they represent. The provisions of this Representation Section do not require that Committeepersons be called earlier than
24
their regular starting times because some employees in their districts start work earlier than their starting times or be given overtime when some employees in their districts start and quit later than their regular shift hours.
[Sec Doc. 2]
(21c) In the event of a reduction in force:
Committeepersons (including Chairpersons of Shop Committees and District Committeepersons) shall be retained regardless of seniority as long as any employees whom they represent are retained at work in their district.

[See Doc. 2]
(22a) Committeepersons shall establish a regular rate equal to their regular straight time hourly rate, as of the time they assumed their duties as Com mi tt eeperso ns.
This rate shall be adjusted in accordance with any adjustments made in the rate for the classification the Committeeperson then held.
When provisions of the Local Seniority Agreement entitle committeepersons to return to their former groups on higher rated jobs, their rates will be adjusted in accordance with such provisions. Also Committeepersons are eligible for promotion to higher rated jobs in their District provided they are the most senior applicant and they are capable of doing the job.
[See Doc. 2]
(22b) All Committeepersons shall ring in and out, or otherwise account for their time, in the manner required by the Local Management.

Job Status - Local Union Officials
(23)	The President, one Vice-President, the Local Union Benefit Representative(s), the two union Local Apprentice Committee members and the Local Joint Programs Representatives provided for in Document No. 24 shall, at the point where they would be subject to layoff from the plant in a reduction in force, be retained at work in the plant regardless of their seniority, provided they can do a job that is operating. This will not apply in cases of temporary layoffs for model change, inventory, material shortages, machine breakdowns, etc.
[See Doc. 2,24]
(24)	Committeepersons shall be governed by the local plant rules regarding employees entering and leaving the plant. However, members of the Shop Committee and local Union Presidents may leave the plant on Union business when arrangements are made as far in advance as possible with the Plant Management by the President of the Local Union, Chairperson of the Shop Committee or International Representative. It is understood that Chairpersons will be replaced for absences greater than two full days.
[Sec Doc. 2,37]
(24a) Chairpersons of Shop Committees will be permitted to leave the plant and will be paid
27
I
their regular rates for up to six (6) hours per day Monday through Friday while they are out of the plant in the performance of legitimate representation functions during straight time hours when they would otherwise be entitled to be in the plant for representation purposes. They shall notify the designated Management representative, if available, when leaving and returning to the plant during working hours.
(25)	The names of the committeepersons and alternate committeepersons in each district and the names of the committeepersons constituting the Shop Committee shall be given in writing to the Local Management. No committeepersons shall function as such until the Local Management has been advised of their selection, in writing, by the officers of the Local Union, Chairperson of the Shop Committee, or an International Officer. Any changes in committeepersons shall be reported to the Local Management in writing as far in advance as possible.
(26)	International Executive Officers of the Union, or their representatives, duly authorized to represent the International Union at Shop Committee meetings, or the President of the Local Union, will be permitted to attend meetings between the Shop Committee and the Management of any plant. Presidents of Local Unions who work in the plant and are not Shop Committeepersons may attend Shop Committee meetings in that plant and will be paid their regular rates for time spent in such meetings for
28
the hours they would otherwise have worked in the plant. The Plant Manager, or designated representative, shall not be requested to meet with more than two such representatives, whose names must have been submitted previously to the Corporation and who must be prepared to show proper credentials. Written request will be given to Plant Management at least twenty-four (24) hours before each meeting in all cases covered by this paragraph.
(27)	Committeepersons	having
individual grievances in connection with their own work may ask for a member of the Shop Committee to assist them in adjusting the grievance with their respective supervisors.
[See Doc. 2]
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Step One. Presentation of Grievance to Supervisor
(28)	Any employee having a grievance, or one designated member of a group having a grievance, should first take the grievance up with the supervisor who will attempt to adjust it.
[See Par, (224)]
(29)	Any employee may request the supervisor to call the committeeperson for that district to handle a specified grievance with the
29
l
supervisor. The supervisor will send for the conimitteeperson without undue delay and without further discussion of the grievance.
(See Par, (20a)] [See App. 1] [SeeDoc, l,2-Sec,IV]
(30)	If the grievance is not adjusted by the supervisor, it shall be reduced to writing on forms provided by the Corporation, and signed by the employee involved and one copy shall be given to the supervisor. The committeeperson shall then take the grievance up with higher supervision with or without another committeeperson, according to the agreed local practice.
[See Par. (77)] [See App. I]
Step Two. Appeal to Shop Committee
(31)	If the case is not adjusted at this step, it may be referred to the Shop Committee (or sub-committee where established).
(32)	In plants in which sub-committees are established, cases not adjusted by the subcommittee and the representative of Management may be appealed to the Shop Committee as a whole to be taken up with the highest Local Management.
(33)	After a written grievance signed by the employee making the complaint has been appealed to the Shop Committee by a
30
committeeperson, the Chairperson of the Shop Committee may designate one of its members to make a further investigation of the grievance in order to discuss the grievance properly when it is taken up by the Shop Committee at a meeting with the Management. After a grievance has been discussed at the Shop Committee Meeting and before the submission of Notice of Unadjusted Grievance, the designated Shop Committeeperson may reinvestigate the grievance in the light of any new facts disclosed in the Shop Committee Meeting or appearing in the Shop Committee Minutes.
[See Par. {6a),(79d}[ (See App. K,ItJ(C)(l2)]
(34)	A final decision on appealed grievances will be given by a representative of the highest Local Management within a maximum of fifteen working days from the date of first written filing thereof unless a different time limit is established by local agreement in writing. Any grievance not appealed from a decision at one step of this procedure in the plant to the next step within five working days of such decision, will be considered settled on the basis of the last decision and not subject to further appeal. Within the applicable time limits of this Paragraph a grievance may be withdrawn by mutual agreement without prejudice to either party.
[Sec Par. (5)419)]
31
(35)	Written answers will be given by the Management to all written grievances presented by the Shop Committee.
(36)	The question of supplying minutes of the Shop Committee meetings with the Management to the Shop Committee and the form of such minutes is a matter to be negotiated with the Management of each plant by the Committee involved. In the interest of expediting orderly procedure, it is desirable for the Chairperson of the Shop Committee to furnish Management with an agenda of the matters, including a listing of grievances the Union desires to discuss at the meeting. The agenda if submitted should be furnished as far in advance of the meeting as possible. Such an agenda would not preclude discussion of other pertinent subjects. The minutes of Shop Committee meetings will be furnished to the Chairperson of the Shop Committee within six (6) calendar days from the date of the meeting.
Such minutes should include:
(1)	Date of meeting.
(2)	Names of those present.
(3)	Statement of each grievance taken up and discussed, also, in summary fashion, of the Union’s contention or, at its option, a written contention, in the event of failure to adjust.
32
(4)	Management’s written answer on each grievance, with reason for same if answer is adverse.
(5)	“Highlights” of the meeting, these including specific questions asked by the Committee on policy matters and any answers to such questions given by Management.
(6)	Date of approval, and signatures as agreed upon locally.
The above provisions shall not interfere with any mutually satisfactory local practice now in effect.
Step Three. Appeal to Corporation and International Union
(37)	If the grievance is not adjusted at this step and the Shop Committee believes it has grounds for appeal from the Plant Management decision, the Chairperson of the Shop Committee will give the Plant Management a written “Notice of Unadjusted Grievance,” on forms supplied by the Corporation, and the Chairperson or designated member of the Shop Committee will then prepare a complete “Statement of Unadjusted Grievance," signed by the Chairperson of the Shop Committee, setting forth all facts and circumstances surrounding the grievance, and where an alleged violation of discrimination is included in the grievance, a statement of the facts and circumstances supporting
33
such claim. The Plant Manager, or a designated Management representative, will also prepare a complete ‘‘Statement of Unadjusted Grievance” and the Management’s reason in support of the position taken, signed by the Plant Manager or an authorized Management representative. ‘ Three copies of the Union’s statement will be exchanged with the Management for three copies of the Management’s statement as soon as possible and in any event within | five (5) working days of the date of filing the “Notice |	of Unadjusted	Grievance.” The exchange of
,	statements shall	take place fifteen (15) working days
1 after receipt of the Plant Management’s decision, I	unless this time	is extended by mutual agreement in
I	writing, in which event the thirty days for appeal by
i	the Regional Director shall be automatically extended
,	by the same number of days as the amount of
extended time for exchanging “Statements of Unadjusted Grievance.” Each Shop Committee shall consecutively number each “Statement of Unadjusted Grievance” from one upward for identification purposes.
[See Par. (6a),(77),(79e)]
(38)	The Chairperson of the Shop Committee shall then forward copies of the “Statements of Unadjusted Grievance," to the Regional Director of the International Union. The Regional Director will review the case and determine if an appeal shall be made. The Regional Director or a specified representative and the Director of the
34
Guide Department of the International Union or a specified member of the Director’s staff will be granted permission to visit the plant for the purpose of investigating the specific grievance involved in ‘"Statements of Unadjusted Grievance,” providing such a grievance is of the nature that observation or investigation will aid in:
[See Par. (43a), (77),(79e)]
[See Doc. 29]
(1)	Arriving at a decision as to whether or not a grievance exists;
(2)	Arriving at a decision as to whether or not such grievance shall be appealed;
(3)	The purpose of its proper presentation in the event of appeal.

If the Regional Director shall decide to appeal the case, notice shall be given on the form “Notice of Appeal” supplied by the Corporation, sending one copy each to the local Plant Management and the Chairperson of the Shop Committee. Such “Notice of Appeal” will carry the same case number as the “Statement of Unadjusted Grievance.” Except as otherwise provided for, any case not appealed within thirty days, or within thirty days plus any agreed upon extension of time for exchanging “Statements of Unadjusted Grievance”, after the date the written “Statements of Unadjusted Grievance” are exchanged, or, in any event, within forty-five (45) days of the date of the written decision of local Plant Management to the Shop Committee, shall be finally and automatically closed on the basis of the written decision of the local Plant Management to the Shop Committee and shall not be subject to further appeal.

40
Step Four. Appeal to Impartial Arbitrator
(43) In the event of failure to adjust the case at this point, it may be appealed to the impartial Arbitrator, providing it is the type of case on which the Arbitrator is authorized to rule. Notice of appeal of such cases to the Arbitrator by the Union shall be given by the Regional Director to the Plant Management of the Plant in which the case arose, with copies to the Industrial Relations Department of the Corporation tn Pendleton. Indiana and to the International Union Office at Detroit; in cases appealed to the Arbitrator by the Corporation, notice of such appeal will be given by the Corporation to the International Union Office in Detroit. Cases not appealed to the Arbitrator within twenty-one (21) days from the date of a final decision given after review in an Appeal Committee meeting shall be considered settled on the basis of the decisions so given; provided, however, that within the twenty-one (21) day time limit of this paragraph a case may be withdrawn by mutual agreement without prejudice to either party.
[See Par. (55)] [See Doc. 26]
(43a) After a case has been appealed to the Arbitrator but prior to the Arbitrator hearing of the case, the Director of the Guide Department of the International Union or,a specified member of the Director's staff will be granted permission to visit the
41
plant for the purpose of investigating the specific grievance.
(43a)(1) Once the Union has provided a notice of intent to arbitrate, the parties shall jointly request the American Arbitration Association (AAA) to provide the parties with a list of names of seven (7) arbitrators, each of whom shall be a member of the National Academy of Arbitrators, from which the parties shall attempt to select an arbitrator to hear the dispute. The selection and arbitration process shall be conducted pursuant to the then current rules of labor arbitration of the AAA.
(43b)(I) Any grievance involving a dispute regarding an employee’s job assignment which has resulted in a loss of work (except as provided in [a] below), or a refusal of Management to return an employee to work from sick leave of absence by reason of the medical findings of a physician or physicians acting for the Corporation, will be initiated at the Second Step, if such findings are in conflict with the findings of the employee’s personal physician with respect to whether the employee is able to do a job to which the employee is entitled, in line with the employee’s seniority, or do the disputed job assignment as the case may be. Failing to resolve the question, the parties may refer the employee to a local clinic or physician mutually agreed upon for an impartial medical opinion as to whether the employee is or is not able to do a job to which the employee is
42
entitled, in line with the employee’s seniority, or do the disputed job assignment as the case may be. If Management and the Union are unable to agree on any aspect of the referral to a clinic or physician, the case may be appealed as provided in the grievance procedure. Without adding to or modifying any other provisions of this Agreement or any of its Supplements, where an Impartial Medical Opinion (IMO) Program is in effect in a plant the medical authority(s) approved for such program may be the “local clinic or independent physician” provided for above. The expense of any mutually agreed to physical examination(s) shall be paid one half by the Corporation and one half by the Local Union.
[See Par. (216)]
(a) This procedure will also be applicable to a situation where an employee is prevented from being transferred to a job classification because of a medical finding by a physician acting for the Corporation, which medical finding the employee’s personal physician does not thereafter detect.
(43b)(2) In the event the Corporation and the International Union are unable to mutually agree at the Third Step, on the referral to a clinic or physician, the case shall be considered as automatically appealed to the Arbitrator and shall be scheduled for Arbitrator Hearing as expeditiously as practicable. Information furnished the Arbitrator shall include all relevant and material medical information
43
that the parties themselves have jointly considered. When deciding medical questions, the Arbitrator shall seek such competent medical advice, including specialists, as the Arbitrator may deem appropriate. Any examination of the employee by the medical personnel selected by the Arbitrator shall be conducted as close as feasible to the city in which the plant where the grievance arose is located.
(43b)(3) Any decision by a mutually agreed to medical authority at any step of this procedure, or by the Arbitrator, shall be final and binding on the Union, the employee involved and the Corporation. Any retroactive pay due an employee shall be limited to a period commencing with the date of filing of the grievance, or the date the employee became able to do a job to which the employee is entitled, in line with the employee’s seniority, whichever is the later. The Arbitrator shall have full discretion to set the amount of back pay, if any, when a dispute exists as to the back pay to which an employee may be entitled for any period during the processing of the grievance when the employee refuses to cooperate with diagnostic medical procedures at other than the employee’s own expense.
(44)	The impartial Arbitrator shall have only the functions set forth herein and shall serve during the term established by contract for as long as the Arbitrator conlinues to be acceptable to both parties. The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator will be paid one-half by the Corporation and one-half by
44
the Union and all other expenses shall be bome by the party incurring them,
(45)	All cases shall be presented to the Arbitrator in the form of a written brief prepared by each party, setting forth the facts and its position and the arguments in support thereof. The Arbitrator has discretion to conduct appropriate investigation and may opt to hold a hearing open to the parties and examine the witnesses of each party and each party shall have the right to cross-examine all such witnesses and to make a record of all such proceedings.
[See Par. (43by2)]

[See Par. (72)]
(63)	The transferring of employees is solely the responsibility of Management subject to the following sub-paragraphs. The provisions of this paragraph shall be applied without discrimination because of race, religion, color, age, sex, disability, sexual orientation, or national origin, so that equal employment opportunity will be afforded to all employees.
[See Par. (6a) (72)] [See App, K Alt. A] [See Doc? 34]
(63X«) (1) Employees who desire advancement to higher paid classifications within
59
their department or other established broader scope of selection, may make application to their supervisor or the Personnel Department on forms provided by the Corporation on which they may state their qualifications and experience. Thereafter, as openings occur, selection for the promotion will be from among such applicants and applicants for that classification that have filed pursuant to subParagraph (2) below, who have applied at least 10 calendar days in advance of the opening in question, and where ability, merit and capacity are equal, the applicant with the longest seniority will be given preference.
(63)(a)(2) Employees who desire advancement within the plant to higher paid classifications in another department or to higher paid classifications where the employee is working outside an established scope of selection that is broader than a department may make application to their supervisor or the Personnel Department on forms provided by the Corporation on which they may state their qualifications and experience. Thereafter, as openings occur, such applicants will be considered in the selection process for that promotion provided they have so applied at least 10 calendar days in advance of the opening in question. Each employee may have two (2) such applications on file. An employee who has been transferred and established seniority under this Paragraph (63)(a)(2) will not be eligible to reapply for consideration for another such promotion
60
until six (6) months have elapsed from the effective date of transfer. An employee who has been offered a transfer and refused the transfer under this Paragraph (63Xa)(2) will have such application for transfer cancelled and thereafter, for a period of six (6) months from the date of such refusal, may be entitled to only one (1) valid application for transfer under these provisions. Such transfer or offer of transfer to employees working outside a scope of selection shall be without prejudice to the establishment or identification of such scope.
Promotions made pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph (63)(a) in the preceding week will be openly displayed in mutually satisfactory locations in the plant which are frequented by large numbers of affected employees.
If the settlement of a grievance alleging violation of this Paragraph (63)(a) is on the basis that a different employee should have been promoted, that employee will receive the difference in wages earned (exclusive of earnings received for overtime hours which they worked but were not worked by the employee improperly promoted to the higher rated job) and the wages they would have earned had they been promoted.
If an employee is transferred pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph (63)(a) and the employee is subsequently reduced from the new classification
61
prior to establishing seniority, the provisions requiring advanced application for an opening in that classification will be waived, provided the employee refiles for such classification within one (1) week from the date of being reduced.
[See Doc. 35]
(63)(b) It is the policy of Management to cooperate in every practical way with employees who desire transfers to new positions or vacancies in their department. Accordingly, such employees who make application to their supervisor or the Personnel Department stating their desires, qualifications and experience, will be given preference for openings in their department provided they are capable of doing the job. However, employees who have made application as provided for above and who are capable of doing the job available shall be given preference for the openings in their department over new hires. In case the opening is in an equal or lower rated classification and there ts more than one applicant capable of doing the job, the applicant with the longest seniority will be given preference. Any secondary job openings resulting from filling jobs pursuant to this provision may be filled through promotion; or through transfer without regard to seniority standing, or by new hire.
Any claim of personal prejudice or any claim of discrimination for Union activity in connection with transfers may be taken up as a
62
grievance. Such claims must be supported by written evidence submitted within 48 hours from the time the grievance is filed.

A copy of such Management notification will be furnished promptly to the Chairperson of the Shop Committee. If the employee complies with the conditions set forth tn the notification, the employee’s seniority will be reinstated if it has not otherwise been broken;
63
however, such reinstatement shall not be construed as limiting the application of the Shop Rule regarding absence without reasonable cause in the employee’s case;
[Sec Par. (74)] ’
(64)(d) If the employee fails to return to work within five-working days after being notified to report for work, and does not give a satisfactory reason.

APPENDIX A
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING EMPLOYEE PLACEMENT
It is recognized that the hiring of new employees in one location while there is a surplus of seniority employees in other locations is not in the best interest of the parties. Therefore, the parties will provide eligible seniority laid-off, Protected and active seniority employees an opportunity to relocate to UAW Guide facilities outside of their area, with particular emphasis on placing employees from closed or idled facilities. For the purposes of this Memorandum, seniority refers to longest unbroken Guide seniority.
When employed, such employees will acquire seniority in the plant where hired in accordance with Paragraphs (56) and (57) of the National Agreement.
In the event of a permanent opening at a Guide facility, the following placement procedure is to be utilized:
1.	Plant Recall
2.	Plant Rehire
3.	Area Hire
a.	Combined list of seniority employees on indefinite layoff, Protected employees, active employees from plants that have excess
161
employees and seniority return to former community applicants.
b.	Volunteers will	be placed in
seniority order.
c.	In the event of insufficient
volunteers, the employee with the least seniority on the Area Hire List (except active) will be offered the job. Non-volume Protected Status employees will be included unless either party identifies a compelling reason not to do so.
4.	Extended Area Hire - Closed Plants
• Volunteers will be placed in seniority order.
5.	Extended Area Hire - Closed Plant Return to Former Community
- Volunteers will be placed in seniority order.
6.	Other Extended Area Hire (includes GtS eligible)

b.	Volunteers will be placed in seniority order.
162
7.	Area Hire Active Employees from Plants without Replacement
- Volunteers will be placed in seniority order.
8.	Extended Area Hire Active Employees from Plants without Replacement
- Volunteers will be placed in seniority order.
In administering the Placement Procedure, items (1) through (8) above will be applied sequentially.
Active employees who volunteer and are placed in accordance with this Placement Procedure must terminate seniority at their current location.
It is understood that the National Parties may mutually agree from time to time to other special provisions, including offering jobs to active or protected employees.
It is further understood that the National Parlies may also mutually agree to deviate from the above order of selection in a particular situation.
In addition, the Union assured the Corporation of its willingness to implement Document No. 65.
Any complaints regarding the application of these provisions in any plant may be taken up with Local Management of that plant by the local Shop
163
Committee and if not resolved may be referred to Guide Corporation Industrial Relations Staff and the International Union for resolution; however, the above provisions shall not be the basis for any claims for back wages or any form of retroactive adjustments.
It is understood that if an employee whose problem is referred to the Guide Corporation Industrial Staff and the International Union is adjudged by the National Parties to be entitled to an adjustment, the employee will be offered an available opening as soon as possible, but in any event within two weeks of such decision.

D,	In the event that higher seniority employees are placed on layoff, employees with the least seniority who would have otherwise been laid off will be placed on the Area Hire List. Such employees placed on the Area Hire List will be advised of this fact and be given the opportunity to designate plants within the Area Hire Area.
E.	Volunteers will be offered the available jobs in seniority order. In the event there are insufficient volunteers, the employee with the least seniority on the Area Hire List (except active) will be offered the job.

171
Hire in accordance with Appendix A and worked there six (6) months and who still retain seniority at a plant in the former community.
B.	Eligible employees will be given the opportunity to file an application to return to their former community. Such employees may apply at the personnel office of the plant at which they are employed and will be provided a copy of their application.
Employees may have only one return to former community application on file at any given time. Once employees return to a former community under the provisions of this document, they are no longer eligible to return to any other community until such time as they are laid off or relocate in accordance with Appendix A.

At the time of receiving an offer to return to a plant in a former community, employees who have filed a Return to Former Community Application, may elect to receive a payment of $6,000 to remain at their current plant. As a result of receiving this payment, the employees will terminate seniority and return rights at all other Guide Corporation facilities and therefore no longer be
172
eligible for Return To Former Community consideration.
"E. Employees returning to a plant in their former community will acquire seniority in accordance with the Application of Corporate Seniority Section (Section Vlll) of this Memorandum.
F, . Should employees return to their former community under the provisions of this Section, their seniority will be terminated pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (64)(d) at the plant from which they are leaving, effective with the date to report to the new plant.
G. It is recognized that the plant from which the eligible employee is released must do so in a manner consistent with the maintenance of quality and efficiency. Accordingly, no eligible employee will be released until a fully trained replacement is available. Consistent with these principles, it is recognized that the rate at which employees are released may vary due to the types of jobs held by such employees, the availability of replacement personnel, product or new model launch, the releasing plant’s staffing requirements or other business reasons. In all cases, management will endeavor to release employees as quickly as possible.

C.	In this regard, solely for the purposes of calculating the periods relative to
178
breaking seniority and exhausting rehire rights at the former plant pursuant to Paragraph (64)(e), such employees in Sections (A) and (B) above shall be considered as having accepted recall to their former plant on the date such work became available and returned to layoff status at such time as the period of temporary work is completed.
XI.	TRAINING
In order to ensure consistent administration of Area Hire and/or Extended Area Hire, training materials will be developed and a joint meeting will be held of those people responsible for the administration of these provisions. Costs for the training will be covered by joint funds upon approval of the Executive Board-Joint Activities. Topics to be discussed, but not limited to, are: ,
-	Changes in the Area Hire provisions and related matters as a result of 2000 Negotiations.
-	Review of existing procedures and
provisions.

Subject:	Date of Entry Status - Apprentices
To:	All Personnel Directors
of Plants Covered by the Guide-UAW National Agreement
During the course of the discussions leading to the current National Agreement, the Corporation and the UAW discussed situations where the placement in the program of a selected apprentice applicant is delayed. The Union emphasized that problems resulted when such a delay occurs due to (1) an approved leave of absence for jury duty, (2) approved time off pursuant to the Vacation Entitlement Section, (3) a sick leave of absence, (4) the short term needs of Local Management such as the necessity to train a replacement for the person who has been selected, or (5) an absence which qualifies the employee for bereavement pay, (6) for paid absence allowance time off under the provisions of prior agreements, or (7) for short term military duty.
The Corporation has advised the Union that if an opening occurs and the person selected to fill the opening is delayed for one of the reasons specified above and the delay is for not more than 21 calendar
180
days, that person’s date of entry for seniority purposes shall be the date he or she would have originally been placed in the opening.

APPENDIX D
INTERPRETATION OF PARAGRAPH (4) THRU (4c) AND PARAGRAPH (57)
Rules for Computing Seniority of Employees Who Acquire Seniority by Working !W Days Within Six Continuous Months, and Computing the Period Specified in Paragraph (4) (4a) (4b) (4c)
1.	Credit toward acquiring seniority will begin with the first day worked by the new employee and will include the subsequent days of that pay period.
2.	Thereafter during six consecutive months until the employee acquires seniority the employee will receive credit for seven days for each pay period during which the employee works except that credit will not be given for any days the employee is on layoff.
3,	No credit will be given for any pay period during which for any reason, the employee does not work except as provided in Paragraph (108) and in the case of the pay period in which the full week of Christmas holidays or the Independence Week Shutdown falls, provided the employee would otherwise have been scheduled to work.
4.	Unless employees are at work on the 90th day of their accumulated credited period, they must work another day within their probationary period to acquire seniority. If the 90th day of their accumulated credited period falls on a holiday or an Independence
182
Week Shutdown Day, the employees will be considered as having seniority as of the holiday or the Independence Week Shutdown Day. If the 90th day of their accumulated credited period falls on their vacation pay eligibility date, the employees will be considered as having seniority as of the vacation pay eligibility date.
5.	In the event temporary employees are summoned and report for jury duty as prescribed by applicable law during the period of six continuous months preceding the date they acquire seniority pursuant to Paragraph (57), the employees’ seniority when acquired will be adjusted to give the employees credit for seven additional days for each week in the period in which they did not work and during which jury duty was performed. The employees must furnish evidence that the jury duty was performed in order to receive seniority credit in accordance with this provision.

Dear Mr. Rapson:	_
It is the policy of the Guide Corporation to perform maintenance work with its own employees, provided it has the labor, skills, equipment and facilities to do so and can do the work competitively in quality, cost and performance and within the projected time limits. At times the Corporation does not deem advisable doing the work itself, and it must, as in the past, reserve to itself the right to decide whether it will do any particular work or let the work to outside contractors This letter is not to be regarded as impairing that right in any way.
The Corporation hereby assures the Union that it has no plans to change its policy and that it expects to continue its general operating policy of placing primary reliance on its own skilled trades employees to perform maintenance work to the extent consistent with sound business practice, as in the past.
In this regard, we have seen the use of joint Management and Union work schedule and business
184
opportunity teams work very successfully in many of our locations. This approach has not only enhanced job security, but has allowed a better understanding as to the competitive challenges facing the parties. As such, each location is encouraged to establish a skilled trades subcontracting planning team involving both Management and Union representation who will review forecasted work schedules, including projects and jobs which may be subject to subcontracting, in order to develop the most efficient approach to the work to be performed. Plants who have experienced success with this approach have found that meetings scheduled weekly, if necessary, were most beneficial, and therefore such meetings should be scheduled accordingly at Guide plants.
The Corporation is genuinely interested in maintaining maximum employment opportunities for its skilled trades employees consistent with the needs of the Corporation. Therefore, in making these determinations, the Corporation intends always to keep the interests of Guide Corporation personnel in mind.
Very truly yours,
Robert H. Steams Vice President

Dear Mr. Raoson:
During the 2004 negotiations the Union discussed with the Corporation serious problems affecting the job security of employees resulting from contracting out of work.
During the course of negotiations, the Union complained that in certain instances the work force in maintenance and tool and die trades particularly was reduced through attrition and then work was contracted out to the point where there was insufficient manpower available within the plant to perform the work; and that in certain instances skilled trades employees were permanently laid off and new work which they had historically performed was contracted out for extended periods, instead of recalling these employees to their jobs. Similar complaints were made relative to work in the Corporation’s engineering departments. In certain instances, the Union alleged that work historically performed in the Parts Division had been contracted
186
out accounting in part for the reduction in the number of employees in that division.
The essential elements in the complaints registered by the Union went to the question of job security.
During the 2004 National Negotiations, the parties reviewed the competitive advantage of Guide Corporation's talented skilled trades workforce. Discussed were the Union’s concerns for the integrity of the apprenticeable trades, the job security of the skilled trades workforce, the content of skilled trades work assignments, and the status of work functions historically performed by the bargaining unit.
At times it is not practicable for the Corporation to do the work itself, and it must, as in the past, reserve the right to decide whether it will do particular maintenance, tool and die skilled trades work, or contract it out. The Union recognizes that in making such decisions the Corporation must consider among other things, the efficiencies and economies involved, the need for specialized tools and equipment, special skills and the necessity of meeting production schedules, model change and plant rearrangement deadlines.
In our discussions we agreed that employees’ jobs should not be eliminated by reason of a practice of contracting out, and we agreed that existing employment opportunities of seniority employees should not be unnecessarily reduced by reason of management contracting out work. The Corporation, moreover, states that it is its policy to fully utilize its
187
seniority employees, under circumstances in which it is reasonable and practicable to do so, in the performance of work which they have historically performed to produce its product and perform its services.
While Guide Corporation intends to provide this opportunity to its skilled trades workforce, the parties agreed that prolonged schedules involving substantial overtime were not in the best interest of employees or the Corporation and, as a result, Guide Corporation must consider the availability of its skilled workforce when scheduling potential overtime. The parties are expected to work out acceptable means by which Management will have reliable information as to the hours employees will work when planning such work schedules.
Accordingly, the Corporation states that it will make a reasonable effort to avoid contracting out work which adversely affects the job security of its employees and that it will utilize various training programs available to it, whenever practicable, to maintain employment opportunities for its employees consistent with the needs of the Corporation.
Very truly yours,
Robert H, Steams Vice President

APPENDIX K
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING JOB SECURITY (JOBS) PROGRAM
The Corporation and the Union are committed to enhancing the job security of Guide Corporation employees. Parties also recognize that such job security can only be realized within a work environment which promotes operational effectiveness, continuous improvement and competitiveness.
Accordingly, the parties have agreed to this JOBS Program and have pledged to work together, consistent with this Program and other provisions of the National Agreement to enhance the Corporation's competitive position.
The cornerstone of the JOBS Program is a commitment to pre-determined Secured Employment Levels (SELs), a series of SEL Benchmark Minimums, and protection against indefinite layoff for eligible employees as expressly provided herein.
I.	SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM - The Corporation and the Union agree that:
(A)	The secured employment levels (SELs) (i.e., numbers of eligible employees or positions covered by this Program as defined herein) initially shall be established as of the Effective Date
191
of the Agreement at each bargaining unit for skilled and non-skilled employees. The transfer of an employee between skilled and non-skilled will cause the SEL for the group receiving the employee to increase and the other group from which the movement occurred to decrease unless the movement occurred to satisfy the SEL, in which case the SEL will remain the same in each group.
SEL groups are set forth in Attachment C. The SELs for each Group will equal the sum of there respective Unit SELs.
(B)	The initial Secured Employment Levels for each Unit shall be equal to the sum of: (1) the number of active employees with one or more years seniority at work and on roll in the Unit on the Effective Date; (2) the number of active employees with less than one year of seniority occupying SEL slots in the Unit on the Effective Date; and (3) the number of unfilled new hire obligations in the Unit as of the Effective Date due to the application of the outsourcing/new hire provisions of the 1996 - 99 Agreement, Appendix K (Article ll(O)(2)(b.3). Such active employees will be SEL eligible and shall include employees not at work who are:
(1)	on vacation,
(2> receiving bereavement pay,
(3)	on jury duty,
192
(4)	on any leave of absence of 90 days duration or less,
(5)	on temporary layoff, and
(6)	any other employee having a direct attachment to the active workforce.
(C)	A series of SEL Benchmark Minimums will be established for each Unit on the Effective Date, representing projected SEL-eligible employment minimums as of the close of each calendar quarter beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2000 through the quarter ending December 31, 2003. Each quarterly Benchmark shall be determined by subtracting from the immediately preceding SEL Benchmark an amount equal to .333% of the Unit’s Initial SEL, so that the December 31, 2003 Benchmark shall equal 95% of the initial SEL. (If this calculation results in something other than a whole number, sequential rounding adjustments may be made to even out the calculations over the term of the Agreement).
(D)	bio employee will be laid off for any reason, other than described in 1(E), if such layoff would cause the number of active employees in the unit to fall below the (hen current SEL or otherwise result in the layoff of one or more SEL eligible employees.
193
(E)	Paragraph 1(D) notwithstanding, an employee protected from layoff by the SEL may be laid off for any of the following reasons:
(1)	volume related declines attributable to market related conditions as described in Document No. 4, JOBS Program - Volume Related Layoffs - SEL, not to exceed 42 weeks (inclusive of vacation shutdown weeks) over the life of the Agreement;
(2)	acts of God or other, such reasons beyond the control of the Corporation;
(3)	the sale of a part of the Corporation’s operations as an ongoing business;
(4)	the layoff of an employee recalled or reassigned to fill an opening known in advance to be temporary; or
(5)	model change or plant rearrangement until the employee otherwise would have been recalled.
An employee impacted by any of the above reasons is, if otherwise eligible, covered by the appropriate Supplemental Agreements which are attached to the National Agreement as Exhibits.
(F)	The number of employees protected
by this JOBS Program will be the equivalent of the employees within the SEL who would otherwise have 194
been (aid off as a result of any event other than those described in Paragraph I.
IL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SEL AND SEL ELIGIBILITY - Following the initial determination of the SEL, it will be adjusted as follows:
(A)	An employee shall become SEL-eligible for any of the following reasons at which point the SEL will be increased by one position for each such employee: (1) an employee in the active workforce, as defined by Paragraph 1(B) who had less than one year seniority on the Effective Date of the Agreement who subsequently attains one year of seniority; (2) an employee with one or more years seniority is recalled, except if recalled to satisfy the SEL, and is actively at work, on vacation or receives pay in at least 26 weeks during any consecutive 52-week period ending after the effective date of the Agreement; (3) an employee with less than one years seniority is recalled, except if recalled to satisfy the SEL, who subsequently attains one years seniority and is actively at work, on vacation or receives pay in at least 26 weeks during any consecutive 52-week period ending after the effective date of the Agreement; (4) an employee rehired pursuant to Paragraph (64)(e), except if rehired to satisfy a SEL, who subsequently attains one years seniority and is actively at work, on vacation or receives pay in at least 26 weeks during any consecutive 52-week
195
period ending after the effective date of the Agreement; (5) an employee newly hired after the effective date of the Agreement who attains three years seniority; (6) an employee deemed to be eligible, recalled or newly hired in order to satisfy a SEL Benchmark Minimum. Notwithstanding the above, the National JOBS Committee is authorized to establish special mechanisms, including SEL eligibility provisions, for the purpose of attracting new work.
(B)	The SEL will be reduced for the attrition of eligible employees who quit, retire, or die.
(C)	The Group SELs established pursuant to Section 1(A) will continue to equal the sum of their respective Unit SELs and will be adjusted in accordance with the addition or deletion of Units to the extent such transactions affect the sum of the respective Unit SELs.
(D)	Unit SELs will be adjusted in the event of transfers of operations or consolidations between Units. The Unit SEL will be decreased by one at the transferring location and increased by one at the receiving location by the corresponding number of jobs involved in the transaction' unless otherwise agreed to by the National plarties. Similarly corresponding adjustments will alsA be made to the SEL Benchmark Minimums of each affected unit.
196
(E)	Each employee who leaves the bargaining unit for a permanent salaried position will be replaced immediately with no effect on the SEL by recalling an employee from layoff or from the Area Hire List, or by hiring a new employee if no such laid off employee is available. For each regular salaried employee returning to the bargaining unit, the SEL will be increased by one.
(F)	SEL eligible employees off roll will maintain their eligibility upon reinstatement.
(G)	(1) Following the last day of
each month and within 15 days of the following month (SEL Benchmark Review), the number of SEL-eligible employees in each Unit shall be compared to the Unit’s corresponding SEL Benchmark Minimum. Adjustments will be made consistent with the provisions of this Memorandum, and attrition replacement obligations will be fulfilled as set forth below.
(2)	When the number of SEL-eligible employees exceeds the Benchmark Minimum, attrition will be replaced on a one-for-two basis by recalling employees on layoff in accordance with the procedure described in Section (3)(b) below.
(3)	When the number of SEL-eligible employees would otherwise fall below the Benchmark Minimum, attrition will be replaced on a one-for-one basis by the following actions in order to
197
maintain eligible employment at the Benchmark Minimum:
(a)	First, by allowing an ineligible active seniority employee at the affected facility to become eligible.
(b)	Second, by
recalling a seniority employee from layoff from the facility, or rehiring an employee with a Paragraph (64)(e) rehire right, or from the Area Hire list.
(c)	Or third, by
hiring new employees up to the net number of jobs outsourced minus those insourced (as defined in Appendix L of the Agreement and determined by the National Committee) subsequent to the Effective Date. Such positions will be filled on a SEL Group basis (or Unit if applicable) no later than ninety (90) days following the SEL Benchmark Review, except when the affected Unit is encountering market-driven, volume-related layoffs.
(4)	Notwithstanding the above, the net outsourcing/new hire obligation provided in Section (3)(c) above shall be activated earlier than required therein if and when the number of SEL-eligible employees is less than the greater of; (1) the SEL Benchmark Minimum for the quarter; or (2) 95% of the Unit’s Baseline SEL under the 1996 Agreement.
198
(5)	If, after fulfilling the above requirements, subsequent attritions would cause the number of SEL-eligible employees to fall below the Unit’s Benchmark Minimum, attrition will be replaced on the following basis:
(a)	When the number of SEL-eligible employees is greater than 90% but less than 100% of the Benchmark Minimum, one (1) new employee will be hired for each three (3) attritions.
(b)	When the number of SEL-eligible employees is greater than 80% but less than 90% of the Benchmark Minimum, one (I) new employee will be hired for each two (2) attritions.
(c)	When the number of SEL-eligible employees is below 80% of the Benchmark Minimum, one (1) new employee will be hired for each one (1) attrition.
(d)	Such positions will be filled on a SEL Group basis (or Unit if applicable) no later than ninety (90) days following the SEL Benchmark Review, except when the affected unit is encountering market-driven, volume-related layoffs.
(6)	Employees recalled, hired, or rehired to fulfill the above obligations may be assigned within their Unit at Management’s
199
discretion, subject to applicable seniority provisions of the Agreement.
(7)	In the event new hire obligations required in Subsection (1)(c) above are fulfilled through the placement of new employees at a Unit within the Group other than the one at which the obligations were created, the SEL for the respective Units will be adjusted on a one-for-one basis, by reducing the SEL at the Unit where the openings occurred by the number of new hire fulfillments and correspondingly increasing the SEL(s) at the Unit(s) where the new hires were placed. Similarly, offsetting adjustments will also be made to the SEL Benchmark Minimums of each affected Unit.
(H)	Jf on the evaluation date the SEL number results in less than a whole number, the Engineering Method of Rounding will be used to determine the SEL
(I)	Notwithstanding the above, SEL Benchmarking Minimums will not be established for a facility determined to be closing.
III. JOB SECURITY AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS - In recognition of the fact that job security can only result from joint efforts to improve operational effectiveness, the Corporation and the Union agree that:
200
(A)	For a period commencing with the Effective Date of this Memorandum of Understanding and for the life of the current Agreement, no employee within the SEL will be laid off as a result of any event other than those described in Paragraph 1(E).
(B)	An employee whose regular job is eliminated will be placed pursuant to the applicable provisions of the National Agreement and Local Seniority Agreement,
(C)	The number of employees protected
from layoff due to the JOBS program will be that determined in Paragraph 1(F). Each Protected employee will be identified by application of the Local Seniority Agreement provisions as if such job security were not provided.
(D)	If an event, other than those described in 1(E), would otherwise cause the number of active employees in a unit to fall below the then current SEL, the employees so protected, as provided for in 1(D), will be placed on Protected employee status. The Parties recognize that events, other than those described in 1(E), may occur during the course of this Agreement that will cause the number of SEL eligible employees to exceed the Corporation’s production requirements. The parties further recognize that the scope of this program requires flexibility with regard to the assignment of such Protected employees and the selection of employees
201
for training. In this regard, the Local JOBS Committee (described in Section IV, below) will insure that assignments are made on a basts consistent with the seniority provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and Local Seniority Agreement while meeting plant needs, minimizing work force disruption and enhancing the personal growth and development of employees. After a decision by the Local JOBS Committee a Protected employee may be (1) placed in a training program, (2) used as a replacement to facilitate the training of another employee, (3) placed in a job opening at another Guide Corporation plant provided there is no employee on layoff from that plant with a seniority recall or Paragraph (64)(e) rehire right applicant who has not been offered a job at that plant, (4) given a job assignment within or outside the bargaining unit which may be non-traditional, (5) placed in an existing opening or (6) given other assignments consistent with the purposes of this Memorandum of Understanding.
(E)(1) Notwithstanding the above, an available Protected employee may be placed on the Area Hire list by Management for selection to an available opening at another location within the area. The number of such Protected employees made available for placement cannot exceed the number of Protected employees who have been laid off for the duration of the 42 week volume-related layoff limit (inclusive of vacation shutdown weeks). Protected 202
employees will be made available for Area Hire placement in inverse seniority order.
(2)	A location that has no one on layoff with a seniority recall or Paragraph (64)(e) rehire right may fill a job opening with an available Protected employee from another location within the Area Hire Area pursuant to Paragraphs M(l) and (2), or an Area Hire applicant who has not been offered a job in the Area Hire Area.
The SEL will be reduced by one at the plant from which the employee is transferred and increased by one at die plant to which the employee is transferred, unless the transfer satisfied the SEL, in which case the SEL will remain the same at both plants.
An available Protected employee transferred permanently to another location may remain at the secondary location until at the employee’s home location (1) there is an available opening in the regular active workforce to which the employee is entitled, or (2) the employee is recalled to Protected employee status, or (3) the employee is laid off from the secondary plant, at which time the employee will return, seniority permitting, to the active workforce.
(F)	Efforts of the local parties to improve operational effectiveness will be encouraged and supported by the national parties including, as
203
may be appropriate, approval of requests to waive, modify or change the National Agreement,
(G)	A Protected employee will continue to receive their regular straight time hourly rate of pay. In the event a Protected employee is assigned to another classification, the employee will receive the rate of pay as provided by the Local Wage Agreement.
(H)	Protected employees’ assignments will be considered temporary and not subject to provisions governing permanent filling of vacancies or the application of shift preference, except for assignments to fill openings resulting from volume increases. Experience gained from these temporary assignments will not be used to advantage such Protected employee over other employees for selection to fill permanent vacancies, nor will the Protected employee gain seniority under Paragraph (62) of the National Agreement from such assignments.
(1)	An employee replaced by a Protected employee will receive their regular straight time hourly rate of pay, and will be returned to the same classification and job assignment upon completion of the replaced employee’s assignment. In the event the employee has insufficient seniority to return to the formerly held classification, the
204
employee will be placed pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Local Seniority Agreement.
(J)	If an employee would have been transferred pursuant to Paragraphs (63)(a)(l), (63)(a)(2), (63)(b) of the National Agreement or placed in an Apprentice program were it not for participation in a training assignment provided by this program, the employee will be transferred to this classification upon completion of the training assignment. In the event the employee would have been selected for an E.LT. or Apprentice assignment the employee’s date of entry will be adjusted as if the employee’s assignment had not been delayed.
(K)	A replaced employee returned to a job assignment under this Program will be credited with all overtime hours the employee worked while out of the equalization group, but not with the overtime hours the employee would otherwise have worked in the group had the employee not have been replaced by the protected employee.
(L)	A training assignment will be voluntary on the part of an employee being replaced by a protected employee, unless such training is to develop or improve technical skills relevant to the employee’s current job assignment or anticipated future job needs.
205
(M)	No Protected employee will be temporarily assigned to a job outside of the bargaining unit except on a voluntary basis, subject to the direction of the National Committee. Permanent transfers of Protected employees outside the bargaining unit to other Guide-UAW represented plants within the Area Hire Area will be handled as follows:
(1)	Management may place a Protected employee’s name on the Area Hire a list. The number of names so placed may not exceed the number of employees who have been laid off for the duration of the 42 week volume-related layoff limit (inclusive of vacation shutdown). Protected employees will be made available for Area Hire placement in inverse seniority order. Thereafter, such employees may be selected in seniority order to available jobs at other locations. The Seniority used by a skilled trades employee in administering these provisions will be the employee’s date of entry or ioumeyperson date.
(2)	A Protected employee who is transferred permanently out of the Area Hire Area in accordance with this paragraph, or if so transferred later accepts a recall or rehire at a former location, will be eligible to receive a relocation allowance and other relocation services as provided in Paragraphs (96a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of the National Agreement. A Protected employee temporarily transferred out of the Area Hire Area who does not
206
change permanent residence as a result of the transfer will receive reasonable transportation and living expenses for the duration of the assignment. Any problems connected with the above may be raised with the National Committee.
(N)	In the event there is an opening due to a volume increase, the available Protected employee with the highest seniority will be placed in this opening, unless the Local Committee determines the employee should first complete the employee’s current assignment. If seniority employees are on layoff from that plant, a number of such employees, equivalent to the number of Protected employees placed in openings due to volume increases will be recalled from layoff. A protected employee transferred to another GM plant due to a volume increase who is subsequently laid off from the secondary plant due to a volume decrease will be returned to available opening at the employee’s home plant, seniority permitting.
(O)	A layoff caused by an event described in Paragraph 1(E) will have no impact on the number of Protected employees except for an employee who is protected from a layoff attributable to a market related volume decline in excess of 42 weeks (inclusive of vacation shutdown weeks). In those instances, Protected employees, having the least seniority, will be laid-off and replaced by an equivalent number of greater seniority employees
207
who would otherwise have insufficient seniority to remain in the plant.
(P)	In the event the Local or National Committee determines that the number of Protected employees exceeds the number of expected openings at the plant or in the Area within the next succeeding 12 months, special programs as set forth in Attachment A may be triggered upon prior approval of the National Committee. Thereafter, to the extent the number of Protected employees is still in excess of expected openings, such employees, under the direction of the National Committee, may be transferred out of the area pursuant to Paragraph (M). The National Committee may also explore the extension of Attachment A to other locations to create job opportunities for excess Protected employees within the Area Hire area.
(Q)	Earnings, including wages and wage related payments, received by employees while on Protected employee assignments, will be charged against the maximum liability amount. The cost of benefits and other payments made or incurred on behalf of Protected employees, specifically, health care (including dental and vision), group insurance, pensions, legal services, training fund contributions, and HCA will be charged against the maximum liability amount. Moving allowance payments and the cost of benefits provided under Attachment A of this Memorandum of Understanding will not be charged
208
against this liability. Earnings received and the cost of benefits and other payments made on behalf of Protected employees while assigned to fill permanent job openings resulting from volume increases or assigned to other regular and productive work (c.g., absentee replacements) will not be charged against this liability.
(R)	Charges against the Corporation’s liability will commence with the first payments made to Protected employees and will continue until the maximum liability is reached or the expiration of the Program as provided in this Memorandum of Understanding, whichever occurs first. The records of such charges will be maintained by the Corporation and will be available to the Union at appropriate times.
IV.	ADMINISTRATION of the jobs PROGRAM - The Corporation and Union agree that:
(A)	At each bargaining unit covered by the current Guide-UAW National Agreement, a Local JOBS Committee will be established to administer the Program.
(B)	The membership of the Committee will consist of the local Plant Manager, and other representatives selected by management; the local Union President, if a Guide Corporation employee, and the Shop Committee.
209
(C)	The duties of the Local Committee
will be:
(1)	Review local accessions and separations relative to the Unit Secured Employment Level (SEL) and the number of Protected employees.
(2)	Review the number and status of the available Protected employees on a monthly basis, specifically noting the impact on this group of attrition, volume and future manpower requirements.
(3)	Monitor the initial placement of an employee who is within the SEL and who returns to work following an event covered in Paragraphs 1(B) and 1(E).
(4)	Monitor the placement of Protected employees. In this regard consideration should be given to both the nature and duration of the assignment following the guidelines contained in Section III of this Memorandum of Understanding. Coordinate with the National Committee the placement of an employee outside the Area Hire as defined in Appendix A Memorandum of Understanding Employee Placement.
(5)	Monitor permanent layoffs caused by the events described in 1(E).

An employee who accepts a VTEP payment shall be provided with basic health care coverage for a period of 6 months dating from the end of the month following the month in which the employee last worked.
An employee eligible for an immediate pension benefit under the Hourly Rate Employees Pension Plan, at the time of his/her break in service (due to participation in a VTEP), shall upon completion of
219
the Allocation Period and application for a pension benefit under the Hourly Rate Employees Pension Plan become eligible for post retirement health care and life insurance on the same basis as other retirees.

VTEP Payment Offsets
Any VTEP payment to an eligible employee will be reduced by the employee’s outstanding debts to the Corporation or to the Trustees of any Guide Corporation benefit plan or program, including any unrepaid overpayments to the employee under the SUB Plan, Exhibit D to the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Effect of Receiving VTEP Payment
An employee who accepts a VTEP payment shall (i) cease to be an employee and shall have his/her seniority broken at any and all of the Corporation’s Plants or other locations as of the last day worked subsequent to the date his/her application for a VTEP payment is received (termination date), (ii) shall have cancelled any eligibility the employee would otherwise have had for a Separation Payment and/or Redemption Payment under Exhibit D-l to the Collective Bargaining Agreement, (iii) shall not be
220
eligible to receive a mutual satisfactory retirement benefit under the Hourly Rate Employees Pension Plan, and (iv) shall not be permitted to retire under the Hourly Rate Employees Pension Plan for the number of months of the allocation period following the termination date.
An employee who receives a VTEP payment, and who is subsequently reemployed by Guide Corporation will not be eligible for any future VTEP payments until the employee has 5 or more years seniority following such re-employment. No seniority used to determine the amount of a previous VTEP payment shall be used in determining a subsequent VTEP payment.
SPECIAL PROGRAM #2
JOBS PENSION PROGRAM
General
The JOBS Pension Program provides pension benefits unreduced for age, payable under the Hourly Rate Employees Pension Plan (Exhibit A to the Collective Bargaining Agreement) subject to the eligibility terms and conditions contained in such Pension Plan, and further subject to such terms and conditions contained herein.

GOALS AND
OBJECTIVES OF JOB SECURITY AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS
The Corporation and the Union recognize that quality and operating efficiency are inextricably wed to job security, and that a high level of quality and operating efficiency requires mutual respect and recognition of each other’s problems and concerns. Accordingly, in
222
addition to the Local JOBS Committee's responsibilities for the JOBS Program and participation in discussions provided in related Letters of Understanding, each committee will focus on cooperative efforts toward our common goal to improve the effectiveness of operations and remove barriers to improvements, increase job opportunities and fully utilize the workforce. The local committees will jointly develop a plan through an exhaustive analysis of the location’s operational efficiency.
Within six months of the effective date of the Agreement, each Local JOBS Committee will review with Guide Management and the International Unton the overall competitiveness of the location’s products and their plans indicating actions, and/or changes needed to improve quality and efficiency at their location and to stimulate job security of the existing workforce and attract new work. Such plans must then be approved by the established National Job Security and Operational Effectiveness Committee,
At the national level, the Committee will have an equal number of Union and Corporate representatives designated by the Guide Corporation Vice President -Industrial Relations and by the Vice President and Director of the GM Department, International Union, UAW,
The National Committee will oversee implementation and administration of these Job Security and
223
Operational Effectiveness Plans. Members of the National Committee will meet jointly with Local Committees to discuss the importance of job preservation and job creation, the reasons for the commitment to increase operational efficiency, suggest possible topics for consideration, and encourage good-faith efforts to develop and implement meaningful local plans.
The National Committee will be available on an ongoing basis as a resource to Local Committees and will review progress at the local level at least on an annual basis.
In these efforts, it is recognized that a great deal of initiative and imagination will be required by the local parties. While not intended to limit such innovation, the following are examples of appropriate areas the local parties may address:
1)	identification of investments in the facility or equipment necessary to improve product quality or operational effectiveness;
2)	the establishment of a team concept and/or pay-for-knowledge wage structure;
3)	the identification of non-labor cost savings and efficiencies;
4)	procedures and plans to review past outsourcing and outside contracting decisions, and
224
identify opportunities for insourcing and new business;
5)	the examination of new forms of work organization, such as job assignments relating to Just-in-Time or other quality enhancement systems;
6)	procedures to review supervisory staffing and support for the initiatives in this Job Security and Operational Effectiveness section of the JOBS Program;
7)	a realignment in skilled classifications to a number of appropriate basic trades to support the needs of the operation or location;
8)	the implementation of skilled trades
team concepts;
9)	initiatives to reduce chronic
absenteeism;
10)	procedures for improved access by
the Local Joint Committee to product plans and other information affecting employment security and operational effectiveness, assuring confidential treatment of such information;
II)	the establishment of work standards on operations that fully utilize employees;
225
12)	the examination of alternative work schedules which provide greater employment opportunities.
Efforts of the local parties to improve operational effectiveness may require change or waiver of certain agreements or practices. It is understood that any such waivers, modifications or changes would not be effective unless agreed to by the local parties involved and approved in writing by the Guide Corporation Industrial Relations Staff and the Guide Department of the Union. Such changes would be effective only at the location(s) specifically designated.

APPENDIX L SOURCING
During these negotiations, the Union raised numerous concerns about the Corporation’s sourcing actions and the impact on employment opportunities. To that end, the Corporation will work with and assist the Union at both the Local and International levels to preserve jobs, replace jobs which may be lost by outsourcing action and to create jobs for Protected employees and laid off employees. It is an objective of the Corporation to grow the business and to continue to rely upon its employees and facilities as the source of its products. During the life of the current Agreement, the Corporation will advise, in writing, the International Union and Local Union of any outsourcing including the number of potential jobs affected. Data regarding incoming and outgoing work will be given in writing on a quarterly basis to the International Union. In this manner, the parties can judge the success of mutual efforts toward improved job security. The Corporation agrees to incorporate the procedures and structure outlined herein when making sourcing determinations during the current Agreement.
The rationale for sourcing actions will consider the criteria of quality, technology, cost, timing, statutory requirements, occupational and related environmental health and safety issues, the impact on long-term job stability, the degree to which the Corporation’s
227
resources can be allocated to further capital expenditures, and the overall financial stability of affected facilities, and the impact on related facilities. Other factors considered by the Corporation before a final sourcing decision is made will include the effect on employment, and job and income security costs, on both a short and long-term basis. Such criteria shall give equal weight to the full impact of a sourcing action on Guide Corporation-UAW represented employment levels and the job and income security of Guide-UAW represented employees. The National parties will jointly further develop the above criteria to be used to address sourcing issues. Only appropriate return on investment and burden will be considered.
Following the development of the sourcing criteria, the parties may form a joint task force to ensure full implementation of such criteria throughout the Corporation and, on an as needed basis, to address any specific sourcing areas of concern identified by the International and Local Union. Pertinent criteria will be applied consistently in comparisons of internal and external supply capability. The International and Local Union will be provided full and timely access to all appropriate data, including financial information, that is pertinent to evaluate product competitiveness and contemplated sourcing. The Union agrees to keep all such information confidential until the Corporation consents to its release. Further, in this regard, the plant Chairperson
228
will designate in writing those Union representatives who will have access to the quote package and related information.
If the Local Committee cannot resolve a sourcing issue, it may file a grievance at the second step of the grievance procedure.
In addition, the following specific commitments have been made to address sourcing-related job security concerns of UAW members'.
1.	Insourcing
The Local JOBS Committee will discuss the practicality of insourcing, in whole or in part, work previously outsourced or new work which the Committee identifies as that which might be performed competitively within the location based on the criteria outlined above.
If it is established that certain work can be performed competitively judged by the above criteria, such findings will be presented to management will adopt the Committee’s proposal and barring unique or unforeseen circumstances, bring the work inhouse. The Union shall thereafter obtain any necessary approval or ratification within 30 days of the decision to bring the work in-house.
2,	Outsourcing
Outsourcing as used herein means the Corporation’s sourcing of work from Guide/UAW
229
locations, including work connected with current, new or redesigned component products.
When the quoting process begins, the local Union at the affected location(s) will review and have access to the entire request for quotation package for this work along with cost book information. Upon receipt of this package at the plant, the Chairperson and the Personnel Director will indicate on the accompanying notice (Notice of Potential Outsourcing) that the information has been received. This notice will include a description of the work involved and will be sent to the Vice President and Director of the Guide Department of the UAW, and to the Vice President of Industrial Relations of the Corporation.
Following receipt of the request for quotation package (or in the infrequent instances where a quote package is not utilized), the local parties will have the opportunity to jointly develop a plan to perform the work competitively, judged by the criteria listed earlier in this Appendix. The local Union will be provided full .and timely access to all appropriate data, including financial information that is pertinent to evaluate product competitiveness and the potential sourcing action. Prior to submission of the initial quote response, the information contained therein will be reviewed by the local parties.
At the close of the quoting process, the local parties will be advised in writing of the most
230
favorable quote response which best meets customer requirements and the terms and conditions contained therein. If this quote response is other than the one submitted by the Local Union, a written notice wifi be issued to the Chairperson which includes the reason for the potential outsourcing, the quote price from the affected location, if applicable, the terms and conditions of the most favorable quote response, the potential jobs impact, and the anticipated impact date. Thereafter, the local parties will be given an additional 30 days, or longer when possible, to meet the terms and conditions of the quote response referenced above. A copy of this notice will be sent to Vice President of Industrial Relations of the Corporation and the Vice President and Director of the Guide Department of the UAW.
If it is established that the work can be performed competitively, judged by the criteria listed earlier in this Appendix, Management will, barring unique and unforeseen circumstances, keep the work in-house. The Union shall thereafter obtain any necessary approvals or ratification within 30 days of the decision to keep the work in-house.
The sourcing authority will not enter into a contractual relationship with a supplier until such time as the designated management representative of the impacted location provides written verification that the above notification procedure and discussion by the JOBS Committee, has taken place.
231
Additionally, International and the Local Union input will be sought by the Corporation as early as possible in the outsourcing dec is ion-making process in order to allow for more thorough discussion and to permit the parties to better assess the impact of outsourcing on the long-term job stability of employees and the financial viability of given Corporate locations.
The Corporation agrees to a full disclosure to the International and Local Union of the procedures utilized in sourcing activities,
3> Temporary Outsourcing
The National Parties agree that temporary outsourcing is not intended to provide a means for circumvention and abuse of the normal outsourcing notification procedures outlined in this Agreement. Outsourcing notices issued for temporary situations such as: breakdown of machinery or equipment, plant rearrangement and/or modernization, spot buys, model changeovers, and factory assists, etc., will be incorporated in the Quarterly Sourcing Report. By incorporating these occurrences in the Quarterly Sourcing Report, it is mutually understood that legitimate temporary outsourcing will not be considered in determining the Corporation’s hiring requirements, pursuant to Appendix K, due to the scheduled return of the outsourced work.
232
The National Parties will monitor all temporary outsourcing to assure the return of such work in a timely fashion in keeping with the intent of this Appendix and Appendix K.
Beginning with the effective date of this Agreement, Temporary Outsourcing Notices which remain open 30 days beyond the date the work was projected to be returned will be converted to permanent notices and the manpower associated with the work will be counted in the Net Sourcing calculation under Appendix K. Upon return of the work after a notice has been converted to permanent status, a notice of insourcing will be issued to the impacted location.
The Parties understand that circumstances do arise wherein the projected return date of temporarily sourced work legitimately requires an extension and the above provisions are not intended to create Appendix K. liabilities in those circumstances.
Any questions or problems that may arise relative to the meaning and intent of this understanding will be reviewed and resolved by the National Parties on a case-by-case basis.
4. Future Product Sourcing
International and Local Union input to early sourcing decisions will be sought by the Corporation.
233
In that regard, the International and Local Union will be notified in writing of the development of any redesigned component product or that a new subsystem or component part is being initiated as a concept.
The implementation of this process should provide the parties with the mechanism to take advantage of every opportunity to use internal resources and to create jobs for Protected employees.
To communicate this new sourcing procedure, the parties agree to conduct joint training seminars as necessary with designated local management and union participants and Corporate International Union participants.
The commitments expressed in this Appendix are intended to contribute significantly to our cooperatively working together to provide Guide Corporation employees in the United States improved job security by growing the business and providing employment opportunities.
234
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON OVERTIME
Introduction
The parties recognize that the manufacturing operations of the Corporation are highly and completely integrated. An interruption at one stage of the production process, whether during the regular work day, work week, or overtime or other premium hours, can, and probably will, cause costly interruptions of the process at earlier and/or later stages. This Memorandum represents an accommodation between the needs of the Corporation and the rights of individual employees to decline overtime work on occasion for a variety of individual and personal reasons.
The parties have earnestly sought during negotiations resulting in the contract dated today, feasible steps that the Corporation might take in scheduling overtime work to provide employees an opportunity to accept or decline work opportunities during such periods, and have reached the following understanding which shall constitute a supplement to the National Agreement.
In order to accommodate the scheduling of overtime in a manner compatible with changing production requirements, while preserving the right, of employees to decline overtime. Local Plant Management will make an election once each model year to schedule overtime operations in accordance with Plan A or Plan B below.

If the employee is not so notified, the employee shall give such notice to the employee’s supervisor before the end of the shift following the day of such notice, provided that if the employee is not so notified until the week in which the overtime is scheduled, the employee shall give such notice by the end of the shift in which the employee receives such notice from Management.
9.	Critical Plants
A.	Critical plants or parts of plants are those that are crucial to the integrated supply system of the Corporation and whose output is essential to meeting the scheduled production of one or more other plants or of customers, and as a result, must operate, in whole or in part, seven (7) days a week.
B.	The Corporation may, from time to time, designate plants or parts of plants as critical, provided, however, that fifteen (15) days prior to making such designations, it will inform the Guide
239
Department of the International Union, which will indicate its objections, if any, to a plant or plants being so designated.
C.	Any plant or part thereof that the Corporation designates as critical, shall, for a period of ninety (90) days after it is so designated, be exempt from the provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding that limit or restrict the right of the Corporation to require employees to work daily overtime or on Saturdays or Sundays or entitle employees to decline to work at such times. After a plant or part of a plant has been initially designated as critical, it may thereafter be redesignated as such by mutual agreement.
10.	Annual Automatic Exemptions
A.	The provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding that limit or restrict the right of the Corporation to require employees to work daily overtime or Saturdays or Sundays shall be ineffective in each assembly plant (a) beginning on a date two (2) weeks preceding the announced build-out date and ending on the build-out date, i.e., when the plant produces for sate the last unit of the model it has been producing; provided, however, the above-mentioned provisions may be ineffective for up to two (2) additional weeks, provided the Corporation gives advance notice of supply or other problems which would interfere with the build-out, and (b) for the week in which it launches, i.e., after the build-out,
240
frames the first unit of a new model, and for three (3) weeks thereafter or until the line reaches scheduled production, whichever is later,

Local Unions will be advised in advance of such designated periods.
11.	Concerted Activity
A.	Any right to decline daily overtime or Saturday or Sunday work that this Memorandum of Understanding confers on any employee may be exercised only by each employee acting separately and individually, without collusion, conspiracy or agreement with, or the influence of, any other employee or employees or the Union or pursuant to any other concerted action or decision. No employee shall seek by any means to cause or influence any other emp loyee to deci ine to work overtime. Violation by any employee of the terms, purpose or intent of this Paragraph shall, in addition to subjecting the employee to discipline, nullify for one (I) month (not including the periods mentioned in Paragraph 10 above) the employee’s right to decline overtime.
241
B.	The Corporation shall have the right to suspend for a period of two (2) weeks (not including the periods mentioned in Paragraph 10 above) as to an affected plant or part of a plant the provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding that limit or restrict its right to require employees to work daily overtime or Saturdays or Sundays, or that entitle employees to elect not to work daily overtime or on Saturdays and Sundays, in the event employees collusively, concertedly or in response to the influence of any employee, or group of employees, or the Union (i) fail or refuse to report for daily overtime work or work on Saturday or Sunday that they have not declined as herein provided, or (ii) decline, as so provided, daily overtime work or work on Saturday or Sunday. If employees who are scheduled to work daily overtime in a plant or department or on Saturday or Sunday fail or refuse to work as scheduled in significantly greater numbers than the Corporation’s experience under this Memorandum can reasonably lead it to expect, such evidence should be carefully considered by the Arbitrator in any decision involving the question of whether their failing or refusing to work the scheduled hours was collusive, concerted or influenced by other persons. The Union shall have the right to present directly to the Arbitrator any claim that the Corporation has acted wrongly in suspending the provisions of this Memorandum as to employees or a plant or part thereof. If the Arbitrator sustains the Union’s claim, the Corporation shall, within sixty (60) days of the 242
date of the Arbitrator’s award, give each affected employee the right to decline work on as many daily overtime days or Saturdays or Sundays as such right was suspended.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING JOINT ACTIVITIES
During current negotiations, the parties discussed the challenges in the marketplace from both foreign and domestic competitors. There is mutual recognition that these challenges require a fundamental change to maximize the potential of our human resources. This change can occur only by building on our current joint efforts and by fostering a spirit of cooperation and mutual dedication that will permit the full development of the skills of our people and meaningful involvement in the decision-making process.

The term “jointness” is understood to mean that concepts for these activities be jointly developed, implemented, monitored, and evaluated. Furthermore, decisions must be arrived at in a setting which is
248
characterized by the parties working together in an atmosphere of trust; making mutual decisions at all levels which respect the concerns and interests of the parties involved; sharing responsibility for the problem solving process; and sharing the rewards of achieving common goals.

Guide Corporation and the UAW hereby agree to meet within 90 days of ratification of the 2004 Guide-UAW National Agreement, and within 90 days of the date they commence meeting, negotiate towards a supplement to the New Guide-UAW National Agreement (“the Supplement"). The Supplement shall be consistent with the terms described in this document.
In the event that the parties are unable to agree on the terms of the Supplement, the New Guide-UAW National Agreement shall continue in effect without modification in accordance with its terms.
Future New Hires
No later than 90 days after the effective date of the 2004 Guide-UAW National Agreement, the parties will enter into discussions for the express purpose of negotiating “competitive wage and benefit levels" for employees hired after the effective date of the Supplement.
The Supplement would cover new hires required in the regular course of business.
279
Wages and benefits in the U.S, automotive and truck component industry would be the benchmark used to determine competitiveness. The resulting wage and benefit levels would be uniformly applied to all Guide Employees covered by the Supplement. As used here, “competitive wage and benefit levels" means wages and benefits that meet those of an appropriate, representative group of UAW-represented employers in the U.S, automotive and truck component industry. This does not mean, however, that the parties will necessarily use a cookie-cutter approach in determining wage, benefit and contractual provisions.
Guide Corporation Commitments
Guide Corporation must commit in definitive, enforceable terms to:
•	make sufficient capital investments in UAW-represented plants to allow them to be competitive, improve product quality, improve operational effectiveness and be viable for the long term;
•	allocate new product to UAW-represented facilities;	1
•	focus on maintaining present GM business, winning back GM business lost since the spin-off and winning new GM business;
280
•	negotiate and implement local operating practices that are competitive in the U.S. automotive and truck component industry;
•	provide opportunities for the flowback of eligible Guide employees to GM facilities, consistent with the provisions of the UAW-GM*Guide Agreement.
•	develop enhanced retirement and separation incentives for Guide employees.
•	provide opportunities for Guide hired employees to be hired into GM facilities consistent with the
provisions of the UAW-GM National Agreements.

■ 292
ARTICLE 8	- RATIO/LAYOFF-RECALL/SEN1ORITY
The ratio of apprentices to joumeypersons shall not exceed one (1) apprentice to each eight (8) joumeypersons employed in a respective trade. In trades where there are less than eight (8) joumeypersons, one (1) apprentice may be assigned in that trade.
When there are no joumeypersons laid off or available in a trade, the Corporation and the Union (Bargaining Committee) may mutually agree to add apprentices over and above the one (1) to eight (8) ratio.
When a reduction in force occurs in a trade where apprentices are employed, apprentices first shall be laid off until the ratio of apprentices to joumeypersons is one (1) to eight (8) or major fraction of eight (8), Thereafter, apprentices shall be laid off proportionately to maintain such ratio.
In the event that the ratio at the time of layoff is less than one (1) apprentice to eight (8) joumeypersons then the ratio existing at the time of layoff shall be maintained, based on the major fraction principle, until all joumeypersons in the respective trade are recalled.
293

For example, if there are four apprentices in any specific trade and a reduction in this number is required due to lack of work, apprentices who are probationary employees shall be laid off first. Thereafter, the first hired shall be the last laid off and the last laid off shall be the first to be reinstated.
In the event the reduction in force is due to unusual circumstances, including but not confined to, a transfer of or discontinuance of an operation, major technological developments, the elimination or consolidation of classifications, the discontinuance of a shift, or a drastic reduction in the level of work resulting in a heavy reduction in the skilled work force, the parties locally shall mutually agree to an acceptable layoff and recall plan.
An employee having seniority in the plant who enters the apprentice training program shall, during the period of their apprenticeship, retain and accumulate seniority in their former seniority group; and if laid off or dismissed from the apprentice training program, they shall be returned to their former seniority group in the plant in line with such established seniority in their former seniority group.
Upon completion of the apprenticeship, journeyperson seniority will be from the apprenticeship entry date, all other seniority, if any, will be canceled. However, it is understood that any
294
previous seniority toward pensions, vacations, etc. will be maintained.
ARTICLE 9	- DISCIPLINE
The committee shall have the authority to discipline an apprentice and to cancel the apprenticeship agreement at any time for just cause pertaining to the apprenticeship, such as inability to learn, unsatisfactory work, poor attendance or lack of interest in work or education. This shall not limit the right of the Corporation to discipline apprentices for cause for matters not related to their training as apprentices. Such discipline by the Corporation shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
ARTICLE 10-WAGES

I.

(iii)
When a complaint has not been resolved by the review body within 90 days or where, despite satisfactory resolution of the particular complaint by the review body, there is evidence that equal opportunity practices of the apprenticeship program are not in accordance with this part, the department my conduct such compliance review
310
as found necessary an will take all necessary steps to resolve the complaint.
(2.)
Where no review body exists, the department may conduct such compliance review as found necessary in order to determine the facts of the complaint, and obtain such other information relating to compliance with these regulations as the circumstances warrant
(3.)
Sponsors shall provide written notice of the above complaint procedure to all applicants for apprenticeship and all apprentices.
Adjustments in Schedule for Compliance Review or Complaint Processing
If, in the judgment of the council, a particular situation warrants and requires special processing and either expedited or extended determination, it shall take the steps necessary to permit such determination if it finds that no person or party affected by such determination will be prejudiced by such special processing.

RELIEVING EMPLOYEE FOR COMMITTEEPERSON DISCUSSION
Consistent with the purpose of the Grievance Procedure, a rule of reason should be applied in determining whether an employee should be excused from the job in order to confer with the Committeeperson handling the employee’s grievance. A rule of reason should likewise be applied when, due to production difficulties, excessive absenteeism, or other emergencies, it will not be possible to immediately relieve the employee from the job. On many jobs discussion between the employee and the Committeeperson is entirely practical without the necessity for the employee being relieved. On the other hand, an employee working on a moving conveyor, in an excessively noisy area, should be permitted a reasonable period of time off the job and a suitable place in which to discuss the grievance with the Committeeperson. This shall not interfere with any local practice which is mutually satisfactory.

The number of consultants and the terms of their retention will be determined by the National Executive Committee and the scope of its research program.
336
VII.	ERGONOMICS
Guide Corporation and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America recognize that cumulative trauma disorders (hereafter “CTDs”) are an occupational illness present in the automobile industry.
The parties also recognize that the control of CTDs is a complex issue often requiring the application of a number of different control methods and technologies that may differ from operation to operation. These include an ergonomically appropriate design, which includes feasible engineering and administrative controls that materially reduce or eliminate job related CTD stressors, employee and supervisory training and education, early recognition of the problem, early and proper medical diagnosis, treatment and care.
Guide Corporation will continue to administer an Ergonomics Program at UAW represented locations utilizing guidelines established between Guide Corporation and the International Union, UAW. Guide Corporation recognizes the accomplishments of the joint ergonomics process and realizes the need for continued efforts to further reduce work-related CTDs. Guide Corporation is committed to progressively pursue improving and enhancing the current process with the UAW. The purpose of the program is to deal cooperatively and constructively with the problem of CTDs in the workplace.
337
Guide Corporation re-committed to fixing jobs that are identified as presenting a corresponding and documented risk of employee injury. The parties recognize that effective corrective action for jobs which present a documented risk of injury, require the timely use of sound judgement in combination with training, experience, and the following:
* Analysis results from the risk factor checklist and secondary analysis tools (when utilized)
• injury/illness history of both the job and the worker
» The history and future plans of the job
Also, seats, chairs, and mats can be considered appropriate solutions to control specific ergonomic risk factors. The Corporation agrees to leave such devices in place when they are provided in accordance with the guidelines in the UAW-Guide risk factor checklist.
The Plant Safety Review Board has the responsibility for supervising and supporting the ergonomics program. In plants with 750 or more employees, the parties will establish a Joint Ergonomics Technician Team, which will be comprised of one full-time UAW Technician and one Guide Management Technician. In addition, plants with 2,000 or more employees will supplement the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team with a second full-time UAW Technician. In plants with less than 750 employees, the Plant Safety Review Board will identify the Ergonomics Technician Team as needed, and to administer the Ergonomics Program. Planjg 338	.jfl
Safety Review Boards in plants with 4,000 or more employees can petition for an additional UAW Technician based on the level of activity required to meet the needs of the Ergonomics Program in the plant. Plants with 750 or more employees that do not experience enough ergonomic activity to sustain the level of resources agreed upon can also petition for a variance. Any petition must be based on the level of sustained activity required to meet the requirements of the Ergonomic Program for that plant. In addition, the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team at any location can request additional interim resources when the ergonomic needs of the plant exceed what the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team can be reasonably expected to accomplish in a timely fashion. Such requests will be reviewed and approved by the Plant Safety Review Board. The local parties may refer unresolved issues or concerns to the National Executive Committee.
The National Executive Committee has established selection criteria for the Joint Ergonomics Technicians. The UAW Technicians will be selected from the local workforce and appointed to the position by the Vice President and Director of the Guide Department of the [ntemational Union.
The responsibilities of the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team will include, but not be limited to, the following:
•	Conducting job analysis
•	Providing recommendations for corrective action
339
•	Monitoring the implementation of job improvements
*	Conducting review and follow up
*	Reporting monthly to the Plant Safety Review Board
The Joint Ergonomics Technician Team will coordinate their efforts through the Local Health and Safety Committee, and resources from appropriate departments; e.g., Medical, Engineering, Skilled Trades, and Production, will be made available to support the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team. The Joint Ergonomics Technician Team will report monthly at each Plant Safety Review Board and Local Joint Health and Safety Committee meeting and keep minutes specific to ergonomics. Quarterly reports will be provided to the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee, the Plant Safety Review Board and the National Executive Committee. The status of the ergonomics process for each facility will be reviewed at the Corporate Review Board meeting with assistance from the Ergonomics Managers. Discussions concerning significant problems or roadblocks will take place at these meetings.
The parties agreed to use the jointly developed process for the use of outside consultants in situations where in-house efforts concerning reduction of job CTDs are not successful. The consultant's reports will be made available to both the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team and the co-chairs of the National Executive Committee and the Plant
Safety Review Board.
340
Based on the results of the job analysis program, each facility shall implement feasible measures to control CTD risk factors. The Joint Ergonomics Technician Team, in conjunction with input from the workers, engineering, supervision, skilled trades and others, as appropriate, will make recommendations for corrective actions in accordance with the current ergonomics process. Once it is determined through the agreed upon ergonomics process that a job requires correction, recommendations for corrective action will be developed using the results of the jointly agreed upon analysis tools. A good-faith effort will be made to accomplish correction of identified CTD hazards at a particular job or work station within six (6) months, after the Local Health & Safety Committee determines that corrective action is required. The parties acknowledge that there may be times when it may take longer than six (6) months to make the proper correction, and those reasons need to be documented. The corrective action will include any combination of the following:
Engineering controls such as design, selection, location and orientation of tools, parts and equipment will be used.
Administrative controls (e.g., job enlargement, job rotation, and appropriate job assignment) will be used in the following manner: as interim abatement measures pending engineering changes, when engineering changes are determined to be insufficient to significantly reduce the CTD L	341
stressors, and in those instances when an administrative control is the most effective fix among the possible choices for corrective actions.
The Plant Safety Review Board will monitor the corrective actions being implemented and any unresolved issues or concerns can be referred to the National Executive Committee.
Guide Corporation will inform and instruct affected employees on the controls implemented at their work station and how they are to he used.
The facility will maintain documentation of modification activity, including the job or work station identified for modification, number of employees affected, the nature of modification, the projected completion date, the actual completion date and, where available, the cost of the modification when completed.
Plants and facilities will include “ergonomics” in their planning process and this information will be available to the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team.
Guide Corporation recognizes the importance of identifying and addressing ergonomic issues early in the development process and values the importance of receiving input from plant ergonomic personnel. Feedback from the Joint Ergonomic Technician Team on site specific ergonomic issues and practices will be provided to the design process at the earliest appropriate planning/design stage. This process will be evaluated and reviewed during the life of the agreement. Guide.
342	B
Corporation will take into account existing jointly established analysis methods when developing internal ergonomic design recommendations for advanced product programs.
For the purpose of job analysis, ergonomic consideration will be given to jobs identified through the use of OSHA Injury and Illness records, medically confirmed symptoms questionnaires, Worker Compensation reports, and work-related sickness and accident data. Based upon the above data, a list of jobs requiring analysis will be maintained. The job analysis will be conducted using the UAW-Guide Risk Factor Checklist, as a first level screening tool, which includes the UAW-Guide lift guideline as identified in the Practical Ergonomics Training (PET). The parties agree to utilize objective and scientific methods to analyze the results of a Risk Factor Checklist completed on a job. A good-faith effort will be made to conduct the initial job analysis within two (2) months of when a job is identified as having a potential CTD risk factor. Job analysis and redesign will include input from employees whose jobs are affected. The original risk factor checklist will be used, along with the symptoms questionnaire, to re-evaluate the controls that were implemented, to confirm their effectiveness.
The joint parties will provide appropriate training for the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team as well as other resources responsible for conducting the ergonomics process at each facility. This training may include Practical Ergonomic Training (PET) with the 343
understanding that any person receiving PET may conduct a first level job analysis using the UAW-Guide Risk Factor checklist.
The UAW-Guide Corporation Ergonomics Awareness Education and Training Program will continue to be provided for newly hired employees as well as employees returning to work from an extended leave, who have not received awareness education and training previously.
All newly hired and transferred employees will be informed on the proper use of the tools and equipment required to be used in the performance of their assigned duties.
Guide Corporation shall annually review with employees the application of ergonomic principles to the prevention of CTDs on their jobs during regular safety talks.
The parties agree to continue to maintain a Medical Management Program for the early detection, evaluation, and treatment of CTDs at all UAW-Guide facilities. The Medical Management Program will provide for common medical practice guidelines for patient evaluation and treatment, follow-up, workplace walk-throughs, and restricted work placement.
Guide Corporation agrees to continue implementation of a CTD Education and Training Program for medical physicians (including contract personnel) that render medical services related to CTDs. The introduction in this training includes the effect of poor job design, identifying problem jobs^ 344	4
and potential solutions based on ergonomic stressors. This training also includes medical instruction and early recognition, evaluation, treatment, and prevention of CTDs. All medical personnel (including contract personnel) will receive CTD education and training prior to rendering medical services related to CTDs. The Vice President of Industrial Relations and staff will ensure that appropriate CTD training has been provided.
Guide Corporation shall authorize Medical Department personnel to attend education and training conferences that address CTDs, including but not necessarily limited to regional conferences, teleconferences, and Corporate conferences. Where practical, conference proceedings will be videotaped and made available to medical personnel who do not attend the conference.
Employees will be encouraged by the Medical Department staff, line supervision, and Joint Ergonomics Technician Teams to report early signs and symptoms of CTDs to the facility’s Medical Department. The supervisor will provide an Ergonomics Symptoms Questionnaire and Evaluation Record form to employees upon request and will encourage them, during their safety talks, to utilize the process. Completed forms will be forwarded to the Health and Safety Representative. An employee with a possible CTD, as indicated in the questionnaire, will be scheduled to report to the facility’s Medical Department. A brief non-invasive examination for the evaluation of the possible CTD k	345
I
will be performed by a physician or nurse. In instances where it has been determined that early signs and symptoms of CTDs are confirmed, the completed symptoms questionnaire and pertinent information from the medical evaluation will be referred to the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team.
Guide Corporation will audit a random sample of medical records, Workers Compensation reports, and work-related sickness and accident data to verify the OSHA 300 log is correct.
The Vice President of Industrial Relations and staff are responsible for the quality, implementation, and compliance by focal Medical Departments with the Guide Medical Management Program, as it applies to ergonomics. This program will be reviewed periodically for continuous improvement and elimination of unnecessary complexity.
The National Executive Committee will monitor implementation of this process and consider changes for continuous improvement.
VIII.	HEALTH AND SAFETY TRAINING
The National Executive Committee will be responsible for identifying employee job-related health and safety education and training needs, which are mandated by the government or would be applicable across UAW-Guide sites.
it is recognized by the National Executive Committee that the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee should be involved in identification oL
346	A
what health and safety training is needed and appropriate for their particular location, including monthly safety talks.
A local training needs analysis will be conducted at each location. Based on this analysis, a comprehensive training plan consistent with the National Executive Committee’s requirements and local plant initiatives will be developed, and the necessary resources will be identified as part of the business planning process to provide such training. The Plan will specify target audiences, recommendations for completion dates, class size, and methods of delivery. The Plan will be reviewed by the Plant Safety Review Board and the National Executive Committee, to ensure consistency with requirements. The Local Joint Health and Safety Committee shall be responsible for monitoring the progress of their local training plan.
The National Executive Committee will continue to provide training resources for use by the plants. The National Executive Committee will direct and oversee the development and administration of required training courses. Alternatively, the National Executive Committee may approve the use of other commercially developed courses. The National Executive Committee with input from the Plant Safety Review Boards will establish the appropriate selection criteria for plant health and safety trainers. Trainers selected will receive necessary instruction in conducting the specific training. Hourly plant trainers ^ill be selected by the Local Union.
—	347
Required Health and Safety training will be introduced to plants by top Union Leadership and Corporate Management. The National Executive Committee will monitor and evaluate all training programs. The National Executive Committee encourages the participation of International and Regional Servicing Representatives and members of management in Health and Safety training programs.
IX.	SAFETY TRAINING FOR CHAIRPERSONS OF SHOP COMMITTEES WITHOUT A DESIGNATED HEALTH AND SAFETY REPRESENTATIVE
The Chairpersons of Shop Committees in locations which do not have a designated Health and Safety Representative, may upon request* attend training or instruction programs provided by the Corporation.
In addition, the Corporation advises that employees who wish to enroll in courses of instruction relating to industrial health and safety at approved educational institutions will be eligible to apply for tuition refund for such courses subject to the terms and conditions of the Corporation’s Tuition Refund Program.
X.	LOCKOUT POLICY
During the current negotiations the UAW and Guide Corporation discussed their mutual concern regarding fatalities and serious injuries to employees, including operators, performing repaiu 7^9
service and maintenance activities on machinery and equipment. The parties agreed that, the Lockout -Energy Control program must be universally implemented and enforced throughout the Corporation. In order to be effective, the parties reaffirmed that the elimination of the potential for injury from hazardous energy is critical to worker safety.
It is the policy of Guide Corporation and endorsed by the UAW that:
Lockout is required where employees may be exposed to hazardous energy which could cause injury. Exposure means that the employee is in a position to be injured by released energy;
Where an employee is exposed to potential injury from expected machine energy/motion, the exposure must be eliminated. If the exposure cannot be eliminated, the machine will be locked out.
Each location will maintain an effective Lockout - Energy Control program which will apply to all employees.
XI.	MONITORED POWER SYSTEMS
The UAW and Guide Corporation recognize the importance of designing processes and equipment with effective health and safety controls. Therefore, the parties agreed to integrate “Monitored Power Systems” into the existing Lockout/Energy Control procedures. The fundamental process begins with performing an initial Task Based Risk Assessment
349
(TaBRA) on any process where “Monitored Power Systems” may be appropriately used.
The use of these systems when integrated into the existing Lockout/Energy Control procedures, can further reduce and eliminate the risk of exposure to employees. However, it is understood by the Parties that Lockout must still be performed whenever the exposure cannot be controlled or eliminated as determined by the Task Based Risk Assessment process.
XII.	UAW-GUIDE HEALTH PROMOTION
The National Executive Committee, will coordinate the development of a health promotion program to be made available for use by all UAW represented employees. This program, to be supported by joint funds to the extent agreed upon by the Committee, is designed to focus on leading factors such as hypertension (high blood pressure), high levels of fat (cholesterol) in the blood, overweight, cessation of tobacco smoking, prevention of the spread of AIDS, and certain other factors, which place employees at high risk of disease. Among other tools developed to accomplish this is a health assessment questionnaire to be completed by participating employees.
Consideration for the inclusion of additional diagnostics such as lung function and/or glucose tolerance will be determined by the National Executive Committee. The National Executive Committee will monitor the program and its usag^
and make necessary adjustments to encourage participation.
The National parties discussed smoking cessation programs and acknowledged that such programs were beneficial and agreed to review their effectiveness.
XIV.	REFUSAL OF HAZARDOUS WORK
A worker, who has a reasonable belief that their work assignment may result in serious physical injury, including illness, should immediately discuss the safety aspects of the work assignment with their supervisor. Failing resolution, the issue may be discussed with the District Committeeperson.
Should technical consultation be requested by the supervisor or committeeperson, the local health and safety committee will be notified to respond before further action is taken. In line with the Memorandum of Understanding on Health and Safety, upon joint recommendation, the machine or operation will be taken out of service to perform any and all corrective action.
Failing resolution of the matter, it may be taken up in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on Health and Safety, Section IV, Complaint Procedure.
XV.	IMPROVEMENT OF MEDICAL AND INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE SERVICES
The Corporation reserves the fight to select and hire appropriate consultants for health and safety —	351
services. The Union will be informed in advance and be provided an account based on specific legitimate requests regarding qualifications of the consultant(s) engaged by the Corporation to provide services. The Union may recommend consultants for Management’s consideration. Included in such recommendation should be an account of the qualifications of the consultants recommended by the Union.
The Local Joint Health and Safety Committee will be informed regarding the engagement of consultants to provide industrial hygiene and safety services. Qualifications of such consultants will be provided upon request. Reports prepared by such consultants will be provided to the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee, who will provide a copy to the local Industrial Hygiene Technician and the co-chairs of the National Executive Committee. In addition, the Corporation will provide a list of consultants under Corporate contract for industrial hygiene services to the National Executive Committee and update the list when changes are made.
Management in conjunction with the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee will assess the need and where required, a facility will develop and implement an air sampling plan. Such plans should be reviewed and implemented on an appropriately scheduled basis. Guidance in the preparation of such plans will be provided by the National Executive Committee. Based upon the air sampling plan, an.

hourly employee selected by the Director of the Guide Department of the International Union, working under the technical supervision of a Guide Industrial Hygienist, may assist in the collection of air samples. Job function key elements of the Industrial Hygiene Technician will be established by the NJC, and the appointee will demonstrate competency by successfully completing required training determined by the National Executive Committee. Reports of industrial hygiene and noise measurement surveys will be provided to the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee who will provide it to the co-chairs of the National Executive Committee, if appropriate.
XVI.	ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL
Environmental information and reports, which are required to be reported to various governmental regulatory agencies, will be made available to the National Executive Committee on a regular basis. Guide Corporation will notify the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee of significant environmental remediation projects, and spills or releases that are subject to government reporting requirements. The Local Joint Health and Safety Committee will forward such information to the co-chairs of the National Executive Committee.
1S1
XVII.	PERIODIC JOINT AUDITS OF PLANTS
The UAW and Guide Corporation agree that a formal system of performance review is an effective means of obtaining and re-enforcing compliance with established Health and Safety requirements. The parties, therefore, agree that the National Executive Committee on Health and Safety will conduct audits to evaluate each facility’s health and safety performance. The purpose of the audits is to review the effectiveness of health and safety activities reaching the operations level and being implemented across the workplace. The parties also agree to enhance the current audit process by developing methods to assure the process is consistently applied and delivers measurable results. Additionally, the parties have developed a method to address repeat audit findings for identical deficient conditions found on consecutive audits.
The National Executive Committee will establish joint review team(s) to conduct such reviews. The review team(s) will be comprised of safety representatives from Guide Corporation and the UAW-Guide Department of the International Union.
A plant visit itinerary will be established by the National Executive Committee on Health and Safety which will be scheduled through appropriate channels. The team will meet with the Plant Manager, Shop Committee Chairperson and the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee before beginning the

performance review, and have a closing conference upon completion of the on-site review. The finalized report will be prepared and sent to the plant and Guide Corporation within thirty (30) days of the review. Following the finalized report, the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee after review by the Key Four, will reply, addressing issues contained in the report. All such review information shall remain the confidential property of Guide Corporation and will not be released without the expressed written permission of Guide Corporation.
The parties agree that through the joint audit process, they will verify that al! facilities have an effective emergency notification system and that it is periodically tested to achieve the best possible response time for the emergency involved.
XVllI,	NEW TECHNOLOGY/ SPECIFICATIONS
Discussions were held during these negotiations regarding Health and Safety being designed into new equipment, refurbished equipment and/or new processes. Guide Corporation and the UAW recognize the advantages of designing processes and equipment with effective health and safety controls. The main objective to the “Designin’’ effort was to develop common design specifications for application across the Corporation, in the manufacturing processes, that incorporated health and safety program requirements. The Local Health & Safety Committee serves as a technical resource to work with the engineering group to assure
- .
that UAW-Guide health and safety program requirements are incorporated into the common design specifications.
In an effort to promote improved communications regarding such matters, as early as possible and preferably in the zero phase of the planning in the design process and incorporating lessons learned, as described in Design for Health and Safety Specification (DHS), The parties agree to perform Task Based Risk Assessments (TaBRA), on new equipment and manufacturing systems, and on existing equipment and manufacturing systems, where locally agreed to and approved by the Plant Safety Review Board. A Task Based Risk Assessment will be performed after the detailed designs are completed on new manufacturing equipment and/or processes. A review of anticipated equipment and/or processes with the shop committee and the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee will be held. The local Joint Health and Safety Committee may be required to travel to vendors, plants, or other locations to participate in a Design Review of such equipment or processes as outlined in the DHS specification. The Union will have an opportunity to discuss Health and Safety concerns with Management and make recommendations designed to improve the equipment and/or process, consistent with the common design specifications where they have been established by the “Design-In” activity in the DHS specification. Additionally, TaBRA data will be incorporated at several points or gate reviews early

the decision process as described in the DHS specification. Reviews will be made at the appropriate level for new rechnology/process awareness and to discuss safety related issues and/or concerns. Recommendations from the Local Health & Safety Committee will be submitted to the National Executive Committee.
Machinery, equipment or processes will not be released for production without the written approval of the Plant Safety Administrator. Where required, lockout placards will be posted for all applicable energy sources. The parties discussed and recommitted themselves to continue the implementation of the UAW-Guide Lockout Placard Guidelines. These placards will continue to be reviewed during a UAW-Guide joint audit and will be reviewed during safety observation tours.
The Local Joint Health and Safety Committee will consult with operators, skilled trades, engineers, supervisors or related personnel to ensure that required safeguards provide effective protection and do not interfere with their ability to perform their assigned tasks.
The National Executive Committee will continue to oversee the development of communications material regarding the design-insafety activity for the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee. This material includes informational material, guidelines, standards, checklists, CD-ROM Disks, and other appropriate material to clearly communicate the common design specifications, k-.	TC-f
XIX.	CONTROL OF CHEMICAL EXPOSURES
The Corporation will continue to set Occupational Exposure Guidelines (OEG’s) to assess employee exposure to chemicals in Guide facilities, as needed. Guidelines are considered necessary whenever existing OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits do not sufficiently protect the worker, or when there is no applicable OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit. Guidelines will be based on consensus standards and recommendations in addition to available scientific evidence. Guide Corporation will require plants to use OEG’s as the basis for evaluating employee exposures and for taking appropriate corrective or preventive action.
The Corporation will review Guidelines with the National Executive Committee on an annual basis and will discuss proposals for necessary changes. When changes to the existing list are proposed, the National Executive Committee:
•	Will review the proposed change and its rational.
*	Will review existing air sampling data to determine the prevailing exposure level to the chemical or substance under consideration.
•	May seek the advice of consultants who are recognized specialists in Occupational Health & Safety concerning the proposed change. These consultants will be responsible directly to the National Executive Committee and will assist and.
advise on matters stipulated by the National Joint Committee. The number of consultants and the terms of their retention will be determined by the National Executive Committee.
The Corporation and Union agree to continue to study the potential health effects of cutting fluids for the purpose of establishing an exposure guideline and to determine the need for additional controls where cutting fluids are used. Where warranted, based on confirmed results the National Executive Committee will devise an action plan and make appropriate recommendations to the Corporation regarding coolant exposures. In this regard, Guide will establish a plan to be reviewed with the National Executive Committee that reduces exposure to coolant aerosol. The plan will include a phased-in approach, as appropriate, across affected plants taking into consideration plant process and/or product changes.
The Joint Parties agree that prior to implementing new chemical technology/proc esses and changes to current chemical processes, reviews will be made al the appropriate level for awareness and discussion of safety related issues and/or concerns.
The Local Joint Health and Safety Committee will review process exhaust ventilation systems at facilities where air is recirculated. Such review will be in accordance with guidelines established by the National Executive Committee. Air Jesting will be performed when requested by the
Local Joint Health and Safety Committee. To the extent feasible, these tests will be incorporated in the previously described air sampling plan. Recirculation will not be permitted where employee health and safety cannot be assured.
Medical surveillance for respiratory effects of machining fluids will be offered to employees who regularly work in operations with machining fluids. Such medical surveillance will include a standardized respiratory symptoms questionnaire and pulmonary function test. For personnel newly-assigned to such operations, pre and post shift pulmonary function tests will be done at least once during the first year.
Records of laboratory testing and coolant additions will be maintained and made available to the local joint committee for health and safety upon request.
The National Executive Committee will establish a medical surveillance program for implementation at Guide Corporation. This will include an air sampling plan and chemical controls as related to plant operations.
XX.	ACCESS TO DATA
During 2004 negotiations, the Corporation agreed to continue to utilize a health information system for the purpose of making it easier for the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee to retrieve and analyze injury/iilness data.
The reports in the Health Information System, that include the OSHA 300 overrides, wilU
continue to be available for access by the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee.
A joint procedure has been established for review of the quarterly audit results of HIS injury/illness records with the Local Joint Health and Safety committee, by the Medical Department. This medical department audit includes a review of Worker’s Compensation cases as part of the current audit of Health Information System injury/illness records.
The National Executive Committee will establish a represented employees' mortality registry. Local Joint Health and Safety Committees may request the mortality experience pertaining to the facility they represent from the National Executive Committee. The National Executive Committee will access the Corporate Mortality Registry as it pertains to UAW represented employees for such information.
XXL NOISE ABATEMENT /CONTROL PROGRAM
The joint parties recognize that the Corporation has had a comprehensive Hearing Conservation and Noise Control Program for the purpose of continuous incremental improvements in noise reduction. In accordance with this program, each plant is required to have a Noise Control Committee. The Noise Control Committee will consist of representatives from Plant Engineering, Operations, Medical, Industrial Hygiene, Finance, Purchasing, the Local Joint Health and Safety 361
Committee, Industrial Hygiene Technicians (where available), and others as deemed appropriate by the Plant Safety Review Board, such as certain skilled trades personnel, and/or other employees. The Noise Control Committee has the responsibility to seek input from plant personnel in identifying noise sources and potential ways to reduce noise levels.
The Noise Control Committee will:
•	Ensure audiometric testing is performed for employees exposed above 85 dBA.
*	Perform an annual evaluation of the noise abatement plan and provide recommendations for improvement to the Plant Safety Review Board.
•	Ensure reports follow formats specified in Guide Hearing Conservation and Noise Program SL 3.0.
•	Ensure new and rebuilt equipment meet the Guide Sound Level Specification SL 1.0.
•	Identify planned maintenance items related to noise control.
The Corporation will continue to conduct the annual notse exposure survey and provide findings to the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee and summary noise abatement program findings to the National Executive Committee on Health and Safety.
The Noise Control Committee will meet regularly, record minutes, and report quarterly to the Plant Safety Review Board regarding progress on the Noise Abatement Plan. The annual evaluation will include:
362
Copies of the plant’s noise
abatement program.
•	The number of employees that experienced standard threshold shift.
•	The number of employees that are required to wear hearing protection.
*	The number of employees at risk of exposure at or above 85 dBA.
•	The number of employees at risk of exposure above 90 dBA.
XXII.	PLANNED MAINTENANCE
The National Executive Committee will jointly identify health and safety requirements to be integrated into the “Planned Maintenance Action Strategy." These requirements will include both those that are regulated by government agencies and those established in UAW-Guide programs. The Local Joint Health and Safety Committee will also review the “Planned Maintenance Action Strategy" to assure local regulations and/or practices currently in effect are included.	•
XXIII.	WORKING ALONE	'
The parties have discussed the Corporation’s policy regarding the assignment of employees to tasks in isolated locations or confined entry spaces. The Corporation explained that when work assignments involve situations hazardous to an employee, appropriate precautions will be taken in accordance with safe work practices, including air 363
sampling and ventilation when necessary, communications systems, personal surveillance arrangements and, as required, adequate support personnel. When an employee brings to Management’s attention a situation where they are reasonably concerned that their safety is jeopardized because they are working alone, Management will provide a copy of an applicable written Safe Operating Practice to the employee detailing precautions to take to perform the task safely. If one has not been developed and reviewed, Management will give the employee job instructions to perform the task safely and within 24 hours make a written request to the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee for the development of a Safe Operating Practice. Safe Operating Practices will be developed by the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee within 5 working days and will be reviewed by the Plant Safety Review Board at the next regularly scheduled meeting. This will not change or restrict any mutually satisfactory local practices.
XXIV.	NO HANDS IN DIES
The Corporate policy has been and continues to be “No Hands in Dies”. Implementation of “No Hands in Dies” in the plant requires provision for expendable hand feeding tools, slide feeds, sliding bolsters, automatic or semi-automatic operation, die cutouts or other means and procedures whereby the operators are not required to place their hands into the point of operation. In addition, well disciplined 364
procedures for use of die blocks and safety lock-outs for maintenance and setup personnel are imperative. An intensive orientation program for operating supervisors, and process and facilities engineers may also be advisable.
XXV.	PLASTIC INJECTION MOLDING MACHINES
During these negotiations, the parties discussed die safe operation and guarding of plastic injection molding machines. It is recognized that hydraulically operated machines of this type may present hazards, different than mechanical power presses. Plastic injection molding machines will continue to be safeguarded in accordance with OSHA requirements and National Consensus Standards (ANSI). The National Executive Committee will continue to explore alternative methods of safeguarding the machines.
XXVI.	CONTRACTOR SAFETY
It is the Corporation’s practice to provide outside contractors with Corporate Health and Safety policies and procedures and, where applicable, relevant site specific UAW-Guide Health and Safety work practices. Additionally, Guide requires that construction or maintenance contractors comply with applicable Federal, State, and Municipal Health and Safety regulations as stipulated in the Guide/contractor contract.
365
Where the nature of the construction or maintenance requires that the contractor’s employees work together with UAW-Guide employees, Guide will require as a condition of the construction or maintenance contract the contractor’s commitment to abide by applicable UAW-Guide plant/site Health and Safety work practices.
The Plant Safety Review Board will monitor Contractor Safety activity to insure compliance, and any unresolved issues or concerns can be referred through the safety process to the National Executive Committee.

JOBS PROGRAM — VOLUME RELATED LAYOFFS —SEL
GUIDE CORPORATION
March 21. 2004
Mr. Cal Rapson
Vice President and Director
Guide Department
International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Rapson:
Subject: JOBS Program - Volume Related Layoffs -SEL
During the course of these negotiations, the Corporation and Union have provided Guide employees with substantially increased job security through the new SEL feature of the JOBS Program, which protects eligible employees against layoff for virtually any reason except volume related market conditions. The parties recognize that employment levels may continue to fluctuate as a result of the cyclical nature of demand in our industry. The Corporation acknowledges, however, the importance of minimizing layoffs even in instances where volume related declines are unavoidable. In particular, the Union stressed the importance of reducing overtime and shifting dual sourced production requirements to UAW-Guide plants in the event of overall market -	371
declines. The Corporation agrees to take these and other actions whenever practical.
In any event, however, employees affected by volume related declines would exercise their seniority in line with local seniority agreements and, if otherwise eligible, receive benefit treatment in accordance with the Supplemental Agreements attached to the current Guide/UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement
Identifying the complex inter-relationships of all the factors involved with volume fluctuations is a difficult task. The parties agreed, however, that for purposes of determining SEL related protections they must identify just those volume declines that are attributable to market related conditions, and in turn just those declines that are not affected by Corporation sourcing choices of components that compete with or act as replacements for components produced by Guide employees covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement. In other words, volume declines that are attributable to the Corporation's production and purchase arrangements with any related or unrelated party (subsidiaries, affiliates, captives, joint ventures, transplants, etc.) would be considered an exception to the overall volume related exclusion in Section 1(D) of the JOBS Program.
The parties also agreed that the complexity of these issues requires that the Corporation provide Local JOBS Committees adequate notice of any impending volume-related layoff, as well as all information necessary to fully evaluate its underlying causes, the
372
extent to which such decline is associated with a Corporate sourcing action and the appropriate number of SEL eligible employees that should be affected by the layoff.
The Coiporation recognizes, moreover, that it has the responsibility to justify implementation of a layoff in the context of the protections spelled out in the JOBS Program and the guidelines outlined in this letter. Similarly, the Coiporation also accepts the responsibility of proving that the proper number of employees are recalled to SEL positions when a volume related decline is reversed, again within the context of the JOBS Program protections and the guidelines outlined in this letter.
The following are to be considered as illustrations to assist the parties in determining when volume related declines support reductions in employment. These illustrations should not be considered all inclusive.
•Market Related Conditions - Included in this category is customer preference of one vehicle over another that might result in a decline in sales of a U.S.-built Guide components that requires the layoff of employees, provided such sales declines are not the result, for example, of increased sales or increased market share of competitive captive imported components or joint venture components or any other components sold in the U.S. by Guide but not produced in a UAW-Guide plant.
— Example of Market Related Conditions
373
(1)	There is a decline in economic activity which depresses retail sales of UAW- Guide components. Lower production levels require the layoff of employees. Guide Plant A, employing 4,100 SEL-eligible employees, is the sole source of Component Z for the U.S, market; it is required to layoff one shift, or 2,000 employees. The number of SEL-eligible employees at the plant remains at 4,100, including 2,000 open positions for laid-off employees. While the plant is down to one shift, the Corporation decides to outsource taillight B, which reduces employment requirements by 250 employees per shift. Two hundred fifty (250) employees are placed on Protected employee status. There is no impact on the SEL numbers.
U.S. lighting component demand picks up to prelayoff levels and the second shift is called back. Active employment at the plant goes back to 4,100, As the second shift is called back and the plant is back to pre-downtum production levels, an additional 250 employees are placed on Protected employee status which now leaves a total of 500 employees. The SEL plant number remains at 4,100,
(2)	Guide Plant B (5,000 SEL-eligible employees) is not the sole source of Component Y, which is also produced in Canada for the U.S. market, in Plant BC. Plant BC supplies one-fourth of the U.S. demand for Component Y. An economic downturn in the U.S. reduces demand for Component Y by 160,000, In accordance with SEL guidelines, volume related employment reductions cannot exceed Plant B’s share of pre-downtum volume levels (three-fourths) applied to the reduced level of overall sales. Production in
374
Plant B is therefore reduced by no more than 120,000 parts, causing layoffs of 2,000 workers. Plant B’s number of SEL-eligible employees remains at 5,000, including 2,000 open Bank positions.
Component Y demand in the U.S. market picks up by 60,000. The Corporation decides to produce 30,000 of those units in Plant B and the rest in Canadian Plant BC. The increase in production is not accomplished in proportion to pre-layoff production shares; to comply with SEL, the Corporation must recall 250 employees which it assigns to Protected employee status in addition to the 500 employees required for the pick up in production.
•Product Discontinuance - Because of the introduction of a new U.S.-built Guide component or a non-allied company component not sold by Guide, sales of another Guide-manufactured component may decline, and production of the latter component must be curtailed necessitating reductions in employment. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program.
— Examples of Product Discontinuance or Phase Out and Changes in Retail Preference
(1)	A new U.S.-built Guide component (or any other new non-allied company component which is not marketed by the Corporation) is introduced. Sales of Component X decline by 50%, and production must be curtailed. The necessary reductions in employment are made through layoffs, keeping the number of SEL-eligible employees at the component plant at the same level.
375
(2)	Component Plant C, employing 1,400 SEL-eligible people, produced half of the taillights for Vehicle X; the other half are produced at a Guide plant in Mexico. The volume reduction is made totally at Plant C rather than split proportionately between Plant C and the plant in Mexico. Therefore, in accordance with the JOBS guidelines half of the 700 employees who are not required any longer in Plant C due to this event are assigned to Protected employee status, and the other 350 employees would be laid off. The number of SEL-eligible employees at Plant C remains at 1,400, including 350 open volume related positions.
•Faulty Product - Headlamp volume may decline because of faulty parts in a vehicle that cause customers to place the product in disfavor. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program.
•Changes in Retail Preference - Guide volume may decline because of customer preference shifts — in tum affecting mix and therefore demand, e.g., halogen headlamp preference shifts to H.I.D. headlamps; option preference swings; high product content to low product content. Such reductions would be considered volume-related declines under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program.
•Non-Guide Commercial Customer Preference -Cancellation or declines in product volume for Guide Corporation manufactured parts that are sold to unrelated firms may cause volume changes. Such
376
volume reductions would be considered volume-related declines under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program, — Examples of Non-Guide Commercial Customer Preference
Plant A produces heavy duty headlamps for off road driving. Volume is reduced as a result of a decline in SUV sales. One hundred fifty (150) employees are laid off; 150 open volume-related positions are established. At the time production is back to pre-layoff levels the Corporation introduces two robots which replace 25 employees. According to SEL guidelines all of the 150 employees are recalled from layoff, 25 of them are assigned to Protected employee status, and the number of SEL-eligible employees remains equal to its prelayoff level.
•Non-Guide Produced Headlamps - If sales of a new or replacement headlamp manufactured by an allied company for Guide, that competes with a headlamp manufactured by the Corporation, results in reduced sales of the Corporation-manufactured headlamp, the action would not be volume related and layoffs under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program would not be permitted, •— Example of Non-Guide Produced Headlamps
The Corporation outsources a headlamp that it markets in competition with Headlamp W manufactured by UAW-Guide employees. This results in reduced sales of headlamp W. Employment requirements are reduced, but this event is not covered under Paragraph 1(D) of the JOBS Program and layoffs are not permitted. This protection also extends to employees producing UAW-Guide components which are manufactured for Headlamp W.
377
•Other Components or Materials
It is recognized that reductions in vehicle production will often be accompanied by reductions in component production. When reductions in vehicle production are volume related, pro-rata reductions in component production will normally be considered volume related as well. However, to the extent a reduction in component production results from a shift in sales to components sold by Guide but not produced in UAW-Guide plants, the reduction will not be considered volume related. Furthermore, when a like or similar component is dual-sourced from a UAW-Guide and a non-UAW-Guide plant, production declines at the UAW-Guide plant will only be considered volume-related to the extent the dual-sourced component produced at that plant continues to be produced in its pre-production decline proportion.
— Examples:
(1)	Automotive Assembly Plant A receives regular headlamps from an UAW-Guide plant and heavy duty headlamps from a non-UAW-Guide plant. A volume decline occurs in regular headlamps because of customer preference for heavy duty headlamps. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under the Program but would not have to be taken proportionately because the headlamps would not be considered like or similar components.
(2)	Automotive Assembly Plant B receives regular headlamps that have plastic fastening brackets from a UAW-Guide plant and regular headlamps that have steel fastening brackets from a non-UAW-Guide plant. The headlamps are used interchangeably and would be
378
considered like or similar components. Therefore, any volume declines in headlamp production would have to be taken proportionately to be considered volume related.
As implied by these examples, there are many variations to be considered when determining volume actions. This letter is intended to provide a framework within which Local and National JOBS Committees may review the applicability of Paragraph 1(D) to volume reductions.
If a Local JOBS Committee cannot agree on a situation being defined as volume related, the matter may be appealed to the National JOBS Committee for resolution.
Very truly yours,
Robert H. Steams Vice President

International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Rapson:
‘ During the current negotiations regarding the JOBS • Program — SEL, the parties discussed utilization of Protected employees at some length. The Corporation and the UAW have agreed that productive utilization of Protected employees is critical to the viability of our operations, and to the continued success of our JOBS Program.
It was agreed that local JOBS Committees must make every effort to ensure that Protected employees are fully utilized on meaningful assignments. The parties have recognized that both underutilized employees and unproductive assignments are contrary to the spirit of the Agreement. It is the intent of the Parties
380
to utilize Protected employees in accordance with previously agreed practices.
For purposes of the JOBS Agreement, "non-traditional” work could encompass any assignments) within the facility (except regular productive work, including the direct production, assembly or fabrication of vehicles or components) which can efficiently and safely be performed by the individuals involved.

As a result of your deep concern about job security in our negotiations and the many discussions which took place over it, this will confirm that during the term of the new Collective Bargaining Agreement, until March 19, 2009, the Corporation will not close, nor partially or wholly sell, spin-off, split-off, consolidate or otherwise dispose of in any form, any plant, asset, or business unit of any type, beyond those which have already been identified, constituting a bargaining unit under the Agreement.
In making this commitment, it is understood that conditions may arise that are beyond the control of
382
the Corporation, e,g., act of God, and could make compliance with this commitment impossible. Should such conditions occur, the Corporation will review both the conditions and their impact on a particular location with the Union.
Should it be necessary to close a plant constituting a bargaining unit consistent with our past practice, the Corporation will attempt to redeploy employees to other locations and, if necessary, utilize the “Special Programs” identified in Appendix K of the Guide-UAW National Agreement or other incentivized attrition programs as agreed to by the National JOBS Committee.
Very truly yours,
Robert H. Steams Vice President

Dear Mr. Rapson:
During the current negotiations, the parties discussed situations where the Local Union was required io refund union dues to a large number of employees. This occurred when employees were laid off after a dues deduction had been made but before they had worked sufficient hours to be liable for dues under the UAW Constitution for that month.
The Corporation advised the Union that in those situations where it is known in advance that a large number of employees (100 or more) are scheduled to be permanently laid off and are not anticipated to work the necessary hours to owe dues under the UAW Constitution, the Financial Secretary may
387
request that the plant delay for one week the deduction of monthly dues. In similar situations where the number of employees being laid off is less than 100, the Financial Secretary may request that the regular deduction of monthly dues for these employees be suspended. These requests must be submitted to the plant Personnel Director one week prior to the payroll period that monthly dues deductions are made.
Upon request of the Personnel Director, the payroll department will initiate the required steps to accomplish this procedure.

MEMORANDUM OF JOINT COMMITMENT: EMPLOYEE PLACEMENT FOR CLOSED AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Both parties recognize the importance of fully utilizing Guide-UAW employees in regular, productive work. In this regard, the parties will continue to build on past joint efforts aimed at providing opportunities and incentives designed to encourage laid-off, Protected and active employees to relocate to available job opportunities at UAW-Guide facilities outside of their current location, with particular emphasis on placing employees from closed or discontinued operations.
The parties, in committing to continued cooperation in this employee placement effort, recognize that necessary productivity and quality improvements, together with the effects of normal and accelerated attrition activities, have had and will continue to have a significant impact on staffing requirements at Guide locations.
The parties agree that an employee placement, relocation and stabilization program will be jointly developed for closed and discontinued operations which will encourage accelerated retirements, relocation and placement of affected employees. Such program will be tailored on a mutually agreeable
389
basis to the individual needs and circumstances of affected locations. A detailed plan, including a range of specific alternatives from which the employee will choose, will be offered to affected employees at the earliest practical time but in no event later than 60 days after the closing or discontinuation of an affected operation.

Dear Mr. Rapson:
During current negotiations, the Union expressed concern that the increased requirements on the Committeepersons’ time for attendance at management meetings was, on occasion, preventing employees from receiving representation in a timely manner.
In this regard, the Corporation and the Union agreed that when such a situation exists, the local parties will allow the Alternate District Committeeperson to handle current grievances until such time as the District Committeeperson becomes available.
391
In the case of District Committeepersons who are also members of the Shop Committee pursuant to Paragraph (11) of the National Agreement, the local parties will allow their Alternate District Committee persons to handle current grievances during the period that such District Committeeperson is legitimately involved in meeting with Management at Step Two and Step Three of the Grievance Procedure or during other mutually agreed upon local contract negotiations meetings.
Any problems in this area should be raised with the Guide Department of the UAW or with the Corporation Industrial Relations Department.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING REGARDING DRUG TESTING
During 2000 National Negotiations, the parties discussed at length the worsening drug problem in our country and the rising incidence of chemical dependency. Chemical dependence on the part of employees impacts the workplace in terms of quality, productivity, and effectiveness of operations, while threatening the safety and well-being of both the ch emica Uy-dependent employee and his/her coworkers. As a result, the parties agreed to institute a screening program and to periodically review it during the term of the agreement and make adjustments where deemed appropriate. This memorandum reflects such screening program and adjustments to it.
Process
Employees may be screened for substance abuse (alcohol and drugs) in the following instances:
1. As part of a return to work physical for employees returning from substance abuse related sick leaves of absence.
1. As required by law; such as, F.A.A., DOT. and D.O.D.
393
All testing and reporting will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines established by the Department of Health and Human Services.
Implications
It is not the intent of the testing requirements to imply that an employee is impaired at the time a sample is provided for testing. An individual who tests positive will be handled in the following manner:
1.	FIRST POSITIVE:	The
employee will be deferred from working for approximately two weeks and scheduled for followup testing. EAR services are to be offered to the employee and the employee is to be referred to the CDR. The employee will automatically be subject to further unannounced screening for a period of three months.
2.	SECOND POSITIVE: The employee will again be deferred from working for approximately two weeks and scheduled for followup testing. EAP services are to again be offered to the employee and the employee is to be referred to the CDR. The employee will automatically be subject to further unannounced screening for a period of six months.
3.	THIRD POSITIVE:	The
employee wifi again be deferred from working for approximately two weeks and scheduled for followup testing. EAP services are to again be offered to the
394
employee and the employee is to be referred to the CDR. The employee will automatically be subject to further unannounced screening for a period of twelve months.
4.	FOURTH POSITIVE: The employee will be discharged regardless of prior disciplinary record or length of service. Grievances protesting irregularities in the testing procedure may be taken through the grievance procedure; however, extent of penalties arguments are not subject to the Arbitrator’s discretion.
All positive test results will be subject to a mutually agreed to third party evaluation upon request of either party. Problems selecting a third party may be referred to the National Executive Committee. Employees who refuse to be tested will be treated as though they had tested positive.
Once terminated, if the employee satisfactorily documents to local management and local union six months continuous sobriety, within the 60 months following discharge, the employee will qualify for reemployment under Article VII of Document 21 of the National Agreement.

Dear Mr. Rapson:
During the course of the current negotiations, Guide i Corporation and the International Union, UAW reaffirmed the National and Local Equal Application Committees. The Parties have agreed to the following:
For many years the Corporation and your Union, in their respective fields, have been leaders in adopting and effectuating policies against discrimination because of age, race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability or sexual orientation, and sexual harassment and to this end the parties have expressly incorporated provisions in their National Agreement that both insures adherence to that principle in all aspects of employment at Guide Corporation and
398
provides the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure for the resolution of alleged violations of that principle.
The parties recognize the desirability of increased communication and cooperative effort on this subject (1) to encourage employees and grievance representatives to use the grievance and arbitration procedure as the exclusive method for prompt resolution of all claims of violations, (2) to determine the cause of such claims in order to reduce the probability of these claims arising or recurring, and (3) to maintain liaison with appropriate federal and state civil rights agencies for the following purposes: (a) to increase understanding, (b) to promote and encourage the use of the grievance and arbitration procedure in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation in many forums simultaneously which is frequently time consuming, contradictory and hence, nonproductive to relieving employee problems, (c) to seek solutions to mutual problems, (d) to relieve tensions in this area, and (e) to exchange information, expertise and advice, (4) to provide and monitor jointly approved diversity training modules.
The National Equal Application Committee will be composed of two (2) representatives of the International Union, one of whom will be a member of the International Union’s Civil Rights Committee, or a designee, and two (2) representatives of the Corporation, one of whom will be active in the
399
Corporation’s equal employment opportunity programs. The National Committee will meet quarterly or more frequently if mutually deemed desirable or necessary and its functions shall be the following:
a.	Review and discuss ways and means of encouraging employees and grievance representatives to use the grievance and arbitration procedure as the exclusive method to resolve claims of violations.	.
b.	Conduct or arrange for investigations and/or studies into the cause of equal employment opportunity and discrimination problems and tensions in an attempt to prevent such problems from arising or recurring,
c.	Maintain liaison with appropriate federal and state agencies for purposes set forth in the second paragraph of this letter.
d.	Review and discuss ways and means of implementing Guide Corporation policy regarding employment of the individuals with disabilities.
e.	Advise and counsel Local Plant
Equal Application Committees.
f.	Review and jointly develop the
necessary tools that would allow the parties to
400
monitor and evaluate UAW-Guide diversity initiatives.
At each plant or facility that the National Agreement covers, a Local Plant Equal Application Committee will be established consisting of three (3) representatives of the Local Union and two (2) representatives of Management. The three (3) representatives of the Local Union shall consist of the Chairperson of the Shop Committee, the Chairperson of the Civil Rights Committee of the Local Union and the Local President. The two (2) representatives of Management shall be the Plant Manager, or a designated representative, and a member of Management at the plant active in the Corporation’s equal employment opportunity program. Local Plant Equal Application Committees will meet on a scheduled quarterly basis, and shall have the following duties:
a.	Recommend to the National Committee ways and means of promoting use of the grievance procedure as the exclusive method for resolving claims of violations.
b.	Suggest guidelines for Union and company representatives active in the grievance procedure in the proper and prompt handling of grievances alleging such claims.
c.	Recommend to the National Committee means for determining the cause of equal
401
employment opportunity and discrimination problems and tensions in the plant.
Where the Chairperson of the Civil Rights Committee of the Local Union is an employee of the plant wages will be paid for time spent attending the quarterly meetings.
Copies of the minutes from these meetings will be made available to the Union.
In addition, the Chairperson will be permitted to leave work up to four (4) hours per week during straight time hours to conduct in-plant investigations of written grievances alleging a violation of discrimination as provided for in the National Agreement.
The parties continue to recognize their legal and moral responsibility for assuring that all Guide Corporation employees have equal employment opportunities and freedom from discrimination. Consequently, the function of the National Equal Application Committee and Local Plant Equal Application Committees shall be advisory, consultative and cooperative. While the Corporation and the Union will welcome the recommendations the Committees may make, the Committees may not commit either party to a specific course of action. However, the Union agrees that it will encourage its members to utilize the grievance and arbitration procedure as the means of resolving claims or
402
complaints against the Corporation which allege a violation.

The Work/Familv team and the employee must concur with this probationary period which is defined as not less than six months nor more than two years and it must be understood by all parties that resumed use could result in termination of employment during this period.
The above items (one through five) will be administered jointly by the Work/Familv team for those employees returning under these conditions. Any conditions of continued employment agreed to by Management* the Union and the employee are considered contractually binding and non-compliance could result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge. The employee’s previous disciplinary record and action which may be taken for further
419
misconduct will be matters reserved to the actual settlement of any grievancetsl involved and/or will be resolved between the bargaining unit representative and Labor Relations,
The seniority status of the employee must be specified as either a new hire or reinstatement of former seniority. If seniority is reinstated, all rights and privileges which would normally accrue in line with the reinstated seniority under the terms of the national or local agreement must be granted.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING UAW-GUIDE QUALITY PROCESS
During the course of prior negotiations, Guide Corporation and the International Union, UAW, held extensive discussions about the quality of our products and services. There is ongoing recognition on the part of both parties to the National Agreement that the cornerstone of job security for all Guide Corporation employees is the design, engineering, and manufacturing of the highest quality, customervalued products and services. This is reflected in the extensive efforts both parties have devoted to the subject of quality, both on the national and local levels, exemplified by the formation and institution of the UAW Guide jointly developed Quality Process. The Quality Process is Guide Corporation’s only Total Quality Management System utilized at UAW-represented locations.
Further, the parties recommitted themselves to the ongoing implementation of the UAW Guide Quality Process. This jointly developed quality improvement process emphasizes customer satisfaction and enthusiasm, continuous quality improvement, and elimination of waste in the design, engineering and manufacturing of products and services provided.
During the past several years, the Corporation in cooperation with UAW leadership, together with the
421
men and women of Guide Corporation, have worked together within a spirit of teamwork to improve product and service quality. This spirit of cooperation has resulted in substantial improvement in the quality of the Corporation’s products and services.
The parties recognize that the design, engineering and manufacturing of the highest quality, customervalued products and services is essential to secure the Corporation’s position in the global market and assure job security. The Corporation stated that high-quality products and services have to be the result of a total quality improvement process if Guide Corporation is to be the world leader in vehicular lighting.
Accordingly, Guide Corporation’s process for total quality management is the UAW-Guide Quality Process the one process for total customer satisfaction and enthusiasm utilized at UAW-represented locations. Although Management has the ultimate responsibility for the Quality Process, it is recognized that UAW leaders and members are valuable partners in the development of the process, the action strategies, and its implementation plans.
This relationship is reflected in the extensive efforts both parties have devoted to the subject of quality, both on the national and local levels, exemplified by the institution of quality councils at appropriate levels throughout Guide Corporation.
422
It is recognized that the point where product design, technology, process and materials come together and must work in harmony is at the worker/supervisor level in the organization. High-quality products and services result from a wellmanaged process that motivates employees to work together within a spirit of teamwork to continuously improve customer satisfaction and enthusiasm. In this process, it is recognized that seeking opportunities for continuously improving product and service quality must be the foundation for customer satisfaction. It is acknowledged that it is ultimately Management’s responsibility to establish and assure product and service quality requirements. Further, it is Management’s responsibility to provide the processes for continuous quality improvement that support all employees based on the Beliefs and Values, as recorded in the Guide Corporation Corporate Policy Manual referenced as "Quality Process’’ (revised 1/10/95). This manual outlines specific policies to be followed throughout Guide Corporation and states in part:
"Guided by the Beliefs and Values, implementation of the Quality Process will lead to the highest satisfaction of the ultimate customers - those who buy Guide Corporation products and use our services. This value system represents significant expectations. It is crucial that behavior is aligned with these values and that decisions and actions are tested against them. We must constantly monitor our

behavior to be certain our actions are consistent with the commitments that have been made to the men and women of Guide Corporation."
It is recognized that performance of high-quality work is everyone’s responsibility and, as a result, it is intended that the Quality Process Representatives and UAW leadership working together' with local management will reinforce other ongoing quality improvement activities.
The parties also discussed the necessity for all Guide Corporation employees to take individual responsibility for product and service quality. Management's business planning process will include the necessity for providing employees with the appropriate training, methods and systems, materials, and equipment in an appropriate environment based on the Quality Process Beliefs and Values to perform their work, it is then incumbent upon employees to exercise diligence and properly perform their work to produce the highest quality, customer valued products and services.
It is only through personal commitment from every Guide Corporation employee to provide the highest quality, customer-valued products and services that we will satisfy our customers and maintain job security for all. Quality Council leadership at all levels within Guide Corporation and the UAW will review and apply the training and principles set forth in the Quality Process

Internationa! Union, UAW
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Rapson:
The UAW and Guide have worked together for many years to understand and promote diversity in the workplace, a goal we absolutely agree on and are fully committed to. The parties have long recognized that diversity is the collective mixture of our similarities and differences. Both organizations recognize that diversity includes race and gender, as well as broader dimensions such as family status, religion, sexual orientation, education, abilities, disabilities, military status, union, non-union, language and many others.
Diversity is a positive asset to an organization because only by leveraging our diversity will we be able to achieve the kind of relationship that we know is necessary if Guide Corporation is to prosper and
438
T
provide good jobs that allow employees, both union-represented and salaried, to be secure in today’s complicated world.
Our vision is to have a workplace that naturally enables the people of UAW-Guide to fully contribute and achieve personal fulfillment. The UAW and Guide continue to support and integrate the many voices of diversity, increasing our appreciation of cultural differences, beliefs, values, abilities, disabilities and sexual orientation. The UAW and Guide work together at the national and local levels to develop and deliver diversity training. The principles that guide UAW-Guide Diversity Initiatives include:
-	creating a learning organization;
-	seeking diverse input and involvement;
-	leading the cultural change process; and
-	pursuing continuous improvement in diversity actions and programs.
The National Equal Application Committee works with local Plants to provide educational materials to the UAW-Guide workforce regarding diversity and equal employment opportunities. They also identify community agencies involved in civil rights and diversity activities and work with community leaders to discuss and work towards solutions to mutual problems regarding discrimination. Action plans can be developed to include such activities as:
439
-	utilizing plant communication methods to celebrate cultural diversity and share the UAW-Guide joint commitment to diversity;
-	seeking input from identifiable diverse employee groups and individuals;
-	identifying opportunities to celebrate diversity with educational awareness events and exhibits;
-	communicating how diverse employee groups can participate in plant and community projects; and
-	recognizing activities that arc inclusive of diverse employee groups.

JOINT PROGRAM REPRESENTATIVES
GUIDE CORPORATION
March 20,2004 Mr. Cal Rapson
Vice President and Director
Guide Department
International Union, UAW
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Rapson:
During these negotiations the parties discussed at length the need to focus our current joint program representatives on specific programs designed to assist our employees and the management in implementation of an improved working environment.
Over the years, we have agreed to a number of different joint program representatives appointed by the Vice President and Director of the Guide Department, UAW, and, in some cases, by the local management and union leadership at the direction of the Co-Chairman, National Executive Committee to carry out and administer certain negotiated agreement programs in the following functions:
441
•	Health and Safety
*	Joint Activities
•	Accommodating DisAbled People in Transition (ADAPT)
•	Employee Assistance Program
*	Human Resource Development
*	Joint Training
•	Quality Process
Each plant in Guide Corporation depending on employee population, may have employees assigned to the above functions. Each lime new programs have been negotiated, people were assigned to perform die tasks associated with each program to the extent that we now have several well-trained experts in those fields. The parties recognize that over the years priorities have shifted and, as a result, there is a need to carefully analyze the programs that currently require increased emphasis, such as, employee assistance, health and safety, etc. As a result, the parties have concluded that these well-trained resources can now be deployed or reassigned to programs requiring special attention.
It is recognized that each plant location has its own unique culture and needs; therefore, the local joint leadership group (Plant Manager, Personnel Director, Local Union President and Chairperson of the Shop Committee) will determine where their current full time representatives will be allocated to best serve the employees of the organization. It is recognized that at
442
some locations additional representatives may be required to perform tasks associated with the newly determined local focus and at others less. In any event, the total number of new and current full time joint program representatives shall not exceed the number provided for below;
Plant Population	Number of
Representatives
Up to 200	1
201 to 400	2
401 to 600	3
601 to 1,000	4
1,001 to 5,000	Ratio of 1 ;250
5,001 and above	Ratio of 1:275
In the case of bargaining units between 1,001 to 5,000 and 5,001 and above, the number of representatives in a given bargaining unit will be determined by the number of represented employees (active, temporary layoff and Protected) divided by the appropriate ratio number. Where the fraction of the result is .5 and above, the number will be rounded up to the next highest whole number and where the fraction is less than .5, rounded down to the whole number.
Nothing in this agreement limits or is intended to interfere with any local mutually agreed upon projects or initiatives falling outside the scope of this
443
document that may provide additional staff resources to meet the specific objectives of the local parties.
Each plant has submitted a plan for deployment of these resources in accordance with specific guidelines issued by the National parties. All such representatives will be appointed by the Vice President and Director of the Guide Department. UAW. Such plan will include the names and assignments for each of the local representatives assigned to Joint Programs and will be forwarded to the National parties for approval prior to implementation. Likewise, as individual plant needs and priorities change, the local parties are afforded the flexibility to submit revised plans for National approval.
When plant population changes occur which would increase or decrease the number of representatives, such population changes must be in effect for a period of six consecutive months before such adjustment is made in the number of representatives, in which case such adjustment will be made at the conclusion of the six month period. In the event such population change results from the discontinuance or addition of a shift, the opening of a plant, or the cessation of a plant’s operations, the adjustment in the number of representatives will be made within the first twenty working days following the first day such population change occurs. Other situations involving a sudden significant change in the number of
444
employees at a location may be discussed by the Corporation and the Guide Department of the International Union.
When a reduction or increase in plant population calls for a change in the number of representatives, the local parties will be required to submit a revised deployment of resources plan for approval. AU representatives in either case will also be appointed by the Vice President and Director of the Guide Department, UAW,
It is understood that the Representatives re-deployed in these locally determined areas of special focus and attention may require additional training. It is agreed that such training will be provided.
It is agreed that such representatives shall function in accordance with governing provisions of the Guide-UAW National Agreement germane to their area of focus.
During overtime hours, joint program representatives in the areas of Joint Activities, Accommodating DisAbled People in Transition (ADAPT), Human Resource Development, and Joint Training will be scheduled to perform joint program-related activities if they would otherwise have work available in their equalization group.
Jj
Longer range, the National Executive Committee will establish a joint process aimed at effectively
445
consolidating, simplifying, integrating, focusing and achieving better utilization of joint programs at the plant level.
The spirit and intent of this document is to provide increased focus on joint employee programs and to more fully utilize the experience and talents of the representatives assigned to joint programs. The parties are committed to working together in a spirit of cooperation to improve our relationship and the effectiveness of our joint programs. The result of such cooperation will improve the working environment in our plants for all Guide employees.
Any problems relating to the implementation of this document may be raised by either party and it is understood that any necessary modifications may be made by mutual agreement between the Corporation and the international Union.

Dear Mr. Ranson:
During current negotiations, the parties reaffirmed their intent to continue the interpretation regarding Paragraph (76) expressed tn the Louis G. Seaton letter addressed to Personnel Directors dated February 13, 1969. The text of this letter is as follows:
“As a result of a series of discussions between the International Union, UAW, and the Corporation, it has been agreed that the provisions of Paragraph (76) of the 1967 GM-UAW National Agreement will be applicable to temporary employees with more than thirty (30) days’ of employment who are released or discharged. This provision, of course, is not
+47
applicable to any employee laid off due to fluctuations in manpower requirements.
“The parties also agreed that this interpretation is not retroactive. Accordingly, cases currently in the procedure involving temporary employees should be processed on their merits without regard to the procedural requirements of Paragraph (76).”
The provisions of Paragraph 76 will apply to employees hired pursuant to Appendix A as of the date of hire. •

ARBITRATION LETTER
GUIDE CORPORATION
March 20.2004 Mr. Cal Rapson
Vice President and Director
Guide Department
International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Rapson:
During the course of the current negotiations, the parties reviewed the Grievance Procedure provisions of the National Agreement for the purpose of identifying certain problems that have been encountered under those provisions in processing grievances to arbitration. Generally, it was recognized that the procedure, as currently constituted, has worked well. At the outset of the 1979 negotiations, the number of open cases on appeal to arbitration was at the lowest level in many years despite the fact there had been an increase in the number of grievances filed. However, the Union stated that some instances have occurred wherein grievances protesting an employee’s loss of seniority, discharge or a series of disciplinary layoffs leading to a discharge, have met with delay in the procedure following their
449
consideration at the Third Step and their resolution at the Arbitration Step.
In view of the above, the Corporation agreed to provide the Union with a 60 day summary of cases appealed to the Arbitrator protesting the loss of seniority, the discharge of employees and also those protesting progressive disciplinary actions which involve an employee whose discharge is also under protest tn an open appeal case. This information will enable both the International Union and Corporation to monitor the number of such cases on appeal to the Arbitrator at any given time and to take remedial action on any particular cases which may be subject to undue delay.
In addition, the parties agreed to schedule regular meetings between the respective Arbitration Staffs to establish future scheduling, to explore alternatives that could increase the frequency with which plant appeal cases are addressed and to review other problems of mutual concern.

REINSTATEMENT OF GRIEVANCES
GUIDE CORPORATION
' March 20,2004 Mr. CatRapson
Vice President and Director
Guide Department
International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue
< Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Rapson:
During the current National negotiations, the parties acknowledged the desirability of ensuring prompt, fair and final resolution of employee grievances. The parties also recognized that the maintenance of a stable, effective and dependable grievance procedure is necessary to implement the foregoing principle to which they both subscribe. Accordingly, the parties view any attempt to reinstate a grievance properly disposed of as contrary to the purpose for which the grievance procedure was established and violative of the fundamental principles of collective bargaining.
However, in those instances where the International Union, UAW, by either its Executive Board, Public Review Board, or Constitutional Convention Appeals 453
Committee has reviewed the disposition of a grievance and found that such disposition was improperly effected by the Union or a Union representative involved, the Guide Department of the International Union may inform the Corporation’s Industrial Relations Staff in writing that such grievance is reinstated in the Grievance Procedure at the step at which the original disposition of the grievance occurred.
It is agreed, however, that the Corporation will not be liable for any claims for damages, including back pay claims, arising out of the grievance that either are already barred under the provisions of the National Agreement at the time of the reinstatement of the grievance or that relate to the period between the time of the original disposition and the time of the reinstatement as provided herein. It is further agreed that the reinstatement of any such grievance shall be conditioned upon the prior agreement of the Union and the employee or employees involved that none of them will thereafter pursue such claims for damages against the Corporation in the Grievance Procedure, or in any court or before any Federal, State, or municipal agency.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a decision of the arbitrator on any grievance shall continue to be final and binding on the Union and its members, the employee or employees involved and the Corporation
454
and such grievance shall not be subject to reinstatement.
This letter is not to be construed as modifying in any way either the rights or obligations of the parties under the terms of the National Agreement, except as specifically limited herein, and does not affect sections thereof that cancel financial liability or limit the payment or retroactivity of any claim, including claims for back wages, or that provide for the final and binding nature of any decisions by the Arbitrator or other grievance resolutions.
It is understood this letter and the parties obligations to reinstate grievances as provided herein can be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days notice in writing to the other.
It is agreed that none of the above provisions will be applicable to any case settled prior November 1, 1998.

Mr. Cal Rapson
Vice President and Director
Guide Department
International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr, Rapson;
The relief time in manufacturing plants on operations on which the employees’ manual operations are continuous and which cannot be left unattended and for which the Corporation provides “tag” relief, and on certain other operations that the Corporation determines are likewise of such a nature as to give the employees no control over their work pace, shall be twenty-three (23) minutes before lunch and twenty-three (23) minutes after lunch on a regular eight (8) hour shift, making a total of forty-six (46) minutes. The amount of such relief shall be modified accordingly for a shift other than a regular eight (8) hour shift. The Plant Management may, by mutual agreement with the Local Union, allocate the relief
456
before and after lunch to not more than two (2) periods before lunch and two (2) periods after lunch.
Sufficient labor will be provided to enable employees to obtain the above relief taking into consideration that the first hour at the start of the shift and the first one-half hour after lunch are not ordinarily required for relief except in emergencies.
The parties have agreed to continue the following informal procedure to address complaints regarding this subject.
1.	The complaint may be raised by the Chairperson of the Shop Committee directly with the Plant Personnel Director.
2.	If not resolved, the Chairperson may refer the problem to a representative of the Guide Department of the International Union who may request a meeting with Guide Corporation’s Industrial Relations Department to discuss the complaint and take appropriate action.
This letter and this informal procedure are not intended to prejudice the position of either Guide Corporation or the UAW.

QUALITY PROCESS IMPLEMENTATION REDEPLOYMENT AND MEANINGFUL WORK
During the term of the 1990 GM-UAW National Agreement and through the direction of the North American Operations (NAO) UAW-GM Quality Council, the focus of the Quality Process evolved and changed from development to implementation. During this same period, GM North American Operations experienced operating losses requiring more efficient practices and a renewed focus on product quality.
Implementation of Synchronous Workshops, Accelerated Workshops (i.e., P1COS), Lean Manufacturing and other quality improvement activities, such as, best practices, resulted in health and safety, ergonomic, and operational improvements affecting quality and the cost of GM products and services. In many cases, these activities resulted in UAW-represented GM employees being placed in a JOBS Bank under the terms of the 1990 GM-UAW National Agreement. The Union leadership felt they could not be party to asking their members to assist in “working themselves out of a job” by supporting these efforts. In any joint effort, job security and “people issues” had to be considered so that people would be redeployed to meaningful work. The issue
458
was discussed at the January 13, 1992, GM Quality Council meeting resulting in specific commitments to integrate synchronous efforts into the joint Quality Process and explore ways to employ people more effectively with meaningful work and help improve the business.
When funding for the JOBS Bank was exhausted and the program discontinued, Management recognized that employee support and involvement in plant quality and productivity improvement activities were essential. As a result, on March 2, 1993, after the JOBS funding was exhausted and employees in the JOBS Bank were laid off, an “Employment Policy” was made effective which resulted in employees being retained at work and not laid off when such employees were impacted by jointly initiated product quality and operational effectiveness improvement efforts.
During the 1993 negotiations, the parties discussed the above events and the Onion provided examples of successful redeployment processes. These redeployment processes, implemented at divisions and plants, resulted in people being retained at work and redeployed to meaningful assignments after they had been made available as a result of quality and productivity improvements and other initiatives.
Following 1993 negotiations, the parties agreed to jointly develop guidelines for redeployment processes, similar to those reviewed by the parties, to
459
assist plant and staff locations with planning for redeployment opportunities. Such guidelines were intended to assist the local parties with the development of plans that put first emphasis on redeployment of employees to meaningful assignments, which included regular productive assignments and “non-traditional” work, as well as efforts to competitively retain or insource new work.
Accordingly during these negotiations, Guide Corporation and the Union restated their intent to not place employees in underutilized or unproductive assignments or only contemplate utilization of the job security provisions of the National Agreement. Further, the parties agreed to reissue the document “Guidelines for Redeployment and Meaningful Work” (QN#2251) and that they would re-emphasize the importance of the local parties developing redeployment plans.

SUBCONTRACTING—IMPLEMENTATION PARAGRAPH (183)(d)

Dear Mr. Rapson:
During the current negotiations the UAW complained that procedures set forth in the outside contracting provisions are not being satisfactorily implemented by Management in many instances.
This letter is intended to clarify the intent and purpose of this provision:
1.	The “advance discussion” except where time and circumstances prevent it, will take place “prior to letting the contract for the performance of maintenance and construction work,” before any decision has been made as to whether the work should be contracted out. The “advance discussion” will include information as to “why Management is
461
contemplating contracting out the work.” It is evident that except as noted above, since Management is only “contemplating contracting out the work” when the “advance discussion” takes place, Management should not have made any decisions concerning whether or not to contract out the work before such “advance discussion” is held.
2,	Management should advise the local Union of the “nature, scope and approximate dates of the work to be performed and the reason or reasons (equipment, manpower etc.), why Management is contemplating contracting out the work.” The parties agree that historical understandings make reference to “manpower, skills, equipment and facilities” and also as to whether the Corporation “can do the work competitively in quality, cost and performance and within the projected time limit.” Since any or all of these conditions may be entailed in the determination as to whether a particular contract should be let out or not, it is necessary that Management advise the local Union in the “advance discussion” concerning the item or items which are relevant to the decisionmaking.
3.	If in the “advance discussion” it is clear that Management is only “contemplating contracting out the work" and if in addition all the pertinent information as noted above is supplied to the local Union, then local Union representatives will be given a better opportunity “to comment on Management’s plans” and will also give an opportunity to
462
Management “to give appropriate weight to those comments in the light of all attendant circumstances.”
4.	These advance discussions should include a Management representative of the Plant Engineering or Maintenance activities knowledgeable of the issues.
In addition the Union complained that in certain instances plant Management requested and contracted for maintenance service on leased equipment, and extended warranty arrangements or service contracts were being purchased which impacted the job security of seniority employees in skilled trades classifications. Management stated that, while the Agreement covers the “fulfillment of normal warranty obligations by the vendor”, warranty arrangements that extend beyond those customarily provided or the obtaining of service contracts are not covered by these provisions. Rather, such arrangements or service contracts covering work normally and historically performed by represented skilled trades employees are to be considered in the same manner as contracts for the performance of maintenance work and such decisions are covered by the provisions of the National Agreement. The local plant Managements will be advised accordingly.

To;	All Personnel Directors
Plants Covered by the Guide-UAW National Agreement
During these negotiations, the parties had extensive discussions centered around the hiring of skilled trades employees as joumeypersons without sufficient checking by local Management of the documents presented by the applicants to assure they qualify. They also complained that in some instances Management shifted the blame to the Union when such an employee had to be released because, upon further investigation, the information upon which Management relied to hire the individual did not meet the criteria.
In response to these complaints the Corporation stated it would inform local managements that when
464
proof of joumeyperson status is not clearly established, such documentation will be furnished to the Chairperson of the Shop Committee and the matter will be thoroughly investigated before an employee is hired. In this regard, it was observed that establishment of such proof of status is often expedited when the applicant is a laid off bona fide UAW joumeyperson. Additionally, the Corporation assured the Union that any explanation concerning the reasons a newly hired joumeyperson must be terminated because of failure to meet the requirements is to be based on those factual reasons and not on the fact that the Local Union may have questioned the matter.
The parties mutually agreed that both the local Management and the local Union must exercise fair but sound judgment.

Dear Mr, Rapson:
During the cunent negotiations, the parties discussed the duties of the Local Union President in certain Guide Corporation plants. The parties agreed that the president’s function includes, in addition to administrative duties as the Local Union’s Chief Executive Officer, certain elements of National Agreement administration.
Accordingly, the Corporation agreed that in plants employing 500 or more employees where the Local Union President is a full time employee, such president will be allowed to perform legitimate administrative functions without loss of pay up to a total of forty (40) straight time hours per week. Moreover, in those same plants such president, as a

portion of the forty (40) hours wilt be permitted to leave the plant in accordance with Paragraph (24) of the Guide-UAW National Agreement and will be paid for up to six (6) hours per day Monday through Friday to perform legitimate administrative functions.
Such Local Union President shall notify the designated Management representative, when leaving and returning to the plant during working hours.
Moreover in those same plants when such Local Presidents are absent for at least one full working day for reasons other than those provided herein, Management will recognize a temporary replacement from among the full time employees. Notification of such replacement shall be submitted in writing at least twenty-four hours in advance to Local Management’s designated representative. In the event such a replacement is made, the Local President shall not be paid and the replacement will be permitted to utilize time out of the plant with pay pursuant to the provisions herein.
In plants employing less than 500 employees but more than 250 employees where the Local Union President is a full rime employee, such president will be allowed to leave the plant in accordance with Paragraph (24) of the Guide-UAW National Agreement to perform legitimate administrative functions without loss of pay for up to a total of eight

FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING

Guide Department
International Union, UAW

Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Rapson:
This will describe the methods to be used by Guide Corporation Payroll Department in regard to withholding of Federal income tax from employee’s wages attributable to grievance awards, vacation pay and pay in lieu of vacation from employee’s wages.
Grievance awards in excess of $500.00, but involving periods less than one calendar year, will be treated as supplemental wages and income tax withholding will be calculated using the Federal income tax regulations regarding supplemental earnings.
Likewise, pay in lieu of vacation also will be treated as supplemental wages and income tax withholding will be withheld using the Federal income tax regulations regarding supplemental earnings.
475
It should be noted that the tax withholding referenced above only covers the Federal withholding amount. An amount for FICA taxes and state or local income taxes, where applicable, will be in addition to the amount withheld for Federal income tax.
Grievance awards which are less than $500.00 will be aggregated with the regular payroll and the income tax withholding will be calculated on the total amount.
If a grievance award is made for a period of more than one calendar year, the income tax withholding will be calculated as if the payment were for a single annual period. Thus, in such situations Guide Corporation Payroll Department will use the annual percentage table to calculate the income tax withholding for such awards. This method would be the same as considering the award as having been paid equally over the preceding 52 weeks.
For vacation payments made for time away from work, such payments will continue to be treated as a regular wage payment; i.e., income tax withholding will be calculated as if the vacation payment represented a regular weekly wage payment.
The above methods are dictated by Federal Income Tax Regulations. Therefore, any change or amendment to such Regulations will, of necessity, have to be reviewed for compliance with the above changes.
476
Formal procedures to effect these changes are being communicated to Guide Corporation Payroll Department by separate letter, with instructions to make these changes as soon as practical.

OVERTIME POLICIES

GUIDE CORPORATION
Date:	March 20, 2004
Subject:	Overtime Policies
To:	All Plant Managers All Personnel Directors
~|As part of the current negotiations, Guide
^Corporation informed the International Union, UAW that it is the Corporation's intention to continue its previous policy regarding overtime practices. This
policy will be applicable only to those employees ^vho are not covered by the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding on Overtime.
cf
I
°!here was considerable discussion in these ffegotiations about the claims of the International
Union, UAW that too many employees who are required to work overtime over extended periods are not excused from overtime work assignments even though they have legitimate reasons to be excused.
The Corporation pointed out that overtime serves a number of functions essential to the effective
479
operation of Guide Corporation tightly integrated and interdependent manufacturing system. In many instances overtime must be worked at one or more plants in order to permit other plants to meet their schedules. Emergency overtime to repair breakdowns in essential equipment is often necessary to prevent or minimize interruptions in plant operations and resultant short work weeks for many employees. Overtime is also necessary on bottleneck jobs and also during certain times of the year in order to meet model change deadlines and to satisfy fluctuations in customer demand for Guide Corporation products.
Both the International Union and the Corporation recognized that the nature of the business requires overtime work assignments. In many instances, however, less than a full complement in a supervisor’s group is needed to fill the jobs which are working overtime. When fess than a full complement of employees is needed it is usually practicable for the supervisor to excuse employees who do not wish to work and confine the overtime assignments to those employees who do wish to work.
In situations where there are sufficient employees available who wish to work overtime and who are capable of doing the overtime work assignments, employees who do not wish to work overtime are to be excused from doing so, insofar as practicable.
480
Employees who are required to work overtime should be given as much advance notice as is practicable so that they can make any personal arrangements that may be necessary.
An individual employee’s personal problems in connection with working overtime should be given careful consideration and such individual needs should be recognized. The individual employee’s . request to be excused from an overtime work assignment, when made a reasonable period of time in advance, should receive every possible consideration. When the request is granted the employee will be notified as far in advance as possible so that the employee can make personal plans accordingly. Thereafter, any cancellation or change in the arrangements to excuse the employee will only be made by mutual consent.
Except in situations of an emergency or crisis nature, an employee who is not assigned to a necessary continuous seven-day operation and who has worked thirteen consecutive calendar days will be excused from work on the next following Sunday provided the request for the day off has been made before the end of the employee’s shift on the previous Friday.

WEATHER COND. & RIOT LTR.
GUIDE CORPORATION
Date:	March 20, 2004
To:	All Plant Managers
All Personnel Directors
Subject:	Failure to Work Forty Hours as
a Consequence of Severe Weather Conditions or Riots — SUB Plans
In general, the following SUB Plan determinations apply with respect to a plant shutdown in an area in which severe weather conditions or an actual or threatened riot have occurred:
1.	With respect to a day for which the plant gives notification by public announcement or otherwise of a shutdown, a SUBenefit shall be paid as provided under the Plan to otherwise eligible laid off employees.
2.	With respect to a day during which the plant attempts to operate but is forced to shutdown because of the absenteeism of employees, and forty percent (40%) or less of the employees scheduled to report
482
for work on the shift have not reported to work prior to the shutdown, a SUBenefit shall be paid to otherwise eligible employees who reported for work but were sent home when the plant suspended operations; provided, however, that if the amount of such SUBenefit payable plus the pay for hours worked on such day equals less than the equivalent of 4 hours' pay, such employees shall be paid 4 hours' pay by the Corporation for such day (including pay for any hours worked) in lieu of such SUBenefit, as provided below. In calculating the SUBenefit, credit should be taken as Available Hours for any period between the starting time of the employees’ regular shift and the time they reported for work.
a.	Employees who report for work during the first 4 hours of their regular shift on a day the plant has attempted to operate and subsequently shuts down, shall receive a SUBenefit for any hours not worked or made available during the period between the time they reported for work and the end of their regular shift; provided, however, that if the amount of such SUBenefit payable plus the pay for any hours worked on such day equals less than the equivalent of 4 hours’ pay, the employee shall be paid 4 hours' pay by the Corporation for such day (including their pay for any hours worked) in lieu of such SUBenefit.
With respect to an otherwise eligible employee who reports for work during the
483
last 4 hours of their regular shift, a SUBenefit shall be payable for any hours not worked or made available during the period between the time they reported for work and the end of their regular shift and the minimum 4 hours’ pay provisions shall not apply.
b.	In addition to the provisions of 2(a) above, if overtime hours occur during the week in which the only day(s) of layoff is a day on which the plant attempted to operate but subsequently shutdown due to employee absenteeism, the SUBenefit for otherwise eligible employees shall be calculated with respect to the week. The SUBenefit amount, if any, plus the pay for any hours worked on such day(s) shall be measured against the minimum 4 hours' pay provision, if applicable, for such day(s).
However, if overtime hours occur during a week having 2 or more days of layoff, including at least one such day on which the plant attempted to operate but subsequently shutdown due to employee absenteeism, the overtime hours may only be applied to reduce hours of layoff on days other than such days on which the plant attempted to operate.
Consequently, a separate SUBenefit shall be calculated for each such day on which the plant attempted to operate, and the amount of such SUBenefit, if any, plus the pay for any hours worked on such day shall be measured against the minimum 4 hours’ pay provision, if applicable. If a SUBenefit is 484
payable for such day, it shall be included and paid with any SUBenefit otherwise payable for the remainder of the week; provided, however, that the sum of such SU Benefits cannot exceed the SUBenefit, if any, that would otherwise be payable under the Plan for the Week,
c.	A SUBenefit shall not be paid to employees for a day when the plant was attempting to operate if such employees failed to report for work at any time during such day. The total number of hours of the employees’ regular shift for such day (8 hours in most cases) will be included as hours made available but not worked in the calculation of any SUBenefit otherwise payable for the week.
3.	With respect to a day during which the plant attempts to operate but is forced to shutdown because of the absenteeism of employees and more than forty percent (40%) of the employees scheduled to report for work on the shift have not reported to work prior to the shutdown, the facts and circumstances of the local situation will be reviewed with the Industrial Relations Department with respect to any additional SUBenefit eligibility beyond the eligibility provided under item “2.” above. Where no additional SUBenefit eligibility is authorized, the provisions and procedures under item “2.” above will be followed. If additional SUBenefit eligibility is authorized, the following will apply.
485
a.	Employees who report to work at any time during their shift shall have all hours worked or paid for such day disregarded in calculating Compensated or Available Hours for the Week and shall be deemed to be on qualified layoff for the shift.
b.	Employees who did not report for work at any time during their shift shall be deemed to have been on qualified layoff for all of the day in calculating any SUBenefit otherwise payable for the Week.
The minimum 4-hours’ pay provisions shall apply to all employees who report to work during the first four hours of their shift
The foregoing SUB Plan determinations with respect to a day when the plant attempts to operate during severe weather conditions or during an actual or threatened riot apply only in situations where the plant is subsequently forced to shutdown because of employee absenteeism. If the plant shuts down early or employees are sent home for any reason other than employee absenteeism, eligible employees should be paid SUBenefits with respect to any period of qualified layoff to which they may be entitled under the Plan and the minimum 4 hours’ pay provisions shall not be applicable.
4.	With respect to a day during which the plant operates in an area in which severe weather
486
conditions or an actual or threatened riot have occurred and more than forty (40%) of employees scheduled to report for work on the shift do not report to work at any time during their shift, the facts and circumstances of the local situation will be reviewed with the Industrial Relations Department with respect to any SUBenefit eligibility for any employee for such day. If the determination does not authorize any SUBenefits then no SUBenefit eligibility will be determined under the provisions of this letter. If a determination is made to authorize SUBenefit eligibility for the shift, such eligibility and SUBenefit calculation shall be made in accordance with item “3.” above.
In determining whether a plant shall attempt to operate during such severe weather conditions or during a riot occurring in the plant area, consideration should be given to the severity of the condition, actions of other employers in the area, and instructions, advice or proclamations issued by local or other authorities.
Employees who are unable to get to work due to a “BAN” on driving will be considered on Qualified Layoff for 8 hours for the day. “BAN” means that under a local law/ordinance which is proclaimed to be in effect through a public safety announcement, that persons caught driving in a specified area (through which employees had no alternative but to travel to get to work on regular shift) will be ticketed, fined
487
and/or jailed. Documentation of such public safety announcement is required from, and on behalf of the employee(s) involved.
During the 1967 negotiations, it was understood by the parties that the Union’s agreement with the Company SUB Plan determination to be followed with respect to a plant shutdown in an area in which severe weather conditions or an actual or threatened riot have occurred, as set forth in this letter, will in no way jeopardize or limit employee’s right of appeal under the Plan to any such Company determination.

Dear Mr. Rapson:
During the current negotiations, Guide Corporation and the International Union, UAW, discussed the problem of “seniority slippage” under Paragraph (69) which inhibits bargaining unit employees from accepting assignments to fill supervisory positions. It was recognized that in many instances it would be of mutual benefit to the parties for these employees to function in such positions.
Accordingly, this letter serves to confirm the agreement reached between the National parties that:
1.	The transfer of any employee from a job classification in the bargaining unit to a supervisory position will result in the recall of a seniority
489
employee from layoff status, if available, consistent with the provisions of the J.O.B.S. Program, and/or;
2.	The transfer of an employee from a supervisory position back to the bargaining unit does not result in the layoff of a seniority employee;
Paragraph (69) of the National Agreement will be modified in the following manner:
(69) Any employee who has been transferred from a supervisory position to a job classification in the bargaining unit shall be credited with the seniority the employee had established prior to March 1, 1977, all time worked in the bargaining unit subsequent to March I, 1977, and all time worked in a supervisory position subsequent to the effective date of this agreement provided:
a.	They previously worked on a job classification in the bargaining unit This shall also be applied to employees who were promoted prior to certification of the Union,
b.	Their employment with the Corporation has remained unbroken.
Such employee may be placed on the job to which the employee’s seniority would entitle the employee under the local seniority agreement, beginning with the last previous job the employee held in the bargaining unit; provided however, that if such last previously held job is no longer in existence, the employee may be placed in accordance with
490
Paragraph (59). In no event shall such employee be transferred to a bargaining unit job at a time when the employee has insufficient seniority to be so placed.
In order to assure accurate and timely administration of the conditions stated above in Paragraph (69) of the 1984 GM-UAW National Agreement, the following procedures will be instituted:
1.	When any employee is transferred from the bargaining unit to a supervisory position, the Chairperson of the Local Union’s Shop Committee will be given a letter specifying the employee’s name and the name of the seniority employee who is recalled from layoff status.
2.	When such supervisory employee, specified above, is returned to a job classification in the bargaining unit, the Chairperson of the Local Union’s Shop Committee will be given a letter, notifying the Chairperson of such transfer back into the bargaining unit.
Any complaints regarding the administration of this procedure may be raised by the Chairperson of the Shop Committee directly with the Plant Personnel Director.

ENGINEERING METHOD OF ROUNDING
The following rules of rounding shall apply to the determination of the Consumer Price Index:
1,	If the leftmost of the digits discarded is less than 5, the preceding digit is not affected. For example, when rounding to four digits, 130.646 becomes 130.6.
2.	If the leftmost of the digits discarded is greater than 5, or is 5 followed by digits not all of which are zero, the preceding digit is increased by one. For example, when rounding to four digits, 130.557 becomes 130.6.
If the leftmost of the digits discarded is 5, followed by zeroes, the preceding digit is increased by one if it is odd and remains unchanged if it is even. The number is thus rounded in such a manner that the last digit retained is even. For example, when rounding to four digits, 130.5500 becomes 130.6 and 130.6500 becomes 130.6.

Dear Mr- Rapson:
During the current negotiations, the parties discussed the possibility of a death of an immediate family member as defined in the Guide-UAW National Agreement occurring during a period in which an employee is on vacation time off with pay.
This confirms our understanding that if such circumstances occur where the employee has satisfied the requirements, the employee will be entitled to three additional days of vacation time off during the employee’s vacation eligibility year. If an employee does not use these days by the employee’s next vacation eligibility date, the employee shall be compensated for these days at a rate of pay established in accordance with the Guide-UAW
500
National Agreement. Recovery of overpayments made pursuant to this understanding will be made from any future payments payable under any term of this agreement.

Dear Mr. Rapson:
During the current negotiations the parties discussed the situation where an employee has applied for and been granted a vacation for a calendar week which contains a holiday. The Union was concerned that if an employee was credited with a fill! week of vacation time off under this situation, the employee would not be able to receive the employee’s full vacation time off as contemplated in the Vacation Entitlement Section.
The Corporation recognizes the desirability of providing vacation time off up to the employee’s eligibility for vacation entitlement as of the end of the current eligibility year. Accordingly, the Union was
502
advised that in situations described above an employee would be eligible for an additional day of absence for vacation purposes to be scheduled in accordance with local practice. This would not apply to holidays falling within the Christmas Holiday Period.

Dear Mr. Rapson; .
During the course of the current negotiations, the Union expressed concern that some disciplinary interviews escalated into confrontation because tempers flared. The Union suggested that in these ■ situations a “Cooling Off” period would be beneficial to alt concerned.
The Corporation and the International Union agreed that contemplated discipline should be discussed in a calm manner allowing for an objective evaluation ot the facts. In those situations where emotions preclude this from happening, the parties agreed that as a matter of practice and when possible such discussions should be postponed until such time that, in the
504
opinion of Management, a constructive exchange of information could occur.
Notwithstanding the foregoing the parties recognized that certain actions such as assault, or other serious acts of misconduct would render the "‘cooling off' period totally inappropriate.
Additionally, it was mutually recognized that providing or not providing a “cooling off" period will be without prejudice to either party in the application of any terms of the National Agreement and will not be cited or relied upon by an employee, the Union, or Management as a basis for any claim.

GUIDE CORPORATION POLICY REGARDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT

Guide Department
International Union, UAW
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Rapson:
The following is the text of Guide Corporation written and published policy regarding sexual harassment.
Guide Corporation has had for many years a written and widely distributed policy on equal opportunity employment. Sexual harassment, as in the case of harassment based on age, race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability or sexual orientation has long been regarded as a violation of this policy.
All employees are expected to deal fairiy and honestly with one another to ensure a work environment free of intimidation and harassment.
506
Abuse of the dignity of anyone, through ethnic, racist or sexist slurs or through other derogatory or objectionable conduct, is offensive employee behavior. Sexual harassment also includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.
All Guide Corporation employees are entitled to a work environment in which words and actions do not have even the appearance of disrespect. Sexually-oriented jokes, cartoons, pictures, language, certain gestures and touching may be offensive to people and, therefore, may result in a hostile work environment. This type of conduct will not be tolerated in the workplace. Guide Corporation facilities must be free of hostility resulting from sexually-oriented behavior. It is the responsibility of management and each employee to maintain an environment free of hostility.
As in the case of other unfair employment practices, if an employee believes he/she has been subjected to sexual harassment, he/she may bring his/her concerns to die attention of either his/her immediate supervisor, personnel director, representative, or union representative, or he/she may utilize appropriate and existing internal complaint procedures.
507
Guide Corporation and the UAW are in agreement that complaints of sexual harassment should be dealt with promptly and fairly under existing internal procedures as provided.

As a result, it was mutually agreed it would be desirable and potentially cost effective to continue to make available competent educational counseling to such employees when educational decisions are being contemplated.
Accordingly, following negotiations, the parties jointly commit to review the experience of the Educational Development Counselor (EDC) Program currently underway. Following such review, the parties will seek authority and funding from the
509

In instances where employees, by virtue of their job assignment, are being provided with technical or professional training, the parties will jointly work with local recognized degree granting institutions to determine the possibility of obtaining credit for such training. Such credit would be applied toward recognized degree requirements only if the employee so desires. Additionally it is anticipated that costs for such credits wiit not normally equate to full credit

Dear Mr. Rapson:
During these negotiations the parties discussed the need for basic educational opportunities and training through existing in-plant or other dedicated, accessible and adequate facilities approved by the Local Joint Activities Committee. The parties agreed to increase their emphasis on basic educational opportunities and training while ensuring that employees and their spouses and retirees continue to have access to education and training opportunities for basic skills in areas such as math, reading, problem solving or language. The parties are expressly interested in assisting employees and their spouses and retirees who want to master new skills and achieve personal goals in basic education. In this regard, it was agreed that the National Executive
515
I
Committee will continue to develop basic education curriculum in six main areas of educational counseling and learning opportunities:
•	Adult Basic Education - provides an emphasis on skill building in the areas of reading, writing, language and mathematics.
•	General Education Development - provides the opportunity to prepare for a high school equivalency exam for those who have not earned a high school diploma.	,
•	Educational Enrichment Services - provides the opportunity to sharpen skills in areas such as math, writing, reading comprehension, communication, problem solving and science, which can assist participants in technical training, college courses, or other personal goals.
•	High School Completion - provides the necessary instruction in subject areas required to complete a high school diploma.
*	English as a Second Language - provides instruction in speaking and writing the English language for participants whose native tongue is not English.
•	Academic Advising Services - provides individualized academic advising services io participants to assist them in identifying and pursuing
516
basic education goals through project educational staffs and Educational Development Counselors.
The basic education curriculum' and any enhancements would continue to be developed through the coordinated efforts of Local Joint Activities Committees (LJAC) along with local education providers and approved by the UAW-Guide National Executive Committee.
It is essential that training and educational services offered in Skill Centers will be jointly monitored, analyzed, and extensively researched to better meet the needs of the workforce and keep the curriculum current.
In this process, the parties agreed to develop changes or enhancements in the curriculum to meet the needs of the workforce. Additionally, the parties agreed to insure that employees and their spouses and retirees have access to education and training opportunities offered in Skill Centers to meet the challenges of the information age.
In developing these changes the parties will solicit input from plants, Local Educational Agencies, and other sources external to UAW-Guide, regarding what changes are deemed appropriate in the Skill Center curriculum and administration.
The program design may vary from one UAW/Guide location to another, but generally will focus on the
517
individuals, adapting to the different interests, abilities, and work schedules of the participants including:
•	Individual Needs Assessments
•	Individual Instructional Plan
•	Individual and Small Group Instruction
•	Computer-Aided and Computer-Managed Instruction
» Instruction in Diverse Subject Area, and
•	Participant Anonymity
Hardware, software and training materials used in the above mentioned computer-aided and computermanaged instruction are subject to approval by the UAW-Guide National Executive Committee.
These Skill Centers create an environment which allows education opportunities to be more accessible within a positive environment. Project services would be integrated and coordinated with other personal development, educational and training activities in each location. Project staff will be made available at times that are convenient for workers including before and after shifts, breaks and lunchtimes.
The above educational pursuits will be supported by a combination of national, local and plant training
518
funds and will be jointly administered by the UAW-Guide National Executive Committee and the Local Joint Activities Committee. In addition, these facilities may be used for other appropriate training approved by the Local Joint Activities Committee.
If a plant constituting a local bargaining unit is scheduled to be idled or closed, the local parties will notify the UAW-Guide National Executive Committee of their proposed plan to alter Skill Center services for participants enrolled in the plant’s Skill Center.
The notice will include a projected date for alternative arrangements, the number of participants enrolled and a brief description of the alternative arrangements. Thereafter, the national parties will discuss the matter and resolve any issues by mutual agreement of the Corporation and the International Union.

Dear Mr. Rapson;
During the 2000 negotiations the parties discussed both the Union’s and Management’s concerns about the scheduling of overtime work Guide Corporation.
On the one hand Management recognized the legitimacy of the Union’s concern that production not be scheduled on a sustained basis on overtime rather than recalling laid off employees or hiring new employees. On the other hand, the Union recognized that the scheduling of overtime serves an essential purpose in many situations in order to meet temporary or seasonal increases in sales, at new model start-up, and to make up for production lost due to factors beyond the parties’ control, such as interruptions in the supply of parts. Also the parties recognize the need for overtime on vital tooling and maintenance projects which often must be
532
accomplished quickly on tight time schedules in order to avoid interruptions or delays in production and layoffs of production employees.
As a result of these discussions, the parties agreed to establish a procedure for regularly reviewing overtime work schedules. This review will be accomplished between representatives of Guide Corporation and the International Union, UAW and will be designed to focus on those plants and facilities that establish a pattern of high overtime scheduling on a sustained basis. The review is intended to assure that overtime work is not scheduled at a plant on an ongoing basis in cases where there are practical and economical alternatives. The alternatives to overtime considered by the parties may include employment increases, innovative shift arrangements, or improvements or additions to the plant’s equipment which could eliminate a bottleneck; or the parties may conclude that the reasons for the overtime are temporary or unavoidable and that there are no practical or economical alternatives.
The purpose of this review procedure is to assure a timely and thorough review of overtime work schedules and provide for a balanced consideration of the interests of both parties.

During the current negotiations, the Union raised a concern regarding management’s active participation in the implementation of the ADAPT Program (Accommodating People in Transition - formerly Job Placement) at all UAW-Guide locations. The parties agree this process was designed to enable employees with disabilities to be retained at work or returned to work from a sick leave or worker’s compensation leave and be placed on jobs within their physical restrictions, while complying with applicable provisions of the local and National Agreements.
The process will be administered at the plant level in accordance with existing National Guidelines.
542
The parties acknowledged that the proper implementation of the ADAPT Program has successfully provided the mechanism for many UAW-Guide employees with restrictions or disabilities an opportunity to be either retained at work or return to work on meaningful jobs. It was agreed that emphasis must be placed on Step 3 of the 6 Step ADAPT process focusing on job modifications. It was reaffirmed that members of the local ADAPT Committee, both management and union, are responsible for the successfill implementation of the Program at their location. This is accomplished by taking an active role and by assigning and maintaining the necessary resources to administer the Program to meet requirements of the local and National Agreements.
The parties will explore for possible implementation an audit procedure and a computerized measurement system. This reporting system will provide the National Parties with the necessary information to ensure a common process is being used at all UAW-Guide locations.
543
In addition, the parties agreed a further emphasis must be placed on making employees, both hourly and salary, aware of the ADAPT Program and the opportunities it provides for accommodating people with disabilities. This will be accomplished through recurrent training, mailings of the ADAPT brochure to employee’s homes and in-plant communications via videos, newsletters, etc.
The National Parties will monitor the Program and provide guidance and training including participating in a training conference during this agreement.
Problems not resolved at the plant level will be communicated to the National Parties for resolution using the process outlined in the ADAPT manual.

We have managed to find common ground on many of the issues involved in these negotiations. Nowhere has that been more evident than in our mutual treatment of issues involving education and training and other programs of joint interest to better our employees and enhance their job security by strengthening the competitive position of Guide Corporation, Our deliberations in this area are in step with congressional and private sector initiatives toward a new era of cooperative labor relations.
In this regard, cooperative labor relations with respect to the joint arena can be accomplished only when activities are jointly approved, developed, implemented, monitored, and evaluated. Furthermore,
545
decisions roust be arrived at in a setting which is characterized by the parties working together in an atmosphere of trust; making mutual decisions at all levels of administration which respect the concerns and interests of the parties involved; sharing responsibility for the problem solving process; and sharing the rewards of common goals.
In these negotiations, we have provided funding for our joint programs which reflect this national policy of cooperative labor relations. We should continue to ensure Chat the projects, programs and events which are supported in whole or in part with these joint funds do tn fact keep us communicating on ail levels, consistent with this objective.
We agree these funds will continue to be used to help solve mutual problems which may not be collective bargaining problems. They will continue to be used to make Guide Corporation and its employees more competitive in a global economy. In this regard, we jointly sponsor conferences, workshops, seminars and meetings to promote cooperative efforts on related subjects, and where appropriate, invite academic, professional, government, labor and industry representatives to attend and participate. In addition, we understand that while these funds are intended for education, training and development of UAW bargaining unit employees, there are situations where it will be natural for some salaried employees to receive the same training or participate in the same
546
program. Such expenses for non-bargaining unit employees may be funded with joint funds provided the parties agree.
Further, the jointly sponsored projects, programs and activities are designed to promote public awareness of Guide Corporation products (including the quality and reliability of such products), Guide Corporation workforce and its role in producing high quality products, and the relationship between Guide Corporation and the collective bargaining representatives for Guide Corporation employees.
We also recognize that as representatives of organizations such as the UAW and Guide Corporation, which are viewed by most as key to the vibrancy of many local economies and the national economy, we are expected to be responsible citizens and caring neighbors. Therefore, from time to time we have agreed to use these funds to assist the victims of disaster or the less fortunate in the communities where our employees live and work. We have also supported research projects or efforts by other training, educational or cultural institutions which will through education and exposure promote our goals of labor and management cooperation in the workplace.
We have pledged that these joint funds will continue to be used to enhance all our employees involvement in, and appreciation for, decisions that affect their
547
lives. We look to the UAW’s continued cooperation in that regard in identifying and developing with us meaningful projects which will assist their members, and our employees, in reaching that objective.
The parties further agree that new programs and activities designed to enhance the welfare and job security of UAW-represented employees may be authorized and funded by the National Executive Committee under the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding Joint Activities contained in the Agreement between Guide Corporation and the UAW.	’

COMPLIANCE WITH FMLA
GUIDE CORPORATION
March 20,2004 Mr. Cal Ranson
Vice President and Director

Dear Mr. Ranson:
Subject: Compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993. The Corporation assured the Union that it will comply with the provisions of the FMLA.
As part of its compliance, the Corporation has established a category of unpaid leave called “FMLA Leave.” In some instances, FMLA Leaves will be concurrent with leaves of absence covered by the National Agreement. Accordingly, in those cases where the employee is eligible for leave under the National Agreement and the leave also qualifies
549
under the FMLA, the Corporation intends to comply with the requirements of the FMLA as well as the separate provisions of the National Agreement regarding covered leaves of absence.
Pursuant to the Corporation’s present plan for compliance with the FMLA, the Corporation’s rights under the Act will be modified to:
■	Provide that an employee on FMLA Leave will continue to accumulate seniority in Ute same manner as an employee on a Personal Leave of Absence;
•	Permit but not require employees to substitute vacation and/or excused absence allowance for unpaid FMLA Leave;
•	Provide that employees who are married to each other will be each entitled to a maximum of 12 weeks of qualifying leave under the Act;
I
I	• Provide that, when a third opinion is
1	necessary under the medical certification and dispute
resolution sections of the FMLA, the neutral provider will be selected jointly by the Corporation and the Union, with the consent of the employee, from a list, provided by the appropriate local or state professional medical association, of board certified specialists in the field of medicine in which the point of controversy exists;
550
•	Continue Corporation-paid Group Life, Accidental Death and Dismemberment, and Disability Insurance during all FMLA Leaves that are not also Medical Leaves as if such leaves were Personal Leaves of Absence.
In addition, the Corporation’s plan for compliance would:
•	Not automatically designate and apply absence time that is compensated under the Sickness and Accident Insurance provisions of the Life, Disability and Health Care Benefits Program against an eligible employee’s FMLA entitlement;
•	Use a calendar year as the 12-month period of the leave entitlement (for example: in 2000, an employee would be eligible for 12 weeks leave from January 1, through December 31,2000):
*	Require repayment of the cost of health care coverage provided during the leave from employees who fail to return from FMLA Leave to the extent permitted by law.
The Corporation may make changes in its compliance plans to reflect changes in regulations and/or subsequent court decisions and the gaining of additional administrative experience but without reducing leaves provided by the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
551
Problems related to the implementation of this letter may be discussed by representatives of the UAW-Guide Department and the Corporation’s Labor Relations Staff.

International Union, UAW 8000 E. Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Rapson:
The parties to this agreement recognize the critical impact outsourcing proposals have on the parties’ relationship at both the National and Local level. In this regard, when potential outsourcing is under consideration, the local parties should have sufficient time to evaluate the proposal to insure that they have the opportunity to develop a plan to retain the work. During the discussions leading to the current Agreement, the sourcing process was modified to provide a more meaningful role for the Union in sourcing decisions through involvement in the request for quotation process. Under this process, which provides for earlier involvement, the Union will generally have as much time to evaluate methods to retain the work as the 150 day notification process 555
provided under the 1993 National Agreement. In those instances where it is anticipated that less than 150 days will be required to complete the sourcing process, the Chairperson of the Shop Committee will be so advised.
However, in such instances where the Union believes that insufficient time has been provided for input into a pending sourcing decision, the matter should be referred to the National Sourcing Committee for further discussion.

Vice President and Director
Guide Department
International Union, UAW
8000 East Jefferson Avenue

Dear Mr. Rapson:
Subject; Supplier Corporate Citizenship
During these negotiations, the UAW stated its interest in having the Corporation continue to recognize the importance of using suppliers which are good corporate citizens and which can be relied upon for quality products and reliable delivery. The UAW further pointed out that the Corporation’s selection of and relationship with suppliers have a significant bearing on its relationship with the Union. Ln this regard, the Union stressed repeatedly the importance of the Corporation's use of high quality, reliable suppliers which maintain good, fair and equitable
561
I
I
relations with their employees, and which satisfy the Corporation's need for a continuous, reliable and cost-effective supply of quality parts and materials.
Guide Corporation fully understands the Union’s concerns in these matters, because quality products, uninterrupted delivery and good corporate citizenship — by the Corporation and its suppliers — contribute significantly to the Corporation’s success in the marketplace, and all of these factors have a direct bearing on the job and income security of UAW members. Guide Corporation assured the Union that it would not take retaliatory action, such as canceling or refusing to renew contracts with suppliers, based on a decision of that supplier's employees to join a labor union. The Corporation further stated that all such decisions will continue to be based on quality, service, technology and cost. The Corporation similarly recognizes the value of suppliers that have successful relations with their employees and employees’ representatives.
Guide Corporation agrees that its relationship with the Union is of paramount importance to the Corporation’s long-term success. The Corporation has told its suppliers and the business community in the past of the positive aspects of its relationship with the UAW and will continue to do so in the future. Guide Corporation, therefore, has no interest in embarking on a purchasing strategy that would detract from that relationship.
562
Correspondingly, the Union has, from time to time, expressed to the Corporation its concern about certain aspects of the Corporation’s relationship with particular suppliers in the area of quality, continuity of supply, and overall performance as a supplier including the maintenance of good relations by the supplier with its employees. The Union recognizes that the Corporation has expressed its views and made suggestions to its suppliers as a result of the Union’s concerns, all within the bounds of applicable legal principles.
The parties recognize that instances in which these matters arise are inherently dependent upon the particular facts that are present in each situation and plan to continue to deal with these matters on a case-by case basis as they have in the past, and in compliance with applicable laws.
In particular, the Corporation will continue to urge its suppliers to treat their employees in a good, fair and equitable manner to provide them wages and benefits competitive within their industry, to provide a safe workplace and to avoid conduct which violates national or state labor and employment laws. In addition, the Corporation will, in a manner which is in compliance with applicable laws, notify suppliers of the importance the Corporation places on harmonious relationships between suppliers, their employees and any union that may represent them.
563
The Corporation will send or transmit to each of its current suppliers a letter, in the form attached hereto (the “Letter'1’), within sixty (60\ days after the effective date of the National Agreement: and, upon request of the Union, the Corporation will re-send the attached letter within fourteen (14) days to any supplier who is awarded a contract with the Coiporation. In addition, the Corporation will transmit the attached letter as a part of each Request for Quotation extended to domestic suppliers.
Very truly yours,
Robert H. Steams
Vice President
Attachment
564
NEW
Form of letter to be sent to Suppliers
This Letter will describe some aspects of Guide Corporation’s policy on supplier selection.
The Corporation’s decision to select or remove a particular supplier is based on numerous criteria, applied in conformance with legal requirements. Guide Corporation recognizes that it is in the mutual interest of employers and their employees for the employer to fully respect the right of the employees to representation by a union. It is, however, definitely not Guide Corporation’s policy or practice to remove product from a supplier if that supplier’s employees have chosen to join the UAW.
As you know. Guide Corporation has a positive and constructive relationship with the UAW, and we encourage our suppliers to strive for similar constructive relationships with their employees or representatives of their employees. Our joint programs have allowed us to make significant improvements in areas such as Health and Safety. Quality, and the implementation of lean manufacturing utilizing the tools of our joint process. We respect the UAW and the UAW respects us.
565
Guide Corporation also notes that many of our supplier facilities have recognized the UAW based on a showing of a majority support among employees by means of a ucard check” certified by a neutral third party. Guide Corporation fully approves of decisions by our suppliers to use such peaceful means of determining employees’ sentiment.
Should you have any questions with respect to this matter, please call.
Very truly yours.

4.	Personal Relief for Certain Employees
The relief time in manufacturing plants on operations on which the employees/manual operations are continuous and which cannot be left unattended and for which Guide provides “tag” relief, and on certain other operations that Guide determines are likewise of such a nature as to give the employees no control over their work pace, shall be twenty-three (23)
594
minutes before lunch and twenty-three (23) minutes after lunch on a regular eight (8) hour shift, making a total of forty-six (46) minutes. This will not affect relief allowance now in effect on certain specific operations due to environmental job conditions. The amount of such relief shall be modified accordingly for a shift other than a regular eight (8) hour shift. The Plant Management may, by mutual agreement with the Local Union, allocate the relief before and after lunch to not more than two (2) periods before lunch and two (2) periods after lunch.
Sufficient labor will be provided to enable employees to obtain the above relief taking into consideration that the first hour at the start of shift and the first one-half hour after lunch are not ordinarily required for relief except in emergencies; details to be implemented locally with the understanding this provision shall not interfere with any mutually satisfactory local practice.
[See Doc. 30J
5.	Union Bulletin Boards and Publication Racks

STATEMENT ON TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS
During negotiations the International Union has claimed that certain work which is performed at some plant locations where the UAW is the certified bargaining representative of certain employees has been improperly assigned to non-represented employees of Guide Corporation.
The Corporation is mindful of the Union's concern regarding the scope and work content of job classifications of employees in the UAW bargaining unit and how such may be affected by advancing technology. Accordingly, the Guide-UAW Joint Training Committee will meet periodically to discuss matters concerning new or advanced technology that cannot be resolved locally and are referred to it by local unions or local managements.
Advancing technology has created, and will continue to create, new and more complex problems ’ bearing upon the work content of job classifications of employees represented by the Union.
It is not the Corporation’s policy to assign to non-represented employees work which comes within the scope and content of that normally assigned to represented employees at a particular plant location. The Corporation recognizes that mere novelty or the sophistication of new technology alone is not grounds
607
for withdrawing work from represented employees. Similarly, the Corporation does not believe that the perimeters of the bargaining unit at a particular plant location should be expanded simply by the introduction of new technology.
It is recognized that advances in technology may alter, modify or otherwise change the job responsibilities of represented employees at plant locations and that a change in the means, method or process of performing a work function including the introduction of computers, energy management systems, modem, art to part, tool cutting paths and fiber optics, CAM, CMM, CAE, 3D Visualization or other new or advanced technology will not serve to shift the work function from represented to nonrepresented employees. Therefore,
I,	Where a work function at a plant location preceded the certification of the Union, the work function will be assigned as it was assigned at the time of certification, unless there has been a written agreement otherwise.
2.	Where a work function was introduced at a plant location following the certification of the Union, the work function will be assigned as it was originally assigned, unless there has been a written agreement otherwise.
The Corporation and the International Union are in agreement that the assignment of represented or
608
non-represented employees depends upon the work function involved and not necessarily upon the work tasks required to accomplish such work function.
Notice and Discussion
The Corporation agrees to advanced written notification to local unions at locations planning the introduction of new or advanced technology so as to permit meaningful discussion of its impact, if any, upon skilled or non-skilled employees.
The Local Management will describe for the Shop Committee the extent to which such technological changes may affect the work performed by represented employees at the plant location involved. The Chairperson of the Shop Committee and the International Union will be provided a written description of the technology involved, the equipment being introduced, its intended use and the anticipated installation date(s). During the discussions the Chairperson of the Shop Committee may include other Local Union representatives such as the Health and Safety Representative, a representative from the Local Joint Training Committee, or other employees, as necessary, in order to review the various matters of concern relative to the introduction of the new technology involved. Accordingly, the parties agreed upon the following examples of situations where 'notification should be given:
609
A)	The first introduction of a technology as compared to previously existing plant technology.
B)	Introduction of a new, more advanced generation of existing technology having a significantly different impact on the bargaining unit.
C)	Introduction of a new application of existing technology * which has a significantly different impact on the bargaining unit
The parties also highlighted that the National Agreement provides for notification to take place as far in advance of implementation of the technological change as is practicable. This is not only to enable the Shop Committee to discuss the impact such introduction of technology has on the bargaining unit, but also to discuss timely implementation of employee training to prepare them to perform their appropriate functions.
Training
The Union has also voiced concern about the possibility that new, technologically impacted bargaining unit work will not be awarded to represented employees because they are insufficiently trained to perform it. In view of the parties’ interest in affording maximum opportunity for employees to progress with advancing technology, as part of the advanced discussion, the parties shall seek to identify
610
appropriate specialized training programs, to be made available as far in advance of the technology’s introduction to the plant as practicable, so that employees will be capable of performing new or changed work normally performed by represented personnel.
Dispute Resolution
The following paragraphs set forth a means of resolving disputes concerning particular problems occasioned by advancing technology.
Where the initial introduction of new or advanced technology at a plant location occasions a question of whether:
1)	certain new work should be assigned to represented employees,
2)	affects the job responsibilities of represented employees, or
3)	otherwise impacts the scope of the bargaining unit,
Local Management and the Shop Committee will attempt to resolve the matter without resorting to the grievance procedure. Local Management will cooperate in the Shop Committee’s investigation and evaluation of impact issues raised due to the introduction of new or advanced technology. Comments by the Shop Committee will be carefully evaluated by the Local Management in accordance
611
with the Corporation’s policy relative to the assignment of work which comes within the scope and content of that normally assigned to represented employees at the plant location. If the issue remains unresolved, it may be introduced into the second step of the grievance procedure.
Settlements made by the local parties concerning the assignment of work functions as between represented and non-represented employees in relation to the new or advanced technology discussed will be forwarded to the International Union and the Corporation and will be reviewed by the Guide-UAW Joint Training Committee within thirty (30) days of receipt of the settlement. In the event either the Corporation or the International Union does not approve the settlement following the review by the National Committee, the subject matter in dispute will be referred to the Management-Shop Committee Step of the Grievance Procedure and processed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Grievance Procedure.

NEW LETTER
COLA Calculation Conversion
GUIDE CORPORATION
March 21,2004
Mr. Cal Rapson
Vice President and Director
Guide Department
International Union, UAW
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Rapson:
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the relationship between the employee paid healthcare benefits received by UAW-General Motors employees and the general cost of living. As a result of these discussions, the parties agreed to base future cost of living adjustments on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (current series, CP1-W, for all items less medical care, not seasonally adjusted, United States City Average), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (1982 - 1984 = 100). This will become the new Index.
This letter is to confirm that the changes to Paragraphs (10l)(f), (l01)(g), and (101)(h) of the 2003 National Agreement and to Document No. 87, the letter of understanding on COLA calculation
614
required for the conversion to the new Index, are intended to maintain the same mathematical wage replacement ratio as existed for the May — July 2003 quarter.
Jn this regard, it is our intention to construct cost of living adjustment tables in the following manner.
Tables shall be based on a new formula value that bears the same relationship to the May-June-July 2003 average for the new Index that the previous formula value of 0.25 bears to the May-June-July 2003 average for the ail items CPI-W on the 1967 base. This yields a new formula of a one cent adjustment for each 0.08159 change in the new Index.
New adjustment brackets will be taken to two decimal places and will follow a repeating cycle of .08, .08, .08, .08, .08, .09, .08, .08, .08, .08, .08, .09, etc.

Joint Program Representation Levels
GUIDE CORPORATION
March 20, 2004
Mr. Cal Rapson
Vice President and Director
Guide Department
International Union, UAW
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Rapson:
During these negotiations, the parties discussed at length proper representation levels for the joint programs essential for the well being of our employees.
As a result of these discussions, the parties agree to modify the 2004 National Agreement provisions regarding joint program representation. As a result of attrition, this will be effected by combining assignments, which will result in the elimination of three (3) representatives per location during the life of this Agreement.
Very truly yours,
Robert FT. Steams
Vice President
