RETAIL MEAT CUTTERS CONTRACT
UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 1546
TERM: 8/24/2014 - 8/25/2018, 11:59 P.M.
ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT governing Retail Meat Markets entered into between JEWEL FOOD STORES, INC., hereinafter called the "Employer", and LOCAL 1546, UNITED FOOD & COMMERCIAL WORKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Union", acting as the exclusive collective bargaining agent for all employees covered by this Agreement.
ARTICLE I GENERAL
Section 1.1	Scope of Contract
It is agreed that this Contract shall govern the hours, wages and other conditions of employment of Employer's meat department employees in Retail Meat Markets within the geographical jurisdiction of Local 1546.
Section 1.2	Definitions
(A)	Journeymen and Apprentice Hired After 1/7/98
1.	Effective 7/26/98, the Employer agrees to a full-time ratio of 30% full time and 70% part-time for the apprentice/journeyman classification. The ratio is calculated on a system wide basis. The ratio will be reviewed on a semi-annual basis (January 1 and July 1) . The full-time placement will be pursuant to the job bid process of the Employer. The Company will provide names and locations of newly hired apprentices.
2.	All employees hired on or before January 7, 1998, that apply pursuant to a job posting, will be given first preference for an apprentice position with a 90 day trial period. All employees hired on or before January 7, 1998, whose rate is above the 0-6 month rate will remain at their rate of pay at time of promotion until they have the required time in the apprentice position to progress to the next rate of pay.
3.	All Market Managers and meat cutters hired before January 7, 1998, shall have preference for all meat cutting hours on Sundays and Holidays before apprentices hired or promoted into the classification on or after January 7, 1998.
4.	Once an apprentice completes the 84 month wage structure, the employee will become a journeyman meat cutter based on the new hire wage structure. The terms of employment shall continue as provided for apprentices and journeymen hired after January 7, 1998.
5.	An apprentice promoted from the new classification to market manager shall receive the current market manager rate of pay in the contract.
6.	Work restrictions contained in Section 2.3, Section 4.1(2), Section 4.2 of the contract do not apply to apprentices/journeymen hired into this classification.
4
(B)	Journeyman
After serving the apprenticeship, an employee shall be classified as a journeyman meat cutter and shall be paid the journeyman rate of pay, based on the Apprentice and Journeyman hired after 1/7/98 pay structure.
(C)	Head Meat Cutter
The term "Head Meat Cutter" means a journeyman meat cutter who is responsible for the efficient management of the market. Each store will have only one (1) head meat cutter.
If a Head Meatcutter requests to step down to a meatcutter position he will be allowed to do so if an opening exists based on the needs of the business. In the event no qualified candidate bids on the Head Meatcutter position are received, the supervisory duties performed by a Head meatcutter may be performed by persons outside the bargaining unit or the incumbent head meatcutter may be required by the Employer to remain in his head meatcutter position until a replacement head meatcutter is available for placement.
(D)	Wrappers
Wrappers may be employed and their duties shall be confined to slicing luncheon meats and sausages; clean-up work in the market; stocking cases; and wrapping, scaling, and pricing. Wrappers are allowed to marinate, assemble, tray and stuff all prepared foods for sale. Wrappers hired on or before 1/7/98 may work in the Seafood Department on a voluntary basis in addition to the rights set forth in Section 1.4 of the Seafood Supplement. Wrappers who are hired after 1/7/98 or promoted to full-time after 1/7/98 may also be assigned to work in the Seafood Department. Their duties shall include all activities assigned to the Seafood Department with the understanding that the Employer may receive into and utilize in such departments, frozen fish items without the requirement that those items be price marked and may receive into and utilize in such departments, fresh fish items without the requirement that those items be cut, prepared, fabricated, etc., priced or packaged on the premises. Seafood Department employees are not required to be craft people, however, they may perform all operations pertaining to fish including the cutting, filleting, packaging, wrapping, pricing, displaying, etc. of either fresh or frozen fish.
No Wrappers shall use knives, saws, grinders, cube machines or other mechanical equipment used in the preparation or processing of fresh meats or poultry other than as specified in this section, with the exception that wrappers may perform all market functions excluding the use of power saws in servicing individual customer requests. Their duties may periodically include supplementing the Service Delicatessen department during high volume periods (Monday-Friday between the hours of 4:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.), and weekends between the hours of 12:00 noon and 4:00 p.m., unanticipated absences and breaks to meet the needs of the business. The Company may not utilize this provision as the sole basis upon which to reduce the number of scheduled hours in either the Service Deli or the Meat Department. This specific provision shall terminate for all associates hired before January 16, 2015, upon the expiration of the successor collective bargaining agreement to this agreement, or on August 29, 2020, whichever occurs first. Associates hired on or after January 16, 2015 shall continue to be subject to the above referenced provisions thereafter.
5
The Company will first utilize all employees in the department before using any employee from the other department. The Company will use only one employee from the other department at a time under these collective agreements. Employees that are working outside of their department (crossover) will not do any production work and will only wait on trade.
Absence: The Company will call all employees not working to fill the shift or offer additional hours to employees currently working. The Company will keep a complete list of all employees that have been called or offered additional hours so that the Union will be able to view the steps taken to resolve the absence.
For proven violations of this provision, the penalties shall be:
1st Offense: Written warning
2nd Offense: Most senior employee not working at the time will receive 4 hours pay at the rate of a top of Scale Part-Time Clerk rate hired after 8/23/2004.
3rd Offense: Most senior employee not working at the time will receive 8 hours pay at the rate of a Top of Scale Part-Time Clerk rate hired after 8/23/2004, and that store will no longer utilize the cross-over provision for a period of 6 months from the date of last violation.
Each offense within this provision shall be removed after 12 months have lapsed from the date of occurrence. If a store uses this provision on the same day and time for three (3) consecutive weeks then that store shall add a minimum of two (2) hours to the schedule for that time frame.
Wrappers who want to transfer to available apprentice positions shall make their desire known to the Employer in writing and they shall be given equal consideration for such vacancies along with other applicants. There shall be no reduction in pay to any wrapper as a result of entering the apprentice program, i.e., wrappers rate of pay shall apply until such time as the apprentice rate exceeds the wrapper rate at which time the apprentice rate shall apply. The wrapper entering the apprenticeship program shall have a ninety (90) day trial period. The trial period shall not jeopardize the employee's former classification or seniority except such wrapper transferred to the apprentice classification will have seniority for the purpose of lay off and recall from the date of such transfer.
Part-time wrappers may be employed on the following basis:
1)	Part-time wrappers can only be new hires or employees who transfer into that classification from the Delicatessen Department, it being understood that the transfer of an employee from the Delicatessen Department classification to the part-time wrapper classification is optional with the Employer and that any full-time Delicatessen Department employee so transferred would be "red-circled" until such time as the part-time wrapper rate reached the red-circled employees rate of pay.
2)	When a full-time wrapper is needed in a given store, the Employer will endeavor to fill said position by the employer's job posting and bidding process. The determination of the relative qualification of all applicants is expressly reserved to the Employer.

ARTICLE X SENIORITY
Section 10.1	Seniority Defined
Seniority means the rights defined herein secured by employees by length of continuous full-time employment with the Employer, that is, full-time employment uninterrupted by termination of service.
Seniority starts from the last date when the employee starts work as a full time employee, provided, however, that new employees shall not acquire any seniority rights until they have completed the probationary period of thirty (30) days, or sixty (60) days by mutual agreement of the Employer, employee and Union, after which their seniority shall date back to the date the employee started to work. When two or more employees start work the same day, the date of birth shall determine their relative seniority, it being understood that the older employee shall be deemed to be more senior. An employee's seniority shall be terminated if he/she: (1) quits; (2) retires; (3) is discharged; (4) fails to report after a layoff within seven (7) calendar days after the Employer sends to the last address known to the Employer, a written notification to return to work (with a copy to the Union); (5) fails to return to work upon expiration of an authorized leave of absence; (6) refuses, as an alternative to being laid off, to accept work in his/her classification in another store within the seniority area; (7) refuses, after having been laid off, to accept work in his/her job classification in any store in the seniority area; or (8) has been laid off by the Employer for a period of one year.
The "in-service" date of an employee who progresses from apprentice to journeyman, or who is demoted from Head Meat Cutter to journeyman shall not be affected by such change in classification.
An employee's seniority shall not be affected as a result of a transfer.
A complete seniority list of the Company's employees working within a local union's jurisdiction will be furnished the Union each calendar year.

3.	Wrappers
35
The Employer shall give a two (2) week notice to regular full-time employees only when it becomes necessary to layoff an employee or two (2) weeks pay in lieu of notice. If a full time Journeyman Meat Cutter or a Market Manager (Head Meat Cutter) in one seniority area (North or South Area) is laid off, that employee may displace the least senior employee in the other seniority area (North or South Area) in the same job classification. If a full time Meat Cutter from one Area displaces the least senior full time Meat Cutter in the other Area (North or South), the Employer and Union agree to meet, if necessary, to address an exceptional travel hardship.
In the event a Head Meat Cutter is to be laid off (by seniority), that Head Meat Cutter will first be returned to a full-time Meat Cutter position in the same Area by seniority. If a full time Meat Cutter position does not exist in the same Area due to the Meat Cutter' s seniority, the Head Meat Cutter shall displace the least senior full time Meat Cutter in the other seniority area (first his/her own Area or, if not more senior than the least senior full time Meat Cutter in the same Area, then the other Area) provided he/she is more senior than the least senior full time Meat Cutter.
The term "seniority area" for full time employees means the area covered by the operating Area (North and South), division district or administrative or geographic unit used by the Employer, as said Employer's unit may be organized from time to time, and falling within the cities and counties in which The Employer has recognized the Union Locals. The Employer shall notify the Union in writing of the stores comprising its Areas covered by this Labor Agreement comprising its seniority Areas as modified from time to time. The Employer agrees to notify the Union of any changes in the seniority areas for full time employees. The Employer agrees to discuss with the union issues concerning the changes to seniority areas.
It is mutually agreed that for the term of this Agreement there shall be no permanent in-classification transfers of employees from one "seniority area" to another "seniority area" as defined above in the instance where there are employees on layoff status in that particular classification in the area in which an employee from another area is sought to be transferred.
A series of store cluster groups will be set up that will be seniority areas for part-time employees. The Company will provide to the Union on a yearly basis the stores that define the part-time cluster groups. The Employer may change the part time "cluster areas" to the Area (North and South) , district or administrative or geographic unit used by the Employer, as said Employer's unit may be organized from time to time, and falling within the cities and counties in which the Employer has recognized the Union Local. The Employer shall notify the Union in writing of the stores comprising the applicable seniority area as determined and/or modified from time to time by the Employer. The Employer agrees to notify the Union of any changes in the company determined seniority areas for part time employees. The Employer agrees to discuss with the union issues concerning the changes to seniority areas.
The Employer shall continue to have the right to implement seniority area changes no later than 30 days after notice to the Union.
No meat cutter, wrapper or service deli employee in service on or before 1/7/98, will be laid off or reduced in hours as a result of the new apprentice/ journeymen classification.
In the event of a layoff in the Apprentice Meat Cutter classification, any wrapper who bids into the Apprentice classification will be allowed upon written request to bump the wrapper with the lowest seniority in the job classification.
36
Part-time Journeymen Meat Cutters must be laid off prior to the layoff of any full-time journeymen (by Area by seniority).

If an employee is promoted from a job within the bargaining unit to a supervisory position with the Employer and is returned to the collective bargaining unit within one year, he/she shall commence work with the seniority rank he/she had at the time of his/her promotion.
Section 10.4	Seniority of Employees on Leaves of Absence
The seniority rights of an employee who, either by voluntary action or draft, entered the Armed Forces of the United States shall continue as though he/she had not been absent, and he/she shall have the right to be reinstated to his/her employment as provided by law and regulation thereunder.
The seniority of an employee on an extended leave of absence, which is hereby defined as any leave of absence, other than military leave of absence, in excess of ninety (90) days, shall be protected to the expiration of said leave of absence, but not in excess of one year, but such seniority shall not accumulate during any period of absence in excess of one year.
The Employer will allow a leave of absence up to one year for the purpose of working for the Union. This leave will be considered a personal leave of absence.
