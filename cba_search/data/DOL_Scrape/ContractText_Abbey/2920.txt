Enumeration of the City's rights, as set forth in this Article, shall not be deemed to exclude other rights of management not specifically set forth herein since the parties expressly agree that the City retains all legal rights to which it is entitled as an employer and retains all other rights not otherwise covered by this Contract, whether or not such rights have been exercised in the past.
11
The exercise of the foregoing powers, rights, authorities, duties and responsibilities by the City, and the adoption of policies, rules, and regulations in furtherance thereof, shall be limited only by the specific and express terms of the Contract. The exercise of management rights which allegedly violate specific provisions of this Contract are subject to the Grievance Procedure.
No action, statement, agreement, settlement, or representation made by any member of the bargaining unit regarding the City's obligations or rights under this Contract shall impose any obligation or duty or be considered to be authorized by or binding upon the City unless and until the City has agreed thereto in writing.
ARTICLE 7	- INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS PROCEDURES
7.1	SCOPE.
This Article is designed to address the procedures used for internal investigations of members. Internal investigations shall be conducted by the chain of command, Equal Employment Opportunity Office (EEO) and/or by personnel assigned to the Internal Affairs Bureau. The term "investigator" refers to that individual(s) conducting the investigation. The term O.L.C. Representative refers to an O.L.C. Officer, Grievance Chairman, Grievance Liaison Representative, or O.L.C.-designated attorney.
7.2	RIGHT TO REPRESENTATION.
(A)	Internal Affairs Bureau and EEO Investigations. When a member is notified to report to the Internal Affairs Bureau, or the EEO, and is the focus of the investigation, the member shall be provided an opportunity to contact an O.L.C. Representative. If requested by the member, an O.L.C. Representative shall be allowed to accompany the member during all interview sessions.
(B)	Chain of Command Investigations. At the time any member is interviewed or interrogated within the chain of command of the Division of Police and the investigator reasonably believes that either departmental or criminal charges could result against that member, that member shall be provided an opportunity to contact an O.L.C. Representative. If requested by the member, an O.L.C. Representative shall be allowed to accompany the member during all interview sessions.
(C)	Objections. On record at the end of the interview, the O.L.C. Representative shall have the right to object to inappropriate lines of questioning and/or to raise any contractual violations. The investigator may also allow the O.L.C. Representative to briefly make such objection
12
on or off the record during the course of the interview, provided that the interview is not thereby unduly disrupted.
7.3	DISCLOSURE.
(A)	When a member is to be interviewed as a witness in an investigation of any other member, the member being interviewed shall be fairly apprised prior to the beginning of questioning of the circumstances giving rise to the interview.
(B)	If during the interview of the witness, the investigator has reason to believe that the member being interviewed has become a focus of the investigation or has provided information which would cause the member to become a focus of another investigation for which it would be reasonable for the investigator to believe that either departmental or criminal charges may result, the investigator shall immediately notify the member of such belief and inform the member of his/her rights under this Article.
7.4	SUPERVISORY ACTION.
When, in the course of his/her duties, any supervisor witnesses an act for which he/she reasonably believes that departmental or criminal charges may result and, if physical evidence is present and the collection of that physical evidence is necessary to substantiate such charges, the supervisor may immediately collect that physical evidence.
Prior to any questioning concerning an act as addressed in this Section, which was witnessed by a supervisor, the member shall be informed of his/her rights under this Article. If an O.L.C. Representative is requested by the member, the supervisor need not wait more than one (1) hour for the arrival of the O.L.C. Representative.
7.5	INVESTIGATION QUESTIONING.
Members shall be informed of the allegations or basic facts of the incident prior to any questioning by an investigator and the member shall be informed, to the extent known at that time, whether the investigation is focused on the member for potential charges, either departmental or criminal. The member being investigated shall be given a copy and the member who is a witness shall be shown a copy of any citizen complaint or written summary of the basic facts of the incident of any non-citizen complaint prior to any questioning of the member being investigated. When the investigator reasonably believes that either departmental or criminal charges may result from a non-citizen complaint, the summary of the allegations or basic facts shall be in writing except when the investigator witnesses the violation.
13
A member will only be asked questions which relate to the allegations or basic facts of the incident unless, during questioning, other information is developed which could lead to additional allegations against the member. In such an event, the member will again be advised by the investigator of the potential for either departmental or criminal charges. When a member requests it, the member shall be given a brief period of time, prior to any questioning, to locate and review any written documents the member possesses regarding the event(s) being investigated, so the member may fully prepare to accurately and completely respond to the questioning. An investigator may accompany the member during the member's brief search for and review of such documents.
7.6	LEGAL RIGHTS.
A member who is to be questioned as a suspect in an investigation that may lead to criminal charges against the member shall be advised of his/her constitutional rights in accordance with the law.
7.7	CONDUCT OF INTERVIEW.
Any interrogating, questioning, or interviewing of a member will be conducted insofar as practical at hours reasonably related to the member's shift, preferably during the member's working hours. Interrogation sessions shall be for reasonable periods of time and time shall be allowed during such questioning for attendance to physical necessities. If at anytime during the interview the investigator believes that the filing of criminal charges against the member may result, the member shall be so informed and have the right, if requested, to consult with his/her O.L.C. Representative prior to any further questioning.
7.8	RECORD OF INTERVIEWS.
All interrogations and/or interviews (including polygraph interviews) of members conducted in conjunction with an Internal Affairs Bureau or EEO investigation shall be tape recorded by the Division of Police at the request of either party; and in the case of chain of command investigations, at the request of either party when the investigator reasonably believes that departmental or criminal charges may result. Subsequent to the interview, the member and/or his/her representative will be afforded the opportunity, upon written request directly to the Chief or his/her designee, to listen to, copy (at the member's expense) and make personal notes from or verify the accuracy of a tape made of his/her interview. If a transcript of the tape is made by the Division of Police, the member will be provided a copy of such transcript upon written request directly to the Chief or the Chief's designee.
7.9	INSUBORDINATION.
If a member has been advised that the investigation may result in criminal charges, his/her refusal to answer questions or to participate in the investigation shall not be considered insubordination or a like offense. In all other circumstances, before a member may be charged with insubordination or a like offense for refusing to answer
14
questions or participate in an investigation, the member shall be advised that such conduct, if continued, may be made the basis for such a charge.
7.10	ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE.
Any evidence obtained in the course of an investigation through the use of administrative pressures, threats, coercion, or promises shall not be admissible in any subsequent criminal action or Departmental hearing. However, explaining to a member that potential corrective action could result if he/she continues to refuse to answer questions or participate in an investigation shall not be construed as administrative pressures, threats, coercion or promises.
7.11	POLYGRAPH EXAMINATION.
Polygraph examinations shall be administered by the Polygraph Section of the Division of Police unless the Chief of Police decides to have the polygraph administered by another agency. Members may be given a polygraph examination only if they are the primary focus of an investigation, known witness to an incident, or at the member's written request directly to the Chief of Police and the member's O.L.C. Grievance-Liaison Chairman or designee. No polygraph examination shall be given in an incident that could not amount to a violation of law, unless requested by the member. No polygraph examination shall be given without the advance written approval of the Chief of Police. The results of this examination cannot be used in any subsequent criminal action unless properly stipulated prior to the giving of such examination in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio. Further, the results of this examination cannot be used in any subsequent Departmental action unless the City can produce additional evidence to corroborate the allegations.
7.12	COMPLAINTS.
When an anonymous complaint is made against a member and no corroborative evidence is obtained, the complaint shall be classified as unfounded and the accused member shall not be required to submit a written report. Also, when any citizen complaint is filed greater than sixty (60) calendar days after the date of the alleged event complained of, and where the complaint, if true, could not lead to a criminal charge, or does not allege critical misconduct which is supported by corroborative evidence, such complaint shall be classified as unfounded and the accused member shall not be required to submit a written report, but he/she shall be notified orally or in writing of such claim.
7.13	ACCESS OF RECORD.
A member who is charged with violating Division of Police Rules of Conduct and the member's O.L.C. Representative, when one is involved, shall be provided access to the City's transcripts, records, written statements, video tapes and written summaries (including opinions, if provided) of any polygraph examinations pertinent to the case. The member who is charged may request and receive, at no cost, a copy of the documentation to which the charged member was provided access. Such access, and
15
copies if requested in a timely manner, shall be provided reasonably in advance of said hearing. The Division of Police shall be provided access, reasonably in advance of the Departmental hearing, to the member's or the member's O.L.C. Representative's transcripts, records, written statements, video tapes, and written summaries (including opinions, if provided) of any polygraph examinations pertinent to the case.
7.14	INVESTIGATION OUTCOME.
Any member who has been under investigation and has been interviewed may, not less than twenty-eight (28) days after the interview, forward a written inquiry to the responsible Deputy Chief as to the status of the investigation. In response to the member's inquiry, the member shall be advised of the status of the investigation and, if known, the estimated time necessary to complete the investigation. At the conclusion of the investigation, the member shall be informed in writing of the outcome of the case.
7.15	VIOLATION.
If any of these procedures set forth within this Article are violated, such violations shall be subject to the Grievance Procedure.
(A)	A grievance resulting from an Internal Affairs Bureau or EEO investigation shall begin at Step 3.
(B)	A grievance resulting from a chain of command investigation shall begin at Step 1.
7.16	EXTERNAL INVESTIGATION PROCEDURES.
(A)	When any City entity outside of the Department of Public Safety initiates an investigation of a member and the Department orders the member to participate in such investigation, the member shall have all rights which would otherwise apply to an investigation conducted by the Internal Affairs Bureau.
(B)	When any non-city entity initiates an investigation of a member, the Division may order the member to appear before the investigating entity. Should such an order be issued, the member shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to meet with an O.L.C. Representative prior to complying with the order.
16
ARTICLE 8	- CORRECTIVE/DISCIPLINARY ACTION AND RECORDS
8.1	ENFORCEMENT.
Members shall comply with all City, departmental, and divisional work rules, policies, and directives as well as all Federal, State and local laws.
8.2	CORRECTIVE/DISCIPLINARY ACTION FOR CAUSE.
No bargaining unit member shall be removed, reduced in pay or position, suspended, given documented constructive counseling or a written reprimand, or suffer any career disadvantage except for just cause.
8.3	POSITIVE CORRECTIVE ACTION.
In those incidents where supervisors believe that positive corrective action would correct performance problems, the City encourages the use of positive corrective action by its supervisors. Positive corrective action encourages a willing modification of performance. Positive corrective action means those actions taken to correct a member's performance or behavior where the action taken, in and of itself, does not have a negative impact on the member. Examples of positive corrective action include non-documented oral counseling, retraining, mandatory professional assistance/evaluation, and referral to the Employee Assistance Program.
8.4	PROGRESSIVE ACTION.
For charges other than insubordination and EEO violations, the principles of progressive corrective action shall be followed for conduct not in violation of law. However, the charge of insubordination will only be used when no other charge is applicable to that conduct. The progression shall at least include documented constructive counseling before a written reprimand, a written reprimand before a suspension, and a suspension before a dismissal for the same or related offenses. If the offenses are of a critical nature, the Labor Relations Manager or designee may determine that a different sequence is required. In reaching a penalty determination, the nature and severity of the misconduct and the member's work record shall be taken into consideration.
8.5	ACTIONS OF RECORD.
When an investigation concerning a member occurs wherein corrective/disciplinary action of record may result, the member, at the conclusion of the investigation, shall be immediately notified of the result.
17
8.6	DEPARTMENTAL HEARINGS.
All departmental hearings shall be held before the City's Labor Relations Manager or designee. Prior to any departmental hearing before the Labor Relations Manager or designee, the charged member shall receive from the Chief of Police a written statement of all charges and specifications. At the Labor Relations Manager’s or designee's hearing, the charged member shall be allowed to be represented by an attorney and will be allowed to call witnesses material to his/her defense.
(A)	A member who is charged, or his/her representative, may make a written request for a continuance. Such request shall be granted where practicable at the discretion of the Labor Relations Manager or designee. The length of such continuance shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties.
(B)	The City shall make all good faith efforts to notify the affected member of any charges or of any decisions reached as a result of the Labor Relations Manager’s or designee's hearing prior to any public statement. The Labor Relations Manager or designee shall withhold any public statement for seventy-two (72) hours from the time of a decision or from the conclusion of any authorized leave which may have been granted to the affected member unless earlier notification directly to the member is confirmed. Hearings shall be held in the Labor Relations hearing room unless an alternative site is mutually agreed upon by the parties.
8.7	USE OF RECORDS.
All Division records of corrective/disciplinary actions shall be maintained in the following manner:
(A)	When a supervisor determines that corrective/disciplinary action is necessary, the supervisor shall follow the principles of progressive corrective/disciplinary action as outlined in Section 8.4 of this Article. A documented constructive counseling shall not be relied upon for any administrative purpose after nine (9) months, so long as there is no subsequent corrective/disciplinary action during the nine (9) month period. If there is subsequent corrective/disciplinary action, the time period shall be extended.
(B)	Actions of record shall be maintained in each member's Division master personnel file throughout his/her employment, with the exception that, at the member's written request to the Chief of Police and after three (3) years from the date of the action, fleet safety records and written reprimands shall have no further force and effect provided no further action of record has occurred. Written reprimands and safety records shall remain a part of the member's Division master personnel file and
18
maintained by the Division of Police until these materials can be legally destroyed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.
(C)	Actions of record (except for Fleet Safety Records and written reprimands) shall be maintained in each member's Division Master Personnel File throughout his/her employment. However, a member may, in writing, through his/her chain of command, request to the Chief of Police that such action of record have no further force or effect, provided no further action of record of the same or similar nature has occurred within four (4) years after the date of the incident which gave rise to the action. The Chief of Police shall grant such a request (and so note on the record of action) unless the incident was of a serious nature, as determined by the Chief.
(D)	In any case in which a documented constructive counseling, reprimand, suspension, or dismissal is overturned, the personnel record shall clearly indicate the same. In addition, unfounded or not sustained allegations or complaints of misconduct made against a member and appearing in Internal Affairs Bureau files shall not be considered in future corrective actions or future promotion consideration.
8.8	REVIEW OF PERSONNEL FILES.
Every member shall be allowed to review any of his/her personnel files except "confidential law enforcement records" and "trial preparation records" as defined in Ohio Revised Code §149.43 at any reasonable time upon written request. Such request shall be made to the supervisor directly responsible for maintenance of such files and review of the files shall be made in the presence of such supervisor or his/her designated representative. For the Division master personnel file, the request shall be made to the member's Subdivision Deputy Chief or his/her designated representative. Any member may copy documents in his/her file. The City may levy a charge for such copying, which charge shall bear a reasonable relationship to actual costs.
8.9	INACCURATE DOCUMENTS.
Should any member have reason to believe that there are inaccuracies in documents contained in the member's Division master personnel file, he/she may write a memorandum to the Deputy Chief of the Administrative Subdivision explaining the alleged inaccuracy. If the Deputy Chief concurs with the member's contention, the Deputy Chief shall so note on the face of the inaccurate document. If the Deputy Chief disagrees with the member's contention he/she shall attach the member's memorandum to the document in the file and note thereon his/her disagreement with the memorandum's contents.
19
8.10	PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS.
A member's signature on any inspection card or performance evaluation, if any, shall be viewed by the parties hereto only as a representation that he/she has read it. It shall not be viewed as a representation that a member has concurred in any or all of the contents or comments thereon. The performance evaluation will be used to provide feedback to members to improve performance, guide their professional development, and for promotional opportunities, if applicable. The original of the completed performance evaluation will be maintained in the member’s personnel file.
ARTICLE 9	- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
9.1	DEFINITION.
A grievance shall mean a complaint against the City arising under and during the term of this Contract by a member or the Union that there has been a violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of the specific terms of this Contract.
9.2	QUALIFICATION.
A grievance may be initiated by an aggrieved member or the O.L.C. When a group of members desires to file a grievance involving a situation affecting each member in the same manner, one member selected by such group shall process the grievance as the designated group representative.
9.3	JURISDICTION.
Nothing in this Grievance Procedure shall deny members any rights available at law to achieve redress of their legal rights, including the right to appeal to another forum, including the Civil Service Commission. However, once a member elects any other forum as his/her remedy and that forum takes jurisdiction over the subject matter, he/she is thereafter denied the remedy of the Grievance Procedure provided herein.
9.4	ESTABLISHMENT OF A GRIEVANCE-LIAISON REPRESENTATIVE.
The O.L.C. shall designate not more than one (1) Grievance-Liaison Chairman who may delegate his/her work to a Grievance-Liaison Representative.
9.5	O.L.C. OFFICIAL REPRESENTATION.
(A)	The O.L.C.'s duly constituted Grievance-Liaison Chairman or his/her designee, subject to providing notice to his/her supervisor at the earliest possible time prior to leaving the worksite, shall have the right and duty as to members in the bargaining unit to:
(1)	Represent said members in conference with representatives of the City when requested by said members.
20
(2)	Represent said members when requested by such members in the Grievance Procedure set out in this Article 9.
(B)	The O.L.C. Representative is required to complete an official Union request for leave form to be provided by the Labor Relations Manager detailing: day, time, reason and location of Union matters to maintain a record of the time spent on Union matters. This official request for leave form shall be given to the O.L.C. Representative's immediate supervisor for a matter of record. No Union matter of an internal union organizational nature shall be conducted during duty hours or overtime work, excepting only such matters as may involve extreme emergencies affecting the health or safety of a member. The O.L.C. Representative shall notify his/her supervisor prior to contacting any member on City time.
9.6	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
The following are the implementation steps and procedures for handling grievances:
(A)	Preliminary Step. A member shall first attempt to resolve individual grievances informally with his/her immediate supervisor. Such attempt at informal resolution shall be made by the member-grievant within ten (10) days following the events or circumstances giving rise to the grievance or when they reasonably should have been first known by the member-grievant. Grievances brought to the attention of the supervisor beyond the time limit shall not be considered. At this Step, there is no requirement that the grievance be submitted, or responded to, in writing; however, the Grievance-Liaison Representative may accompany the grievant, should the latter request his/her attendance. If the member is not satisfied with the oral response from his/her immediate supervisor at this Step, he/she may pursue the formal steps which follow. Before a grievance is placed in writing pursuant to Step One, such grievance shall be screened by the Grievance-Liaison Chairman or his/her designee.
(B)	Step One - Immediate Supervisor.
(1)	When a supervisor's oral response in the Preliminary Step is unsatisfactory, the member may then submit said grievance in writing to the supervisor on a Grievance Form. Such Form must be submitted to the supervisor within ten (10) days following the oral response from the Preliminary Step. The supervisor shall date the Form when he/she receives it. Grievances submitted beyond the time limit shall not be considered.
21
(2)	Within ten (10) days of his/her receipt of the written grievance, the immediate supervisor shall affix his/her written response to the Form, date and sign his/her response, and return all but one copy to the grievant. If the aggrieved member does not refer his/her grievance to the Second Step of the Procedure, the grievance shall be considered to be satisfactorily resolved.
(C)	Step Two - Chief of Police or Designee.
(1)	If the member is not satisfied with the answer in Step One, he/she may, within ten (10) days of receiving the same, appeal the grievance to Step Two by delivering a copy of the Grievance Form, the written response at the prior Step, and the grievant's reasons why the responses at the previous Step were not sufficient to resolve the grievance, to the Chief of Police or designee, with copies of the grievance forwarded to his/her immediate chain of command. The Chief of Police or designee shall date the Form, showing his/her office's date of receipt.
(2)	Within ten (10) days of his/her receipt of the Grievance Form, the Chief of Police or designee shall schedule and conduct a meeting to discuss the grievance with the Grievant and the Grievance-Liaison Chairman or his/her designee.
(3)	At the conclusion of this oral discussion, and within the above time limit, the Chief of Police or designee shall affix his/her written response to the Form, date and sign his/her response, and return all but one copy of it to the member-grievant. If the aggrieved member does not refer this grievance to Step Three of this Procedure, the grievance shall be considered to be satisfactorily resolved.
(D)	Step Three - Labor Relations Manager or Designee.
(1)	If the member is not satisfied with the answer in Step Two, he/she may within ten (10) days of receiving the same, appeal the grievance to Step Three by delivering or having delivered a copy of the Grievance Form, containing the written responses at the prior Steps, and the grievant's reasons why the responses at the previous Steps were not sufficient to resolve the grievance and any other pertinent documents, to the office of the Labor Relations Manager or designee. The Labor Relations Manager or designee shall date the Form, showing his/her office's date of receipt.
22
(2)	Within fourteen (14) days of his/her receipt of the Grievance Form, the Labor Relations Manager or designee shall investigate the grievance and shall schedule and conduct a meeting to discuss the grievance with the grievant. The grievant may bring the Grievance-Liaison Representative with him to the meeting.
(3)	In the meeting called for at this Step, the Labor Relations Manager or designee shall hear a full explanation of the grievance and the material facts relating thereto.
(4)	Within ten (10) days of the meeting in this Step, the Labor Relations Manager or designee shall submit to the Grievance-Liaison Representative his/her written response to the grievance.
(E)	Step Four - Arbitration.
(1)	Arbitration Notification. If a member, after receiving the written answer to his/her grievance at Step Three of the Grievance Procedure, still feels that the grievance has not been resolved to his/her satisfaction, he/she may request that the O.L.C. initiate arbitration. Should the O.L.C. approve the request, the O.L.C. shall notify the Labor Relations Manager or designee of the O.L.C.'s intention to proceed to arbitration within twenty-one (21) days of the Grievance-Liaison Representative's receipt of the written answer from the Labor Relations Manager or designee at Step Three.
(2)	Selection of Arbitrator.
(a)	The parties will maintain a permanent panel of six (6) arbitrators. An arbitrator shall be selected from the panel to hear grievances through random drawing. Within seven (7) calendar days after the Labor Relations Manager or designee receives the notification of the O.L.C.’s intention to proceed to arbitration, the parties’ representatives shall meet to select the arbitrator. Once selected, the arbitrator’s name will no longer be available for selection until all remaining arbitrators on the panel have been selected.
(b)	The arbitrator shall be notified of his\her selection to hear a grievance by a joint letter from the Labor Relations Manager or designee and the O.L.C., requesting that he/she set a date and time for the hearing subject to the availability of the City and O.L.C. representatives, provided that the hearing must be held within sixty (60) calendar days following the
23
selection of the arbitrator. If the selected arbitrator is unable to schedule the hearing within the sixty (60) day period, either the City or the O.L.C. may initiate the process to select another arbitrator from the panel through random drawing.
(c)	After all arbitrators on the panel have been selected once, the above process of selection using random drawing will be repeated.
(3)	Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator's role shall be to determine whether a violation of this Contract has occurred. In fulfilling that role, the arbitrator shall not add to, subtract from, change or modify any of the terms of this Contract. In discipline cases the arbitrator's role shall be limited to determining whether the member committed the act or omission for which the member was disciplined; if the arbitrator finds that the member committed the act or omission, the disciplinary penalty imposed by the Labor Relations Manager or designee shall not be changed. The arbitrator shall consider and decide only the question of whether there has been a violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of the specific provisions of this Contract based on the specific issue submitted to the arbitrator by the parties in writing. If no joint written stipulation of the issue is agreed to by the O.L.C. and the City, the arbitrator shall be empowered to determine and decide the issue raised by the grievance as submitted in writing at the First Step. The arbitrator shall be without power to make recommendations contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable laws or rules and regulations of administrative bodies that have the force and effect of law. The arbitrator shall not in any way limit or interfere with the powers, duties and responsibilities of the City under law and applicable court decisions. The decision of the arbitrator, if made in accordance with the jurisdiction and authority granted to the arbitrator pursuant to this Contract, will be accepted as final by the City, O.L.C. and the member(s), and all parties will abide by it.
(4)	Transcripts. A transcript shall be taken in any arbitration hearing involving a discharge.
(5)	Arbitrator's Findings. The arbitrator shall include specific findings of fact in his/her award and if a contract violation is found, he/she shall state the specific contract article(s) and section(s) that have been violated, the facts relied upon to find such a violation and the law, if any, relied upon to reach his/her decision.
24
(6)	Arbitration Expenses. The cost of the arbitration hearing, including the arbitrator's fee and expenses, the cost of the transcript, and the cost of the facility at which the hearing is held, shall be borne entirely by the losing party. Upon a separate motion by either party, the arbitrator will determine the proportion of expenses to be paid by each party.
(7)	Arbitration Panel. The parties agree to use the services of arbitrators selected for the panel provided for in Section 12.6 of the collective bargaining contract between the City and the Fraternal Order of Police, Capital City Lodge #9.
9.7	TIME OFF FOR PRESENTING GRIEVANCES.
A member and his/her Grievance-Liaison Representative shall be allowed time off from regular duties with pay for attendance at scheduled meetings under the Grievance Procedure with prior approval of their respective supervisors. The Grievance-Liaison Representative or grievant must obtain prior approval from the grievant's immediate supervisor before conducting meetings with the grievant while the grievant is on duty. Such approval by the supervisor shall not be unreasonably withheld. The meetings between a grievant and his/her Grievance-Liaison Representative shall be held at a police facility or the Union Office. The Grievance-Liaison Representative shall be allowed adequate time, as approved by the supervisor, off the job with pay to conduct a proper investigation of each grievance. Such approval will not be unreasonably withheld and the withholding of such approval shall result in an automatic, equivalent extension of time limits within which a grievant must appeal his/her grievance or have it heard.
9.8	ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS AND OTHER MATERIALS.
All documents and other materials upon which the City relies as the basis for the action taken which gave rise to the grievance shall, upon request, be furnished to the Grievance-Liaison Representative. The O.L.C. will, upon request, furnish to the City all documents and other materials upon which it relies as the basis for its position on the grievance.
9.9	GRIEVANCE-LIAISON REPRESENTATIVE.
Grievants and the Grievance-Liaison Representative shall not receive overtime pay to engage in grievance activities provided for herein. The O.L.C. shall notify the Chief of Police and the Labor Relations Manager or designee, in writing, of the name of the Grievance-Liaison Representative immediately following his/her appointment.
9.10	TIME LIMITS.
It is the City's and the O.L.C.'s intention that all time limits in the above Grievance Procedure shall be met. The parties' designated representatives may mutually agree, at any Step, to shorten time extensions, but any such extension must be in writing and signed by the parties. In the absence of such mutual extensions, at any Step where a
25
response is not forthcoming within the specified time limits, the grievance shall automatically be taken to the next step of the procedure. Any Step in the Grievance Procedure may be waived on any grievance by mutual written consent signed by both parties. A grievance may be processed through the chain of command whose actions gave rise to the grievance if different from that of the grievant.
9.11	REPRESENTATIVES IN MEETINGS.
In each step of the Grievance Procedure outlined in Section 9.6, certain specific representatives shall be given approval to attend the meetings therein prescribed. Either party may bring additional representatives that are necessary to any meeting in the Grievance Procedure.
9.12	GRIEVANCE FORMS.
The Labor Relations Manager or designee and the O.L.C. shall jointly develop a Grievance Form. Such Forms will be supplied by the O.L.C. The Form is to be prepared in triplicate. Copies of the completed Form, including the action taken, will be distributed as provided in Section 9.6. The jointly-developed Grievance Form will be made available to the Grievance-Liaison Representative.
9.13	NON-DISCRIMINATION.
No member or official of the Union shall be removed, disciplined, harassed, or discriminated against because he/she has filed or pursued a grievance under this Article.
ARTICLE 10	- LABOR RELATIONS MEETINGS
10.1	MEETINGS.
To facilitate communication, the City and the O.L.C. agree that the O.L.C. Grievance Chairman and the Administrative Deputy Chief of Police shall meet quarterly for the purpose of discussing matters of mutual concern, if necessary. The City's Labor Relations Manager shall serve as moderator/facilitator of such meetings. Additional meetings may be held upon mutual agreement.
10.2	ADDITIONAL PARTICIPATION.
Upon mutual agreement, additional interested parties may become participants in any meeting held under Section 10.1 above.
26
ARTICLE 11	- WORK RULES AND DIVISION DIRECTIVES
11.1	RULES AND DIRECTIVES.

However, any member not employed in the bargaining unit as of the effective date of this Contract and any member who has retired from the State of Ohio or any of its political subdivisions including the City, and is reemployed or hired by the City on or after June 24, 1987, shall not have prior service with the City, the State or Ohio or any of its political subdivisions recognized for purposes of determining the vacation accrual rate.
Requests for recognition of periods of full-time service with the State of Ohio and its political subdivisions for accrual rate purposes shall be made in writing and forwarded to the City Auditor through the Appointing Authority prior to the beginning of the pay period ending August 26, 1995, before adjustments can be made to the vacation accrual rate. Failure to meet this deadline will result in forfeiture of any rights set forth in this Paragraph and the preceding Paragraph of this Section 19.2 and forfeiture of any rights under Section 9.44 of the Ohio Revised Code. Adjustments to vacation accrual rates, based on previous employment with the State of Ohio or political subdivisions of the State as specified herein, shall be effective as soon as practicable following the verification by the Appointing Authority and certification by the City Auditor. This computation will be used only for the purpose of determining the rate at which vacation is earned. The provisions of this Paragraph and the preceding Paragraph of this Section 19.2 shall be in lieu of any prospective or retrospective application of Section 9.44 of the Ohio Revised Code. For all purposes herein, the parties agree that Section 9.44 of the Ohio Revised Code does not apply to this Contract or to any members in the bargaining unit.
19.3	PAYMENT FOR EXCESS VACATION BALANCES.
At the end of the last pay period in the vacation year, members may be paid for any vacation balances in excess of the maximums fixed by Section 19.2 of this Article upon certification by the Appointing Authority to the City Auditor and the approval of the City Council that due to emergency work requirements it is not in the best interests of the
42
City to permit the member to take vacation leave which would otherwise be forfeited as provided in Section 19.2.
19.4	EFFECT OF UNPAID STATUS ON VACATION ACCRUAL.
No vacation credit shall be allowed for any member working a forty (40) hour workweek for any pay period in which such member is off duty and not in paid status for more than eight (8) hours of regularly scheduled work except for paid military leave and; except that when a member is required to report for work and does so report and is denied work because of circumstances beyond his/her control, absence from work for the balance of that workday shall not be construed as unpaid work status for the purpose of this Article.
19.5	SEPARATION PAYMENT FOR VACATION.
A full-time member with more than thirteen (13) pay periods of vacation accrual in paid status who is about to be separated from City service through discharge, resignation, retirement, or layoff and who has unused vacation leave to his/her credit, shall be paid in a lump sum, less applicable withholding and any amounts owed by the member to the City, for each hour of unused vacation leave in lieu of granting such member a vacation leave after his/her last day of active service with the City, provided, however, that such payment shall not exceed the maximum number of vacation hours outlined in Section 19.2 based on length of total City service. However, such payment for members who retire shall be permitted to exceed the maximum accrual in Section 19.2(B) only to the extent that the member’s vacation leave account at the time of retirement exceeds the maximum accrual as a result of vacation time earned in the member’s last “vacation year” as that term is defined in Section 19.1. Vacation balances over the maximum accrual of less than one (1) full hour shall not be paid.
19.6	PAYMENT OF VACATION BALANCES OF DECEASED EMPLOYEES.
When a member dies while in paid status, any unused vacation leave to his/her credit shall be paid to the surviving spouse. In the event the member has no surviving spouse, said balance shall be paid to the estate of the deceased, any other provisions of this Article notwithstanding.
19.7	USE OF VACATION.
(A)	All vacation leaves shall be taken at such times as may be approved by the Appointing Authority.
(B)	For new hires or rehires, no vacation leave may be granted until the member has accrued thirteen (13) pay periods of vacation hours in continuous active City service at the rate of vacation accrual appropriate for that member.
43
(C)	Vacation leave may be taken in increments of one-tenth (1/10) of an hour with the approval of the Appointing Authority.
ARTICLE 20	- SICK LEAVE
20.1	SICK LEAVE ACCRUAL.
(A)	Each member shall receive sick leave as follows: No sick leave credit shall accrue for any such pay period in which such member is off duty and not in paid status more than eight (8) hours of regularly scheduled work except for paid military leave. During the first pay period of each calendar year, each full-time member employed on that date shall be credited with seventy-two (72) hours of sick leave with pay (hereafter referred to as "sick leave entitlement") for the remainder of that calendar year. Each fulltime member hired on or after the first pay period of each year shall, on the date of hire, receive sick leave entitlement for the remainder of that calendar year computed as follows: six (6.0) hours for each calendar month in the calendar year of hire, commencing with the month following the month in which the member was hired. However, for each full calendar month in which a member is in unpaid status, six (6.0) hours shall be deducted from his/her paid sick leave entitlement. When a member is required to report to work and does so report but is denied work because of circumstances beyond his/her control, absence from work for the balance of that calendar month shall not be considered as unpaid work status for the purposes of this section.
(B)	Sick leave shall be cumulative and any member having unused sick leave prior to the effective date of this Contract shall be credited with such unused sick leave for the purpose of this Contract.
(C)	No sick leave with pay shall accrue except for service as an employee of the City of Columbus.

(E)	No sick leave with pay shall accrue except for service as an employee of the City of Columbus, except that an employee who has been employed by the State of Ohio, or any political subdivision thereof, shall be credited with any certified, unused and unpaid balance of accumulated sick leave earned in such service, provided employment with the City occurs within
44
ten (10) years after leaving his/her prior position. Such unused sick leave balance shall be subject to all provisions of this Article, with the exception that such unused sick leave shall not be eligible for payment as described in Section 20.3.

(4)	Sickness of a spouse, child, step-child, and upon prior approval of the Chief of Police, a family member who is dependent for his/her health and well-being on the member. Members shall be granted not more than five (5) workdays in any calendar year for sickness in the immediate family. The Chief of Police or designee may require a certificate of the attending physician before paying any member under this Paragraph. In special cases where the Public Safety Director deems that more than five (5) workdays are necessary, the Director may, in his/her sole discretion, grant such leave.
(5)	Quarantine of a member because of exposure to a contagious disease. The Chief of Police or designee shall require a certificate of the attending physician before paying any member under this Paragraph.
(6)	Any member scheduled to work on a holiday as designated in Article 18 who reports sick shall be charged sick leave with pay for the number of hours that comprise the holiday.

45
(8)	In the event of death in the immediate family, each member shall be entitled to up to five (5) workdays for a funeral service and/or interment, if needed for these purposes. For purposes of this subsection, the immediate family shall include: spouse, son, daughter, brother, sister, parent, grandparent, grandchild, stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, stepsister, stepson, stepdaughter, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, grandparent-in-law, half brother, and half sister and persons who stand in the place of a parent.
(B)	The Chief of Police may require evidence as to the adequacy of the reason for any member's absence during the time for which sick leave is requested for more than three (3) days, or when the chain of command has cause to believe that the sick leave was not used for the purpose requested.
(C)	A member on sick leave with pay shall be at their place of residence during duty hours unless sick leave is due to death in the immediate family or the member is away from home to attend a doctor's appointment.
(D)	Sick leave with pay shall be charged at the rate of one-tenth (1/10) of an hour for each one-tenth (1/10) of an hour of regularly scheduled work from which a member is absent, when sick leave is chargeable to such absence under the provisions of this Article.
(E)	Pregnancy-related disabilities shall be treated as any other non-work-related disability.
20.3	PAYMENT UPON SEPARATION OR DEATH.
A member who is to be separated from the City service through discharge, resignation, retirement, or layoff, may, if he/she so desires, be paid in lump sum one (1) hour of pay for each six (6) hours of unused sick leave to his/her credit for total accruals up to and including 1,100 hours; one (1) hour of pay for each three (3) hours of unused sick leave to his/her credit for all accruals in excess of 1,100 hours up to and including 2,300 hours. Such payment shall be paid at the member's hourly rate of pay at time of separation.
No reimbursement shall be made to any member with less than one (1) year of service or one hundred ninety-two (192) hours accrued sick leave credit, except that, when a member dies while in paid status, all unused sick leave to his/her credit shall be paid in a lump sum to the surviving spouse. In the event the member has no surviving spouse, said balance shall be paid to the estate of the deceased, at the rates provided in the above Paragraph.
46
Effective January 1, 1997, and for any hours credited after January 1, 1997, for a member who is separated from City service through discharge, resignation, retirement or layoff on or before December 31 of any year, the number of sick leave hours which that member has to his/her credit at the time of separation shall be reduced by the number of paid sick leave hours used plus six (6.0) hours for each calendar month remaining in the calendar year following the month of separation. If, after such calculation, the member has any unused sick leave hours for that calendar year, the member shall be paid, at the time of separation, for such unused sick leave hours for that year, at his/her regular straight-time hourly rate in effect at that time, less applicable withholding and any amounts owed by the member to the City. If, after such calculation, the member has used more sick leave hours than that to which he/she was entitled, an amount shall be deducted from his/her final paycheck for such hours, at his/her regular straight-time hourly rate in effect at that time.
20.4	CONVERSION OF SICK LEAVE.
Each member may, during the month of January of each year, convert sick leave to vacation leave subject to the following conditions:

Following election for participation in the sick leave reciprocity program, a member may convert sick leave to vacation as provided in Section 20.4. No interest is planned or to be paid by the City on this account. Effective January, 2000 and each year thereafter, members must select between receiving Sick Leave Reciprocity or Conversion of Sick Leave as outlined in Section 20.4.
47
ARTICLE 21	- INJURY LEAVE
21.1	INJURY LEAVE WITH PAY.
All members shall be allowed injury leave with pay up to a maximum of sixty (60) work days per calendar year for on-the-job injuries, not to exceed a total of one hundred twenty (120) workdays per injury. Any injury leave which is granted for reasons permissible under a FMLA leave as provided in Section 22.6 shall be charged as a FMLA leave and shall be subject to the twelve (12) week per year limitation for the length of a FMLA leave.
Injuries must be reported to the member's immediate supervisor no more than forty-eight (48) hours after such injury is known. If a member who has been granted injury leave does not begin receiving payments in lieu of wages from the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation by the time the injury leave has been utilized, and the member has a claim filed under the Ohio Workers' Compensation laws for such payment, then the City shall continue to pay the member seventy-two percent (72%) of his/her wages until such time as payments from the Bureau are received or the claim is denied by the Bureau. In any instance of double payment by both the City and the Bureau for the same day or days, the member shall provide full reimbursement to the City in a prompt manner.
21.2	ELIGIBLE INJURIES.
Injury leave with pay shall be granted to a member only for injuries determined by the Director of Human Resources or designee as caused by the actual performance of the duties of the member's position.
21.3	REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
A report of the cause of all injuries signed by the immediate supervisor, the Division Administrator, and the Appointing Authority shall be submitted to the Director of Human Resources or designee within four (4) days of the date the injury is reported by the member on forms designed and furnished by the Director of Human Resources or his/her designee.
21.4	AUTHORIZATION OF INJURY LEAVE.
No member shall be granted injury leave with pay unless the Appointing Authority has in his/her possession written authorization signed by the Director of Human Resources or designee indicating the approximate length of the leave. No member on injury leave shall be returned to work without the written approval of an attending physician. If there is a recurrence of a previous injury, the Appointing Authority must request approval of injury leave for each recurrence. If, in the judgment of the Director of Human Resources or designee, the injury is such that the member is capable of performing his/her regular duties or light duties during the period of convalescence, the Director of Human
48
Resources or designee shall so notify the Appointing Authority in writing and deny injury leave with pay. Whenever a member is required to stop working because of an injury or other service-connected disability, he/she shall be paid for the remaining hours of that day or shift at his/her regular rate, and such time shall not be charged to leave of any kind.
21.5	APPEALS TO THE BOARD OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.
Any injured member may appeal the decision of the Director of Human Resources or designee by written notice to the Board of Industrial Relations within ten (10) days of notification that injury leave has been denied. The Board of Industrial Relations, at the City's expense, may require a member to be examined by a physician of the Board's choice.
21.6	LEAVE WHILE CLAIM IS PENDING.
Pending a decision by the Director of Human Resources or designee, a member applying for injury leave may be carried on sick leave or vacation leave with pay, in that order, which shall be restored to his/her credit upon certification by the Director of Human Resources or designee that injury leave has been approved. However, when a member is applying for injury leave, exclusive of apparent heart attack cases, and the Chief of Police can establish that the injury occurred during the member's hours of work for the City, then the member may be carried on injury leave with pay pending certification by the Director of Human Resources or designee that injury leave has been approved. In no case may the member be carried on injury leave for a period of time in excess of the member's amount of accumulated sick leave and vacation leave prior to certification by the Director of Human Resources or designee that injury leave has been approved. If injury leave is not certified by the Director of Human Resources or designee, the member will be charged sick leave, and vacation leave, in that order, for the time used.
21.7	INJURY LEAVE FOR EXAMINATION AND TREATMENT.
Pursuant to rules established by the Director of Human Resources or designee, time off for the purpose of medical examination, including examinations by the Bureau of Workers' Compensation, and/or treatments resulting from injury occurring during any period of time a member was in paid status and performing services for the City required by his/her employment shall be charged to injury leave.
21.8	INSURANCE CONTINUATION.
While a member is on approved injury leave with pay or upon proof that a member is receiving payments in lieu of wages from the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation, the accrual of employee benefits shall continue uninterrupted and the City shall maintain applicable insurance benefits for the member until such time as the member returns to duty, resigns, retires or is terminated.

(1)	When notified by the court to report for jury duty on a day certain, a time report shall be completed and signed by the assignment commissioner or appropriate court official for each day during jury service setting forth the time of arrival and departure from the court. Such record shall be presented by the member to his/her supervisor upon return to work.
(2)	When a member is not required to be in court for jury duty for two (2) or more hours of his/her regular shift, he/she shall report to work for such time at the beginning of his/her work shift before being required to report to jury duty and/or after being released from jury duty two (2) or more hours before the end of his/her work shift.

(2)	Any member who has entered the service as stated above must request restoration to the position within ninety (90) days of receiving an honorable discharge from the armed forces or the position shall be declared vacant.

(2)	"Child" means a child either under eighteen (18) years of age, or eighteen (18) years or older who is incapable of self-care because of mental or physical disability. A member’s "child" is one for whom the member has actual day-to-day responsibility for care and includes a biological, adopted, foster or stepchild or the child of one standing in loco parentis.
(3)	"Parent" means a biological parent or an individual who stands or stood in loco parentis to a member when the member was a child. This term does not include parents "in law."

(3)	Any period of incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition that requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care provider, continues over an extended period of time, and may cause episodic rather than continuing periods of incapacity, i.e., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.; or
(4)	Any period of incapacity that is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective, i.e., Alzheimer's, severe stroke, terminal illness, so long as the member or family member is under the continuing supervision of a health care provider; or
(5)	Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments by a health care provider either for restorative surgery after accident or surgery, or for a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three (3) days in the absence of medical intervention, i.e., cancer (chemotherapy, radiation), severe arthritis (physical therapy) or kidney disease (dialysis).

(E)	Upon return from FMLA leave, the member shall be returned to the position held prior to the leave or an equivalent position.

(G)	During an unpaid FMLA leave, members shall not continue to accrue seniority or continuous service and shall not accrue any employment benefits for the period of the leave, except for continuation of insurance benefits as provided in Paragraph (F) immediately above.
(H)	All accrued sick leave benefits must be utilized for any FMLA leave taken for any reason. All accrued vacation leave benefits must be substituted for all or part of any unpaid FMLA leave taken for any reason after sick leave benefits have first been exhausted.

(I)	The following notice and scheduling requirements shall apply to FMLA leave requests:
(1)	Members must give thirty (30) days notice to the City before taking FMLA leave, if the need for leave is foreseeable.

(2)	If a member has actual notice of the notice requirement stated in 22.6(I)(1) above, (this requirement of actual notice is fulfilled by posting a notice at the worksite), and fails to provide the City with thirty (30) days notice for a foreseeable leave with no reasonable excuse for the delay, the City may deny the taking of leave until at least thirty (30) days after the member provides notice.
(3)	Members shall provide at least verbal notice sufficient to make the City aware that the member needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. The City may inquire further of the member if it is necessary to have more information about whether FMLA leave is to be taken.
55
(4)	If a member takes leave based on the serious health condition of the member or to care for a family member, the member must make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment so as to not unduly disrupt the City's operation.
(J)	The following medical certification requirements shall apply to FMLA leave requests:
(1)	Members who request leave because of their own serious health condition or the serious health condition of a covered family member shall be required to provide a certification issued by the health care provider of the member or the member’s family member on a form acceptable to the Human Resources Director or designee. For the member’s own medical leave, the certification must include a statement that the member is unable to perform the functions of the member’s position and a statement of the regimen of treatment prescribed for the condition by the health care provider (including estimated number of visits, nature, frequency and duration of treatment). For leave to care for a seriously ill child, spouse or parent, the certification must include a statement that the patient requires assistance for basic medical, hygiene, nutritional needs, safety or transportation, or that the member’s presence or assistance would be beneficial or desirable for the care of the family member, and an estimate of the amount of time the member is needed to provide care.
(2)	The City shall give members requesting FMLA leave written notice of the requirement for medical certification.
(3)	In its discretion, the City may require a second medical opinion and periodic recertification at its own expense. If the first and second opinions differ, the City, at its own expense, may obtain the binding opinion of a third health care provider, approved jointly by the member and the City.
(4)	Members must provide the requested certification to the City within the time frame requested by the City, unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to do so despite the member’s diligent, good faith efforts. The City must allow at least fifteen (15) calendar days after the City's request for certification.
56
(5)	In most cases, the City shall request that a member furnish certification from a health care provider at the time the member requests FMLA leave or soon after the leave is requested, or in the case of unforeseen leave, soon after the leave commences. The City may request certification or recertification at some later date if the City has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration.

If the participating providers are not used, co-insurance will reduce to 60/40 percent of reasonable charges. The additional twenty percent (20%) co-insurance will be the member’s responsibility and is not counted toward the deductible, co-insurance or out-of-pocket maximum. Any PPO network modifications by the Plan Administrator will apply.

The Plan Administrator will recommend alternate medical treatment on a case-by-case basis. Alternate medical treatment benefits refer to expenses that are approved before they are incurred, which may not otherwise be payable as covered expenses under the medical plan.
62
24.3	COST CONTAINMENT.
(A)	Pre-Admission Certification.
If a member or a dependent is informed that a non-emergency inpatient admission or inpatient psychiatric treatment is necessary, the admission must be pre-certified by the City's medical utilization review administrator. If no pre-certification was made, a ten percent (10%) co-insurance will be applied, in addition to the deductible and co-insurance provisions.

This ten percent (10%) co-insurance does not apply to the out-of-pocket maximum. Based on medical information obtained prior to the surgery, the City’s medical
63
utilization review administrator may waive the mandatory second surgical opinion required in specific cases.
(E)	Emergency Admissions.
Emergency inpatient hospital confinements including inpatient psychiatric treatment must be certified within 48 hours of admission or a ten percent (10%) penalty will be applied to total charges in addition to the deductible, co-insurance and out-of-pocket maximum. In the event the care is determined to be medically unnecessary, the member will be responsible for the cost of all medically unnecessary care.
(F)	Continued Treatment and Technological Review.
Certain outpatient non-emergency therapy, outpatient continued treatment, and advanced technological treatments recommended by the member's attending physicians will require the City's medical utilization review administrator's approval.

Also, if the member's physician instructs the member to receive any of the listed technological procedures, it is necessary for the member to contact the City's Medical Utilization Review Administrator to obtain pre-treatment authorization.
In the event the member does not obtain authorization for continued therapy, treatment, or technological review, the member will be responsible for ten percent (10%) of the total charges, in addition to his/her deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximum provisions. In the event the care the member receives is determined to be medically unnecessary, he/she will be responsible for all medically unnecessary care.
(G)	A mental health and/or substance abuse case management benefit will be available whereby an eligible participant may elect to exchange unused mental health or substance abuse inpatient days for other needed mental health or substance abuse benefits as determined by the Plan Administrator. The medical necessity and exchange rate shall be determined by the Plan Administrator.
