The Union agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Employer from and against any and all claims, demands, suits or actions of any kind, nature or description arising out of the deduction, payment, or withholding contemplated in this Section, including but not limited to any judgment, settlement, court costs and/or attorney fees incurred by the Employer except the Union shall not have to indemnify the Employer in cases involving malicious and intentional acts on the part of the Employer.

Seniority- Refer to Section 6.6 for reinstatement of seniority after lay-off.
11.0 DISCIPLINE AND DISCHARGE
Employees covered by this Agreement shall be disciplined only for just cause.
11.1	Progressive Discipline
Discipline for infractions of work rules will generally require progressive discipline as follows:
First Step: Oral reprimand - this is an oral warning to employees that their conduct is unacceptable, and that further infractions will lead to more severe penalties. A written statement of the oral warning will be placed in the file but will be removed after 12 months if the misconduct does not reoccur.
Second Step: Written reprimand - this reprimand will describe the unacceptable conduct or performance and specify the improvement needed. A copy of this written reprimand will be retained in the employee's personnel file.
Third Step: Suspension - an employee who fails to improve his or her performance within a 12-month period following the oral reprimand may be suspended without pay for a period not to exceed 10 days. During said suspension, health, dental and life insurance as provided for in Paragraph 9.2 shall continue to be maintained.
Fourth Step: Termination - an employee who fails to improve following a
95
suspension or who commits some conduct of a serious nature to warrant immediate termination will be discharged as follows:
11.2	Termination and Exceptions
If the Employer believes that it has just cause to terminate an employee, the employee may immediately be suspended without pay by written (registered, certified or hand delivered) communication to the employee and the Union Steward which specifies the conduct which supports the suspension. Within 5 days of the suspension, a Notice of Intent to Discharge shall be issued to the employee and the Union Steward setting forth with specificity the conduct which the Employer believes constitutes just cause for discharge. The Notice shall state the date on which discharge is to take effect, which shall not be less than five working days from the date of the mailing of the Notice. Upon the invocation by the Union of the grievance procedure contained in Section 12.0, the Notice of Intent to Discharge shall not take effect until such procedures are exhausted or abandoned and the employee's unpaid suspension shall continue until said procedures are completed. If a terminated employee cannot immediately remove his/her personal belongings, the employee shall make an appointment with the employer to remove the belongings within ten (10) days.
The Employer and the Union recognize that some conduct is of such a serious nature to warrant immediate termination rather than progressive discipline.
96
Those circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following situations: arson to LAWV property, embezzlement, assault on LAWV employees or clients, destruction of LAWV property, theft of LAWV property or funds, unreasonable absences from the work place for five (5) consecutive work days for which prior approval was not received, and abandonment or gross neglect of cases.
