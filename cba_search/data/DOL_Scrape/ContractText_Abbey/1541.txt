The American Arbitration Association shall submit the second Panel List within forty-eight (48) hours after being requested so to do. In the event that the parties cannot mutually agree upon the arbitrator to be selected from the Second Panel List within five (5) days after it is received, then, within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter, the American Arbitration Association shall be requested to designate an arbitrator and the person so designated shall be acceptable by the parties hereto. The American Arbitration Association shall designate such arbitrator within forty-eight (48) hours after being requested so to do.

It is understood that the User of construction services is concerned with the total project being completed and delivered on time without unnecessary or undue delay created by the involved contractors. Full cooperation and coordination of the efforts of all contractors, their workmen, and supervisory personnel is required.

Anything contained in the respective Collective Bargaining Agreements between the parties hereto to the contrary notwithstanding, the work day or shift work or type of job subject to coverage under a particular collective bargaining agreement as defined in the said respective Collective Bargaining Agreements may be changed during the term of said Collective Bargaining Agreements by mutual agreement between Employer and the Business Manager of LOCAL UNION to such work day or shift work or wage rate as shall be established as aforesaid on any given project on a job-by-job basis.

Area practice, prior agreements and decisions of record shall be taken into account; however, in the event a unanimous agreement is not reached, the contractor who has responsibility for the performance and installation shall make a specific assignment.
