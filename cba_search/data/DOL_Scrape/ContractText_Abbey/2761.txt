This MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING, hereinafter referred to as the Contract, entered into by the STATE OF CALIFORNIA, hereinafter referred to as the State or the State employer, pursuant to Sections 19815.4 and 3517 of the Government Code, and the CALIFORNIA STATE EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION (Civil Service Division), Local 1000, SEIU, AFL/CIO, CLC, hereinafter referred to as CSEA, Local 1000, or the Union, pursuant to the Ralph C.

1.2.1	Designation of Confidential Positions Unit 1
A.	“Confidential employee” is defined as any employee who is required to develop or present managements positions with respect to employer-employee relations or whose duties normally require access to confidential information contributing significantly to the development of management positions [Government Code Section 3513(f)].

2.	Processing Workers’ Compensation claims, appointment papers, Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) applications and policies; examination design and execution, training of employees; handling post and bid programs.
10
BU 1

Each appointing power may have at least one position designated as confidential.
D.	If the State proposes to designate positions as confidential, the State shall provide Notice to the Union and shall meet and confer with the Union upon request. If the parties are unable to agree, the confidential designation dispute shall be submitted to PERB for resolution.
E.	The State agrees that no Union officer, bargaining unit council member, or job steward shall be involuntarily transferred, assigned or designated into a confidential position.
F.	The State agrees to provide the Union with a list of incumbents in confidential positions by department; including names, classifications and positions numbers; no later than thirty (30) days after ratification of this Contract.
G.	Any grievance regarding this Contract section shall be filed by the Union at Step 3 (DPA).

11
BU 1
03-05
C.	Area of Representation - A Union steward's "area of primary representation" is defined as an institution, office, or building. However, the parties recognize that it may be necessary for the Union to assign a steward an area of representation for several small offices, department, or buildings within close proximity. Disputes regarding this paragraph may be appealed directly to the DPA Step of the Grievance Procedure.
2.2	Access
A.	Union stewards, Union staff, and/or elected bargaining unit council representatives may have access to employees to represent them pursuant to Section 2.1 A. above.

2.6	Steward Time Off
Upon request of an aggrieved employee, a steward shall be allowed reasonable time off during working hours, without loss of compensation, for representational purposes in accordance with Section 2.1 A. of this Contract, provided the employee represented is in the steward's designated area of representation. Release time for these purposes is subject to prior notification and approval by the steward's immediate supervisor. Upon mutual agreement of the parties, a reasonable number of additional stewards can also be granted reasonable time off under this section.
2.7	Employee Time Off

ARTICLE 8	- LEAVES
8.1	Vacation Leave
A.	Employees shall not be entitled to vacation leave credit for the first six (6) months of service. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of six (6) qualifying monthly pay periods of continuous service, all full-time employees covered by this section shall receive a one-time vacation bonus of forty-two (42) hours of vacation credit. Thereafter, for each additional qualifying monthly pay period, the employee shall be allowed credit for vacation with pay on the first day of the following month as follows:
7 months to 3 years
37 months to 10 years
121 months to 15 years
181 months to 20 years
20 years and over
7 hours per month
10 hours per month
12	hours per month
13	hours per month
14	hours per month
An employee who returns to State service after an absence of six (6) months or longer, caused by a permanent separation, shall receive a one-time vacation credit on the first monthly pay period following completion of six (6) qualifying pay periods of continuous service in accordance with the employee's total State service before and after the absence.
B.	A full-time employee who has eleven (11) or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall earn vacation credits as set forth under Item A. above. Absences from State service resulting from a temporary or permanent separation for more than eleven (11) consecutive working days which fall into two consecutive qualifying pay periods shall disqualify the second pay period.
C.	Employees working less than full-time accrue vacation in accordance with the chart shown in Section 7 L. of this Contract.
D.	Vacation credits may be taken in fifteen (15) minute increments.
34
BU 1

E.	Employees are authorized to use existing fractional vacation hours that may have been accumulated.
F.	Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for accrued vacation credits for all accrued vacation time.
G.	Subject to operational needs, the time when vacation shall be taken by the employee shall not be unreasonably denied. Employee vacation requests shall be submitted and granted or denied in writing in a timely manner. Vacations can only be cancelled when unanticipated operational needs require it.
H.	Vacation requests must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on this subject. However, when two (2) or more employees on the same shift (if applicable) in a work unit (as defined by each department head or designee) request the same vacation time and approval cannot be given to all employees requesting it, employees shall be granted their preferred vacation period in order of seniority (defined as total months of State service in the same manner as vacation is accumulated). When two (2) or more employees have the same amount of State service, department seniority will be used to break the tie. Vacation schedules, which have been established in a work unit, pursuant to the seniority provisions in this Article, shall not be affected by employee(s) entering the unit after the schedule has been established.
I.	By June 1 of each calendar year those employees whose vacation balance exceeds, or could exceed by December 31, the vacation cap of Section 8.1 J. must submit to their supervisor for approval a plan to use vacation to bring their balance below the cap. If the employee fails to submit a plan, or adhere to an approved plan, the department head or designee has the right to order an employee to take sufficient vacation to reduce the employee's vacation balance or potential balance on December 31 below the cap specified in Section 8.1 J.
J.	If an employee in Unit 1, 14 or 20 does not use all of the vacation that the employee has accrued in a calendar year, the employee may carry over his/her accrued vacation credits to the following calendar year to a maximum of six hundred forty (640) hours. A department head or designee may permit an employee to carry over more than six hundred forty (640) hours of accrued vacation hours if an employee was unable to reduce his/her accrued hours because the employee: (1) was required to work as a result of fire, flood, or other extensive emergency; (2) was assigned work of a priority or critical nature over an extended period of time; (3) was absent on full salary for compensable injury; (4) was prevented by department regulations from taking vacation until December 31 because of sick leave; or (5) was on jury duty.
8.2	Sick Leave
A.	As used in this section, "sick leave" means the necessary absence from duty of an employee because of:
1.	Illness or injury, including illness or injury relating to pregnancy;
2.	Exposure to a contagious disease which is determined by a physician to require absence from work;
35
BU 1
03-05
3.	Dental, eye, and other physical or medical examination or treatment by a licensed practitioner;
4.	Absence from duty for attendance upon the employee's ill or injured mother, father, husband, wife, domestic partner (as defined in accordance with Family Code Section 297), son, daughter, brother, sister, or any person residing in the immediate household. Such absence shall be limited to six (6) workdays per occurrence or, in extraordinary situations, to the time necessary for care until physician or other care can be arranged.
B.	A full-time employee who has eleven (11) or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall be eligible for up to eight (8) hours of sick leave credit. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each qualifying pay period of service, each full-time employee shall earn eight (8) hours of credit for sick leave with pay.
C.	Credit for less than full-time employees shall be computed as follows:
1.	Part-time employees: On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each monthly pay period of continuous service, each part-time employee shall be allowed, on a pro rata basis, the fractional part of his/her appropriate accrual rate of credit for sick leave with pay in accordance with the schedule in Article 7.
2.	Multiple positions under this rule:
a.	An employee holding a position in State service in addition to the primary full-time position with the State shall not receive credit for sick leave with pay for service in the additional position;
b.	Where an employee holds two (2) or more "less than full-time positions," the time worked in each position shall be combined for purposes of computing credits for sick leave with pay, but such credits shall not exceed the amount earned for (8 hours per pay period) full-time employment credit.
D.	An employee may be required to provide a physician's or licensed practitioner's verification of sick leave when:
1.	The employee has a demonstrable pattern of sick leave abuse; or
2.	The supervisor has good reason to believe the absence was for an unauthorized reason. A supervisor has good reason if a prudent person would also believe the absence was for an unauthorized reason.
E.	An employee will not be denied the right to use sick leave or be subject to any type of corrective or disciplinary action, or in any manner discriminated against for using or attempting to exercise his/her right to use sick leave based solely on the amount of use.
36
BU 1
03-05
F.	The department head or designee shall approve sick leave only after having ascertained that the absence is for an authorized reason and may require the employee to submit substantiating evidence including, but not limited to, a physician's or licensed practitioner's verification. The State recognizes the confidential nature of the relationship between the health care provider and patient. However, such substantiation shall include, but not be limited to, the general nature of the employee's illness or injury and prognosis (i.e., the anticipated length of the absence, any restrictions upon return to work that prevent the employee from performing the full range of his/her normal work assignment and anticipated future absences). If the department head or designee does not consider the evidence adequate, the request for sick leave shall be disapproved. Upon request, a denial of sick leave shall be in writing stating the reason for denial.
G.	Sick leave may be accumulated without limit.
H.	Sick leave may be requested and taken in fifteen (15) minute increments.
I.	A full-time employee whose continuity of employment is broken by a permanent separation of six (6) months or longer and is subsequently reemployed cannot be credited with any unused sick leave accumulated prior to the employee's separation and the full-time employee must complete one month of continuous service before being granted one day of sick leave credit. In addition, when a full-time employee has a break in the continuity of employment because of a permanent separation of less than six (6) months or because of a temporary separation, the full-time employee's prior unused sick leave balance is restored.
J.	When an employee's sick leave balance is zero, other leave credits such as vacation, CTO, PLP, personal holiday, or holiday leave may be substituted with the supervisor's approval, and shall not be unreasonably denied.
8.3	Bereavement Leave
A.	A department head or designee shall authorize bereavement leave with pay for a permanent or probationary full-time State employee due to the death of his/her parent, stepparent, spouse, domestic partner (as defined in accordance with Family Code Section 297), child, grandchild, grandparent, brother, sister, stepchild, or death of any person residing in the immediate household of the employee at the time of death. An intervening period of absence for medical reasons shall not be disqualifying when, immediately prior to the absence, the person resided in the household of the employee. Such bereavement leave shall be authorized for up to three (3) eight-hour days (24 hours) per occurrence. The employee shall give notice to his/her immediate supervisor as soon as possible and shall, if requested by the employee's supervisor, provide substantiation to support the request upon the employee's return to work.

Such bereavement leave shall be authorized for up to three (3) eight-hour days (24 hours) in a fiscal year. The employee shall give notice to his/her immediate supervisor as soon as possible and shall, if requested by the employee's supervisor, provide substantiation to support the request.
C.	If the death of a person as described above requires the employee to travel over 400 miles one way from his/her home, additional time off with pay shall be granted for two (2) additional days which shall be deducted from accrued leave. Should additional leave be necessary, the department head or designee may authorize the use of other existing leave credits or authorized leave without pay. Any such request shall not be arbitrarily or unreasonably denied.
D.	Employees may utilize their annual leave, vacation, CTO, or any other earned leave credits for additional time required in excess of time allowed in A. or B. above. Sick leave may be utilized for Bereavement Leave in accordance with the sick leave provision of this Contract in Section 8.2. Any such request shall not be arbitrarily or unreasonably denied.
E.	Fractional time base (part-time) employees will be eligible for bereavement leave on a pro rata basis, based on the employees' fractional time base. (See schedule in Article 7.)
8.4	Parental Leave
A.	A female permanent employee shall be entitled, upon request, to an unpaid leave of absence for purposes of pregnancy, childbirth, recovery therefrom or care for the newborn child for a period not to exceed one (1) year. The employee shall provide medical substantiation to support her request for pregnancy leave.

B.	If payment is made for such time off, the employee is required to remit to the State jury fees received. If an employee elects to use accrued vacation leave or compensating time off while on jury duty, the employee is not required to remit jury fees.

C.	For an employee summoned to jury duty during hours other than the employee's regular and customary shift, management will endeavor to temporarily reassign the employee to a work shift that more closely coincides with the hours the employee is required to serve on jury duty, including any necessary travel time, subject to the following:

B.	At the discretion of the State, all or a portion of unused Personal Leave credits may be cashed out at the employee's salary rate at the time the Personal Leave payment is made. It is understood by both parties that the application of this cash-out provision may differ from department to department and from employee to employee. Departments shall consider an employee's request to retain leave credits for future use rather than have the leave cashed out. Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for unused Personal Leave credits in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Cash-out or lump-sum payment for any Personal Leave credits shall not be considered as "compensation" for purposes of retirement. If funds become available for the Personal Leave Program, departments will offer employees the opportunity to cash out accrued Personal Leave.

D.	Personal Leave credits shall not be counted towards the 1,734/1,934 hours of compensation for Special School employees subject to the State Special Schools 10-Month Compensation Agreement.
8.16	Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
A.	The State acknowledges its commitment to comply with the spirit and intent of the leave entitlement provided by the FMLA and the California Family Rights Act (CFRA) referred to collectively as "FMLA”. The State and the Union recognize that on occasion it will be necessary for employees of the State to take job-protected leave for reasons consistent with the FMLA. As defined by the FMLA, reasons for an FMLA leave may include an employee's serious health condition, for the care of a child, spouse, domestic partner (as defined in Family Code Section 297), or parent who has a serious health condition, and/or for the birth or adoption of a child.
B.	For the purposes of providing the FMLA benefits the following definitions shall apply:
1.	An eligible employee means an employee who meets the eligibility criteria set forth in the FMLA;
2.	An employee's child means any child, regardless of age, who is affected by a serious health condition as defined by the FMLA and is incapable of self care. "Care" as provided in this section applies to the individual with the covered health condition;
3.	An employee's parent means a parent or an individual standing in loco parentis as set forth in the FMLA;
4.	Leave may include paid sick leave, vacation, annual leave, personal leave, catastrophic leave, holiday credit, excess hours, and unpaid leave. In accordance with the FMLA, an employee shall not be required to use CTO credits, unless otherwise specified by Section 8.8 of this Contract.
a.	FMLA absences due to illness and/or injury of the employee or eligible family member, may be covered with the employee's available sick leave credits and catastrophic leave donations. Catastrophic leave eligibility and sick leave credit usage for a FMLA leave will be administered in accordance with Sections 8.8 and 8.2 of this Contract.
b.	Other leave may be substituted for the FMLA absence due to illness and/or injury, at the employee's discretion. An employee shall not be required to exhaust all paid leave, before choosing unpaid leave, unless otherwise required by Section 8.8 of this Contract.
45
BU 1
03-05
c.	FMLA absences for reasons other than illness and/or injury (i.e., adoption or care of an eligible family member), may be covered with leave credits, other than sick leave, including unpaid leave, at the employee's discretion. Except in accordance with Section 8.8 of this Contract, an employee shall not be required to exhaust all leave credits available before choosing unpaid leave to cover an FMLA absence.
C.	An eligible employee shall provide certification of the need for an FMLA leave. Additional certification may be requested if the department head or designee has reasonable cause to believe the employee's condition or eligibility for FMLA leave has changed. The reasons for the additional certification request shall be provided to the employee in writing.
D.	An eligible employee shall be entitled to a maximum of twelve (12) workweeks (480 hours) FMLA leave per calendar year and all other rights set forth in the FMLA. This entitlement shall be administered in concert with the other leave provisions in Article 8 of this Contract. Nothing in this Contract should be construed to allow the State to provide less than that provided by the FMLA.
E.	On January 1 of each year, FMLA leave shall be recorded in accordance with the calendar year. Each time an employee takes an FMLA leave, the remaining leave entitlement is any balance of the twelve (12) workweeks that has not been used during the current calendar year. Employees who have taken FMLA leave under the previous 12 month rolling period, shall be entitled to additional leave up to a total of 12 weeks for the current calendar year.
F.	An employee on FMLA leave has a right to be restored to his/her same or "equivalent" position (FMLA) or to a "comparable" position (CFRA) with equivalent pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment.
G.	For the purposes of computing seniority, employees on paid FMLA leave will accrue seniority credit in accordance with the Department of Personnel Administration Rules 599.608 and 599.609.
H.	Any appeals regarding an FMLA decision should be directed to the department head or designee. FMLA is a Federal law and administered and enforced by the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division. The State's CFRA is a State law which is administered and enforced by the Department of Fair Employment and Housing. FMLA/CFRA does not supersede any Article of this Contract which provides greater family and medical leave rights. This section is not subject to grievance or arbitration.
8.17	Mentoring Leave
A.	Eligible employees may receive up to forty (40) hours of "mentoring leave" per calendar year to participate in mentoring activities once they have used an equal amount of their personal time for these activities. "Mentoring leave" is paid leave time which may only be used by an employee to mentor. This leave does not count as time worked for purposes of overtime. "Mentoring leave" may not be used for travel to and from the mentoring location.
46
BU 1
03-05
B.	An employee must use an equal number of hours of his or her personal time (approved annual leave, vacation, personal leave, personal holiday, or CTO during the workday and/or personal time during non-working hours) prior to requesting "mentoring leave”. For example, if an employee requests two (2) hours of "mentoring leave”, he or she must have used two (2) verified hours of his or her personal time prior to receiving approval for the "mentoring leave". "Mentoring leave" does not have to be requested in the same week or month as the personal time was used. It does, however, have to be requested and used before the end of the calendar year.
C.	Prior to requesting mentoring leave and in accordance with departmental policy, an employee shall provide his or her supervisor with verification of personal time spent mentoring from the mentoring organization.
D.	Requests for approval of vacation, CTO, and/or annual leave for mentoring activities are subject to approval requirements in this Contract and in existing departmental policies. Requests for approval of mentoring leave are subject to operational needs of the State, budgetary limits, and any limitations imposed by law.
E.	In order to be eligible for "mentoring leave", an employee must:
1.	Have a permanent appointment;
2.	Have successfully completed their initial probationary period; and
3.	Have committed to mentor a child or youth through a mentoring organization that meets the quality assurance standards in accordance with the California Mentor Program Directory, under the guidance of the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, for a minimum of one school year. (Most programs are aligned with the child's normal school year, however, there may be some that are less or more. Department management may make exceptions to the one school year commitment based on the mentor program that is selected.)
F.	An employee is not eligible to receive “mentoring leave” if:
1.	He or she is assigned to a “post” position in the Departments of Corrections or Youth Authority; or
2.	He or she works in a level of care position in the Departments of Developmental Services, Mental Health, Education or Veterans’ Affairs.
G.	Permanent part-time and Permanent Intermittent employees may receive a pro-rated amount of mentoring leave based upon their time base. For example, a half time employee is eligible for twenty (20) hours of mentoring leave per calendar year, whereas an intermittent employee must work a qualifying monthly pay period (equivalent to 160 hours) to earn 3.3 hours of mentoring leave.
H.	Any appeals and/or disputes regarding this section shall be handled in accordance with the Complaint procedure specified in Article 6 of this Contract.

8.18	Work and Family Participation
A.	Family Activity
Subject to operational needs and reasonable notice to the employer, employees shall be permitted to use accrued leave credits (vacation, annual leave, personal holiday, holiday credits, CTO) for the purpose of attending school or non-school family-related activities such as sports events, recitals, 4-H, etc., in which the employee’s child is participating.
However, use of such leave shall not diminish an employee’s entitlement under the Family School Partnership Act (Labor Code Section 230.8) to, upon reasonable notice to the employer, use up to eight (8) hours per month but not to exceed forty (40) hours per calendar year of accrued leave credits (vacation, annual leave, personal holiday, holiday credits, CTO) for the purpose of attending school or preschool related activities in which the employee’s child is participating.
Family is defined as the employee’s son, daughter, or any child the employee stands in loco parentis (to the child).
Employee leave requests for family activities shall be in accordance with the appropriate departmental procedures.
B.	Family Crisis
Subject to operational needs, and upon reasonable notice to the employee’s immediate supervisor, employees shall be eligible to use accumulated leave credits for the purpose of dealing with family crisis situations (e.g., divorce counseling, family or parenting conflict management, family care urgent matters and/or emergencies). If the employee has exhausted available leave credits, the employee may request unpaid leave.
Family is defined as the parent, stepparent, spouse, domestic partner (as defined in accordance with Family Code Section 297), child, grandchild, grandparent, brother, sister, stepchild, or any person residing in the immediate household.
If eligible, any family crisis leave that meets the definition of serious health condition will run concurrently with Section 8.16 of this Contract, Family and Medical Leave Act.
The State shall consider requests from employees to adjust work hours or schedules or consider other flexible arrangements consistent with a department’s operational needs and the provisions of this Contract.
Employee requests related to family crisis or domestic violence shall be in accordance with departmental procedures and, except in emergencies, shall be made with reasonable notice to the employee’s immediate supervisor.

Part-time and hourly employees shall accrue proportional annual leave credits, in accordance with the applicable DPA rules. Employees shall have the continued use of any sick leave accrued as of the effective date of the Agreement, in accordance with applicable laws, rules, or memorandum of understanding. All provisions necessary for the administration of this Section shall be provided by DPA rule or memorandum of understanding.
D.	Employees, who elect, upon transfer into Bargaining Unit 1, the vacation and sick leave programs will have their accrued Annual Leave converted to vacation and sick leave as follows:
An employee switching to the sick leave and vacation programs may designate an amount of accrued annual leave to be assigned to vacation time. The accumulated vacation leave shall not exceed 400 hours. All other accrued hours from the Annual Leave Program will be converted to sick leave.
E.	A full-time employee who has eleven (11) or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall earn annual leave credits as set forth in DPA Rules 599.608 and 599.609. Absences from State service resulting from a temporary or permanent separation for more than eleven (11) consecutive days which fail into two (2) consecutive qualifying pay periods shall disqualify the second pay period.
F.	Employees who work in multiple positions may participate in annual leave, provided an election is made while employed in an eligible position subject to these provisions. Annual leave accrual for employees in multiple positions will be computed by combing all positions, as in vacation leave, provided the result does not exceed he amount earnable in full-time employment, and the rate of accrual shall be
49
BU 1
03-05
determined by the schedule which applies to the position or collective bargaining status under which the election was made.
G.	If an employee does not use all of the annual leave that the employee has accrued in a calendar year, the employee may carry over his/her accrued annual leave credits to the following calendar year to a maximum of six hundred forty (640) hours. A department head or designee may permit an employee to carry over more than six hundred forty (640) hours accrued hours because the employee: (1) was required to work as a result of fire, flood, or other extensive emergency; (2) was assigned work of a priority or critical nature over an extended period of time; (3) was absent on full salary for compensable injury; (4) was prevented by department regulations from taking annual leave until December 31 because of sick leave; or (5) was on jury duty.
H.	Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for accrued annual leave credits for all accrued annual leave time.
I.	The time when annual leave shall be taken by the employee shall be determined by the department head or designee. If on January 1 of each year an employee’s annual leave bank exceeds the cap in Subsection F., the department may order the employee to take annual leave.

B.	Salary ranges and rates shall be changed to reflect the July 1, 2003 general salary increase; however, each full-time employee shall continue to work his/her assigned work schedule and shall have a reduction in pay equal to 5%. In exchange 8 hours of leave will be credited to the employee's Personal Leave Program monthly.
C.	Personal leave shall be requested and used by the employee in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Requests to use personal leave must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on vacation and annual leave. Personal leave shall not be included in the calculation of vacation/annual leave balances pursuant to Article 8 (Leaves) and Sections 8.1 (Vacation Leave) and 8.19, (Annual Leave).
D.	At the discretion of the State, all or a portion of unused personal leave credits may be cashed out at the employee's salary rate at the time the personal leave payment is made. It is understood by both parties that the application of this cash out provision may differ from department to department and from employee to employee. Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for unused personal leave credits in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Cash out or lump sum payment for any Personal Leave credits shall not be considered as "compensation" for purposes of retirement. If funds become available, as determined by the Department of Finance, for the Personal Leave Program, departments will offer employees the opportunity to cash out accrued personal leave. Upon retirement/separation, the cash value of the employee’s personal leave balance may be transferred into a State of California, Department of Personnel Administration Deferred Compensation Program as permitted by federal and state law.
E.	An employee may not use any kind of paid leave such as sick leave, vacation, or holiday time to avoid a reduction in pay resulting from the Personal Leave Program.

8.23.1	EDD Vacation Leave Policy (Units 1 and 4)
Subject to operational needs, the time when vacation shall be taken by the employee shall not be unreasonably denied. Employee vacation requests shall be submitted and granted or denied in writing in a timely manner. Vacations can only be canceled when unanticipated operational needs require it.
An employee shall be granted annual vacation leave request(s) up to their annual accrual rate. All vacation leave taken during the calendar year shall be counted towards the amount of leave described in the previous sentence. Employees must have sufficient leave earned and available to cover the time requested, prior to beginning their vacation.
When two (2) or more employees on the same shift (if applicable) in a work unit (as defined by EDD) request the same vacation time and approval cannot be given to all employees requesting it, employees shall be granted their preferred vacation period in order of seniority (defined as total months of State service in the same manner as vacation is accumulated). When two (2) or more employees have the same amount of State service, department seniority will be used to break the tie. After review of State service and departmental seniority a tie will be broken by lot. Vacation schedules, which have been established in a work unit, pursuant to the seniority provisions, shall not be affected by employee(s) entering the unit after the schedule has been established.
There are two periods during which vacation leave requests may be submitted:
1.	A defined filing period.
2.	Outside a defined filing period.
52
BU 1
03-05
Defined Filing Period
Bargaining Unit 1 and 4 employees shall be offered the opportunity to submit vacation requests during a defined filing period which shall be the mid-month of each quarter of the year. Quarters are defined as January through March, April through June, July through September, and October through December. Requests may apply to leave to be taken during any of the four (4) quarters following the quarter in which a request is filed.
Employees may submit their vacation leave requests during the first ten working days of the mid-month of each quarter.
EDD management will, within fifteen working days after close of the filing period, post vacation leave approvals by work unit with an attached waiting list (if any) based on seniority. This information will be posted in a location accessible to employees. The waiting list shall be used to grant further vacation leave as operational needs permit.
When an employee who was granted vacation leave cancels that leave, or will not have sufficient leave credits to cover the leave, the first person on the waiting list, if any, shall be awarded that vacation leave time.
Once an employee’s vacation request submitted during a filing period is approved, the employee cannot be bumped by a more senior employee submitting a request outside a filing period or making a request during a later filing period.
Outside a Defined Filing Period
An employee may request vacation at any time outside a defined filing period to cover unplanned or unanticipated needs for vacation leave. Such leave requests will be limited to leave to be taken prior to the end of the next quarter.
When an employee requests vacation leave outside a defined filing period, the employee’s vacation leave request shall be granted on a first come, first served basis.
EDD management will notify an employee requesting vacation leave outside a defined filing period in a timely manner.
When two (2) or more employees request vacation for the same period on the same day, ties will be broken based upon seniority as defined above.
Vacation In Lieu of Sick Leave & Other Sections of the Personnel Management Handbook will be updated to reflect negotiated changes in the new Contracts.
Expedited Grievance Procedure
EDD agrees to the following expedited grievance procedure for alleged violations of Article 8 - Leaves, Section 8.1(G) Vacation Leave. This procedure applies to Unemployment Insurance Call Centers, Tax Branch Call Centers, Adjudication Centers, and Disability Insurance Offices.

Such injury must have been directly and specifically caused by an assault by a resident, patient, student, client, or member.
C.	The EIDL benefits will be equivalent to the injured employee’s net take home salary on the date of occurrence of the injury.

In the event that the disability exceeds twenty-two (22) workdays, the employee will receive 66 and 2/3 percent of gross pay from the twenty-third (23rd) workday of disability until the end of the fifty-second (52nd) week of disability. No IDL or payments shall be allowed after two (2) years from the first day (i.e., date) of disability.
C.	The employee may elect to supplement payment from the twenty-third (23rd) workday with accrued leave credits including annual leave, vacation, sick leave, or compensating time off (CTO) in the amount necessary to approximate the employee's full net pay. Partial supplementation will be allowed, but fractions of less than one (1) hour will not be permitted.

F.	In the event that an employee is determined to be "permanent and stationary" by his/her physician before the IDL benefit is exhausted, but is unable to return to work, he/she must agree to participate in a vocational rehabilitation program. Refusing to participate will result in immediate suspension of the IDL benefit.
G.	All appeals of an employee's denial of IDL benefits shall only follow the procedures in the Government Code and Title 2.

D.	The employee shall serve a seven (7) consecutive calendar day waiting period before ENDI payments commence for each disability. Accrued paid leave or CTO leave balances may be used to cover this waiting period. The waiting period may be waived commencing with the first full day of confinement in a hospital, nursing home, or emergency clinic for at least one full day. A full day is defined as a 24-hour period starting at midnight.

11.2	Salary Definitions
Units 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 hereby agree to support putting the following changes to Article 5 of the Department of Personnel Administration regulations into effect provided all bargaining units agree to the same.
As used in this Article, terms are defined as follows:
A.	“Salary range” is the range of rates between, and including, the minimum and maximum rate currently authorized for the class; Top Step Rounding: Classes shall be adjusted to reflect 5 percent increments between the minimum and the maximum salary rates.

To calculate 5 percent for daily and hourly rates multiply by 1.05 and round to the nearest dollar and cents amount, subject to the availability of funds.
B.	“Step” for employees compensated on a monthly basis is a five percent (5%) differential above or below a salary rate rounded to the nearest dollar and for employees compensated on a daily or hourly basis is a five percent (5%) differential above or below a rate rounded to the nearest dollar and cents amount. One-step higher is calculated by multiplying the rate by 1.05 (e.g., $2,300 x 1.05 = $2,415). One-step lower is calculated by dividing the rate by 1.05 (e.g., $2,415 + 1.05 = $2,300).
C.	“Rate” for employees compensated on a monthly basis is any one of the full dollar amounts found within the salary range and for employees compensated on a daily or hourly basis is any one of the dollar and cents amounts found within the salary range.
D.	“Range differential” is the difference between the maximum rate of two salary ranges.
73
BU 1
03-05
E.	“Substantially the same salary range” is a salary range with the maximum salary rate less than two-steps higher than or the same as the maximum salary rate of another salary range.

G.	“Lower salary range” is a salary range with the maximum salary rate any amount less than the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
Unless otherwise provided, the lowest salary range currently authorized for the class is used to make salary comparisons between classes except for deep classes. Any rate falling within the salary range for a class may be used to accomplish appropriate step differentials in movement between classes and salary ranges.

11.16.1	Arduous Duty Differential for FLSA Exempt Employees (Unit 1)
The State shall establish an “arduous pay” program to provide additional compensation to FLSA exempt employees assigned to WWGs E and SE when there is no other way to recognize the performance of additional duties and responsibilities which clearly exceed the normal demands of an employee’s classification/position. Employees shall be eligible for this pay differential for up to four months per fiscal year (or per event for emergencies involving loss of life or property).
Requests for arduous pay shall be made to the DPA on a case-by-case basis by the employing department. The DPA shall evaluate said requests based on whether it satisfies all of the following:
1.	Nonnegotiable Deadline or Extreme Urgency
The work must have a deadline or completion date that cannot be controlled by the employee or his/her supervisor, or must constitute an extreme urgency. The deadline or extreme urgency must impose upon the employee an immediate and urgent demand for his/her work that cannot be avoided or mitigated by planning, rescheduling, postponement or rearrangement of work, or modification of the deadline.
2.	Work Exceeds Normal Work Hours and Normal Productivity
The work must be extraordinarily demanding and time consuming, and of a nature that it significantly exceeds the normal workweek and work productivity expectations of the employee’s work assignment.
Employees who are excluded from FLSA are expected to work variable work schedules as necessary to meet the demands of the job. This pay differential is not intended for employees who regularly or occasionally work in excess of the normal workweek to meet normal workload demands. It is intended where in addition to working a significant number of hours in excess of the normal workweek, there is a demand for and achievement of greater productivity or result.
3.	Work is Unavoidable
The work must be of a nature that it cannot be postponed, redistributed, modified, reassigned or otherwise changed in any way to provide relief.
4.	Work Involves Extremely Heavy Workload
The work is of a nature that it cannot be organized or planned to enable time off in exchange for the extra hours worked. The absence from work would cause difficulty or hardship on others and would result in other critical work not being completed. Occasional heavy workload of less than 12 to 14 days in duration would not normally satisfy this requirement because time off can be arranged as compensation for this demand.
81
BU 1
03-05
5.	No Other Compensation
The employee who is receiving this pay differential is not eligible for any other additional compensation for the type and nature of the above described work.
DPA decisions to deny arduous pay shall not be subject to the grievance or arbitration provisions of this Contract.
The differentials shall be $300 per workweek, up to $1200 total per pay period. Any workweek that overlaps months should be counted in the month that the workweek ends. An employee may be paid: $300, $600, $900 or $1200 per pay period.

11.18.1 California State Lottery Sales Incentive Bonus (Unit 1)
The California State Lottery (CSL) reserves the right to manage the variety and quantity of Scratcher products offered for sale in order to stay within its budgetary and legal mandates.
Additionally, the CSL reserves the right to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of new gaming methods, techniques, equipment and software, as well as new gaming products and sales aids, through tests or pilot programs. The time duration for the tests and/or pilot programs may vary. Pilots/tests shall be implemented at the beginning of a quarter unless a budgetary or legal reason exists in which case the pilot/test may be implemented mid-quarter.

Employees appointed to the CSL classifications of District Sales Representative (DSR) and Key Accounts Specialist (KAS) are eligible to receive a sales bonus based on achievement of sales in the following three product lines: Scratcher products; On-Line products; and a Target Game which shall be designated by the Director or designee.
The following provisions shall govern the program:
A.	Prior to the beginning of each new quarter, the CSL Director or designee shall announce a statewide sales goal for each of the three product lines identified above. Individual achievement of quarterly sales goals for each territory or account list is measured against the established quarterly CSL statewide sales goal for each of the three product lines. The sales bonus for eligible employees is based on sales achievement in each of the three product lines. Scratcher product sales are defined as only those ticket packs that have been financially settled by retailers.
B.	The CSL Sales Division shall issue a quarterly report showing the percentage contribution (market share) of the employee’s sales area to actual statewide sales.
The “market share” of each sales area is the percentage contribution of the territory or account list to actual statewide sales during quarter ending one quarter prior to the goal quarter, also identified as the “quarter before last”.
Example: The goal for quarter 1 of FY 1999/00 is based on the market share from quarter 3 of FY 1998/99.
C.	Each product line is allocated a percentage of the total award dollar with each level as follows: Scratchers product 70 percent; Target Game product 20 percent; and On-Line product 10 percent. Upon completion of each quarter and a qualifying period, if a territory or account list achieves at least a Level 1 sales goal in any product line, the employee receives the appropriate percentage of the total award attributable to that product for the level achieved. With a qualifying period, the employee is eligible to attain an award for each of the three product lines.
D.	“Target Game” is that game identified and designated by the Director (CSL) or designee to receive special promotional emphasis. Target Game sales shall be excluded from the goal and achievement of other product lines.
If a Target Game is not designated, the Director or designee shall redirect the Target Game percentage to the other remaining product lines.
E.	If the CSL deems it necessary to adjust one or more of the bonus level percentages, it shall notify the Union and meet and confer, upon request, concerning the impact of the proposed adjustment.
F.	Bonus levels and corresponding dollar awards attributable to each level are listed below:
84
BU 1

(20%) Target Game	$320	$420	$570	$790
(10%) On-Line Product	$160	$210	$285	$395
G.	Each eligible employee described in Subsections G (2) through G (8) shall be required to work a qualifying period to be eligible for bonus.
1.	A qualifying period is defined as actually working in a territory or actually working an assigned account list a minimum of sixty-five percent (65%) of actual available work days in a thirteen-week (13) quarter excluding holidays and weekends.
Formula: 13 weeks (91 days) less weekends (26 days) times 8 hours a day less holiday hours times 65% equals a qualifying period.
Example: A qualifying period in a quarter with no holidays equals 65 days; a qualifying period in a quarter with one holiday equals 64 days.
2.	A full-time employee who works a qualifying period and who works in an assigned territory or an assigned account list during the quarter is eligible for the appropriate level bonus achieved by that territory/account list during that quarter.
3.	An intermittent employee who works a qualifying period and who works in a single territory during the quarter is eligible for the appropriate level bonus achieved by that territory/account list during that quarter.
4.	An intermittent employee who works a qualifying period and who works in more than one territory in a single district during the quarter is eligible for the appropriate level bonus achieved by that district during that quarter.
85
BU 1
03-05
5.	An intermittent employee who works a qualifying period and who works in more than one territory and in more than one district in either the North or South region during the quarter is eligible for the appropriate level bonus achieved by that region during that quarter.
6.	An intermittent employee who works a qualifying period and who works in more than one territory in both the North and South regions during the quarter is eligible for the appropriate level bonus achieved by the State during that quarter.
7.	A permanent part-time employee who works a qualifying period and achieves a sales bonus level in a product line during the quarter is eligible to receive a percentage of the bonus dollar amount for that level consistent with the time base. The qualifying period as defined in Subsection H(1) is prorated to the time base.
8.	An employee appointed to a limited-term or retired annuitant position of DSR or KAS shall be eligible to participate in this program consistent with the criteria established for full-time or intermittent employees.
H.	Bonus payments shall be made within sixty (60) days after the quarter ends.
I.	Bonus awards paid pursuant to this Section are excluded from compensation for retirement purposes.
J.	Bonus awards paid pursuant to this Section are considered compensation for taxation purposes.
K.	This Section shall be grievable only to Step 2 of the grievance procedure (Director, California State Lottery).
11.19.1 California State Lottery Business Building Incentive (BBI) Program (Unit 1)
This provision is effective following ratification by both parties.
A.	The objective of the Business Building Incentive (BBI) program shall be to add new and viable Lottery retailer locations. A new retailer location is one that has never sold Lottery products or has contracted to sell “Scratcher-Only” products.
B.	The Lottery Director or designee shall identify a “product game” that shall be the focus of the BBI. The Lottery Director or designee shall also determine the specific criteria for the product game.
C.	The classifications of District Sales Representative (DSR) and Key Account Specialist (KAS) shall be eligible for the incentive award.
D.	For each new qualifying retailer location, the employee shall receive an incentive award of $250.
E.	The CSL will provide weekly BBI product sales advisory information on a bi-weekly basis to allow tracking of retailer activation and sales activity. An official BBI product sales report will be issued by the CSL following the end of each retailer’s qualifying period.
86
BU 1
03-05
F.	The employee shall submit a claim for the recruitment incentive award within thirty (30) days following the issue date of the sales report referenced in Subsection E. Awards shall be paid, upon verification by the CSL, no later than sixty (60) calendar days after the completed claim is submitted by the employee.
G.	Program criteria: In addition to specific criteria for the BBI product game determined by the CSL Director or designee the following program criteria shall be met:
1.	A new retailer shall be one that has never sold Lottery products or has contracted to sell “Scratcher-Only” products.
2.	A qualifying retailer shall be located within the employee’s regularly assigned territory or on the employee’s regularly assigned account list at the date of activation.
3.	In the event that more than one employee, DSR/KAS, has direct participation in the recruitment of a qualifying retailer, the incentive award shall be divided equally between the recruiters. Direct participation shall be substantiated by the Lottery Sales Manager or Key Accounts Chief, as appropriate. The Key Accounts Chief shall determine, if necessary, the beginning and ending periods for targeted account recruiting.
4.	If the retailer location is re-assigned during a qualifying period from one DSR’s regularly assigned territory to another DSR’s regularly assigned territory or from one KAS’s regularly assigned account list to another KAS’s regularly assigned account list, or if the employee does not have a regularly assigned territory/account list, the award will be made in favor of the recruiting employee (DSR/KAS).
5.	Upon written request from an employee, an exception to specific product game criteria may be granted by the CSL Director or designee prior to retailer activation.
H.	Terminal Malfunction: Upon notification from the employee and verification by management that the on-line terminal of the qualifying retailer became inactive due to technical malfunction of the phone line or “the G-Tech” line after the initial activation date and during the qualifying period, said qualifying period will be extended by the number of inactive days. Extensions shall be approved by the CSL Director or designee.
I.	Game Termination: A BBI product game may be modified or discontinued by the CSL Director or designee due to technical, financial, or legal reasons. If the BBI product game is discontinued, the CSL is not obligated to provide a replacement game. If a retail location meets the criteria established for the game prior to its discontinuance, the recruiting employee shall have qualified for the incentive award. If an employee recruits a new retailer and the CSL subsequently discontinues the BBI product game due to financial, technical, or legal reasons before the new retailer has on-line Status Code 1 or 2, and the CSL introduces a replacement target game within 120 days after the discontinued game, the tracking period shall begin with the effective date of the replacement game. The Union shall be given notice and an opportunity, upon request, to meet and discuss the impact of this action.

11.20.1	California Housing Loan Insurance Fund (CHLIF) Mortgage Insurance Profit Bonus (Unit 1)
Eligible employees in these assignments will be entitled to a bonus not to exceed 10 percent of their base salary based on the performance of the loans insured by California Housing Loan Insurance Fund (CHLIF) in the employee’s assigned territory annually. The bonus will be based on maintaining a delinquency rate of less than 1 percent.
The delinquency rate is derived by dividing the number of CHLIF insured loans in the eligible employee’s assignment that are delinquent for a period of 90 days or more by the total number of CHLIF insured loans in the employee’s assigned territory.
If the delinquency rate for the year is not more than 0.5 percent, the eligible employee will be entitled to the maximum bonus of 10 percent of base salary. If the delinquency rate is more than 0.5 percent but less than 1 percent, the employee will be entitled to a proportional bonus based on the difference between 1% and the actual delinquency rate, as a percentage of 5 percent. For example, if the delinquency rate at the end of the year is 0.62 percent, the bonus percentage would be 76 percent of the maximum bonus payable, or 7.6 percent of base salary. It may be simpler to express this decimally, e.g., delinquency rate of 0.0062 subtracted from 0.01 equals 0.0038 divided by 0.05 equals 0.076 to be applied to the base salary.
The following chart is illustrative of the delinquency and claims bonus structure based on five even delinquency rates. In actuality, the bonuses will be based on the delinquency rate calculated to the nearest hundredth of one percent (0.0001), which translates to two-tenths of one percent (0.002) of annual salary per the formula.
DELINQUENCY	BONUS
0.50%	10% of base salary
0.60%	8% of base salary
0.70%	6% of base salary
0.80%	4% of base salary
0.90%	2% of base salary
1.00%	0% of base salary 88	BU 1 03-05
Criteria and Calculations for Customer Services, Product Development, Technical Services, and Underwriting Manager:
Employees performing these functions will be eligible to receive a bonus not to exceed 10 percent of their base salary based on the return on equity percentage which exceeds 9 percent, as a percentage of 5 percent. The return on equity is based on the GAAP profit on the average fund equity for the 12 calendar months. For example, if the return on equity at the end of the year is 11 percent, the bonus would be 40 percent of the maximum bonus payable, or 4 percent of salary (i.e., 11% minus 9% = 2%; 2% divided by 5% = 40% of the maximum bonus, or 0.04 of salary).
The following chart is illustrative of the bonus structure for these employees. In actuality, the bonuses will be calculated to the nearest tenth of one percent (0.001) of salary.
PROFIT %	BONUS %
14.00%	10% of base salary
13.00%	8% of base salary
12.00%	6% of base salary
11.00%	4% of base salary
10.00%	2% of base salary
9.00%	0% of base salary
Bonuses for eligible employees in all categories will be based on the 12 months from January through December and will be paid once per year as soon after December 31 as practicable. Bonuses will be prorated for employees not working a full year in an eligible assignment.

89
BU 1
03-05
B.	When the annual payment is authorized, employees must complete twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods in order to receive the annual payment. No payment, nor pro-rata share of the payment, shall be given if the employee separates or is discharged from State service, is rejected on probation, or voluntarily transfers to another location where the differential is not authorized. Time spent on NDI does not count as a qualifying pay period.
If an employee who is receiving a monthly differential transfers to a location where the differential is not authorized, the differential shall be discontinued.
C.	Part-time and intermittent employees shall receive a pro rata share of the annual recruitment and retention differential based on the total number of hours worked, excluding overtime, during the twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods. Parttime and intermittent employees shall receive a pro rata share of the monthly differential based on a total number of hours worked within the monthly pay period.
D.	Annual recruitment and retention payments shall not be considered as compensation for purposes of retirement contributions.
E.	It is understood by the Union that the decision to implement or not implement annual recruitment and retention payments or monthly differentials or to withdraw authorization for such payments or differentials, and the amount of such payments or differentials, rests solely with the State and that such decision is not grievable or arbitrable.

The first installment shall be paid 12 qualifying pay periods after the employee’s request and the employer’s verification.
2.	In order to be eligible for the bonus, the employee’s classification must include internal auditing or fiscal examination as a major duty and for which the minimum qualification requires professional accounting or auditing experience or successful completion of prescribed professional accounting courses given by an accredited college or university, including courses in elementary and advanced accounting, auditing, and cost accounting.
3.	The employee must have passed the examination after November 30, 1986. No employee who has requested and received the previous form of professional competency pay shall be eligible for this bonus.
C.	An employee who transfers to another State department and otherwise continues to qualify for the bonus must request the new department to continue the bonus on schedule. The new department may or may not agree to recommend the continuation of the bonus to DPA. In any case the bonus shall not exceed $3,600.

An employee may not claim lodging, meal, or incidental expenses within 50 miles of his/her home or headquarters.
C.	Long-term Travel: Actual expenses for long term meals and receipted lodging will be reimbursed when the employee incurs expenses in one location comparable to those arising from the use of establishments catering to the long-term visitor.

F.	Any performance evaluation conducted of an employee who is a participant in the Union/State Collective Bargaining negotiations shall recognize the employee's frequent absence from his/her State job and the impact of such absences on the employee's performance. This is not intended to abrogate the right of the State to take disciplinary action against any employee who happens to be involved in such representational activities.
G.	Material relating to an employee's performance included in the employee's departmental personnel file shall be retained for a period of time specified by each department, except that at the request of the employee, materials of a negative nature may either be purged after one year or at the time such material is used in a written performance evaluation. This provision, however, does not apply to formal adverse actions except as defined in applicable Government Code Sections. By mutual agreement between a department head or designee and an employee, adverse action material may be removed. When an employee receives written documentation of a negative nature, the supervisor shall note in writing on the documentation the time frame it will remain in the file.
H.	Supervisors may keep working supervisory files on the performance and conduct of employees to provide documentation for matters such as, but not limited to, probation reports, performance appraisals, training needs, MSA reviews, bonus programs, adverse actions, employee development appraisals, or examination evaluations. An employee and/or his/her authorized representative may, upon request, review the contents of his/her file with his/her supervisor.

Duties that are appropriately assigned to incumbents in the employee's current classification are not out of class. Duties appropriately assigned are based on the definition and typical tasks enumerated in the California State Personnel Board specification.
Training and Development assignments are not out-of-class work.

a.	Is of unusual urgency, nature, volume, location, duration, or other special characteristics; and,
b.	Cannot feasibly be met through use of other civil service or administrative alternatives.
2.	Departments may not use out-of-class assignments to avoid giving civil service examinations or to avoid using existing eligibility lists created as the result of a civil service examination.
3.	When an employee is assigned out-of-class work, he/she shall receive the rate of pay he/she would have received pursuant to Title 2 California Code of Regulations Sections 599.673, 599.674, or 599.676 if appointed to the higher classification.
4.	Out-of-class work may be discontinued by departments at any time; however, departments may not rotate employees in and out of out-of-class assignments to avoid payment of out-of-class compensation.

b.	Twenty-one (21) calendar days after the date the employee’s duties allegedly changed such that he/she stopped working out of classification or his/her position became misallocated.
However, under no circumstances may the period in which to bring the grievance be extended beyond the twenty-one (21) calendar days in Item B. above.

Upon request, within thirty (30) calendar days of the Union’s receipt of the notice, the State shall meet and confer with the Union over such assignments.
14.8	Contracting Out
A.	Purpose
The union has presented evidence that State departments are presently contracting out work appropriately done by Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees, and that said contracting results in unnecessary additional costs to the State. Thus, the purpose of this section is to guarantee that the State does not incur unnecessary, additional costs by contracting out work appropriately performed at less expense to the State by Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees, consistent with the terms of this section. In achieving this purpose the parties do not intend this section to expand the State’s ability to contract out for personal services. The parties agree that this section shall not be interpreted or applied in a manner which results in a disruption of services provided by state departments.
121
BU 1
03-05
B.	Policy Regarding Personal Services Contracts and Cost Savings
Except in extremely unusual or urgent, time-limited circumstances, or under other circumstances where contracting out is recognized or required by law, Federal mandate, or court decisions/orders, the State must make every effort to hire, utilize and retain Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees before resorting to the use of private contractors. Contracting may also occur for reasons other than cost savings as recognized or required by law, Federal mandate, or court decisions/orders.
C.	Information Regarding Contracts To Be Let
1.	Departments will provide CSEA’s designated representative with copies of Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and Invitations for Bid (IFBs) for personal services contracts when released for publication if they call for services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications.
2.	To the extent that a department is preparing to enter into a contract (or amend a contract) and it does not require an RFP or IFB, the department shall provide CSEA’s designated representative with a copy of the Standard Form 215 (or its departmental equivalent) if and when the Form 215 is completed but no less than five (5) business days thereafter provided the contract is/will be for services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications. If the Form 215 contains confidential or proprietary information, it shall be redacted as discussed below in subsection D(2).
3.	The purpose of this subsection (C) is to provide CSEA with notice and an opportunity to present alternatives which mitigate or avoid the need for contracting out, while still satisfying the needs of the State to provide services. Directors (or their designee) shall therefore meet with CSEA for this purpose, if requested by CSEA.
D.	Labor/Management Committee To Review Personal Service Contracts In Existence
1.	A State Joint labor/management committee shall be established. It shall consist of representatives of CSEA, the Department of Personnel Administration, the Department of Finance and affected departments. The first meeting of this committee shall occur no later than 10 working days from ratification of the MOU, and shall be for purposes of determining the procedures by which the committee will operate. An initial review of all currently existing contracts as requested by the committee shall be completed within six (6) months from ratification of this agreement. However, if this deadline cannot be met due to the number or complexity of existing contracts for review, the committee may mutually agree to extend this deadline.
122
BU 1
03-05
2.	Upon request of the committee (or either party on the committee) each department shall submit copies of any or all personal services contracts that call for services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications. For each contract, departments shall provide additional documents establishing the number, scope, duration, justification, total costs of all such contracts, and payment of all overhead and administrative costs paid through each contract, provided it does not disclose confidential or proprietary information, in which case it shall be redacted as discussed below. The requested contract and related information shall be provided as soon as reasonably possible. The parties expect that this shall be provided no more than 21 calendar days following the request by the joint labor/management committee, or longer if approved by the committee. This shall include contracts that may otherwise be protected from public disclosure, if they provide for services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications. However, the State may redact those portions of protected contract(s) that are proprietary, necessary to protect the competitive nature of the bid process, and that which does not pertain to the costing of personnel services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 classes. The goal shall be to protect against disclosure of information which should remain confidential, while at the same time providing the committee with sufficient information to determine whether unnecessary, additional costs are being incurred by contracting out work found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 class specifications. Costing information provided to the committee for protected contracts shall include total personnel costs for personnel services found in Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 classifications plus any overhead charges paid to the contractor for these services, provided such disclosure does not breach confidentiality requirements or include proprietary information.
3.	Within 10 workdays after receipt of the personal service contracts and associated documents as provided for in paragraph D (2) above, the committee shall begin reviewing the contracts. The committee shall examine the contracts based on the purpose of this section, the terms of the contracts, all applicable laws, Federal mandates and court decisions/orders. In this regard, the committee will consider which contracts should and can be terminated immediately, which contracts will take additional time to terminate, which contracts may continue (for how long and under what conditions) and how (if necessary and cost effective) to transition contract employees or positions into civil service. All determinations shall be through express mutual agreement of the committee. Committee determinations regarding contracts let by the Department of Corrections shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in subsection F below.
4.	The committee will continue to meet as necessary to examine personal services contracts which have been let.
5.	If savings are generated by the termination of personal service contracts under this provision, it is the intent of the State to implement findings of the committee for utilization of said savings. Such findings may include:
a.	Contributing toward position reductions which would otherwise be accomplished by the layoff, salary reduction or displacement of Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees.
123
BU 1

b.	Enabling the employment of Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees for services currently performed by contractors;
c.	Enabling of the conversion to Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 civil service employment of qualified contract employees who wish to become State employees, as otherwise permitted by law, regulations, provisions of the contracts and resolutions by the State Personnel Board.
d.	Providing timely, adequate and necessary recruitment efforts. These efforts may include focused recruitment, publicizing in professional journals, use of the media, job fairs, expedited hiring, expedited background checks, spot testing authorized by the SPB, State employee registries, and recruitment and retention incentives.
e.	Such other purposes as may be mutually agreed upon by the joint labor/management committee.
E.	Displacement Avoidance
1.	The objective of this subsection is to ensure that Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employees have preference over contract employees consistent with, but not limited to the following principles.
a.	The duties at issue are consistent with the Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee’s classification;
b.	The Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee is qualified to perform the job; and, c. There is no disruption in services.
2.	To avoid or mitigate Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee displacement for lack of work, the appointing power shall review all existing personal services contracts to determine if work consistent with the affected employee’s classification is being performed by a contractor. Displacement includes layoff, involuntary demotion, involuntary transfer to a new class, involuntary transfer to a new location requiring a change of residence, and time base reductions. If the joint labor/management committee that reviews personal services contracts determines that the terms and purpose of the contract permit the State to assign the work to a Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee who would otherwise be displaced, this shall be implemented consistent with the other terms of this section. The State and CSEA shall meet and confer for purposes of entering into an agreement about the means by which qualified employees are notified and provided with such assignments. This shall include developing a process that ensures that savings realized by terminating the contract and reassigning the work to a Unit 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20 employee to avoid displacement, are utilized to offset that employee’s moving and relocation costs, the amount of which shall be consistent with Section 12.2 Moving/Relocation of the parties’ collective bargaining agreement.

ARTICLE 15	- TRANSFER
15.1	Appeal of Involuntary Transfer
A.	The State shall make reasonable efforts to avoid involuntary transfers. An involuntary transfer which reasonably requires an employee to change his/her residence may be grieved under Article 6 only if the employee believes it was made for the purpose of harassing or disciplining the employee. If the appointing authority or the Department of Personnel Administration disapproves the transfer, the employee shall be returned to his or her former position; shall be paid the regular travel allowance for the period of time he/she was away from his/her original headquarters; and his/her moving costs both from and back to the original headquarters shall be paid in accordance with the Department of Personnel Administration laws and rules.

B.	An appeal of an involuntary transfer which does not reasonably require an employee to change his/her residence shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure. It shall be subject to the complaint procedure if the employee believes it was made for the purpose of harassing or disciplining the employee.
C.	The State shall provide a minimum of sixty (60) days written notice for an involuntary transfer which reasonably requires an employee to change his/her residence.
D.	Employees, who are unwilling to accept the geographical transfer required by their current department, may pursue other options, such as but not limited to voluntary transfer, voluntary demotion, reduced work-time program, authorized partial service retirement, or voluntary retirement or resignation. Such employees who meet the Department of Personnel Administration, State Restriction of Appointments (SROA) definition, shall be considered surplus. The department head or designee shall make job opportunity bulletins and materials available to all eligible surplus employees. Eligible surplus employees shall be permitted to apply and compete for vacant positions of their current class or other classes to which he/she can transfer, pursuant to the SROA Process. Article 16 shall govern employee rights and appeals under these conditions.
E.	With prior supervisory approval, employees shall be allowed a reasonable amount of State paid time to participate in employment interviews associated with the efforts described in paragraph D. above.
F.	When a department has two or more employees in a class who are subject to an involuntary transfer which reasonably requires an employee to change his/her residence consideration shall be given for the affected employee’s seniority in accordance with Government Code Section 19994.2.
15.2	Hardship Transfer
The State and the Union recognize the importance of hardship transfers as a way of dealing with Work and Family issues. An employee experiencing a verifiable hardship, e.g., domestic violence, mandatory job transfer of a spouse or domestic partner as defined in Family Code Section 297, family illness, serious health condition, injury or death of family members, may request a transfer to another geographic area to mitigate the hardship.
The State shall endeavor to reassign the employee to a comparable or lesser (if comparable is not available) position in the requested geographic area. If the employee accepts a position in a lower paid classification, the State shall endeavor to reinstate the employee to their former classification and comparable salary level.
Transfers under this section shall be considered voluntary and any associated relocation costs shall be subject to the applicable Department of Personnel Administration laws and rules.
A department shall provide in writing the reason(s) for the inability to grant the transfer.
This section is not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of this Contract.

A.	Effective the first of the pay period following approval by the CalPERS Board and ratification of the legislature and continuing for 12 monthly pay periods thereafter, the State agrees to the following:
•	Employees who are miscellaneous and/or industrial members of the first tier plan, and who are subject to Social Security under the CalPERS, shall have their employee retirement contribution rate reduced to zero.

E.	Classifications are assigned to the workweek groups as shown in the Lists of Classifications attached to this Contract.

Consistent with the professional status of these employees, they are accountable for their work product, and for meeting the objectives of the agency for which they work.
Following is the State's policy for all employees exempt/excluded from the FLSA:
1.	Management determines, consistent with the current Contract the products, services, and standards which must be met by FLSA - exempt/excluded employees;
2.	The salary paid to FLSA - exempt/excluded employees is full compensation for all hours worked in providing the product or service;
3.	FLSA - exempt/excluded employees are not authorized to receive any form of overtime compensation, whether formal or informal;
4.	FLSA - exempt/excluded employees are expected to work, within reason, as many hours as necessary to accomplish their assignments or fulfill their responsibilities and must respond to directions from management to complete work assignments by specific deadlines.

7.	With the approval of the appointing power, FLSA - exempt/excluded employees may be allowed absences with pay for one or more whole days due to excessive work load or other special circumstances without charging leave credits;
8.	Subject to prior notification and management concurrence, FLSA exempt/excluded employees may alter their work hours. Employees are responsible for keeping management apprised of their schedule and whereabouts.

Both parties agree and understand that a different type of overtime payment (cash or CTO) may be provided to employees at different times and may even be different for employees in the same or similar situations. However, in the event that the Department of Industrial Relations determines that this provision is inconsistent with Labor Code Section 204.3, the parties agree to immediately meet and confer regarding the impact of that determination.

The parties agree that implementation of all Post and Bid provisions, which are set forth in Article 15 of the Units 1, 4 and 11 MOUs as referenced in SB 728 (Machado), shall be consistent with existing State Personnel Board laws and rules. For employees eligible to transfer, those employees will only be appointed using the post and bid process if they have met SPB’s transfer requirements.

Section 4.10 of the Budget Act of 2003 recognizes that the Budget Bill approved by the Senate does not provide funds for employee compensation increases that may become effective during the 2003-04 fiscal year, and grants the Director of Finance authority to reduce and reallocate appropriations in the Budget Act in order to ensure the integrity of the 2003 Budget.
The savings achieved in employee compensation for fiscal year (FY) 03/04 that have been agreed to by the parties shall first be applied to mitigate layoffs during FY 03/04 for Bargaining Units 1, 4, 11, 14, 15 and 20, consistent with the provisions of Section 4.10 of the Budget Act of 2003.

ADDENDUM I
Time off for Victims of Domestic Violence
State of California
M E M O R A N D U M
DATE: June 20, 2001
TO:	PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT LIAISONS	REFERENCE CODE: 2001-025
THIS MEMORANDUM SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO:
Employee Relations Officers Personnel Officers
FROM:	Department of Personnel Administration
Policy Development Office
SUBJECT:	Time Off for Victims of Domestic Violence
CONTACT:	Charlotte Gehringer, Personnel Management Analyst
(916)323-6938 FAX: (916) 324-9393
Email: CharlotteGehringer@dpa.ca.gov
The purpose of this memo is to notify departments of an addition to existing law regarding time off for an employee who is a victim of domestic violence.
Effective January 1, 2001, Assembly Bill 2357 added Section 230.1 to the Labor Code to specify that employers with 25 or more employees may not discharge or in any manner discriminate or retaliate against an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, as defined in Section 6211 of the Family Code, for taking time off to seek medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, obtain psychological counseling related to an experience of domestic violence, obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program, or rape crisis center, or to participate in safety planning to increase safety from future domestic violence.
As a condition for taking time off, the employee shall give the employer reasonable advance notice of the employee’s intention to take time off for any of the purposes summarized above, unless advance notice is not feasible. When an unscheduled absence occurs, the employer may require the employee to certify that the absence is a result of domestic violence in the form of a police report, a court order, or medical documentation. An employer would be required to maintain the confidentiality of any employee’s request for time off pursuant to provision of this law.

PML 2001-025 June 20, 2001 Page 2
The law does not require an employer to compensate an employee for the time taken off under these circumstances, but the employee may use vacation, personal leave, or other compensating time off that is otherwise available to the employee.
An employee whose rights are violated under this section may be entitled to lost wages and reinstatement. An employer who willfully refuses to reinstate an employee under this section may be guilty of a misdemeanor. This law also allows an employee to file a complaint with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement of the Department of Industrial Relations.
This section does not create a right for an employee to take unpaid leave that exceeds the unpaid leave time allowed under, or in addition to the unpaid leave time permitted by, the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
The provisions of this bill apply to the State as an employer and to State employees. The entitlement of any employee under this law shall not be diminished by a collective bargaining agreement.
If you have any questions, please contact Charlotte Gehringer at (916) 323-6938.
