AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of the 1st day of June, 2018 by and between NAV-LVH, LLC dba Westgate Las Vegas Resort cfc Casino (hereinafter, called the “Employer”) and its successors and assigns, and the LOCAL JOINT EXECUTIVE BOARD OF LAS VEGAS, for and on behalf of CULINARY WORKERS UNION, LOCAL NO. 226 and BARTENDERS UNION, LOCAL NO. 165 (hereinafter, called the “Union”).
WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, pursuant to a valid reopening notice dated February 13, 2018 and served upon the Employer by the Union, the parties have, by negotiations and collective bargaining, reached complete agreement on wages, hours of work, working conditions and other related, negotiable subjects to be incorporated into a new Labor Agreement which shall supersede all previous verbal or written agreements in conflict with or modified by this Agreement applicable to the employees in the bargaining unit defined herein which may have existed between the Employer and the Union or between the predecessor of the Employer, if any, and the predecessor of the Union; if any.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the execution of this Agreement and the full and faithful performance of die covenants, representations and warranties contained herein, it is mutually agreed as follows:
ARTICLE 1:	RECOGNITION AND CONTRACT COVERAGES
1.01. Recognition of the Union.
(a)	The Employer recognizes the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for the Employer's employees employed at its facility as indicated in the first paragraph of this agreement, and excluding any persons working for the Employer at any other facility, including those located in Clark County, Laughlin or Reno, Nevada or any subsequently acquired property not organized by the Union, working under the Union's jurisdiction and working in those job classifications listed in Exhibit 1, attached to and made a part of this Agreement. The Employer and the Union agree that all employees working in classifications listed in Exhibit 1 are properly within the bargaining unit. Any classification established by the Employer not listed in Exhibit 1, where all of the employees' duties are covered by this Agreement, shall be a part of this Agreement at a wage rate comparable to related job classifications.
(b)	For clarification, “all employees” as used in subsection 1.01(a) includes workers the Employer may obtain from a temporary labor source, employment agency or other source besides the Employer's own hiring process regardless whether the workers are on the Employer's payroll or that of another entity and regardless of the job classifications or titles assigned to them by another entity, as long as they are performing work at the Employer's facility that is associated with the classifications listed in Exhibit 1. Temporary workers performing such bargaining unit work are covered by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Employer shall make contributions to benefit funds called for by this Agreement for all hours temporary workers perform such bargaining unit work. If temporary workers are not on the Employer's payroll, the Employer shall obtain and provide to the Union the same information about such employees as it provides about its own employees pursuant to Section 4.03. The Employer shall also obtain the
Westgate
1
payroll and personnel records necessary to determine that any temporary workers are being paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and supply copies to the Union upon the Union's request. The Employer shall not enter into any arrangement with any source of temporary workers unless the Employer has the right under such arrangement to obtain and share with the Union the information described herein and shall terminate any arrangement for temporary workers as soon as it has the legal right to do so if the arrangement does not give the Employer the right to obtain and share with the Union the information described herein. The Employer shall provide to the Union copies of any and all contracts, agreements, purchase orders or other documents evidencing any arrangements existing as of the effective date of this Agreement under which the Employer may obtain temporary employees.
1.02. Open and Excluded Classifications.
(a)	The classifications set forth below are included in the bargaining unit, but their wage scales shall be open, and they shall be covered only by Articles 11,14,15,25 and 26 of this Agreement and, where applicable, those provisions dealing with gratuities. The provisions of Article 21 may be invoked as to persons employed in such classifications solely for the purpose of processing grievances limited to disputes or differences involving the meaning, interpretation, and/or application of the Articles specified above. This shall not preclude the Union from filing grievances under other Articles for claimed violations of its rights.
Banquet Captain	Head Butcher	Head Host Person
Bell Captain	Head Bartender
(b)	All regular, relief and steady extra Bell Captains and Head Butchers employed as of June 1, 1994, (i.e., who have not suffered as of that date a break as defined in Section 20.05) shall have the one-time option of being covered by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The option may be exercised by no later than the sixtieth (60) day following execution of this Agreement and shall be in writing.

2.01. Hiring Procedure.
Whenever the employer finds it necessary to hire new employees for those classifications covered by the Agreement, it may recruit and procure applicants from any source.
At its sole option, the Employer may notify the Union who shall assist the Employer in obtaining applicants who meet the qualifications required by the Employer. When applicable, the Union's selection of applicants for referral shall be on a nondiscriminatory basis, and shall not be based upon or in any way affected by membership in the Union or the Union's bylaws, rules, regulations, constitutional provisions or any other aspects or obligations of Union membership, policies, or requirements, or upon an applicant's race, color, religion, sex, age or national origin.

The Union will give the applicants proof of registration. The Employer agrees no employee will be hired or put to work without a referral slip from the Union's Dispatch Office except in the case of an emergency. The Union's referral service shall send applicants named by the Employer directly back to the Employer. Such applicants named by the Employer shall be processed by the service without any discrimination. Any applicant named by the Employer shall be permitted by the Union's referral service to register in the same manner as others.

Except as provided in Section 20.03, and provided they are otherwise qualified to perform satisfactorily the work to be done, Steady Extra Board employees shall be offered a choice of all steady extra work in the order of their seniority amongst themselves before extra employees are hired. The Employer shall solely determine the frequency at which available work is offered, and nothing herein shall require the Employer to redistribute additional work already offered and accepted.
(b)	The Employer shall offer to steady extra employees in a classification, in accordance with their steady extra classification seniority, the first two out of every three permanent vacancies in that classification, after regular employees in that classification have exhausted their rights under Section 20.04(b). Every third such vacancy shall be filled by promotion as provided in Section 20.04(a).
Steady Extra employees will have the same rights as other employees to bid for promotions using house seniority from original date of hire (20.04 {a}).
Steady Extra Board employees who become regular relief or Full Time Flex employees shall not be required to serve a new probationary period provided that the transfer is within the same classification. If a Steady Extra becomes a regular relief, or Full Time Flex employee, their classification seniority shall date from most recent date of transfer into their present classification on a full-time basis, and house seniority shall date from original date of hire.
(c)	Extras who work forty (40) shifts in the same classification for one (I) employer in any twelve (12) month period shall at that time either become a Steady Extra, in that classification, if there is a Steady Extra position available at that time, within the contractual limitations on the number of Steady Extras or if not be offered the next available Steady Extra position in that classification, and in the meantime may continue to work as an Extra.
An Extra who becomes a Steady Extra under this provision shall not be required to serve a second probationary period.
If an Extra refuses an available Steady Extra position, they shall lose their rights to that position, but may earn a new right by working an additional forty (40) shifts. However, they may continue to work as an Extra. These rights do not apply to banquet extras.
10.08. Staffing for Distressed Food and Beverage Venues.
During the term of this Agreement, the Employer may implement the conditions set forth in this Section in any buffet, coffee shop, room service or other food and beverage operation that was, a) closed on or after June 1, 2010, and is reopened by no later than October 1, 2015, b) in which hours of operation were cut by 40% or more during the period June 1, 2010, through August 31, 2013, or, c) that the Employer, and the Union agree is experiencing such stress that it may close or suffer a serious cut in style or hours of operation or in size. The venues included are listed on Exhibit A which may be amended from time to time to add venues as provided below.

Westgate
18
kitchens supporting such venues, including garde manger, baker and butcher shop as specified on Exhibit A). The Parties agree to meet within thirty (30) days after the yearly anniversaries of this Agreement to discuss the Full Time Flex category and any related issues. It shall be presumed that any new cafe, buffet and room service venue shall, at the request of the Employer, be added to Exhibit A upon opening to the public. Upon the Employer's request, the Parties will meet and discuss the inclusion of additional venues on Exhibit A. However, if the Employer seeks to add venues and/or additional kitchens to the list, including fine dining venues, it shall provide the Union with relevant information demonstrating that the venue is or is becoming economically distressed and the venue may be added to the list by mutual agreement of the Employer and the Union.
(b)	A Full Time Flex employee is carried on the Employer's regular food and beverage payroll and guaranteed a work schedule consisting of a thirty (30) hour work week made up of no more than six (6) shifts of six (6), eight (8) or ten (10) hours. Work performed by a Full Time Flex or Steady Extra employee working in a distressed venue on the employee's sixth (6th) and seventh (7th) consecutive day of work shall be paid for at one and a half times (1-1/2X) or two and one half times (2-1/2X) the employee's straight time hourly rate of pay, respectively. The wage rate for six (6) hour shifts shall be the eight (8) hour wage rate shown on Exhibit 1 divided by eight (8) and multiplied by six (6). The wage rate for four (4) hour shifts shall be the eight (8) hour rate shown in Exhibit 1 divided by eight (8) and multiplied by four (4).
(c)	Employees classified as Full Time Flex shall not exceed forty percent (40%) of the total number of bargaining unit employees in each classification employed by Employer in the venues identified on Exhibit A. Full Time Flex employees shall be offered additional work which becomes available before such work is offered to Steady Extra employees (so long as such work would not result in the employee incurring overtime). The Company and Union agree that at either party’s request, the parties will meet to discuss moving to the MGM-style Informal Dining Venue language, specifically the sixty percent (60%) Full Time, twenty percent (20%) Flex and twenty percent (20%) Steady Extra division.
(d)	When a full-time flex category is first introduced into a venue, the Employer will determine the number of full time, Full Time Flex and Steady Extra positions needed in each classification (based upon the percentages set forth herein).
1.	If the staffing levels established by the Employer include a reduction in the number of regular full time positions, the Employer will provide regular full time employees the opportunity to volunteer to move to a Full Time Flex position in their classification. If there. are no or insufficient volunteers, the most senior employees in the classification shall remain regular full time employees and the remainder shall be re-classified as Full Time Flex.
2.	If available Full Time Flex positions are not filled by reclassification of regular full time employees, such positions will be posted for bid for steady extra employees in the classification and shall be awarded by seniority in their classification.
3.	If an insufficient number of steady extra employees bid on open Full Time Flex positions, such positions will be posted for promotional bidding.

(f)	The Employer may cross-utilize employees in all cooking and runner classifications to work in more than one of the venues listed on Exhibit A either during the same shift or during the same work week. The Employer may also continue its current cross-utilization practices with respect to venues whether or not listed on Exhibit A.
(g)	As provided in 10.08(a), the Employer and the Union may mutually agree to extend the terms of this section to any previously closed venues that are reopened after October 1, 2015, to newly opened venues, to restaurants other than buffets or coffee shops, or all or any combination of these.
(h)	A committee composed of Union and Employer representatives shall develop a joint program to inform bargaining unit employees and managers about the provisions relative to distressed venues, including recall rights, and then to monitor the implementation of this Section 10.08 to address any issues that arise during and after implementation.

If an employee works in part of a month and is on leave part of the month, the employer shall make contributions for only the hours the employee would have been paid but for the leave.

An employee absent five (5) or more days due to his or her own serious health condition, whether or not compensable under the terms of the EICON shall, upon request, present a release from his/her treating physician stating that the employee is physically able to perform the duties of his/her former position. However, if the absence exceeded twenty (20) days, the Employer may also promptly require the employee to be examined by a health care provider (within the meaning
Westgate
26
of the Family and Medical Leave Act [FMLA]) selected by the Employer, other than the one employed by or regularly retained by the Employer. Such examination shall be paid for by the Employer. If there is a dispute or conflict between the employee's treating health care provider and the health care provider selected by. the Employer as to the physical ability of the employee to return to work and perform the duties of his/her founer position, the dispute or conflict shall be resolved by a third medical opinion by a health care provider agreed upon by the employee's and Employer's health care providers. Employees absent due to illness or injury shall advise their Employer as to their expected date of return to work, and of any changes therein, but shall not be required to call or advise their Employer daily.

13.04. Relationship to Family and Medical Leave Act.
Where this Article provides rights greater than those provided for under FMLA, this Article governs. Where FMLA provides rights greater than those provided in this Article, FMLA governs. The rights provided in this Article shall not be added to those provided by FMLA to produce greater rights than an employee would have under either this Article or FMLA standing alone; there shall be no duplication of rights. Where FMLA governs instead of this Article, all of the requirements for a leave under FMLA must be met by the employee. Where this Article governs, or where leave is available both under FMLA and under this Article, only the requirements set forth in this Article, and not those in FMLA, must be met by the employee. For further clarification, the FMLA requirements referred to here include paperwork requirements. An employee requesting a non-FMLA medical leave of absence may not be required to supply FMLA certification, but the Employer may require the employee to complete an application for the leave on a form to be agreed upon by the Union and Employer.
13.05. Light Duty.
The Employer reserves the right to assign employees to work in light duty in classifications that are covered and excluded from the terms of this Agreement, during the time that an employee's bona fide illness or injury compensable under the Nevada State Industrial Insurance Act precludes him/her from performing the duties of his/her claissification. The employee shall be paid either the temporary total disability rate mandated by the EICON while assigned to light duty excluded from this Agreement, or the appropriate rate for the classification if the employee is assigned to perform bargaining unit work, unless the appropriate rate for the classification is less than the temporary total disability rate mandated by the EICON, in which case the temporary total disability fate will apply. The Employer shall assign the employee to work the shift and hours consistent with the needs of the business and availability of light duty work, and without regard to restrictions upon a weekly guarantee. In any event, employees assigned light duty work shall be paid at least the temporary total disability rate required by Nevada Law. Time spent working light duty shall not count as shifts worked for completion of the probationary period. However, the employee's shifts worked, prior to and after assignment to light duty, shall be combined to complete the probationary period. Time spent working light duty shall not be considered a break in service when calculating seniority or vacation entitlement.
If the bargaining unit employee rejects the assignment to perform light duty work, whether within or outside of the bargaining unit, the employee shall be subject to disqualification of benefits under the EICON. However, if the bargaining unit employee rejects the assignment to perform light duty
Westgate
27
work, the bargaining unit employee shall not otherwise be subject to discipline and shall continue to be entitled to leave for which the employee is eligible under 13.01(a).

11	2
12	3
If during the course of the shift a scheduled checkout room becomes a stay over instead, the foregoing reduction will not be made with respect to that room. If more than one credit is given for a suite, that same number shall be used in calculating the number of checkouts (for example, a suite worth three credits would be counted as three checkouts) when the suite is a checkout. This subsection applies only to Guest Room Attendants assigned to day shifts. ;

EXHIBIT 9 — RE: ATTENDANCE POLICY
Attendance: Being the best means being on time to provide fast and flawless service every shift. If you are excessively absent or late, you create inconvenience for our guests. In addition, it places an unfair burden on co-workers who may have to perform additional work or may be called in on their day off.
The schedule in each department is designed to provide the best guest service. The Attendance policy is designed to be fair and consistent in recording punctuality and attendance.
Westgate
101
The Attendance policy is based on an eleven (11) point system. Points are accumulated when an employee is late, leaves early, is absent from work. A total of eleven (11) points in any rolling 12-month period results in Separation of Employment.
It is your responsibility to notify your supervisor at least four (4) two (2) hours prior to the start of your shift if you are going to be late or absent. If you do not follow your department call-in procedures, it will result in progressive discipline. Being on time means being at your workstation, fully prepared to begin work at your scheduled start time.
Absences will be recorded as follows:
I Violation-	■ *;	■	:.	Points
One Day Absent	1 point
Consecutive Absences: 1 point for the first day of absence !4 point for day following initial day of absence (Total points for 4 consecutive days absent = 1 Vi) (Please refer to Leave of Absence guidelines; for example if absence is due to overnight hospitalization, or employee missing more than 3 consecutive days of work and requiring follow-up treatment, or continuing treatment for chronic'condition, pre-natal care, birth of child or caring for a family member with a serious health condition may be eligible for a LOA: points are not recorded for an approved Leave of Absence)	1 point first day Vz point
Patterned Absence (3) incidents creating a pattern within 3 months; may include but is not limited to calling off on same days of the week, days before or after days off, days before or after payday, days before or after holiday, etc.)	2 points
Late for work (including returning late from break)	Yz point
Leaving work early after completing 2 or more hours of shift (unless due to business demands or approved in ' advance)	‘/i point
Leaving work before completing 2 hours of shift (unless due to business demands or approved in advance)	1 point
No Call/No Show (If the employee does not call in or report for their scheduled shift before 50% of their shift elapses)	6 points
Denied Day Off (formal request for a day off was denied but employee calls out as an absence; includes denied Shift Request to switch schedules)	3 points
Mandatory Meetings — absence/lateness/no call/no show	Points apply as above
Training Classes—.absence/lateness/no call/no show	Points apply as above
Peak Business Days (defined below)	2 Points
Additional Points-Improper Call-Out	
Failure to call at least two hours before start of shift	Vz additional point
Calling in 4 hours after shift starts	1 additional point
Westgate
102
Peak Business Days .
•	Until February 1, 2008, each property shall follow its existing policy on peak days (if any). Effective February 1,2008, departments will have the ability to identify five (5) days per year as a “peak business day.” Employees who are absent on any of these designated days, will be issued two (2) attendance points. The department will post each such designated peak day a minimum of ninety (90) days in advance. ; Designation of peak day(s) may be changed by the department at any time provided that there is at least ninety (90) days advance notice of the newly designated peak day.
Points are not recorded for:
•	JuryDuty
•	Bereavement Leave
•	Approved Family Medical Leave (please see Family Medical Leave Guidelines) —However, employees on Intermittent leave must follow proper call in procedures for each shift not worked due to intermittent leave, unless otherwise provided by law.
•	Approved Medical Leave (please see Medical Leave Guidelines)
•	Approved Personal Leave (please see Personal Leave Guidelines)
•	Approved Military Leave
•	Documented on-the-job-injury
•	Pre-approved Paid Time Off or Vacation
•	Workers comp leave
An employee can reduce his/her point total on the 12-month anniversary of an incident; that is, the point(s) for that incident drop off and are no longer counted.
After one-hundred eighty (180) days of perfect attendance, all existing attendance points and counseling notices issued under the attendance policy will become inactive and no longer used for progressive counseling purposes, excluding patterned absences. Employees on any type of leave will not have the period of leave counted towards fulfillment of the one hundred eighty (180) day requirement.
Employees who have accrued Vacation may use such time for shifts on which they are absent for their entire shift. If Vacation is requested, it must be for all hours of the absent shift. Points will still be assigned as noted above for all unscheduled absences/attendance incidents.
Employees are responsible for keeping track of their point totals. The property will attempt to provide written notification during the orientation period; and, after completion of the orientation period, at five (5) points, at seven (7) points, at ten (10) points and eleven (11) points (Separation of Employment), as follows:
5 points	Verbal (Coaching)
7 points	Written
10 points	Final Written Warning
11 points	Separation
Westgate
103
Each step of progressive counseling need not be issued prior to termination provided that points have been properly assessed. For example, an employee with 7 points who is a no-call/no-show would be separated because of the accrual of 13 points, despite not having received a prior Final Written warning.
The Company reserves the right to review each situation on a case-by-case basis. The Union shall not raise the issue of disparate treatment where the Company chooses to be more lenient in a particular case.
This Attendance Policy is effective November 1, 2007 and will remain in full force and effect throughout the term of the current collective bargaining agreement.
The parties agree that all existing grievances and requests for arbitration will be withdrawn upon acceptance of the proposed language changes.
Westgate

The Employer may, in lieu of providing an escort as set forth herein, reassign the Employee to clean another guest room to replace the missed credit or the Employer may advise the employee not to perform service on the room in question.
