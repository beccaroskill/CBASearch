separated from its main location, the Union may also designate a steward for each such separate unit for each shift provided that such unit consists of a minimum of four (4) employees, is not adjacent to the shop's main location and is not established on a temporary short-term basis; notwithstanding Section 3.1(a), when such unit drops below four (4) employees, no employee in such unit shall have steward status. If a geographically separated unit of a shop does not have a separate steward, arrangements will be made to permit employees in such unit to contact a steward upon request. In the absence of the regular steward for any reason, the Union may designate a temporary steward to act for the regular steward. Such designation shall be in writing. For the purpose of this Article 3, a shop shall be defined as any organization, geographically separated unit, or grouping of employees which the parties establish in advance by mutual agreement.
3.1	(a) Stewards
An employee while serving as a Steward shall not be laid off, transferred or loaned from his job classification or his shop, or his shift so long as other employees remain in his job classification, and in the shop, and on the shift for which he is designated as Steward. If he/she is not eligible so to remain in his/her job classification, he/she will be offered a downgrade to the highest labor level job classification within his/her normal line of promotion which is then being utilized in the shop and on the shift for which he/she is designated as Steward. If he/she declines such a downgrade or if he/she is relieved of his/her Stewards status prior to such downgrade action, he/she will then be subject to normal surplusing procedures as provided in Section 16.3.
3.1	(b) Stewards/Layoff
Stewards will be promoted and recalled from layoff on the same basis as provided in Section 16.5 for other employees, except that in the event a shift in a shop is deactivated and is reactivated by the Company within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after such deactivation, the former Steward will be offered an opportunity to return to that shop and shift provided the Company determines to utilize the Steward‘s former job classification or a lower level in the same job

leaving his work assignment for the purpose of investigating complaints or claims of grievance on the part of employees or the Union or contacting the Business Representative in regard to such claim or grievance. The Supervisor shall agree to the Steward leaving his work assignment except where there is a substantial reason for delaying the contact or the investigation due to safety conditions or the fact that a critical operation is in process. The supervisor may be present during any discussion relating to any complaint or grievance. However, upon the request of an employee or Steward, the Supervisor shall authorize a Steward to participate in a private discussion with an employee or Business Representative, relating to a complaint or grievance. Discussions of the type described in this Section 3.6 shall be conducted without requiring the employee or Steward to clock out provided the discussion does not extend beyond the time that the Supervisor considers reasonable under the circumstances.

Except as provided in Section 3.6 above, each Steward, local lodge officer or district council delegate shall, with authorization from the Union, give his Supervisor at least twenty-four (24) hour advance notice if possible and clock out prior to departure from his work assignment to conduct Union business. If the work assignment given the Steward, local lodge officer or district council delegate seriously interferes with the performance of his duties for the Union, or if Union business seriously interferes with his work assignment, the Company and the Union agree to cooperate in making arrangements to prevent such interference in the future. However, Stewards, local lodge officers and district council delegates shall not be penalized for such Union business; provided, that nonpayment by the Company for time spent on Union business shall not be considered as a penalty. This Section 3.7 shall apply to cases of Stewards who are designated to act for Business Representatives in accordance with Section 7.13 for the temporary period the Steward is authorized as a designee.

Union. The Union is also aware and has agreed that solicitation of membership cannot be conducted during working time due to the interference and disruption that could result in working schedules. To accommodate both viewpoints and assure that an ample opportunity exists for the Union to explain their role in the bargaining relationship while preserving minimal interference in the Company's working schedule the following procedure will be utilized:
1.	At an appropriate time following the Company interview, all individuals employed into the IAM bargaining unit will be directed to an IAM&AW representative who is present in the Employment Office.
2.	The following message will be used by the Company representative to introduce the IAM&AW representative:
"The Union representative wishes to explain their designation as your bargaining agent, your opportunity for membership, and the payroll deduction of dues for members."
3.	The Union representative will advise the employees that membership in the IAM&AW is voluntary and not a required condition of employment.
4.	Both the Company and the Union agree to cooperate in the implementation and administration of this procedure. Neither party will interfere, restrain or coerce employees and both parties agree to use good judgment in all words and actions during this procedure.
5.	The Union agrees to minimal interference with the new employee employment processing and the Company agrees to refrain from any actions or statements which could adversely reflect upon the Union.
6.	The Union agrees to pay their representative's time allotted by this procedure and to have sufficient representatives present during normal working hours.
7.	With the implementation of the procedure for the interview of new employees it is agreed that any existing or contemplated arrangements for permitting the Union to explain membership to applicants or hires is no longer valid and will be cancelled.

chance of being met. The Company will brief upper level Union leadership on the Plan‘s goals each year.

Target goals may not be changed for the year once set.

c)	The percentage bonus shall be 2.5% for Target and 5.0% for Outstanding Performance in Plan Years 2013,	2014, and
2015.

B.	Determination of Cost of Living Lump Sum Payment
1.	Determination of the potential Cost of Living Lump Sum Payment shall be made in reference to the new series "All City Average of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers" published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S.	Department of	Labor,_with the
following base period:	1982-84 = 100, such index being
referred to herein as the BLS Index.
2.	During the life of this Agreement, subject to the provision stated below, an annual Cost of Living Lump Sum Payment shall be computed by using (1)	213.34 (the three-month
average of the BLS Index for February, March, April, 2010) as the base and (2) an Annual Adjustment Multiplier using the formula 1 cent = .075 percent change in the appropriate average (May through October 2010, November through October thereafter), and (3) the Annual Adjustment Multiplier shall be capped at 1.5% of average base rate as of November 30 in 2010, and 2011, 1.75% of average base rate as of November 30 in 2012 and 2013, 2.0% of average base rate as of November 30 in 2014 and 2015, 2.5% of average base rate as of November 30 in 2016, 3.0% of average base rate as of November 30 in 2017, 4.0% of average base rate as of November 30 in 2018, 6.0% of average base rate as of November 30 in 2019, and (4) the Cost of Living Lump Sum Payment for each eligible employee shall equal the cents per hour adjustment (the Annual Adjustment Multiplier) multiplied by the number of straight-time hours worked in the applicable year plus 1.5 times the cents per hour adjustment multiplied by the number of overtime hours worked in the applicable twelve month period (December 1 through November 30). For 2010, the period will be straighttime and overtime hours worked between July 1 and November 30, 2010.
3.	Any Annual Adjustment Multiplier shall be cumulative up to the level of each year‘s cap and shall not decrease. A Cost of Living Lump Sum Payment in any particular year shall be payable only to those employees who, on a Date of Potential Adjustment, are on the active payroll or on leave of absence for less than ninety (90) days. The Date of Potential Adjustment shall be November 30th of each year. The

payment will be made before December 31st of the same year.
4.	If the BLS Index is revised or discontinued, the parties shall attempt to determine an appropriate Index figure by agreement and, if agreement is not reached, the parties shall request the Bureau of Labor Statistics to make available a BLS Index in its present form for the appropriate date or dates and calculated on a comparable basis.
C.	Cost of Living Adjustments shall not be added to or subtracted from any employee's base rate, except as herein provided.
Section 5.11.	Garnishments
In cases of dismissal or suspension of an employee because of writs of garnishment served upon the Company in litigation involving claims of third parties against such employee, such a dismissal or suspension will be treated as a dismissal or suspension under Section 7.3 and will be subject to the grievance procedure and other provisions of Article 7.
Section 5.12.	Wage Payment Basis
Employees shall be paid for time worked computed to the nearest one-tenth hour.
Section 5.13.	New Assignments
When employees are assigned to work in a higher or lower labor level the new pay rate shall be effective in the employee's paycheck not later than the third payday subsequent to the date on which the new assignment is made.
Section 5.14.	Base Rates After Reclassifications
Subject to the base rate ranges provided for in Section 5.2(B), employees who are promoted will have their base rate increased by fifty-six (56) cents for each I-Code they are promoted or decreased by fifty-six (56) cents for each I-Code the employee is downgraded. All base rate changes are subject to wage range maximums. Employees promoted to an I-code they previously held will receive a minimum rate increase sufficient to bring the employee‘s hourly rate equal to the same hourly rate they previously held or fifty-six (56) cents per I-Code, whichever is greater. Any employee being downgraded who is in progression will be automatically considered

to be at the mid-point of progression towards their next progression increase.
Section 5.15.	Rate Retention
The base rate of an employee who, under Article 16, accepts downgrade rather than electing layoff shall be, for the ninety (90) calendar-day-period after the downgrade, at a rate that is not less than the rate he held immediately preceding the downgrade. However, this provision shall not apply to any period of employment within a bargaining unit covered by this Agreement after termination, layoff, employee-requested downgrade or transfer to a unit or group to which this Agreement does not apply within the ninety (90)-day period with the following exception: if such an individual is recalled from layoff to a job title classification to which he had been downgraded, and the recall occurs less than ninety (90)-calendar-days after such downgrade, he will receive rate retention prospectively for the portion of the ninety (90)-calendar-day period that remained at the time of layoff. If an employee receives a Temporary Promotion to the job classification from which he was most recently surplused and the employee is receiving rate retention pay as a result of such downgrade, the 90-calendar-day period will be extended one (1) day for each day of such Temporary Promotion.
Section 5.16.	Recalls from Layoff
An employee who is recalled from layoff through the exercise of recall rights, will have the following base rate:
A.	If the employee is recalled to the same labor level from which he was laid off, he will be paid the base rate and the cost of living adjustment in effect on the date of his layoff, provided that, if cost of living adjustment has been added to base rates and made a part thereof since the employee's layoff, the cost of living adjustment in effect on the date of the employee's layoff shall be similarly added to his base rate.
B.	If the employee is recalled to either a higher or lower labor level than the one from which he was laid off, his base rate will be determined first by treating him as though he had been recalled to the same labor level under Section 5.16(A) and then reclassified under Section 5.14.

Section 5.17.	Returns from Leaves of Absence
An employee on approved leave of absence who returns to the active payroll will have the following base rate:
A.	If the leave of absence was granted due to industrial injury or industrial illness, military service, or to accept a full-time Union position, the employee's base rate will be equal to the base rate he would have had if he had not been on a leave of absence.
B.	If the leave of absence was granted for any other reason, his base rate will be determined as though he had been recalled from layoff under Section 5.16.(A)
Section 5.18.	Gain Sharing Plan
A.	The Company will establish a gain-sharing plan whereby employees are rewarded for Company productivity improvements.
B.	Target performance goals will be set for each year. Each year the Company will make a good faith effort to establish reasonable goals with a realistic chance of being achieved. Once a target is set for the Plan Year, the target goal may not be changed to be more difficult to achieve. For 2010 and 2011, the following goals shall apply. In following years, the Company will review proposed goals with the Union:
a.	Calendar Year 2010 Performance
i.	Target - 3% reduction in Scrap & Rework and 2%
reduction in IAM Hours per Unit.
ii.	Outstanding Performance - 6% reduction in Scrap &
Rework and 4% reduction in IAM Hours per Unit.
b.	Calendar Year 2011 Performance (Will be reviewed with Union in January 2011)
i.	Target - 4% reduction in Scrap & Rework and 3%
reduction in IAM Hours per Unit.
ii.	Outstanding Performance - 8% reduction in Scrap &
Rework and 6% reduction in IAM Hours per Unit.
c.	Reductions for 2010 are measured from a baseline of performance from June 1,	2009 through May 31,	2010.
Subsequent performance shall be measured with the preceding year as the baseline.
d.	Scrap & Rework reductions will be computed by comparing total scrap and rework per fuselage unit delivered during the

base line period to total scrap and rework per fuselage unit delivered during the target period: percent reduction = ((total scrap and rework during baseline period + fuselage units delivered during baseline period)) - ((total scrap and rework during the target period + fuselage units delivered during the target period) divided by (total scrap and rework during baseline period + fuselage units delivered during baseline period)).
e.	Total IAM Hours per Unit reduction will be computed by comparing total IAM Hours per fuselage unit delivered during the base line period to Total IAM Hours per fuselage unit delivered during the target period: Percent Reduction = ((total IAM Hours during baseline period + fuselage units delivered during baseline period) - (total IAM Hours during the target period + fuselage units delivered during the target period)) divided by ((total IAM Hours during baseline period + fuselage units delivered during baseline period)).
C.	The Company will meet quarterly with Union officials to discuss the targets that have been set and the quarterly progress with regard to the attainment of the target levels. The definition of Target and Outstanding Performance goals will be communicated to the Union as soon as they have been set at the beginning of the Plan Year. Once set, the Target and Outstanding Performance goals may not be changed to be more difficult to achieve during the Plan Year.
D.If the Target is met, employees will be paid a gain-sharing payment equal to one (1.0) percent of the employee‘s straighttime and overtime wages (pay for hours worked) during the calendar year. If the Outstanding goal is met, employees will be paid a gain-sharing payment equal to two (2.0) percent of the employee‘s straight-time and overtime wages (pay for hours worked) during the calendar year. The two measurements of Scrap & Rework Reduction and IAM Hours per Unit are equally weighted thresholds. If one threshold is met, but the other is not, half of the incentive payment will be made. The following examples illustrate how this calculation will occur:
a.	A score of one (1) is met on the Scrap & Rework Reduction measurement but the score on the IAM Hours per Unit measurement is less than one (1). A gain-share payment equal to one half of one percent (0.5%) of the employee‘s

straight-time and overtime wages during the calendar year will be paid.
b.	A score of two (2) is met on the Scrap & Rework Reduction measurement but the score on the IAM Hours per Unit measurement is less than one (1). A gain-share payment equal to one (1.0%) percent of the employee‘s straight-time and overtime wages during the calendar year will be paid.
c.	A score of two (2) is met on the Scrap & Rework reduction measurement and the score on the IAM Hours per Unit measurement is one (1). A gain-share payment equal to one and one half percent (1.5%) of the employee‘s straight-time and overtime wages during the calendar year will be paid.
E. As a condition to be eligible for the gain-share payment, the employee must be employed by the Company in an IAM bargaining unit position on December 31st of the particular calendar year for which the gain-share payment is being made. Payment shall be made by March 15 of the following year.
ARTICLE 6 HOURS OF LABOR
Section 6.1.	Regular Hours
A.	Workweek. The normal work schedule shall consist of five (5) consecutive workdays, Monday through Friday, followed by two (2) days of rest (Saturday and Sunday), except for those employees designated in advance by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union who regularly work on Saturday and/or Sunday, whose normal work schedule shall consist of five (5) consecutive workdays, followed by two (2) days of rest, which shall be treated as their Saturday and Sunday, in that order. The Company will attempt to meet its non-regular workweek assignments on a	voluntary basis
among the employees. In the event there are insufficient volunteers to meet the requirement, the	supervisor may
designate and require the necessary number of employees to work the non-regular workweek. Such designation shall first affect the junior qualified employees in the classification. When reducing the number of non-regular workweek assignments, senior employees within each job will be given

their preference to return to regular workweek schedules. The purpose of non-regular workweek assignments is to provide for those maintenance and service functions that are required on a continuing seven (7)-day per week basis. Such assignments will not be utilized for the purpose of providing maintenance or service in support of weekend production operations. It is mutually agreed that Maintenance employees and employees assigned to specific programs, employees assigned to specialized machinery and employees in organizations providing seven-day customer service may be assigned to a non-regular workweek. Employees assigned to a specific program will revert back to a regular workweek schedule upon first production delivery of product to customer.
B.	Short Workweek. The Company in its discretion may schedule short weeks	less than	forty (40)	hours per week, if	deemed
necessary to	avoid a layoff. In the	event the Company deems it
advisable to	work any	number of the employees on	a short
workweek, the Union	and the	affected employees	will be
notified in advance which days are to be worked, and such days worked shall be consecutive. The parties agree that stable long-term employment is beneficial for both the Company and the Union. When a layoff appears imminent, the parties will meet to discuss alternatives to layoffs, including, but not limited to, short workweeks, training, and alternative duty assignments. When short workweeks are used the following shall apply:
1.	Volunteers shall be asked first and accepted.
2.	In the event that there are insufficient volunteers, a short workweek will be staffed in reverse seniority order within the shop. For the purposes of Section 6.1(B) —shop” shall mean the crew identified by a distinct five (5) digit alpha/numeric code that identifies the working group. If exceptions to seniority are	needed due to	specific skills or machine
familiarity, Operations Leadership will discuss the need with the In-Plant	Representatives	to mutually agree to an
exception.
3.	During short workweeks the Company will continue to make pension plan contributions based on forty (40) hours per workweek, provided the Pension Plan will permit this. The Company will also continue Medical/Dental, AD&D, and Life

5.	During	periods of short workweek,	the Operations
Leadership and the Union will meet regularly to discuss scheduling and process issues.
C.	Shifts, Lunch Periods, Rest Periods. Each employee shall be assigned to a definite shift with designated times of beginning and ending. The first and second shifts each shall be an eight (8) hour-and-thirty-minute period which shall include a thirty (30) minute unpaid lunch period. The third shift shall be a seven (7) hour period which shall include a thirty (30)-minute unpaid lunch period. The designated times of beginning each shift during the scheduled workweek shall be: first shift -between 5:00 A.M. and 8:30 A.M.; second shift between 1:30 P.M. and 6:00 P.M.; third shift - between 10:00 P.M. and 1:30 A.M. of the following day. Each employee shall be given a ten (10)-minute rest period in each half of the shift to which he is assigned, the time of starting each such rest period to be designated by the Company. Each employee who is required to report for work two (2) or more hours prior to the start of his regular shift shall receive a ten (10)-minute rest period prior to the start of his regular shift. Each employee who is scheduled to work two (2) or more hours of overtime after his regular shift shall receive a ten (10)-minute rest period prior to the start of the overtime. Changes of shift assignments shall be made on the first day of a new workweek whenever practicable.
Section 6.2.	Variable/Alternative Work Schedules
A.	Variable work schedules may be established to meet production or support services requirements. Any such change in work schedules will be by mutual agreement between the parties.
B.	Management may allow employees to volunteer for variable work schedules (four (4) 10-hour days, Monday through Thursday workweek; three (3)12-hour days, Friday through Sunday) as warranted by business need.

Section 6.6.	Shift Preference
A. In order to ensure operational efficiency, the Company shall have the right to assign employees to any shift. Subject to the foregoing, senior employees who have a shift preference on file shall be given preference over junior employees who are assigned to the same job classification, level and shift, junior returning non-bargaining unit employees, new hires, recalls from layoff,	and promotional candidates	for placement in
openings in their job classification, level and organization. Shift preference rights are not applicable over employees being downgraded, laterally reclassified on their current shift, laterally transferred to the organization on their current shift or over senior employees who are in their labor level. Employees who have requested downgrades will not be given preference over senior employees in their organization who have shift preferences on file. Shift preferences must be filed more than three (3) working days prior to an organization effecting a shift change or declaring a job opening by submission of a dated open requisition.	If an employee does not file a shift
preference, it shall be assumed that he is on his preferred shift. Under no circumstances will the provisions of this Section 6.6 be construed to enable an employee, at his instance and request, to displace a less senior employee from his job and shift.
1.	As stated, shift preferences as defined will not apply in instances where the exercise of such rights would affect the efficiency of Company operations in any organization on any shift.	When such instances arise, it shall be the
responsibility of organizational management to prepare an exception request for transmittal to the organization‘s designated executive or delegate.
a) Exception requests shall be discussed with the Union Steward(s) on both shifts prior to submittal to the organization‘s senior Human Resources executive or designee for final approval. The Company will follow the

process agreed upon by the Company and the Union. (Ref. MOU #4).
2.	When senior employees are displaced from their shift of preference during a staffing exercise, the displaced employee shall be given, in writing, a date of return to the preferred shift he/she was on.
3.	The Company will de-staff a shift in the following order: first, by shift preference filings; and second, in reverse seniority order among remaining employees. In cases where the shift is to be eliminated, employees will be notified in advance and given the opportunity to file a timely shift preference.
Section 6.7.	Overtime Rate
A.	For time worked outside of his assigned shift, an employee shall be paid one and one-half (1%) times his base rate for the first two (2) hours, and double his base rate thereafter.
B.	For the first eight (8) hours of work by an employee on the first day of his two (2) consecutive days of rest, who is assigned on that day to work the first or second shift, such employee shall be paid one and one-half times his base rate for that shift and double such base rate thereafter.
C.	For the first six and one-half hours of work by an employee on the first day of his two (2) consecutive days of rest, who is assigned on that day to work the third shift, such employee shall be paid one and one-half times his base rate for that shift and double such base rate thereafter.
D.	Any time worked on the second day of an employee's two (2) consecutive days of rest shall be paid for at double his base rate for such shift and such double time shall remain in effect for all hours continuously worked.
1.	Except if an employee is scheduled and does not work on first scheduled day of rest, but works on second scheduled day of rest, employee will be paid one and one-half (1%) times his Base Rate plus shift premium where applicable for time worked for first eight (8) hours worked, normal double time rates shall apply thereafter.
E.	In lieu of the provisions in Sections 6.7 A-D, overtime worked in any of the following circumstances shall be paid at double the employee's base rate:

Section 6.8.	Reporting Pay
If an employee reports for work in accordance with instructions, he shall receive a minimum of eight (8) hours pay at his Base Rate plus shift premiums where applicable. This will not apply in case of emergency shutdowns arising out of any condition beyond the Company‘s control. An employee who leaves work of his own volition, or because of incapacity (other than industrial injury or illness), or is discharged or suspended after beginning work, will be paid only for the number of actual hours worked during the day. An employee who leaves work because of incapacity due to industrial injury or illness will be paid eight (8) hours pay at his Base Rate plus shift premiums where applicable.
Section 6.9.	Call Back Pay
A minimum of four (4) hours pay at the applicable overtime rate will be paid for any call back work performed outside of one‘s regularly schedule hours. An employee who leaves work of his own volition, or because of incapacity (other than industrial injury or illness), or is discharged or suspended after beginning work, will be paid only for the number of hours actually worked during that day. An employee, who leaves work after call back, will be paid only for the number of hours actually worked unless authorized by management.
Section 6.10.	Overtime Scheduling
It is the intent of the Company to distribute overtime as equally as reasonably practicable within the job classification, shop and shift. Both the Union and the Company recognize that the employees who are assigned the work must be qualified to perform the specific work. The Company will strive to meet its overtime requirements on a voluntary basis. In the event there are insufficient qualified volunteers to meet the requirement, management may designate and require the necessary number of employees to work the overtime.

2.	An employee is asked to work overtime (Saturday and/or Sunday) and is subsequently absent due to illness or bereavement leave on the workday preceding the overtime day.
3.	The employee has been given a Disciplinary Memo (DM) for violation of the Company‘s attendance policies.

military leave on Friday preceding the weekend, or unless Sections (A)(4,5,6) of this Section 6.10(A) apply.
C.	It is understood that the authority of the Company to require overtime work, established by Section 6.10 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, is necessary for business planning and meeting operational objectives. The parties recognize, however, that the exercise of this authority may affect employee productivity.
D.	Accordingly, the Company and the Union agree, subject to the exceptions noted below, that the authority conferred by Section 6.10 of the Agreement shall hereinafter be limited as follows. No employee shall be required, and need not be permitted, to work overtime in excess of the following limits:

3.	Holidays
All overtime on a holiday as set forth in Section 10.1 of the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement or on the weekend which immediately precedes a Monday holiday or immediately follows a Friday holiday shall be voluntary.
4.	No employee will be scheduled for weekend overtime in conjunction with his or her vacation provided the vacation is scheduled three (3) or more days prior to the start of the vacation.
E.	All overtime in excess of the above limits shall be strictly on a voluntary basis and no employee shall suffer retribution for his refusal or failure to volunteer. An employee may be required to perform overtime work beyond the above limits where necessary for delivery of an airplane which is on the field, for customer-requested emergency repair of delivered products, or for Government DX or Government DO rated orders.

ARTICLE 7 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE AND ARBITRATION
Section 7.1.	Establishment of Grievance and Arbitration Procedure
Grievances or complaints arising between the Company and its employees subject to this Agreement, or the Company and the Union, with respect to the interpretation or application of any of the terms of this Agreement, shall be settled according to the following procedure. Subject to the terms of this Article 7 relating to cases of dismissal or suspension for cause or of involuntary resignation, only matters dealing with the interpretation or application of terms of this Agreement shall be subject to this grievance machinery.
Section 7.2.	Employee Grievances
It is agreed that the Business Representative of the Union and the Company Labor Relations Representative may assist in any step of the grievance:
STEP 1. Oral Discussion. The employee first shall notify his supervisor of his grievance and then, if he so desires, shall discuss his grievance with the Steward or the Union In-Plant Representative, and if the Steward or the In-Plant Representative considers the grievance to be valid, then the employee and the Steward or In-Plant Representative will contact the employee's supervisor and will attempt to effect a settlement of the

complaint. This procedure, however, will not prevent an employee from contacting his supervisor if he so chooses. If the purpose of the employee's contacting his supervisor is to adjust the grievance, the Steward or the In-Plant Representative shall be given an opportunity to be present and such adjustment shall be in conformity with this Agreement.
STEP 2. Grievance Reduced to Writing - Handling at Supervisory Level. If no settlement is reached in Step l, the InPlant Representative, if he considers the grievance to be valid, may at any time reduce to writing a statement of the grievance or complaint which shall contain the following:
a)	The facts upon which the grievance is based.
b)	Reference to the section or sections of the Agreement alleged to have been violated (this will not be applicable in cases of dismissal or suspension for cause or of involuntary resignation).
c)	The remedy sought.
The In-Plant Representative shall submit the written statement of grievance to the Supervisor or the next level of Management for reconsideration, with a copy to the designated representative of the Company. After such submission the Supervisor and the InPlant Representative may, within the next five (5) workdays (unless mutually extended), settle the written grievance and, over their signatures, indicate the disposition made thereof. Otherwise, promptly after the expiration of such five (5)-day period (or agreed extension thereof) the Supervisor and the InPlant Representative shall sign the grievance, with the Supervisor indicating the basis for denying the grievance, and their signatures will indicate that the grievance has been discussed and reconsidered by them and that no settlement has been reached.
STEP 3. Written Grievance; Handling at Business Representative-Company Representative Level.	If no
settlement is reached in Step 2, within the specified or agreed time limits, the Business Representative may at any time thereafter submit the grievance to the designated representative of the Company. After such submission the designated

representative of the Company and the Business Representative may, within the next ten (10) workdays (unless mutually extended), settle the grievance and, over their signatures, indicate the disposition made thereof. Otherwise, promptly after the expiration of such ten (10)-day period (or agreed extension thereof) the designated representative of the Company and the Business Representative shall sign the grievance, with the designated representative indicating the basis for denying the grievance, and their signatures will indicate that the grievance has been discussed and reconsidered by them and that no settlement has been reached.
STEP 4. Arbitration. If no settlement is reached in Step 3 within the specified or agreed time limits, then either party may in writing, within ten (10) workdays thereafter, request that the matter be submitted to an arbiter for a prompt hearing as hereinafter provided in Sections 7.6 to 7.9, inclusive.
Section 7.3.	Dismissals, Suspensions, Layoffs, Etc.
In cases of layoff, or of dismissal or suspension for cause, or of involuntary resignation, the employee shall be given a copy of the layoff, suspension or termination of service slip, as the case may be, if he is available to be presented with such copy. If he is not available, copies of the slip will be sent to the employee and to the Union office. The employee shall have the right to appeal the action shown on the slip providing the In-Plant Representative files a written grievance at Step 2 with the designated representative of the Company within seven (7) workdays after the date of layoff, dismissal, suspension for cause or involuntary resignation, or within seven (7) workdays after the date of the mailing of the copy of the slip, provided, however, that any dismissal or suspension of an employee who has committed a sex crime victimizing a child or children shall be deemed to be for cause and shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of this Article 7. The written grievance then may be processed through subsequent steps.
Section 7.4.	Union Versus Company and Company Versus Union Grievances
In the case of any grievance which the Union may have against the Company or the Company may have against the Union, the

A.	Statement of the grievance setting forth the facts upon which the grievance is based.
B.	Reference to the section or sections of the Agreement alleged to have been violated.
C.	The correction sought. The grievance shall be signed by the designated representative of the Union or the designated representative of the Company.

Within ten (10) workdays thereafter either party may in writing request that the matter be submitted to an arbiter for a prompt hearing as hereinafter provided in Sections 7.6 to 7.9, inclusive.
Section 7.5.	Retroactive Compensation
Grievance claims involving retroactive compensation shall be limited to thirty (30) calendar days prior to the written submission of the grievance to Company representatives, provided, however, that this thirty (30)-day limitation may be waived by mutual consent of the parties.
Section 7.6.	Selection of Arbiter - By Agreement
In regard to each case reaching Step 4, the parties will attempt to agree on an arbiter to hear and decide the particular case. If the parties are unable to agree to an arbiter within ten (10) workdays after submission of the written request for arbitration, the provisions of Section 7.7 Selection of Arbiter - From Arbitration Panel shall apply to the selection of an arbiter.

Section 7.7.	Selection of Arbiter - From Arbitration Panel
Immediately following execution of this Agreement the parties will proceed to compile a list and agree upon one (1) permanent panel of arbiters, for life of the agreement. Each panel shall be comprised of five (5) arbiters and, insofar as practicable, the arbiters on each panel shall be located in the general vicinity of the location identified with the title of their panel. If a case reaches Step 4, and the parties are unable to agree to an arbiter within the time limit specified in Section 7.6, the case shall be heard and settled by an arbiter on the panel geographically identified with the grievance, if available. An available arbiter is one who is available to conduct a hearing within sixty (60) days (unless mutually extended) after expiration of the time limit specified in Section 7.6. Assignment of cases to arbiters on each panel shall be rotated in the alphabetical order of the last names of those available on the panel.
Section 7.8.	Procedure Where Permanent Panel Arbiter Not Available
In the event, as to any case, that there is no available arbiter on the applicable Permanent Panel, the parties shall jointly request the American Arbitration Association to submit a panel of seven (7) arbiters. Such request shall state the general nature of the case and ask that the nominees be qualified to handle the type of cases involved. When notification of the names of the panel of seven (7) arbiters is received, the parties in turn shall have the right to strike a name from the panel until only one (1) name remains. The remaining person shall be the arbiter. The right to strike the first name from the panel shall be determined by lot.
Section 7.9.	Arbitration - Rules of Procedure
Arbitration pursuant to Step 4 shall be conducted in accordance with the following:
A.	The arbiter shall hear and accept pertinent evidence submitted by both parties and shall be empowered to request such data as he deems pertinent to the grievance and shall render a decision in writing to both parties within fifteen (15) days (unless mutually extended) of the completion of the hearing.
B.	The arbiter shall be authorized to rule and issue a decision in writing on the issue presented for arbitration, which decision shall be final and binding on both parties.

When the Business Representative again is available to perform his duties under this Article 7, he shall promptly notify the Company representative of the fact and such notice will terminate the period during which the designee is authorized to act.
Section 7.14.	Signing Grievance Does Not Concede Arbitrable Issue
The signing of any grievance by any employee or representative either of the Company or of the Union shall not be construed by either party as a concession or agreement that the grievance constitutes an arbitrable issue, that other claims or defenses may not be raised, or that the grievance is properly subject to the grievance machinery under the terms of this Article 7.
Section 7.15.	Union Jurisdictional Claims

C.	If the parties are unable to agree upon the question that is to be submitted to the arbiter for decision, the question to be submitted to, and answered by, the arbiter shall be: "On the basis of the evidence, information, and arguments submitted by the parties in reference to the Union's contention in this case, is the Company violating Article 1, Section 1.1.?"
D.	The arbiter shall answer the question submitted to him under Section 7.15(c) or the agreed statement of the issue presented by both parties.	The arbiter's answer shall either be in the
affirmative or the negative. The arbiter shall confine the proceedings before him to the questions presented to him in accordance with this Section 7.15 and he shall not have authority to specify any change in a job or any change in the work assignments under a job or the creation of a new job or any other remedy or type of award.
E. If the arbiter's answer sustains the Union's contention, the Company shall, within thirty (30) days (or any longer period to which the parties may mutually agree) after receiving the arbiter's decision, take whatever corrective action is necessary to eliminate the basis for the Union's jurisdictional claim in the particular case.
Any resolution of any claim or controversy under Section 1.1, whether by mutual agreement or by arbitration, that requires corrective action on the part of the Company shall be prospective in effect from the date of the corrective action taken by the Company.

at any time are earned and unused shall be referred to as the employee's Sick Leave Credit.
All hours credited on an employee's first eligibility date and as earned during each succeeding year of service, in excess of the number of hours to be allocated to the employee's Sick Leave Credit as aforesaid, shall be referred to as the employee's Vacation Credit.
B.	Use of Vacation Credit as Vacation With Pay or Sick Leave.
Between eligibility dates, an employee shall use his unused Vacation Credit accumulated in the twelve (12)-month period preceding his last eligibility date as vacation with pay at the rate in effect for each day of the vacation period, including shift differential, if applicable, subject to the following conditions:
1.	He shall request vacation dates on forms provided by the Company and the Company will endeavor to schedule his vacation as requested. Generally, Vacation Credit will be used in units of eight (8) hours; however, Credit may be used in one tenth (.10) increments to cover partial days of absence, subject to advance approval by the employee's supervisor.
2.	In instances where Company management believes the awarding of vacations as requested would interfere seriously with production requirements, the scheduling of vacations shall be as near to the dates requested as possible.
3.	In scheduling vacations, the Company will attempt to meet its production requirements by use of employees on a voluntary basis and, failing in this, the seniors will be given their preference of available vacation dates when request is made thirty (30) or more days prior to the vacation dates requested to the extent established vacation schedules will permit.
4.	In the event an employee is temporarily laid off as provided in Section 16.4 or is on approved leave of absence, he may elect to take his vacation with pay, to the extent of his eligibility, during such layoff or leave.
5.	If an employee's Sick	Leave	Credit is exhausted,
management may approve on a	case-by-case basis an
employee's request to use Vacation Credit as sick leave for legitimate reasons for absence under the same conditions as set forth in Subparagraph 11.4(C)(1). Such approval will not

be unreasonably denied; however, requests will not normally be approved if the employee is then under a Disciplinary Memo for attendance.
C.	Use of Sick Leave Credit as Sick Leave. Sick Leave Credit may be used as follows:
1.	General.
Between eligibility dates, an employee, including an employee on a leave of absence, may, at his option, use any part or all of his Sick Leave Credit as sick leave providing: (A) the employee is partially or wholly incapacitated by actual illness or injury on the days taken as sick leave, (B) an illness in the employee's immediate family requires the employee's presence or (C) the employee has a medical or dental appointment which can be scheduled only during working hours. The employee shall be paid for absence charged to sick leave and shall not be penalized for such absence providing the nature of the absence and anticipated length of absence is reported to his organization on the first day of such absence, or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible. As to possible rights after exhaustion of Sick Leave Credit, see Section 11.4(B.5).
2.	Prior to First Eligibility Date.
Prior to his first eligibility date an employee may use in accordance with Subparagraph 11.4.A., accumulated Sick Leave Credits anticipated to be allocated on his first eligibility date. Use of such credits will be considered to be an advance from the employees' Sick Leave Credits due on his first eligibility date and will reduce such allocation accordingly. Should the employee terminate for any reason other than layoff prior to completion of his first year of service, sick leave payment made to the employee may be deducted from the employee's final paycheck and any remaining amounts will be due the Company.
D.	Unused Vacation Credit.
It is the intent of the parties that employees shall be required to use Vacation Credit as vacation. However, where an employee does not use all or part of such Vacation Credit as vacation with pay during the year between vacation eligibility dates, the unused balance of vacation will be rolled over on the employee‘s next eligibility date, unless ten (10) or more working

days before the employee‘s eligibility date, the employee requests in writing to be paid for any unused Vacation Credit. Vacation credits so carried over must be used during the next eligibility year. If not used within the following eligibility year, the employee will be paid for the unused Vacation Credit at his next eligibility date. All payments in lieu of vacations shall be made at the employee‘s rate in effect on the employee‘s current vacation eligibility date, including shift differential where applicable.
E.	Unused Sick Leave Credit.
An employee who, on any eligibility date, has more than forty (40) unused hours in his Sick Leave Credit, less the number of leave without pay hours taken during the eligibility year, will receive pay-in-lieu of those hours over forty (40) in accordance with the following table:
Hours of Unused Sick Leave	Percentage Payment
Credit in Excess of 40	
(Less Leave Without Pay Hours)	
40 hours	160%
36 to 40 hours	150%
32 to 36 hours	140%
28 to 32 hours	130%
24 to 28 hours	120%
20 to 24 hours	110%
less than 20	100%
Such payments shall be made at the employee's rate in effect on that eligibility date, including shift differential where applicable. Notwithstanding the above, there will be no deduction for leave without pay hours taken for the following reasons: departure from work for Union business pursuant to Section 3.7; temporary layoff pursuant to Section 16.4; or emergency plant closure.
F.	Effect of Termination.
Upon termination of an employee's employment for any reason on or after any eligibility date, such employee shall receive pay in lieu of his hours of Vacation Credit and Sick Leave Credit earned and unused up to and including the effective date of his termination of employment. For the purposes of this Section 11.4(F) only, an employee shall be deemed to have terminated

on or after his first eligibility date if he worked on his last scheduled workday prior to that eligibility date.
G.	Effect of Military Service on Credit.
Any employee who leaves to enter military service shall receive pay in lieu of his hours of Vacation Credit and Sick Leave Credit earned and unused up to the effective date of termination irrespective of whether he has been employed until his eligibility date. Such payment will be made when the employee furnishes proof, satisfactory to the Company, of his entry into military service within sixty (60) days after termination and without intervening employment elsewhere.
H.	Effect of Layoff on Credit.
Any employee who is laid off (on other than a temporary layoff of twenty-one (21) calendar days or less) shall receive pay in lieu of all of his hours of Vacation Credit and Sick Leave Credit earned and unused up to the effective date of layoff irrespective of whether he has been employed until his eligibility date. Employees temporarily laid off shall not receive pay in lieu of unused Credit.
I.	Use of Credit in Lieu of Working Short Workweek.
In the event the Company deems it advisable to work an employee on a short workweek as provided in Article 6, Section 6.1(B) the employee may:
1.	elect against working the short workweek in which case he may apply for and use his unused Credit accumulated in the twelve (12)-month period preceding his last eligibility date (to the extent that it is not allocated or required to be allocated to his Sick Leave Credit) as time off with pay at the rate in effect on the day(s) such credit is used, including shift differential if applicable, or
2.	elect to work the short workweek and apply for and use such unused Credit as time off with pay for the regular workdays that are not worked in the short workweek, or
3.	elect layoff, in which case the provisions of Section 11.4(H) above shall apply.

Coordinated Care (Core) Plan (CCP)
You must choose a primary care physician (PCP) who will coordinate your care and refer you to specialist when necessary. Benefits are higher when you obtain care from a CCP network provider. Generally network coverage is provided at 100% after a copay and 60% after the deductible when you do not use a network provider. You will pay a lower office visit copay when you use high performing providers.
Coverage Level	Network Deductible	Out-of- Network Deductible	Network Out-ofPocket Maximum (excluding deductible)	Out-of-Network Out-of-Pocket Maximum (excluding deductible)
Employee	None	$600	None	$1,500

Employee + Child (ren)	None	$1,200	None	$2,250
Family	None	$1,800	None	$3,000

1
2	Consumer Directed (Enhanced) Health Plan (CDHP)
3	Under this plan, you will manage your care and how your health
4	care dollars are spent. You may use any provider to receive care but
5	will receive higher benefits (90%) when you use a network provider
6	than when you use an out-of-network provider (60%). The
7	Company will make a contribution to a Personal Care Account (PCA)
8	ranging from $500 to $1,500 depending on your coverage level.
9	Unused funds will be carried over to the next year. This plan has a
10	network deductible and an out-of-pocket maximum, whereas the
11	other plan does not. See below:___________________________________

Section 13.6.	Joint Committee on Health Care Costs & Quality The Company and the Union are committed to ensuring that employees have access to cost effective, quality health care coverage.

When appropriate, health care experts and representatives from the Company's health plans will be invited to attend Committee meetings. Each party may have their benefits consultants and advisors attend Committee meetings. The Committee will meet at least twice each year to discuss issues related to the health care program. The Committee also will meet with health care providers to express the parties' interest in obtaining quality health care at affordable prices. Among the topics that the parties will consider and discuss are:
•	Costs under the Company’s medical plans.
•	Overall plan design.
•	Efficient use of health care resources by consumers.
•	Cost management programs to address specific cost areas, including:
•	Disease management of selected high-cost chronic diseases.
•	Targeted health risk assessment.
•	Catastrophic case management.
•	Pharmaceutical management.
•	Measurement tools for evaluating health plans‘ and providers‘ efficiency, including but not limited to programs of the National Academy of Sciences and National Quality Forum as well as accreditation from nationally recognized groups such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) or the Foundation for Accountability (FACCT).
•	Benchmark data from other employers.
•	Opportunities to work with other employers, unions or other parties interested in obtaining quality health care at affordable prices.

The Company and the Union also will undertake initiatives to expand health care plan accountability for quality. Among these initiatives will be:
•	Provider performance reporting on quality and efficiency to encourage use of the highest quality providers, including those who meet the highest patient safety standards.
•	Provider programs focused on specific high-yield quality innovations shown to substantially improve patient safety.
•	Computerized physician order entry. Physicians will be required to enter prescriptions into a hospital database to screen for inappropriate medications and dosages and avoid potential adverse drug reactions/interactions.
•	Evidence-based hospital referral. Physicians will be required, where practical, to guide patients to facilities with superior outcomes (linked to significantly lower patient mortality).
•	ICU physician staffing. Where available, physicians who are critical care specialists will provide ICU care.
To encourage plan participants to use the highest quality health care available, it is the intent that the Company will provide education to employees regarding the effectiveness of physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as it becomes available. In recognition that reliable provider performance data is currently not collected and available, the Company will update the Committee from time to time on its progress in obtaining and sharing such data.
The Company and the Union are committed through these and other initiatives to improve quality and maintain reasonable costs, and they will recognize and endorse contracting decisions with physicians, hospitals and health plans based on compliance with these joint initiatives.

Section 14.6.	Subcontracting
Anything in this Section 14.6 to the contrary notwithstanding, it is agreed that under and included within the meaning of Article 4 of this Agreement that the Company has the right to subcontract and offload work, to make and carry out decisions, and to designate the work to be performed by the Company and the places where it is to be performed.
A.	The Company and Union agree that an increasingly productive workforce is critical to the continued success of the enterprise and that domestic and international sales represent opportunities for employment growth and stability. The parties also recognize that a variety of business factors, including the Company‘s ability to secure sales, may require offsets as part of such transactions.	Given these conditions, and in
acknowledgement of Company and Union concerns regarding employment stability, the parties agree to meet periodically to discuss offsets and the impact of subcontracting on bargaining unit jobs. Recognizing the value of open communications to the partnering relationship between the Company and the Union, the Senior Operations Management will meet as needed but no less frequently than quarterly with the Union In-Plant Representatives to discuss any sourcing decisions that could impact bargaining unit jobs.
B.	With respect to the subcontracting of work currently performed by bargaining unit employees, the parties recognize that from time to time such subcontracting may be necessary. To enable the Union to suggest competitive alternatives which might allow the retention of work within the bargaining unit, the Company will, at least sixty (60) days prior to signing any agreement to subcontract work currently being performed by bargaining unit employees, provide notice to the Union of its plans to subcontract work which would directly result in the displacement of twenty-five (25) or more bargaining unit positions. The Company will provide information related to the potential subcontracting other

than information it considers to be confidential, proprietary or subject to nondisclosure provisions.
C.	The parties recognize that some subcontracting decisions cannot be disclosed with the sixty (60) day period referred to above, due to confidentiality concerns. In such circumstances, the Company will provide the Union as much notice as practicable.
D.	Following notice of specific plans to subcontract work currently performed by the bargaining unit that would displace twenty-five (25) or more bargaining unit employees, the parties shall, upon the request of the Union, meet and discuss the impact on the bargaining unit. The Company agrees to consider any proposal the Union might make which would result in a less costly way to retain such work in the bargaining unit. The Union must present any such proposals within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the Company‘s plans. The parties will meet periodically to review the implementation of any such union proposals accepted by the Company. Should the Union‘s projected savings not be realized within any ninety (90) day review period during implementation, the Company will have the right to subcontract the work.

JOB SECURITY, JOINT PARTNERSHIP AND SPECIFIC SUBJECT MATTER COMMITTEES,
WORKPLACE STEWARD-MANAGER PARTNERSHIP, SUCCESSORSHIP
Section 17.1.	Job Security
The Union and the Company understand and agree that they have a strong and mutual interest in the long-term financial success and growth of the Company‘s Wichita operations. An essential component of that success and growth is the maintenance of a strong, highly skilled, and sustainable workforce in Wichita consistent with the Company‘s need to remain viable and cost competitive over the long term in the global aerospace industry. To this end, the Union and the Company commit as follows:
1.	The Company agrees that the Union is entitled to strategic briefing on an ongoing basis in order to ensure that the Union has sufficient advance information on all subjects necessary to fulfilling its role in maintaining and, to the extent possible, advancing workforce levels in Wichita. To this end, promptly after each quarterly meeting of the Company‘s Board of Directors and the quarterly analyst call, members of the Company‘s Senior Executive Team shall meet with the Union‘s International and	District Lodge team	to discuss	the
Company’s current_ condition, projections, and plans. These meetings will be strategic in nature and will cover, but not be limited to: the Company‘s evolving plans for Wichita, competitive pressures and opportunities, long-term strategic sourcing, new programs and resulting work statements, hiring plans, and expected or possible contingency plans or other mitigating actions to manage variations in production and customer requirements. The Union may request other meetings as necessary.
2.	The Company agrees to maintain Major Manufacturing Operations in Wichita for the life of this Agreement and therefore maintain jobs in Wichita. Major programs being produced in the Wichita Plant by IAM bargaining unit

members will continue to be performed by IAM bargaining unit members unless as provided herein:
a.	The Union and the Company understand that the scale of the Company‘s operations may require a program or portion of a program to be shifted out of Wichita in order to make room for a new or expanded program.
b.	In making program decisions, the Company‘s intent over the long term will be to maintain and, if possible, expand the workforce in Wichita. If, during the term of this Agreement, the Company begins to consider options for selling or outsourcing a major work statement being produced at that time in the Wichita plant by IAM bargaining unit members, or to establish a next generation program line outside of the bargaining unit for any program line produced at that time in the Wichita plant by IAM bargaining unit members, the Company agrees to inform the Union.	In such a
circumstance, the Company will work cooperatively with the Union to consider options for maintaining workforce levels in Wichita. If the Company comes to the conclusion that outsourcing is necessary, the Union will have the opportunity to present an alternative business case, to which the Company agrees to give full consideration in good faith. In evaluating the Union‘s alternative, it is agreed between the Company and the Union that the Company will consider the maintenance of a strong, highly skilled workforce in Wichita, consistent with the intent of this Article 17, to be an important factor and an important Company priority.
c.	Throughout the processes described in the paragraph, the Company and the Union recognize that the Joint Partnership Committee may play a valuable role.
3.	In order to ensure that the IAM bargaining unit in Wichita has the maximum potential for growth, the Company agrees to offer such training as may be necessary or appropriate in order for bargaining unit members to have the skills and skill sets that will enable them to keep pace with the Company‘s program requirements and plans.

4.	During the term of this Agreement, if it appears that the Company will be faced with fluctuations in customer demand that could impact the amount of work available to the bargaining unit, the Company agrees that it will notify the Union promptly and engage in good faith in a process of considering all fiscally reasonable alternatives to layoffs. Such alternatives may include, but not be limited to, temporary furloughs, alternative work schedules, additional training, insourcing, and short workweeks. The Company and the Union recognize that the Joint Partnership Committee may play a valuable role in this process.
Section 17.2.	Joint Partnership and Specific Subject Matter Committees
To help ensure future success the Company and the Union agree to establish a Joint Partnership Committee (JPC) and Specific Subject Matter Committees to support the intention of this contract and jointly address mutually agreed upon topics to further the health of the Company and keep the team for the future intact.
The parties intend the JPC to form the basis for honest and meaningful dialogue between the parties, and to promote a positive relationship that will ensure the parties‘ mutual desire to establish and maintain effective working relationships and a work environment that will facilitate improved productivity and competitiveness.
1.	The Company and the Union shall each select a maximum of three (3) suitably qualified individuals to participate in the JPC. The Company and Union may need support from other specialized subject matter experts and in such case, both parties will agree to the attendance of and disclosure of information to subject matter experts prior to the meeting.

3.	The JPC will make recommendations on targets and other matters relating to the Gain Sharing Program and will discuss the targets and goals established by the Board of Directors for the annual Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP).
4.	The JPC will meet monthly, or as required, to monitor and discuss outstanding grievances with a view to speedy resolution. The JPC will overview and monitor Steward and Manager training on complaint and grievance resolution.
5.	Where feasible, the Company‘s intention is to use temporary IAM employees as a buffer to protect against short-term hiring challenges and to give some protection during economically challenging times. The Company will discuss sourcing temporary employees and their terms and conditions with the IAM through the JPC with a view to using the IAM as a referral or job house and will agree with the IAM through the JPC, the duration of the said temporary assignment. If the Company hires any of said temporary employees, temporary assignment time will count towards probationary period. It is not the Company‘s intention to use temporary employees to replace or erode the work performed by IAM bargaining unit employees. The use of temporary employees will be restricted to meeting short-term hiring and economic challenges. Temporary assignments will last no longer than 90 days, unless expressly agreed by the JPC.
6.	During times of economic uncertainty, the Company intends to explore, and will discuss with the JPC, as needs arise, all fiscally reasonable alternatives to layoffs, including temporary furloughs, alternative work schedules, release of temporary employees, additional training, in-sourcing and short workweeks. Additionally, the Company will evaluate any other recommendations from the JPC.

1.	The Company and the Union agree to work to establish an ongoing robust communication process throughout all levels of management that provides timely and informative information to members of the bargaining unit. The parties will strive to

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING # 4
EXCEPTION REQUEST TO SHIFT PREFERENCE, SECTION 6.6
Temporary Shift Deviation
Implemented October 6,	2008
•	We have language in our collective bargaining agreement to allow for deviations to shift preference in order to meet business needs Section 6.6 Shift Preference.
•	As stated, shift preferences as defined will not apply in instances where the exercise of such rights would affect the efficiency of Company operations in any organization on any shift. When such instances arise, it shall be the responsibility of the organization’s designated executive or delegate.	Exception requests shall be discussed with the Union
(Stewards) on	both shifts prior to	submittal	to the organization’s senior
Human Resources executive or designee for final approval. When senior employees	are	displaced from their shift or	preference during a staffing
exercise, the displaced employee shall be given, in writing, a date of return to the preferred shift he was on.
i It is in all parties’ best interests to follow a common process, including timely notifications and documentation to the Union and Labor Relations.
Definition
•	An Exception Request of Shift Preference is a request made by the Company to	deviate from the normal shift	preference process	for a temporary basis
to	avoid affecting	efficiency of	daily operations.
•	Example: Training, Schedule Recovery, Customer Requirements
•	An Exception Request form is filed to track this process
• Management must provide, in writing, a specific reason for the temporary assignment, including skills required and why employee chosen meets those requirements.
•	When a senior employee is displaced, they must be given, in writing, a date of return
Page 125
Guidelines for Managers
•	Temporary shift exception requests should not be utilized when the requirement can be met by the normal shift preference process or by use of reverse seniority
•	A plan should be in place to avoid having to repeat this process multiple times in the same area
•	If the temporary situation will become permanent or repetitive, every effort should be made to utilize the normal shift preference process
•	REMEMBER THIS PROCESS IS IN PLACE FOR EXCEPTIONS ON A TEMPORARY BASIS
Process
•	Manager	discusses	situation	of proposed exception with Steward to	explain
the business need/reason
•	Manager	retrieves	Exception	Request electronic form from website
•	Manager completes the form (obtains Steward acknowledgment) and sends form electronically to Labor Relations for approval/denial
•	Completed forms should be received in Labor Relations at least five (5) working days in advance of shift movement
•	As a general rule, forms will not be accepted "after-the-fact"
•	Once received Labor will forward copy to authorized Union Representative
•	If approved, Labor Relations notifies Management so they can change employee schedule, notifies receiving manager, etc., and forwards appropriate information to HRSC
•	If denied, Labor Relations will contact Management for discussion
