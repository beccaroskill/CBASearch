Delinquency and Collection Procedure
A.	The Trustees of the Trust Fund shall furnish the Contractor Associations and the Union with a list of delinquent
contractors each month. Such list will also be available to all signatory contractors on request, subject to such reasonable cost as may be determined by the administrative office of the Trust Funds as representing the cost of duplication and transmission of such lists, payment for which to be made in advance. The Contractor agrees he will not subcontract anyportion of his job to any subcontractor whose name appears on the delinquent list until such subcontractor has paid all delinquent monies to the various Trust Funds. In the event the Contractor subcontracts to any such delinquent subcontractor in violation of the foregoing, the Contractor shall remove such subcontractor from the job immediately, unless such delinquent subcontractor immediately makes full payment for all delinquencies to the Trusts.
B.	If the Contractor fails to remove the delinquent subcontractor, the Contractor shall become financially respon-
sible for all fringe benefits owed to any funds established by this Agreement by the Contractor or by his subcontractor or the subcontractor of his subcontractor for work performed on the Contractor’s job or project in accordance with the requirements set forth below.
C.	The term “Contractor’’ for delinquency purposes only, shall include all entities of the delinquent contractor, change of name, or change of entity, provided that the delinquent contractor holds at least ten (10%) percent ownership in the new entity.
D.	In the event the Contractor subcontracts to a subcontractor that is not on the delinquency list at the time the subcontract is entered into, the Trust Office shall notify the Contractor of any delinquency of the subcontractor within ninety (90) days of the date the delinquency first occurred and in no case shall the Contractor be liable for fringe benefit contributions of a subcontractor for more than ninety (90) days prior to the date the Trust Office notice is sent to the Contractor.
E.	Where a Contractor contracts with a listed delinquent subcontractor or subcontractors, and the Contractor
fails to terminate the subcontract of such delinquent subcontractor, or subcontractors, the contractor shall become financially responsible for the liability of the delinquent subcontractor’s fringe benefits on that job from the commencement of the work under the subcontract to the date of termination of that subcontract.
F.	The Trust Office shall send delinquency notices to Contractors whose contributions are not paid as required.

I.	All employees shall be covered by this Agreement and the provisions applicable to Trust Funds.

Quarterly State Tax returns and cash disbursement ledgers, all canceled checks, check registers and invoices. If requested by the Trusts, the Contractor shall provide payroll breakdown by job when a lawsuit has been filed against a contractor. The Trustees may file suit to enforce this obligation, and, if successful, shall recovertheir attorneys fees and costs, whether or not tbeaudit reveals a delinquency. Any Contractor delinquent under this Article maybe required by the Trust Funds to submit, in addition to regular reports, payroll breakdowns by job, and the failure to submit timely job breakdowns shall he considered a delinquency under this Article. If a Contractor refuses to furnish the foregoing the Union may take economic action.
J.	It is recognized that a delinquency in contributions causes damages beyond the value of the unpaid contributions, which are difficult to quantify. These damages include, hut are not limited to, the administrative costs of processing and collect! ng delinquencies, the costs of adjusting benefit credits and notifying partici pants, the additional burden placed on Contractors who faithfully pay their contributions, and the burden upon participants and beneficiaries who maybe unable to qualify for benefits they may have otherwise been entitled to but for the delinquency of the Contractor. Because these damages are difficult, if not impossible, to quantify on a case-by-case basis, the parties agree that liquidated damages, not a penalty, for such losses shall be set at the greater of $25or 20% of the contributions late or unpaid for each Trust Fund. The parties have reviewed the costs of collection by the Trust Funds, and agree that 20% liquidated damages is an accurate projection of the Trusts’ damages that result from a delinquency In addition, any Contractor delinquent in its obligations under this Article shall be required to pay interest on the delinquent contributions (at a rate to be set by the Trustees of the Trust Funds), and any audit fees. In the event that litigation is necessary to collect any delinquent contributions (including litigation to enforce mechanic liens, stop notices, bond claims or similar remedies, and any bankruptcy or receivership proceedings) or to enforce any obligation under this Article, in addition to liquidated damages owed by the delinquent Contractor, the Contractor shall also be liable for all reasonable attorney fees and legal costs incurred in such litigation. The Trustees of the Trust Funds may waive or reduce the amount of liquidated damages, at their sole discretion and consistent with their fiduciary duties. The decision of the Trustees in any request to waive or reduce liquidated damages shall be final and binding upon the parties.
K.	For the purposes of this Agreement, delinquency in failure to make the required reports and contributions to the
Trust Fund as determined by the Trustees, shall consist of the following:
(a)	Fhilure to submit trust report forms.
(b)	Fhilure to report on all employees.
(c)	Failure to make the payments as required on time.
(d)	Failure to pay audit amounts and audit fees and other costs and damages as determined by the Tnist.
(e)	Fhilureof the bank to honor checks submitted.
(f)	Fhilure to pay monies due.
(g)	Failure to submit to an audit.
L.	In addition to any other remedies under this Article, the Union may terminate the participation of a delinquent
contractor. Notice of such termination shall be sent to the Contractor, and each of the employees listed on the last report submitted by that Contractor, and shall be effective 30 days from such notice. Upon termination, no employee of the delinquent Contractor shall accrue credit for any benefits for hours worked for that Contractor. However, termination shall not end or alter the obligations of the Contractor (or any Contractor subcontracting to that Contractor) under this Article. In addition to any other damages under this Article, a Contractor so

Appendix A
Residential Work
The provisions of the Master Labor Agreement apply except as modified by this Appendix A.
A.	Definition:
1.	Residential work is defined as all Laborers’ work on wood or metal frame construction of single family residences, apartments and condominiums. This residential work shall not include projects that exceed three stories over a garage level; any utility work, such as telephone, gas, water, sewer, and other utilities: or any work outside property lines, including curbs, gutters, and sidewalks.
2.	This residential work shall include all rough gradingwork at the job site behind theexistingpublic right-of-way, at the time of commencement of said work. It shall not include any fine grading work, utility work, or paving work in the future street and public right-of-way.
B.	Application: The Contractor may pay to its employees the rate for residential work, but only on residential work. Any work that is not residential work or is excluded from residential work as defined in paragraph A, shall be paid at the construction rate.
C.	Enforcement: For purposes of this Appendix A and not withstanding any other steps in the grievance procedure of this Agreement a claimed violation of this Article shall be handled in the following manner:
1.	Within twenty-four (24) hours of a request by the Union to the Contractor and to the Associations, a representative of the Union and a representative of the Associations shall meet on the job and review with the Contractor the work in question or the contractor’s bid. or both, to determine whether the Contractor has bid the job ora portion of the job, or has permitted any work to be performed on the job under residential rates where the work in question was not residential. If the Contractor refuses to participate or to furnish its bid, it shall be presumed that a deliberate, major violation of this article occurred.
2.	If the Union and Association representatives find a violation of this Article, or less than construction rates were paid at a time when the Contractor did not have an Agreement with the Union to pay less than construction rates, the representatives shall issue a written award in the following language:
“(Name of Contractor) is hereby found to be performing non-residential work, for which the Contractor has paid or proposes to pay residential rates. The remedy for this violation is an injunction against further work on the job known as (describe job) except at the construction overtime rate (as liquidated damages). This injunction shall be enforceable by a court injunction, and the plaintiff shall be entitled to its attorneys’ fees and cost."
The Union and the Association representatives shall thereafter examine the Contractor’s books and records and make an award of damages, with the overtime portion of the award being paid to the Union as its damages.
3.	If the Union and Association representatives find, or if it is found by any other arbitrator that the payment of less than construction rates by the Contractor for other than residential work was not inadvertent and minor, the Contractor shall lose the benefit of the residential rate of this Agreement for one year from the finding of a violation. The burden of showing that the violation was inadvertent and

minor is on the Contractor. If there is a finding of a second violation, the Contractor shall lose the benefit of the residential rate for the remainder of the Agreement.
4.	If the Union and Association representatives cannot agree, the dispute shall proceed through the normal
grievance procedure of this Agreement or the Short Form Agreement (whichever is applicable to the Contractor), and the award shall be as set forth in paragraph 2.
D.	If the Union finds that the enforcement of this clause is not succeeding, the Union may reopen the Agreement for
the purpose of amending this paragraph, and if no agreement is reached within 15 days on more stringent enforcement, the dispute shall be submitted to arbitration for the sole purpose of adopting language that is more stringent and easier to enforce.
E.	Transfer Provisions: The Contractor recognizes the desirability of employing workmen from the area in which the work is located and the Union recognizes that in the employ of the Contractor are laborers who are necessary to the efficient continuity of the Contractor’s operations. Therefore, the Contractor may transfer up to four (4) Laborers and one (1) foreman from area to area. After the transfer of no more than four (4) Laborers and one (1) foreman, the Contractor must hire the next two (2) Laborers from the Local Union hiring hall in the geographical area in which the work is performed. Thereafter the Contractor may transfer one (1) additional Laborer for each Laborer hired from the Local Union hiring hall in whose jurisdiction the work is performed. The Employer shall keep this 50-50 ratio intact (one (1) local person and one (1) person from outside the area) in employing, laying off and terminating Laborers. Only employees who have been employed by the Contractor for at least three hundred (300) hours in the last six (6) months may be transferred from one area to another area. The Contractor must properly clear all employees, including foreman and Key employees, with a dispatch slip from the Local Union having geographical jurisdiction over the project prior to those employees beginning work. The Union will not unreasonably withhold issuing a clearance. Fbr the transfer of additional Laborers, the Contractor shall first contact the office of the appropriate Local Union in the area where the work is to be performed. The above additional transfers shall only be made by mutual consent.
