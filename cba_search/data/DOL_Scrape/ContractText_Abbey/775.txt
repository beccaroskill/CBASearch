The following example is provided to illustrate exemptions under Section (l)(a)(i) of the Memorandum of Agreement.
Company A releases Album X containing ten tracks, to a Digital Download Vendor. Album X is downloaded 5,000 times. In addition:
• If Track 1, individually, is downloaded 2,500 times:
•	Accordingly, Track 1 ~ 7,500 total downloads of the track o 5,000 from Album X (“unbundled” for this calculation); and o 2,500 individual track.
•	Therefore 2,500 downloads of Track 1 remain before payment obligation for downloads of Track 1 commences.
• If Track 2, individually, is downloaded 7,500 times:
•	Accordingly, Track 2 = 12,500 total downloads of the track o 5,000 from Album X (“unbundled” for this calculation); and o 7,500 individual track.
•	Therefore Company could take exclusion on 10,000 downloads of Track 2 and must pay on 2,500 downloads of Track 2 in excess of the threshold, as well as all future downloads of Track 2, as set forth in Sections (ii) and (iii) below.
•	If Track 3, individually, is not downloaded at all, but it is included on “best of Y” compilation album released at a later date, which album is downloaded 2,500 times:
•	Accordingly, Track 3 = 7,500 total downloads of the track
o 5,000 from Album X (“unbundled” for this calculation); and
o 2,500 from “best of Y” album (“unbundled” for this calculation).
•	Therefore 2,500 downloads of Track 3 remain before payment obligation on Track 3 commences.
• If Track 4, individually, is downloaded 5,000 times, and “best of Y” compilation album is downloaded 2,500 times:
•	Accordingly, Track 4 = 12,500 total downloads of the track:
o 5,000 from Album X (“unbundled” for this calculation); and o 5,000 individual track downloads; and
o 2,500 from “best of Y” compilation album (“unbundled” for this calculation).
•	Therefore Company could take exclusion on 10,000 downloads of Track 4 and must pay on 2,500 downloads of Track 4 in excess of the threshold, as well as all future downloads of Track 4, as set forth in Sections (ii) and (iii) below.
This example is intended to illustrate that the 10,000 download exclusion threshold is calculated taking into account all formats from which any track was downloaded.

If during the term hereof, the Federation shall enter into an agreement with any phonograph record company upon terms more favorable than or different from those contained in this agreement, the Company shall have the right at its option to cause this agreement to be conformed therewith, provided, however, that no such right shall come into being by reason of the compromise of any claim against any recording Company by reason of the insolvency, bankruptcy, or other financial difficulty of such Company.
18.	Payment for Music Recorded by Third Party
The Company shall not produce any phonograph record from recorded music acquired or taken from or licensed by any other person, firm or corporation, in the making of which there was utilized instrumental music recorded within the Domestic Area or by a person who, at the time of the recording, resided within the Domestic Area, unless the total cost to the person, firm or corporation which produced the recorded music with respect to the scale of wages and fringe benefits paid to the musicians was at least equal to what the cost would have been under the Sound Recording Labor Agreement of the Federation which was in effect at the time the recorded music was produced provided, however, that if such music was recorded outside the Domestic Area, no payment need be made pursuant to this paragraph if the music was acquired, taken or licensed before January 1, 1964.
The Company may satisfy its obligation under this paragraph by incorporating in an agreement under which it acquires the right to use recorded music, a representation and warranty by the seller or licensor (which the Company shall guarantee if the seller or licensor was not a party to a Sound Recording Labor Agreement with the Federation when the recording was made) that such recorded music does not come within the terms of this paragraph or that the requirements of this paragraph have been satisfied and a statement that such representation and warranty was included for the benefit of the Federation (among others) and may be enforced by the Federation or by such person or persons as it may designate. Upon request, a signed copy of such agreement shall be furnished to the Federation. No rights or privileges existing or accrued between January I, 1959 and January 31, 2002 shall be deemed waived by reason of the provisions of this paragraph (numbered “17” in some prior agreements).
3 Subject to ratification of the Basic Theatrical Motion Picture Agreement of 2002 and the Basic Television Film Agreement of2002, effective February 16, 2002 the Company is entitled to a 15% discount from the rates set forth in this Article 16 for soundtrack records that; (i) use 45 minutes or more of music originally recorded for the motion picture; (ii) utilize 80 or more musicians (excluding orchestrators and music preparation musicians) for whom payment is due under this Article 16; and (iii) meet the conditions of Ex. A(I)(K)(6)(c)(iii) below.

19.	Dubbing
Except as specifically provided in paragraphs 8, 9, 18 and 20, nothing contained in this agreement is intended to or shall be deemed to relate to the rendition of services or to dubbing in connection with the production of devices other than phonograph records as such devices are presently known.
20.	Use of a Phonograph Record in the Same Medium
The Company may use all of the contents of any master record for the production of a new phonograph record that in its entirety contains only the identical content of the record originally produced from such master record (or contains the identical content except that it (i) is re-mixed, mastered or re-mastered or (ii) includes a translation into a different language) and is intended to be used for the same purposes to which the record originally produced from such master record was principally devoted. In all other circumstances, except as specifically provided in this Agreement, if the Company uses a phonograph record produced under any Sound Recording Labor Agreement since January 1954 in another phonograph record, the Company shall pay to those musicians who rendered services in the recording of the phonograph record an amount equal to all payments (including, without limitation, pension contributions, but excluding health and welfare contributions) that would be required under the Sound Recording Labor Agreement that would apply if the phonograph record so used were an original recording.
21.	Use of a Phonograph Record in Other Mediums
If the Company uses a phonograph record produced under any Sound Recording Labor Agreement since January 1954 for a purpose not covered by this Agreement, the Company shall pay to those musicians who rendered services in the recording of the phonograph record an amount equal to all payments (including, without limitation, pension contributions, but excluding health and welfare contributions) that would be required under the AFM agreement that would then be effective if the recording were originally made for the purpose set forth under that agreement.
In order to effect such a "new use" of a phonograph record, the Company must first provide the Federation’s Sound Recording Labor Agreement Contracts Administrator with the identity of the records involved and the intended use of the product in the form set forth in Exhibit F to this Agreement.
22.	Assignment
(a)	This agreement shall be personal to the Company and shall not be transferable or assignable, by operation of law or otherwise, without the written consent of the Federation, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld.
(b)	Without the written consent of the Federation, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, the Company shall not transfer or assign any individual contract (or part thereof) for the performance of services by a person(s) covered by this agreement, or give another person control over such contract of such services. Provided, however, that consent by the Federation shall not be required if the person to whom such individual contract (or part thereof) is transferred or assigned or to whom such control is given: (1) is at the time of such transfer, or agrees to become a party to this agreement; or (2) will incur total labor costs (for wages and fringe benefits) with respect to the
7
SOUND RECORDING LABOR AGREEMENT
February 1, 2002 - January 31, 2005
services covered by such individual contract, which are at least equal to the total labor costs (for wages and fringe benefits) which would be incurred under the scale of wages and fringe benefits provided for under this agreement.
(c)	Nevertheless, if the provisions of paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 22 are violated, and services are thereafter performed by such individual s), the obligations and duties imposed by this agreement shall be binding upon the transferee or assignee with respect to such individual(s).
(d)	The obligations imposed by this agreement upon the Company, shall be binding upon the Company, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon such of its subsidiaries as are engaged in the production of phonograph records in the Domestic Area.
(e)	To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Federation, at its option, may, upon ninety (90) days written notice to both the transferee and transferor, terminate this agreement at any time after a transfer of any controlling interest in the Company.
23.	Sound Recording Special Payments Fund Agreement
The Company agrees to be bound by the Sound Recording Special Payments Fund Agreement (February 1, 2002 - January 31, 2005) and the Sound Recording Trust Agreement (February 1, 2002 - January 31, 2005) which are incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
24.	Transfers of Rights in a Phonograph Record
(a)	If the Company sells, assigns, leases, licenses or otherwise transfers title to or permission to use any phonograph record produced under any Sound Recording Labor Agreement since January 1954 for any purpose, the Company may obtain from such party an assumption agreement in the form set forth in (e) below.
(b)	Within sixty (60) days of each sale, assignment, lease, license or other transfer of title of any phonograph record produced under any Sound Recording Labor Agreement since January 1954, the Company shall provide the Federation's Sound Recording Labor Agreement Contracts Administrator, the Sound Recording Special Payments Fund and the Recording Industries Music Performance Trust Funds (collectively, the “Funds”) with the identity of the records involved, the intended use of the product, the date of transfer, and the name, address, telephone number and fax number of each such purchaser, assignee, lessee, licensee, or other transferee in the form set forth in Exhibit D to this Agreement (or a redacted licensing agreement to the extent that it includes the information set forth in Exhibit D), and with an executed copy of each assumption agreement entered into by the Company. An inadvertent failure on the part of the Company to comply with any of the provisions of this Article 24 shall in no event constitute a default by the Company hereunder or a breach of this Agreement, provided that such failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from the Federation or either Fund.
(c	) This Article 24 does not apply in the case of a transfer of phonograph records for the sole purpose of use in another phonograph record where no payment is due to either Fund because the phonograph record was recorded before 1964 or released more than ten years before the date of the transfer.

(7)	The minimum pay, per side musician, for a basic session (Column A or B), for a unit of regular overtime before the completion of six (6) hours of work (seven (7) hours in the case of a four hour session) in any day (Column C or E - 1M time) and for a unit of premium overtime after the completion of such six (6) or seven (7) hours of work in any day (Column D - double time), shall be as follows:
A B	C	D	E

(8)	The recording session will begin at the called time unless all musicians are not on stage, tuned and ready to play, in which case the session will officially begin when they are ready to play. This provision is not meant to delay the beginning of a session because a musician(s) is late to a session and shall not apply to the resumption of a session after a break, which is as always on Company time.
(9)	If a session runs over because of a technical problem beyond the producer’s control, such additional time may be paid for at straight time rates for the time actually involved provided that such runover will not be considered for the purpose of increasing the amount of finished recorded music that may be made pursuant to B(2) above.
(10)	Rehearsal Session to Rehearse Music Not Performed in Live Concert
The wages and working conditions for symphonic recordings are predicated upon the fact that the orchestra will usually have rehearsed numbers in its repertoire and therefore will need no rehearsals for recordings. The foregoing sentence shall not prohibit the recording in a studio session of material not previously performed in concert, provided that the following conditions shall apply to rehearsal sessions of such material: (1) the first such rehearsal is paid at the applicable locally negotiated rehearsal or service rate plus 50% of such rate, and any subsequent rehearsals are paid at the basic recording session rate: (2) the rehearsal does not take place on a regularly scheduled day off (as defined by local contract or custom); and (3) the length of the rehearsal, the break time, and any other working conditions shall be governed by the local contract.

SOUND RECORDING LABOR AGREEMENT
February 1, 2002 - January 31, 2005
(13)	Location Recordings
The following provisions apply to the recording of complete operas, symphonies, and similar works performed by opera and symphonic orchestras during regularly scheduled performances:
(a)	General
There is no limit on the number of performances of a work that may be recorded during a season. The orchestra shall be notified of the work to be recorded in advance of the recording and only that work may be recorded. The first recording session shall trigger a guarantee payment for one 3 hour session at the "basic session rate.” Upon release, the complete work shall be paid for at the “basic session rate” on the basis of one session hour for each 10 minutes of finished product (15 minutes in the case of operas) against which the guarantee payment may be credited. (For example, a 45 minute symphonic work equates to 4/2 hours, computed at straight time rates; a 25 minute work would be covered by the 3 hour guarantee.)
(b)	Inapplicable Symphonic Provisions
The provisions of paragraphs (4) and (12) hereof do not apply to recordings made under this paragraph (13).
(c)	Microphone Balancing
Balancing of microphones (without tape) will be permitted during ANY performances and rehearsals provided the rehearsal is not an extra service.
(d)	Recording “Patch" Sessions
A recording “patch” session shall be permitted for a location symphonic or operatic recording. Within ten minutes after the Concertmaster has left the stage, the Company shall advise the musicians whether a patch session shall take place and, if so, the proposed length of that patch session. In the event that a patch session is called, the musicians shall be guaranteed a minimum call of one half hour at overtime pay calculated at the “basic session rate”. If the patch session is called for and extends beyond one half-hour, the musicians shall receive overtime pay calculated at the “basic session rate” in fifteen-minute increments. A patch session shall begin no later than forty-five (45) minutes following the Concertmaster’s exit from the stage and shall not exceed two (2) hours. Any portion of a patch session that takes place after midnight shall be paid at double the “basic session rate” in fifteen-minute increments. A two (2) hour patch session shall be permitted to patch product that has been recorded on a prior date (not to add any new product) provided that the patch session does not take place on any regularly scheduled day off (i.e. a day off established by local contract or custom) and that the patch session takes place within fourteen (14) days of the original location recording.

SOUND RECORDING LABOR AGREEMENT
February 1, 2002 - January 31, 2005
(e)	Discs That Include More Than One Work
For discs with more than one work included on them, the following rules shall apply. These rules govern any currently pending disputes as well as apply to any prospective situations in which more than one work is involved. These rules shall apply irrespective of whether the works are recorded during the same concert program performance(s) or from different programs. It is the understanding and intent of the parties that administration of these provisions will not result in a payment to musicians of more money than is required by the existing provisions of the agreement, i.e., 1 hour of payment for each 10 minutes of finished product (15 minutes for opera).
(1)	In advance of the location recording, the record company shall identify in writing the works intended to be recorded and included in the final product. The Company may later change any work that has not been recorded without penalty, and it may also add additional material to the planned disc at a later date without penalty. The Company is responsible for any additional payments if the additional work changes the length of the final product in such a way that an additional payment would be due.
(2)	For the first such work recorded musicians shall receive a payment equivalent to 3 hours of session time, as it does in the case when a single work comprises the disc.
(3)	For each subsequent work recorded musicians shall receive a payment equivalent to 2 hours of session time, provided however that the maximum amount of the payment shall not exceed the payment that would be due under the location recording provisions of the Sound Recording Labor Agreement as determined by the length of the planned final disc (1 session hour for each 10 minutes of finished product - 15 minutes in the case of operas - with half-hour increments; thus, for example, a 55 minute disc would be equate to 5.5 hours computed at straight time rates). Once the maximum payment has been reached, no further payments are due the musicians for material recorded.
(4)	In the case of a recording which also includes material not performed by the orchestra, the musicians will be paid only for that amount of material which constitutes their performance on the disc.
(5)	Non-playing Members of the orchestra receive 2/3 of whatever payment is received by playing members. If they play in some pieces but not others, they receive a 3 hour payment for the first piece in which they play, a 2 hour payment for any subsequent piece in which they play, and 2/3 of the appropriate payment for any pieces in which they do not play. However, in no case shall they receive an amount greater than that due a member who played on the entire disc.
23
SOUND RECORDING LABOR AGREEMENT
February 1, 2002 - January 31, 2005
(6)	Extra players and substitutes who play in only some of the works involved are paid only for those works in which they perform. They are paid 3 hours for the first work in which they perform, and 2 hours for any additional work in which they perform. However, in no case shall they receive an amount greater than that due a member who played on the entire disc.
(14)	Opera
The following discounts from symphonic rates apply to the recording of operatic works by opera orchestras other than as provided in (13) above:
(a)	15% if 3, 4 or 5 sessions are called.
(b)	20% if 6 or more sessions are called.
(15)	Premiere Recordings
The following terms shall apply for premiere recordings of symphonic and operatic works written specifically for symphony or opera orchestras (but not music written as film soundtrack), by contemporary domestic composers. For the purpose of this provision “premiere” means repertoire previously unreleased on the commercial market at the time the commitment to record is made; and “contemporary” means a composer living in the second half of the 20th Century.
1.	A two hour symphonic or operatic recording session may be called if it is coupled with either a three or four hour session on the same day. Payment for such a two hour session shall be pro rata at the regular symphonic hourly rate.
2.	After the last performance and before a recording session, a rehearsal or rehearsals may be called, and the rates and terms for such rehearsals shall be governed by the orchestra’s collective bargaining agreement with the Local. No recording will take place at these rehearsals but this does not prohibit the balancing of microphones during the last rehearsal of each work. Requests for waivers on balancing of microphones at other performances and rehearsals will be considered by the Federation and approval will not be unreasonably withheld.
3.	A two hour recording “patch" session will be permitted for a location symphonic or operatic recording, with rates pro rata of the three or four hour session.

In the event that the Company fails to comply with the foregoing, the Company shall be required to compensate each musician at the rates provided for under the Video Promo Supplement section of the applicable Sound Recording Labor Agreement. The Company will provide 24 hours’ advance wTitten notice (fax, e.g.) to the Federation and will deliver to the Federation two copies of the final EPK within fifteen (15) business days after it is released.
In the event that any product made under this provision is ever used by the Company for any purpose other than as a promotional Press Kit, the Company shall be obligated to execute an assumption agreement pertaining to such use whereby it agrees to comply with all the terms and conditions of the applicable Federation agreement(s). A Company that fails to comply with the foregoing sentence shall make the payment(s) due and owing under the applicable Federation agreement(s) plus a penalty equal to 50% of such payment(s).
Further, if the Federation believes that any Company is violating the provisions of this article, the Federation may convene a joint Federation-Industry meeting to discuss this matter.
(18)	New Use of Symphonic Recording
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 21. at page 7, in the event that a symphonic recording is used in a television or theatrical motion picture, the Company shall pay to all persons who were covered on the original Form B session report an amount equal to 50% of the payments (including, without limitation, pension contributions, but excluding health and welfare contributions) that would be required under the television and theatrical motion picture agreements that would then apply if the recording were

If the name of the parent symphony orchestra is mentioned on the record or its package, the musicians who play shall be compensated in accordance with the symphonic provisions; if the parent name is not mentioned on the record or its package, said musicians shall be compensated in accordance with the chamber provisions.

The following terms and conditions shall apply to the production of video promo selections on or after July 1, 1983, and to the licensing, sale, leasing and other exploitation of video promo selections, and where, in either case, the video promo selection incorporates a master record produced pursuant to the AFM Sound Recording Labor Agreement:
1.	A. The Company will pay to each side musician, i.e. other than a “royalty artist”, (as that term is defined in the AFM Sound Recording Labor Agreement, February 2002) who performs as a musician “on-camera” (and for purposes of this agreement, this shall include “sideline musicians” as that term is commonly understood) in any covered video promo selection produced from February 1, 2002 through January 31, 2003, the sum of $229.02 per 10 hour day. For such video promo selections produced on or after February 1, 2003 said payment is to increased to $234.75 per 10 hour day and for such video promo selections produced on or after February 1, 2004, said payment is to be increased to $241.79 per 10 hour day. Pension and welfare payments at the rates and conditions set forth in the AFM Sound Recording Labor Agreement shall be made. For work performed in excess of 10 hours, the musicians shall be compensated at I'/z times the pro rata 10 hour payment at one-half hour intervals.
B.	A Meal Period shall be provided with the time of the meal period to be determined at the producer's discretion subject to applicable state law.
2.	A. An “arbitrary recoupment figure” applicable to each video promo selection, regardless of the actual cost of production, is hereby established. That figure shall be $50,000 for each covered video promo selection produced prior to July 1. 1984; $60,000 for each covered video promo selection produced between July 1, 1984 and November 29, 1985; $70,000 for each covered video promo selection produced between November 30, 1985 and January 31, 1987; and $75,000 for each covered video promo selection produced on or after February 1, 1987.
B.	If and when the Company receives revenue from the licensing, sale, leasing or other exploitation of a covered video promo selection, the Company shall pay to the Sound Recording Special Payments Fund, as the agent for the musicians involved, 1% of revenues received therefrom by the Company to the extent such revenues are in excess of the “arbitrary recoupment figure” referred to in paragraph 2.A above.
C.	The Sound Recording Special Payments Fund shall distribute the monies collected pursuant to paragraph 2.B, above, among all musicians who were involved in the production of the original recording that was utilized in the video promo selection. Payments to be distributed to individual musicians resulting from audits shall be reduced in an amount equivalent to each musician’s pro rata share of the reasonable costs incurred by the Sound Recording Special Payments Fund in providing such audits. The parties hereto agree that if the Company has fulfilled its obligations pursuant to paragraph 2.B, above, and made the required payments, the Company’s obligations with respect to all musicians involved in the production of the original recording that was utilized in the video promo selection shall have been discharged and the Company shall not be required to look to the application of any such monies paid to the Sound Recording Special Payments Fund.
3.	Notwithstanding anything provided for in paragraph 2, above, in the event that the “Company’s revenue" derived from the sale or licensing of a video promo selection for use in the consumer market (i.e. as a video disc/cassette), and if and when
48
SOUND RECORDING LABOR AGREEMENT
February 1, 2002 - January 31,2005
revenues received by the Company from any such exploitation total $5,000, the Company agrees to pay the sum of $500, which shall be credited against any payments to the Sound Recording Special Payments Fund on pursuant to paragraph 2.B. above, that may come due. This $500 advance shall be paid to the Sound Recording Special Payments Fund for distribution as set forth in paragraph 2.C, above.
4.	A. For purposes of this agreement, “Company revenues” shall be deemed to mean the worldwide total gross receipts actually received by the Company in its role as the producer, from the licensing, sale, leasing or other exploitation of any covered video promo selection in any market or in any media. For example, if the Company does not directly exploit any covered video promo selection, but engages a third party to license or otherwise exploit the Company’s rights in said video promo selection, then the monies paid to the Company by said third party shall constitute the Company's revenues for purposes thereof. As a further example, it is the intention of the parties hereto that the basis of determining “Company’s revenues” from the sale of consumer products at the retail level would not be the amount received by the retailer or the distributor, but would be the amount actually received by the Company. Additionally, the Company is permitted to allocate revenues received from the licensing of more than one video promo selection in accordance with fair and reasonable practices.
B. In the event that any Company maintains a separate subsidiary, division, or other department to license or otherwise exploit the Company's rights in a covered video promo selection produced by a different subsidiary, division or department of the Company, “Company’s revenues" shall be deemed to mean the fee or other payment received by the subsidiaiy, division or other department of the Company which serves as the production branch from the subsidiary, division or other department of the Company which serves as the “exploiting” branch. Where no separate subsidiary, division or other department serves as the production branch, the Company may make a reasonable allocation of the gross receipts of the Company from licenses attributable solely to fees or other payments which would be made to a production subsidiary, division, or other department of the Company, if one existed, or would be made to an outside producer and Company’s revenues would be deemed to be the amount so allocated. The reasonableness of such allocation or the amount of the fee or other payment received by the producer, subsidiaiy, division or other department where the production and exploitation functions are separately maintained, shall be determined by the licensing fees paid to outside producers for comparable product, or in the absence of any such practice, by general prevailing trade practices with respect to video promos.
5.	It is understood and agreed that nothing contained herein is intended to diminish the rights of any musician, including royalty artists, to individually negotiate better terms and conditions in connection with services on covered video promo selections. However, if a royalty artist’s individual contract gives such artist a percentage or other participation in the receipts, revenues or profits of a covered program and if the royalty artist’s individual contract so provides, the royalty artist’s computed share under paragraphs 2 and 3, above, may be credited against the payment due to the royalty artist under his or her individual contract, and the sum payable to the Sound Recording Special Payments Fund shall be reduced accordingly.

SOUND RECORDING LABOR AGREEMENT
February 1,2002 - January 31, 2005
6.	The parties hereto agree that the payments required to be made by the Company, pursuant to paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, above, are intended to constitute the sole payments arising out of the production and/or exploitation of video promo selections by any party, to either the Federation or the Sound Recording Special Payments Fund, on behalf of, or to any individuals covered hereunder, unless such individuals negotiate for better terms and conditions pursuant to paragraph 5, above.
7.	The parties hereto agree that in the event that the Company exploits video promo selections produced prior to July 1, 1983, all provisions of this agreement, except paragraph 1 hereof, shall be applicable.
8.	Following the execution of this agreement, the Company shall promptly furnish to the Federation or the Sound Recording Special Payments Fund, upon request, a list of any covered video promos currently available for exploitation, and thereafter, from time to time, upon request, Company shall furnish a schedule listing amendments and additions thereto.
9.	The Company shall respond promptly to reasonable requests by the Federation or the Sound Recording Special Payments Fund for information relating to the Company’s performance of the terms and conditions of this agreement and for individual agreements with persons covered by this agreement.

11.	The provisions of paragraphs 11, 12, 14, 22, 25, and 26, of the Sound Recording Labor Agreement (February, 2002) shall herein be deemed incorporated by reference.
12.	All present provisions of the Federation’s Bylaws are made part of this agreement to the extent to which their inclusion and enforcement are not prohibited by any applicable law. No changes therein made during the term of this agreement shall be effective to contravene any of the provisions hereof.
13.	The Company agrees that the Sound Recording Special Payments Fund shall have the right, from time to time and at reasonable times during business hours, to have its duly authorized agent examine and audit the Company records and accounts concerning revenues derived from the sale or licensing of video promo selections covered hereunder; such examination and audit to be made for the purpose of the Federation’s verifying any statements made by the Company pursuant to this agreement, during a period not exceeding four (4) years preceding such examination, and of determining the amount of payments due it thereunder. It is agreed that the four (4) year period provided herein shall not affect the operation of the applicable statute of limitations. The Company agrees to afford all necessary facilities to such authorized agent to make such examination and audit and to make abstracts and excerpts from said records and accounts as may be necessary or proper according to approved recognized accounting practices. Such examinations and audits shall be coordinated, to the extent practical, with examinations and audits made under the Sound Recording Special Payments Fund Labor Agreement so that inconvenience to the Company may be minimized.

Side Letter Agreement I re Symphonic Recordings
Gentlemen:
In the current round of collective bargaining the Phonograph Record Industry and the American Federation of Musicians (“Federation”), Industry submitted a symphonic proposal whereby a provision would be incorporated into the collective bargaining agreement stating, in effect, that compensation due each musician may be credited by “service conversion" m lieu of direct payment. After a full discussion of that proposal and the general subject of service conversion, the Industry withdrew its proposal in return for the commitment made herein by the Federation,
In the course of these discussions, the parties noted that there are now numerous collectively negotiated agreements between the Federation local unions and symphony orchestra managements which contain provisions authorizing the performance of electronic services and specifying the guarantee and working conditions that apply to such sendees. In view of that development, the purpose of this letter is to notify the Phonograph Recordindustry that the Federation policy over the course of the collective bargaining agreement (February 1, 1996 through January 31, 1999) will be to allow the parties - symphonic orchestra managements and the respective local unions with whom they bargain collectively - to negotiate whatever guarantee, if any, they may agree to concerning the orchestra’s performance of electronic services, whether or not such guarantee is a part of or in addition to the minimum weekly salary, provided that any such agreement does not violate the Federation Bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement.

Side Letter Agreement II (two hour rule)
Gentlemen:
In the current round of collective bargaining between the Phonograph Record Industry and the American Federation of Musicians (“Federation”), Industry submitted a symphonic proposal to eliminate the existing contract provision requiring a two hour guarantee for those musicians not called to a recording session. A meaningful discussion of that proposal ensued, but in the face of the deadline created by contract expiration, the parties both recognized that time constraints precluded the exhaustive discussion that Industry is now agreeable to withdraw its above described proposal. In consideration of that action, the Federation has agreed to convene over the period of this agreement but in no event commencing later than October 1, 1996, on a periodic basis, a series of meetings with the Industry as a means of fostering an open and frank exchange of views and ideas concerning the pros and cons of the two hour rule, its administration and operation, and possible alternatives. By providing for these meetings, it is not the intent of the parties to relieve any employer of its obligation to comply with the two hour provision throughout the term of this collective bargaining agreement.

Side Letter HI re Symphonic Recordings (limited pressings)
Gentlemen:
In the current round of collective bargaining between the Phonograph Record Industry and the American Federation of Musicians (“Federation”), Industry submitted a symphonic proposal whereby symphonic musicians would be compensated pursuant to a formula that would provide a reduced scale payment that is less than would be required under the applicable scale payment provision of the current collective bargaining agreement. After a lengthy discussion concerning the proposal it was withdrawn by Industry. The Federation, for its part, contemporaneously advised Industry that the Federation's Negotiating Committee would promptly take all necessary steps to obtain the International Executive Board’s approval to modify the International Executive Board’s rules applicable to local union limited pressing agreements for symphonic recordings, as follows:
The maximum number of pressings per recording would be increased from the existing 5,000 unit level to 10,000; the existing cap of one (1) recording per year would remain in effect but the Federation would be authorized to approve on a project-by-project basis limited pressings in excess of one year. Any limited pressing would continue to be subject to approval by the orchestra musicians. As in the past, these rules shall not apply in Canada.
As soon as the foregoing modification to the limited pressing rules for symphonic recordings is approved by the International Executive Board, it will become effective retroactive to February 1, 1996.

In the current round of collective bargaining between the Phonograph Record Industry and the American Federation of Musicians, the parties clarified that each Company has the following obligation with respect to audits conducted by the Phonograph Record Manufacturers’ Special Payments Fund and the Recording Industries Music Performance Trust Funds (collectively, the “Funds”):
With respect to a phonograph record that is licensed, leased, sold or otherwise transferred to a party that (i) is not signatory to the Phonograph Record Labor Agreement and (ii) has not executed an assumption agreement in the form set forth therein (“licensee”), the Company shall make available to the Funds (or their authorized agents) a redacted licensing agreement and the units sold (or, if no unit information is provided to the Company by the licensee, the licensing revenues received by the Company with respect to such phonograph record). In no event may the redacted licensing agreement referred to in the foregoing paragraph omit information relevant to payments due to the Funds, including without limitation advance payments from the licensee to the Company and minimum unit guarantees.

Side Letter Agreement V re Digital Distribution
The parties have agreed that if, during the term of the 2002-2005 Sound Recording Labor Agreement, a dispute arises with respect either to the Company’s obligation to make payments to musicians with respect to making recordings produced under any Sound Recording Labor Agreement available for digital distribution (e.g., downloading) via any online computer service, the Internet, satellite, or any other similar distribution vehicle and/or the basis on which such payments should be calculated, either party has the limited right to convene a Joint Federation-Indus try Cooperative Committee meeting to discuss these issues. In order to exercise this limited right, a party must serve written notice on the other party on or before July 15, 2003. During the 90 days following such notice, the parties shall attempt to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of any such dispute. Failing a negotiated agreement by the expiration of any such 90-day period, each party may exercise its rights under the federal labor laws and under the 2002-2005 Sound Recording Labor Agreement. The afore-described limited right has no effect on any other provision of the 2002-2005 Sound Recording Labor Agreement.

SPECIAL PAYMENTS FUND AGREEMENT
(February 1, 2002 - January 31, 2005)
AGREEMENT, made and delivered in the City and State of New York, on the date set forth below, by and between the undersigned and such others as shall hereafter agree to contribute to the fund referred to hereafter (individually called “First Party” and collectively “First Parties”), the undersigned Executive Director ("Executive Director"), and The American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada (“Federation").
WITNESSETH:
(a)	Each First Party has executed and delivered this Agreement pursuant to its undertaking so to do as provided by the Sound Recording Labor Agreement (February, 2002), simultaneously herewith entered into with the Federation.
(b)	Each First Party by executing and delivering this Agreement assumes the duties and obligations to be performed and undertaken by each such First Party hereunder. The Executive Director has been designated collectively by the First Parties, who have requested it to assume and perform the duties of Executive Director hereunder, and it is willing to do so in the manner prescribed herein.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, of the mutual covenants herein contained, of the undertakings assumed by each First Party, and of the undertakings herein by the Executive Director at the request of the First Parties, it is agreed as follows:
1.	(a) There is incorporated herein and made part hereof, as though fully set forth herein, Addendum A.
(b)	Subject to paragraph 2(d), hereof, each First Party to this Agreement shall make the payments to the Executive Director called for in Addendum A, hereto, to provide for:
(i)	said First Party's contribution to the musicians’ share of the Fund as defined under paragraph 2(b) hereof, and
(ii)	any employment taxes or insurance premiums which may be owing by the First Parties with respect to the distribution of the musicians’ share of the Fund.
(c)	Within forty-five (45) days after the end of each calendar half-year (that is within forty-five (45) days after December 31st and June 30th in each year), each First Party will pay to the Executive Director such portion of the aforesaid payments as may have accrued hereunder during the preceding half-year, provided that the Executive Director may agree with any First Party that semi-annual payments be made with respect to other half-yearly periods ending on dates satisfactory to the Executive Director. Each payment hereunder shall be accompanied by a statement, certified by the Treasurer, Controller, or other authorized officer or representative of the First Party making such payment, containing such information as may be reasonably required to ascertain the correctness of the payment made. If such payments are not made when due hereunder,
69
SOUND RECORDING SPECIAL PAYMENTS FUND AGREEMENT
February 1,2002-January 31, 2005
the same shall bear interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date when such payment was due.
(d)	Each First Party at all times, without limitation to the duration of this Agreement, shall keep full and accurate records and accounts concerning all transactions on which payments to the Executive Director are based pursuant to this Agreement, in convenient form and pursuant to approved and recognized accounting practices. The Executive Director shall have the right from time to time, without limitation to the duration of this Agreement and at all reasonable times during business hours, to have its duly authorized agents examine and audit such records and accounts, and such other records and accounts as may be necessary, such examination and audit to be made for the purpose of verifying any statements made hereunder by each First Party, or due from such First Party, during a period not exceeding four (4) years preceding such examination and of determining the amount of payments due to the pursuant hereto. It is agreed that the four (4) year period provided herein shall not effect the operation of the applicable statute of limitations. Each First Party agrees to afford all necessary facilities to such authorized agents to make such examination and audit and to make such extracts and excerpts from said records and accounts as may be necessary or proper according to approved and recognized accounting practices. Examinations and audits made pursuant hereto shall be coordinated, to the extent practicable, with examinations and audits made under the Sound Recording Trust Agreements to which First Party is signatory so that inconvenience to the First Party may be minimized.
(e)	Any sale, assignment, lease or license of, or other transfer of title to, or permission to use any device covered by Addendum A to this Agreement whether by operation of law or otherwise, shall be subject to the rights and duties established by this Agreement. The Executive Director shall be advised monthly of each purchaser, assignee, lessee, licensee, transferee or user and of the identity of the phonograph record (as defined above) involved. No sale, assignment, lease, license, transfer or permission shall be made or granted by any First Party to any person, firm or corporation doing business within the United States, Canada or Puerto Rico, unless and until such purchaser, assignee, lessee, licensee, transferee, or user, shall become an additional First Party hereto. No other sale, assignment, lease, license, transfer or permission shall be made or granted unless such purchaser, assignee, lessee, licensee, transferee, or user, shall promise to make to such First Party the payments required by this Agreement, which said First Party shall pay over to the Administrator, but only to the extent that such First Party has received such payments, (i) in the United States or Canada, or (ii) in United States or Canadian currency or in a currency convertible into United States or Canadian currency, or (iii) in a currency not convertible into United States or Canadian currency, of which such First Party has made beneficial use, or (iv) in an asset other than currency. No such First Party will, without the consent of the Executive Director and Federation forgive or compromise such obligation.
(f)	All payments and other communications for each First Party to the Executive Director shall be made to the Executive Director at its office which shall be located in New York, N.Y.

SOUND RECORDING SPECIAL PAYMENTS FUND AGREEMENT
February 1, 2002-January 31, 2005
2.	(a) The Executive Director accepts the duties hereby assigned to it, and shall establish the proper administrative machinery and processes necessary for the performance of its duties hereunder. The Executive Director shall as soon as practicable after May I31 of each year, distribute as herein provided the "musicians’ share of the Fund,” as defined in paragraph 2(b) hereof. Each musician, as collectively referred to in paragraph 1 of the Sound Recording Labor Agreement (February, 2002), shall receive as a special payment a fraction of the total distribution which shall be determined as follows: the numerator of said fraction shall be a sum determined by adding the scale wages payable to such musician by all First Parties hereto; (i) during the immediately preceding calendar year weighted or multiplied by 100 percent, (ii) during the immediately preceding calendar year less one weighted or multiplied by 80 percent, (iii) during the immediately preceding calendar year less two weighted or multiplied by 60 percent, (iv) during the immediately preceding calendar year less three weighted or multiplied by 40 percent, and (v) during the immediately preceding calendar year less four weighted or multiplied by 20 percent; the denominator of said fraction shall be a sum determined by adding the scale wages payable to all such musicians during the same calendar years as aforesaid by all said First Parties hereto similarly weighted or multiplied as set forth above. In the case of arrangers and orchestrators scale wages for all purposes of this paragraph 2(a) shall be deemed to be 150 percent of the scale wages paid to an instrumentalist for each tune on which the arranger or orchestrator performed services hereunder.
By way of illustration but not limitation:
Example 1:
If the scale wages payable to a musician participating in the 1996 distribution have been $500 in 1995, and $1,000 in 1994, and the total scale wages payable to all musicians during the same two years have been $100,000 in 1995, and $90,000 in 1994, the fraction of the distribution payable to that musician would be determined as follows:
Year__________Musician’s scale wages___________________Total scale wages____________
1995	$500 x 100%	=	$ 500	$100,000 x 100% =	$100,000
1994	$1,000 x 80%	=	800	90,000 x 80% =	72,000
$1,300	$172,000
The musician’s 1996 special payment would be 1,300/172,000 of the "musicians’ share of the Fund.”
SOUND RECORDING SPECIAL PAYMENTS FUND AGREEMENT
February 1,2002-January 31,2005
Example 2:
If the scale wages payable to a musician participating in the 1997 distribution have been $500 in 1996, $1,000 in 1995, $700 in 1994, none in 1993, and $300 in 1992, and if the total scale wages payable to all musicians during the same five years have been $100,000 in 1996, $90,000 in 1995, $70,000 in 1994, $50,000 in 1993 and $50,000 in 1992, the fraction of the distribution payable to that musician would be determined as follows:
Total scale wages
Year Musician "s scale wages payable to all musicians
1996	$500 x 100% =	$ 500	$100,000 x	100% =	$100,000
1995	$1,000 x 80% =	800	90,000 x	80% =	72,000
1994	$700 x 60% =	420	70,000 x	60% =	42,000
1993	0 x 40% =	0	50,000 x	40% =	20,000
1992	300 x 20% =	60	50,000 x	20% =	10,000
		$1,780			$244,000
The musician’s 1997 special payment would be 1,780/244,000 of the “musicians’ share of the Fund.”
(b)	For purposes of this Agreement, the “musician’s share of the Fund” shall be an amount equal to:
(i)	All sums received by the Executive Director up to May 1 st of the year of distribution, with respect to sales of phonograph records made:
(A)	During the preceding calendar year, or,
(B)	At any time prior to the preceding calendar year, if the payment with respect to such sales, was received by the Executive Director after May first of the preceding calendar year.
(ii)	Less:
(A)	All expenses reasonably incurred in the administration of the Fund, including the compensation of the Executive Director herein provided, and appropriate bonding premiums.
(B)	Amounts reasonably reserved by the Executive Director as an operating Fund, and for contingencies, and,
(C)	An amount (hereinafter referred to as the “share of the Fund”) equal to the total of any Social Security Tax, Federal and/or State Unemployment Insurance Tax, other employment taxes, Disability Insurance premiums, and/or Workers’ Compensation premiums, which may be owing by the First Parties, individually or collectively, and/or by the Executive Director, as Employer or Employers, with respect to the distribution of the musicians’ share of the Fund.
72
SOUND RECORDING SPECIAL PAYMENTS FUND AGREEMENT
February 1, 2002-January 31, 2005
(c)	The First Parties, individually and collectively, hereby irrevocably designate the Executive Director as their agent to pay from the Manufacturers’ share of the Fund, any Social Security Tax, Federal and/or State Unemployment Insurance premiums, and/or Workers’ Compensation premiums, which may be owing by the First Parties individually and/or collectively, as Employer or Employers, with respect to the distribution of the musicians’ share of the Fund.
(d)	Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, a First Party may, at the time it makes its annual payment to the Fund, request that the Executive Director refund to it such proportion of such payment as:
(i)	The total of any taxes and insurance premiums which may be payable under paragraph 2(b)( ii)( C) hereof, with respect to the distribution of the musicians’ share of the Fund in the year of payment, bears to
(ii)	The total payments made to the Fund by First Parties in said year.
Any such refund shall be made by the Executive Director to the First Party requesting the refund not later than September 1st of the year of payment.
If a refund is made to a First Party under this subparagraph, the Executive Director shall not be responsible in said year, for payment of said First Party's share of any taxes and insurance premiums payable under paragraph 2(b)(ii)(C). hereof, with regard to the distribution of the musicians’ share of the Fund.
(e)	The Federation has agreed to furnish to the Executive Director, and to cause its local unions to furnish to the Executive Director, all data in the possession or subject to the control thereof, which is necessary and proper to assist in the orderly and accurate distribution to musicians as provided herein and to request the Trustees of the American Federation of Musicians and Employers’ Pension Fund to do likewise upon reimbursement of all costs reasonably incurred thereby in so doing.
(f)	The Executive Director shall indemnify and hold the First Parties harmless out of the Fund against any liability for making any of the payments to the musicians under paragraph 2(a), hereof, or any payments of employment taxes and insurance premiums which may be required to be made by the Executive Director under paragraph 2(c), hereof, it being the express intent of the parties that all such payments are to be made out of the Fund with no further cost or expense of any kind whatsoever to the First Parties. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Executive Director also shall furnish a surety bond with a responsible surety company satisfactory to the First Parties and to the Federation, to guarantee the full and faithful performance of its duties as herein described.
(g)	In making distribution to musicians hereunder, the Executive Director shall clearly and legibly display the following legend on all checks, vouchers, letters or documents of transmittal: “This is a special payment to you under a collectively negotiated agreement between the Ajnerican Federation of Musicians and recording company signatories.”
73
SOUND RECORDING SPECIAL PAYMENTS FUND AGREEMENT
February 1,2002^January 31, 2005
(h)	In the event of the death of a musician entitled to a distributive share hereunder, the Executive Director shall distribute such share to the beneficiary designated by such musician on a form provided by the Executive Director for such purpose or, if no such beneficiary is so designated, the beneficiary designated by such musician pursuant to the AFM-EP Pension Fund; and if no beneficiary be so designated, then to the surviving spouse of such musician; and if there be no such person, to the musician’s estate.
(i)	If a musician for whom a distributive share has been set apart cannot be found, or if payment under this Agreement has been tendered but is not completed after efforts which the Executive Director deems reasonable, the Executive Director shall add such amounts to a reserve Fund and hold the same therein pending receipt of claim or until the end of the second full calendar year payable.
Thereafter, all such amounts remaining unclaimed shall be redeposited in the “musicians’ share of the Fund” as defined in paragraph 2(b) for distribution as therein provided.
3.	(a) In the event that any First Party shall default in the payment of any sums to the Executive Director when the same shall become due pursuant to this Agreement, the Executive Director shall have the duty, right and power forthwith to commence action or to take any other proceedings as shall be necessary for the collection thereof, including the power and authority to compromise and settle with the Federation’s consent. The Executive Director’s reasonable expenses, attorney’s fees and other disbursements incurred in the collection of any such overdue sums shall be paid to the Executive Director by the First Party so defaulting and such payment shall be added to the Special Payments Fund.
(b)	Nothing contained herein shall create any cause of action in favor of any musician as defined in the Sound Recording Labor Agreement (February, 2002) against any First Party but the Federation may enforce distribution of the musicians’ share of the Fund in behalf of the individual musicians.
(c)	The Executive Director shall deposit all money and property received by it, with or without interest, with any bank or trust company, insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and having capital, surplus and undivided profits exceeding $5,000,000; provided, however, that in the event that Canadian dollars are receivable by the Executive Director and it is not feasible or desirable to convert such Canadian dollars into the United States funds, such Canadian funds and any securities purchased therewith may be deposited in a Chartered Bank of the Dominion of Canada, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

SOUND RECORDING SPECIAL PAYMENTS FUND AGREEMENT
February 1, 2002-January 31,2005
ADDENDUM A
1.	For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms “phonograph record” and “record” shall
include phonograph records, wire or tape recordings, or other devices reproducing sound, and the term “master record” shall include any matrix, “mother,” stamper or other device from which another such master record, phonograph record, wire or tape recording, or other device reproducing sound, is produced, reproduced, pressed or otherwise processed.
2.	(a) Each First Party shall make payments to the Executive Director in the amounts computed as stated below, with respect to the sale during the period specified in 6, below, of phonograph records, produced from master records containing music which was performed or conducted by musicians covered by, or required to be paid pursuant to, a collective bargaining agreement with the Federation known as Sound Recording Labor Agreement (February, 2002) (but specifically excluding services solely as arranger, orchestrator or copyist) where such phonograph records are sold during said period by such First Party, or, subject to the provisions of paragraph 1 (e) of the main text of this Agreement, by purchasers, lessees, licensees, transferees, or other users deriving title, lease, license, or permission thereto, by operation of law or otherwise, by, from or through such First Party. Effective for all unresolved audits as of February 1, 2002 no payments shall be required with respect to any sale after February 1, 1996, of any single, defined as any record containing (i) no more than three (or four, for sales after February 1, 2002) different titles (songs) and (ii) no more than eight sides (versions).
(b) For product produced during the term of this Agreement, as to foreign receipts the obligations of the First Party shall not accrue until the First Party shall either have the right to freely use such foreign currency, or the First Party has the right to transmit to the United States to the First Party such foreign currency from such foreign country or territory. If such currency may be utilized or transmitted as aforesaid it shall be deemed to have been converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which such currency was actually transmitted to the United States as aforesaid, or if not actually transmitted, then at the prevailing free market rate of exchange at the time such right to use or to transmit occurs. Frozen foreign currency shall be deemed to be unblocked on the basis of “first in. first out", unless otherwise allocated by local foreign fiscal authorities. Allocation of such unblocked funds as between revenue which serves as the basis of determining payments hereunder and other revenue, shall be on a proportional basis, subject to different earmarking by local foreign fiscal authorities. Payments of amounts accruing hereunder shall be made semiannually on the basis of the reports to the Administrator required in paragraph 1(c) of the main text of this Agreement. Foreign retail price shall be accounted for in U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange at which receipts are actually converted and remitted.
With respect to foreign sales, the First Party shall pay only that proportion of the amount provided for in paragraph 3, as the adjusted foreign receipts bears to the total foreign receipts. For purposes hereof, adjusted foreign receipts shall be computed, as follows: total foreign receipts less (1) value added taxes or other taxes, whatever called, which the consumer pays and which are not segregated from the retail price and (2) repatriation taxes or withholding taxes or other foreign taxes, whatever called; provided, however, that taxes shall not reduce foreign receipts to the extent that such
78
SOUND RECORDING SPECIAL PAYMENTS FUND AGREEMENT
February 1, 2002-January 31, 2005
taxes constitute income taxes which are credited as a foreign tax credit on the First Party’s consolidated U.S. Corporation Income tax. For purposes hereof, an income tax will not be treated as credited as a foreign tax credit in a given year except to the extent of the excess of the First Party’s allowed foreign tax credits computed pursuant to SS 901 and 904 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for such year over the amount of such First Party’s foreign tax credits which would have been allowed for such year if computed without reflecting the foreign receipts and related income taxes and expenses. The determination of whether an income tax will be treated as credited as a foreign tax credit shall take into account any carryback or carryforward of foreign income taxes to such year; provided, however, if the First Party makes a good faith determination that the First Party expects to be entitled to a foreign tax credit for a tax for the years subject to audit, an income tax will be treated as a foreign tax credit three years from the payment date of the royalty statement date which reflected such tax. The First Party shall not be responsible for loss or diminution of foreign receipts as a result of any matter or thing not reasonably within the control of the First Party. The Federation, the Executive Director, or the Special Payments Fund, as the case may be, and the musicians shall be bound by any arrangements made in good faith by the First Party, or for its account, with respect to the deposit or remittance of foreign revenue. Frozen foreign receipts shall not be considered trust funds and the First Party may freely commingle the same with other funds of the First Party. No sums received by way of deposits or security need be included until earned from net sales.
3.	The payments to the Executive Director shall be computed as follows:
(a)	.54% of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price for each record when such price does not exceed $3.79.
(b)	.52% of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price for each record when such price exceeds $3.79, to a maximum suggested retail price of $8.98 for each record.
(c)	,522% of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price for each wire or tape recording or other device, to a maximum suggested retail price of $8.98 for each wire or tape recording or other device. In the case of compact discs, such maximum suggested retail price shall be $10.98. The term "compact disc" shall include Audio Digital Versatile Discs (Audio-DVD) and Super Audio Compact Discs (SACD) for all purposes under this Agreement.
(d)	For sales of records, tapes, cartridges, compact discs and other devices in excess of the first 300,000 units of each title, the percentage of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price shall be .53% effective February 1, 1996 and .54% effective August 1, 1997 for each unit, up to the maximum applicable suggested retail price set forth in paragraphs 3(a) through 3(c). [It is further agreed that the first 300,000 units of each title shall be calculated in the same manner that the 25,000 unit allowance under Addendum A, 4(c) is calculated-namely, by combining all configurations (per side letter of 2/13/96 available on request from AFM).]
(e)	For sales of records, tapes cartridges, compact discs and other devices in excess of the first 1,000,000 royalty-bearing units of each title, the percentage of the manufacturer's suggested retail price shall be .55% on records produced on or after February 1, 2002, up to the maximum suggested retail price set forth in paragraphs 3(a) through 3(c). It is further agreed that the first 1,000,000 royalty-bearing units of each title shall be
79
SOUND RECORDING SPECIAL PAYMENTS FUND AGREEMENT
February 1, 2002-January 31, 2005
calculated in the same manner that the 25,000 unit allowance under Addendum A, 4(c) is calculated-namely, by combining all configurations.
For packages which contain more than one (1) record or tape or wire equivalent, the maximum suggested retail price shall be $8.98 (in the case of compact discs, $10.98) multiplied by the number of units in the package.
With respect to a phonograph record produced after January 31,2002, both from master records described in paragraph 2, of this Addendum A and recorded under the Sound Recording Labor Agreement (February, 2002) for which payments are due hereunder and from other master records, First Party shall pay that proportion of the amount provided for above as the number of such master records recorded under said Agreement bears to the total number of master records embodied in the phonograph record.
(f)	Effective for all unresolved audits as of February 1, 2002, no payments shall be required with respect to the sale of any cutouts.
4.	For the purposes of computing payments to the Executive Director:
(a)	Each First Party will report 100% of net sales.
(b)	Each First Party will have an allowance, with respect to singles sold before February 1, 1996, of the first 100,000 records sold for each title.
(c)	Each First Party will have an allowance, with respect to albums, tapes, compact discs and other devices, of the first 25,000 units of a title.
(d)	Each First Party will have a packaging allowance in the country of manufacture or sale of 20% of the suggested retail list price for phonograph records and 30% of the suggested retail list price for tapes, cartridges, and compact discs.
(e)	Each First Party will have an absolute “free record” allowance with respect to records, tapes, cartridges and compact discs regardless of mix (except for record clubs which are dealt with separately below), of 25% of the total records distributed.
(f)	With respect to its record clubs, if any, each First Party will have an allowance of “free” and “bonus” records, tapes, cartridges and compact discs actually distributed of up to 50% of the total records, tapes, cartridges and compact discs distributed by or through the clubs; and with respect to such “free” and “bonus” records, tapes, cartridges and compact discs distributed by its clubs in excess thereof, each First Party will pay the full rate on 50% of the excess of such “free” and “bonus” records, tapes, cartridges and compact discs so distributed.
5.	Schedules of current manufacturer’s suggested retail prices for each record in each First Party’s catalogue shall be furnished by each First Party to the Executive Director upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement and amendments and additions thereto shall be so furnished as and when established. For the purposes of determining the amounts payable hereunder, such suggested retail prices shall be computed exclusive of any sales or excise taxes on the sale of phonograph records subject to this Agreement. If any First Party discontinues the practice of publishing manufacturer’s suggested retail prices, it agrees
80
SOUND RECORDING SPECIAL PAYMENTS FUND AGREEMENT
February 1, 2002-January 31,2005
that it will negotiate a new basis for computing payments hereunder which shall be equivalent to those required above.
6.	The payments provided for in this Agreement shall be made with respect to the sales of any phonograph record produced from a master record described in paragraph 2, of this Addendum A which take place during the period commencing with the calendar year during which a phonograph record produced from such master record is first released for sale and terminating at the end of the tenth calendar year thereafter. The year of such release shall be counted as the first year of the ten years. (By way of illustration but not limitation, if a phonograph record produced from a master record made pursuant to the Phonograph Record Labor Agreement (February, 1996), is first released for sale in May, 1996, payments shall be made with respect to sales of said record which take place during the calendar years 1996-2005 inclusive. If said phonograph record is first released for sale in April, 1998, payments shall be made with respect to sales of said record which take place during the calendar years 1998-2007 inclusive.)
7.	The report to the Executive Director required in paragraph 1(c) of the main text of this Agreement shall show the number of phonograph records, tapes and other devices subject to payment under this Agreement which have been sold during the period to be covered by the report, the dates of initial release for sale thereof, the manufacturer’s suggested retail price thereof and of the component units thereof and the excise and sales taxes, if any, bome by the First Party thereon.
8.	Despite anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, it is specifically agreed that the First Party reserves the right, by written notice to the Executive Director, effective with the effective date of any termination, modification, extension or renewal of the said sound Recording Labor Agreement (February, 2002), to terminate or change any of the terms of this Special Payments Fund Agreement, but no such termination or change shall be effective unless the First Party has secured the prior written approval thereto by the Federation. It is agreed, however, that no such change may have any retroactive effect.
9.	Anything to the contrary herein contained notwithstanding, it is agreed that if the sound Recording Labor Agreement (February, 2002), or any successor agreement is not renewed or extended at or prior to its expiration date, and if a work stoppage by members of the Federation ensues, then all payments otherwise due to the Executive Director based on sales for the period of such work stoppage, and only for such period, shall not be made to the Executive Director. In lieu thereof, equivalent amounts shall be paid by each First Party as an additional contribution to the Trustee under the sound Recording Trust Agreement (February, 2002) unless otherwise determined as a condition for the cessation of such work stoppage

SOUND RECORDING TRUST AGREEMENT
(February 1,2002 - January 31, 2005)
AGREEMENT, made and delivered in the City and State of New York, on the date set forth below, by and between the undersigned and such others as shall hereafter agree to contribute to the trust fund referred to hereafter (herein individually called "First Party" and collectively "First Parties"), and the undersigned Trustee (herein called the "Trustee").
WITNESSETH

(b)	The First Parties desire to contribute to the trust referred to in this instrument; each First Party by executing and delivering this Agreement assumes the duties and obligations to be performed and undertaken by each such First Party hereunder. The Trustee has been designated collectively by the First Parties; who have requested the Trustee to assume and perform the duties of Trustee hereunder. The Trustee is willing to accept the trust and to perform the duties of Trustee, as prescribed herein, in a manner based solely upon the public interest.
Now, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, of the mutual covenants herein contained, of the undertakings assumed by each First Party, and of the undertakings assumed herein by the Trustee at the request of the First Parties, it is agreed as follows:
1.	If the Trustee shall so request, each First Party, whether an original signatory hereof or an additional First Party, upon becoming a First Party, shall make an initial payment to the Trustee in an amount which such First Party estimates to be equal to fifty per cent (50%) of the payment which will become due from such First Party to the Trustee hereunder within forty-five (45) days after the end of the calendar half-year immediately following the date when such First Party shall become a signatory hereto, such initial payment to be deductible from the payment due and owing at such time but in no event to be otherwise returnable.
2.	(a) There are incorporated herein and made part hereof, as though fully set forth herein, Addendums A and B.
(b)	Each First Party to this Agreement shall make the payments to the Trustee called for in Addendum A hereto.
(c)	Within forty-five (45) days after the end of each calendar half-year (that is within forty-five (45) days after December 31 st and June 30th in each year), each First Party will pay to the Trustee such portion of the aforesaid payments as may have accrued
85
SOUND RECORDING TRUST AGREEMENT
February 1,2002-January 31, 2005
hereunder during the preceding half-year; provided that the Trustee may agree with any First Party that semi-annual payments be made with respect to other half-yearly periods ending on dates satisfactory to the Trustee. Each payment hereunder shall be accompanied by a statement, certified by the Treasurer, Controller, or other authorized officer or representative of the First Party making such payment, and containing such information as the Trustee may reasonably require to ascertain the correctness of the payment made. Such statements shall be made in such reasonable form and detail as the Trustee may from time to time prescribe. If such payments are not made when due hereunder, the same shall bear interest at the rate of six per cent (6%) per annum from the date when such payment was due.
(d)	Each First Party at all times, without limitation to the duration of this Agreement, shall keep full and accurate records and accounts concerning all transactions on which payments to the Trustee are based pursuant to this Agreement, in convenient form and pursuant to approved and recognized accounting practices. The Trustee shall have the right from time to time, without limitation to the duration of this Agreement and at all reasonable times during business hours, to have its duly authorized agents examine and audit such records and accounts, and such other records and accounts as may be necessary, such examination and audit to be made for the purpose of verifying any statements made hereunder by each First Party, or due from such First Party, during a period not exceeding four years preceding such examination and of determining the amount of payments due to the Trustee pursuant hereto. It is agreed that the four year period provided herein shall not affect the operation of the applicable statute of limitations. Each First Party agrees to afford all necessary facilities to such authorized agents to make such examination and audit and to make such extracts and excerpts from said records and accounts as may be necessary or proper according to approved and recognized accounting practices. Examinations and audits made pursuant hereto shall be coordinated, to the extent practicable, with examinations and audits made under the Special Payments Fund Agreements to which First Party is signatory, so that inconvenience to the First Party may be minimized.
(e)	It is agreed that any sale, assignment, lease or license of, or other transfer of title to, or permission to use any device covered by Addendum A to this Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise, shall be subject to the rights and duties established by this Agreement. The Trustee shall be advised monthly of the name and address of each purchaser, assignee, lessee, licensee, transferee or user and of the identity of the phonograph record (as defined in Addendum A) involved. No sale, assignment, lease, license, transfer or permission shall be made or granted by any First Party to any person, firm or corporation doing business within the United States, Canada or Puerto Rico, unless and until such purchaser, assignee, lessee, licensee, transferee, or user, shall promise to make to such First Party the payments required by this Agreement, which said First Party shall pay over to the Trustee, but only to the extent that such First Party has received such payments (i) in the United States or Canada, or (ii) in United States or Canadian currency or in a currency convertible into United States or Canadian currency, or (iii) in a currency not convertible into United States or Canadian

SOUND RECORDING TRUST AGREEMENT
February I, 2002-January 31, 2005
ADDENDUM A
1.	For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms “phonograph record” and "record” shall include phonograph records, wire or tape recordings, or other devices reproducing sound, and the term “master record" shall include any matrix, “mother,” stamper or other device from which another such master record, phonograph record, wire or tape recording, or other device reproducing sound, is produced, reproduced, pressed or otherwise processed,
2.	(a) Each First Party shall make payments to the Trustee, in the amounts computed as stated below, with respect to the sale during the period specified in “6” below, of phonograph records produced from master records containing music which was performed or conducted by musicians covered by, or required to be paid pursuant to, a collective bargaining agreement with The American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada known as Sound Recording Labor Agreement (February, 2002) (but specifically excluding services solely as arranger, orchestrator or copyist) where such phonograph records are sold during said period by such First Party, or, subject to the provisions of paragraph 2(e) of the main text of this Agreement, by purchasers, lessees, licensees, transferees, or other users deriving title, lease, license, or permission thereto, by operation of law or otherwise, by, from or through such First Party,
Effective for all unresolved audits as of Febreuary 1, 2002, no payments shall be required with respect to any sale after February 1, 1996 of any single, defined as any record containing (i) no more than three different titles (songs) (or four, for sales after February 1, 2002) and (ii) no more than eight sides (versions).
(b) For product produced during the term of this Agreement, as to foreign receipts the obligations of the First Party shall not accrue until the First Party shall either have the right to freely use such foreign currency, or the First Party has the right to transmit to the United States to the First Party such foreign currency from such foreign country or territory. If such currency may be utilized or transmitted as aforesaid it shall be deemed to have been converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which such currency was actually transmitted to the United States as aforesaid, or if not actually transmitted, then at the prevailing free market rate of exchange at the time such right to use or to transmit occurs. Frozen foreign currency shall be deemed to be unblocked on the basis of “first in, first out” unless otherwise allocated by local foreign fiscal authorities. Allocation of such unblocked funds as between revenue which serves as the basis of determining payments hereunder and other revenue, shall be on a proportional basis, subject to different earmarking by local foreign fiscal authorities. Payments of amounts accruing hereunder shall be made semiannually on the basis of the reports to the Trustee required in paragraph 2(c) of the main text of this Agreement. Foreign retail price shall be accounted for in U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange at which receipts are actually converted and remitted.
With respect to foreign sales, the First Party shall pay only that proportion of the amount provided for in paragraph 3 as the adjusted foreign receipts bears to the total foreign receipts. For purposes hereof, adjusted foreign receipts shall be computed as follows: total foreign receipts less (1) value added taxes or other taxes, whatever called, which the consumer pays and which are not segregated from the retail price and (2)
95
SOUND RECORDING TRUST AGREEMENT
February 1, 2002-January 31, 2005 
repatriation taxes or withholding taxes or other foreign taxes, whatever called; provided, however, that taxes shall not reduce foreign receipts to the extent that such taxes constitute income taxes which are credited as a foreign tax credit on the First Party's consolidated U.S. Corporation Income tax. For purposes hereof, an income tax will not be treated as credited as a foreign tax credit in a given year except to the extent of the excess of the First Party's allowed foreign tax credits computed pursuant to SS 901 and 904 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for such year over the amount of such First Party's foreign tax credits which would have been allowed for such year if computed without reflecting the foreign receipts and related income taxes and expenses. The determination of whether an income tax will be treated as credited as a foreign tax credit shall take into account any carryback or carryforward of foreign income taxes to such year; provided, however, if the First Party makes a good faith determination that the First Party expects to be entitled to a foreign tax credit for a tax for the years subject to audit, an income tax will be treated as a foreign tax credit three years from the payment date of the royalty statement date which reflected such tax. The First Party shall not be responsible for loss or diminution of foreign receipts as a result of any matter or thing not reasonably within the control of the First Party. The Federation, the Trustee, or the MPTF, as the case may be, and the Musicians shall be bound by any arrangements made in good faith by the First Party, or for its account, with respect to the deposit or remittance of foreign revenue. Frozen foreign receipts shall not be considered trust funds and the First Party may freely commingle the same with other funds of the First Party. No sums received by way of deposits or security need be included until earned from net sales.
3.	The payments to the Trustee shall be computed as follows: .20475% of manufacturer's suggested retail price to a maximum suggested retail price of $8.98 for each record, wire or tape recording or other device. In the case of compact discs, such suggested maximum retail price shall be $10.98.* The term "compact disc" shall include Audio Digital Versatile Discs (Audio-DVD) and Super Audio Compact Discs (SACD) for all purposes under this Agreement.
Payments made to the Trustee on or after February 1, 1996 for pre-1964 phonograph records shall be computed at .20475% of manufacturer's suggested retail price to a maximum suggested retail price of $8.98 for each record, wire or tape recording or other device. In the case of compact discs, such suggested retail price shall be $10.98. The obligation to make such payments shall cease with respect to any sale of such phonograph records after January 312002.
For packages which contain more than one record or tape or wire equivalent, the maximum suggested retail price shall be $8.98 (in the case of compact discs, Audio Digital Versatile Discs (Audio-DVD) and Super Audio Compact Discs (SACD) $10.98) multiplied by the number of units in the package.
In computing payments due to the Trustee, each of the revised percentage payments shall be applicable on the respective effective dates both prospectively and retroactively (i.e., each of the revised percentages shall apply in computing payments due for the sale of any phonograph record irrespective of when that record was produced).
96
SOUND RECORDING TRUST AGREEMENT
February 1, 2002-January 31,2005

Effective for all unresolved audits as of February 1, 2002, no payments shall be required with respect to the sale of any cutouts.
4.	For the purpose of computing payments to the Trustee,
(a)	Each First Party will report 100% of net sales.
(b)	Each First Party will have an allowance, with respect to single sold before February 1, 1996, of the first 150,000 records sold for each title.
(c)	Each First Party will have an allowance, with respect to albums, tapes, compact discs and other devices, of the first 25,000 units of a title.
(d)	Each First Party will have a packaging allowance in the country of manufacture or sale of 20% of the suggested retail list price for phonograph records and 30% of the suggested retail price for tapes, cartridges and compact discs.
(e)	Each First Party will have an absolute “free record” allowance with respect to records, tapes, cartridges and compact discs regardless of mix, (except for record clubs which are dealt with separately below), of 25% of the total records distributed.
(f)	With respect to its record clubs, if any, each First Party will have an allowance of “free” and “bonus” records, tapes, cartridges and compact discs actually distributed of up to 50% of the total records, tapes, cartridges and compact discs distributed by or through the clubs; and with respect to such "free” and “bonus” records, tapes, cartridges and compact discs, distributed by its clubs in excess thereof, each First Party will pay the full rate on 50% of the excess of such “free” and “bonus” records, tapes, cartridges and compact discs so distributed.
5.	Schedules of current manufacturer's suggested retail prices for each record in each First Party's catalogue shall be furnished by each First Party to the Trustee upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement and amendments and additions thereto shall be so furnished as and when established. For the purposes of determining the amounts payable hereunder, such suggested retail prices shall be computed exclusive of any sales or excise taxes on the sale of phonograph records subject to this Agreement. If any First Party discontinues the practice of publishing manufacturer's suggested retail prices, it agrees that it will negotiate a new basis for computing payments hereunder which shall be equivalent to those required above.
6.	The payments provided for in this Agreement shall be made with respect to the sales of any phonograph record produced from a master record described in paragraph 2 of this Addendum A which take place during the period commencing with the calendar year during which a phonograph record produced from such master record is first released for
97
SOUND RECORDING TRUST AGREEMENT
February 1, 2002-January 31, 2005
sale and terminating at the end of the fifth calendar year thereafter. The year of such release shall be counted as the first year of the five years. (By way of illustration but not limitation, if a phonograph record produced from a master record made pursuant to Sound Recording Labor Agreement (December, 1983), is first released for sale in January, 1984, payments shall be made with respect to sales of said record which take place during the calendar years 1984-1988 inclusive. If said phonograph record is first released for sale in June, 1985, payments shall be made with respect to sales of said record which take place during the calendar years 1985-1989 inclusive.)
7.	The report to the Trustee required in paragraph 2(c) of the main text of this Agreement shall show the number of phonograph records, tapes and other devices subject to payment under this Agreement which have been sold during the period to be covered by the report, the dates of initial release for sale thereof, the manufacturer's suggested retail price thereof and of the component units thereof, and the excise and sales taxes, if any, borne by the First Party thereon.
8.	Despite anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, it is specifically agreed that the First Party reserves the right by written notice to the Trustee effective with the effective date of any termination, modification, extension or renewal of the said Sound Recording Labor Agreement (February, 2002) to terminate or change any of the terms of this Sound Recording Trust Agreement, but no such termination or change shall be effective unless the First Party has secured the prior written approval thereto by the Federation referred to in the main text hereof. It is agreed, however, that no such change may have any retroactive effect.
98

February 1, 2002-January 31, 2005

TELEVISION AND RADIO
COMMERCIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS AGREEMENT
(October 17,2004 - October 16,2007)
ARTICLE I:	PARTIES, TERM, AND APPLICABILITY
1.	Parties
The Joint Policy Committee on Broadcast Talent Union Relations of the Association of National Advertisers and American Association of Advertising Agencies (ANA-AAAA) and on behalf of each company whose name appears on the lists submitted to the Federation in October, 2004 together with any other party which executes the appropriate Letter of Adherence (each of which is herein severally called the "Employer”)—and the American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada (herein called “Federation”) agree to the following terms, conditions and provisions (herein called the “Agreement”).
2.	Term
This Agreement shall be in effect commencing October 17, 2004—or in the case of any new signatory Employer, on the effective date in the Letter of Adherence—and continuing through October 16, 2007.
3.	Services Covered
This Agreement shall apply to the employment of persons who fall within the bargaining unit classifications set forth in Article n (1) in connection with the recording of music tracks to be used in the production of television and radio commercial announcements, and the performance of services under Article XV. Excluded from this Agreement are music tracks recorded in Canada by members of Canadian Locals performing services under the Television and Radio Commercial Announcement Agreement for Canada. Commercial announcements (called “jingles and spot announcements” in prior Agreements) shall include those announcements which consist of (1) words accompanying music, (2) words under or over music, or (3) music intended to be performed without words. Theme music for a program shall be excluded from the definition of commercial announcements.
This Agreement shall also apply to the employment of persons who fall within the bargaining unit classifications set forth in Article II (1) in connection with the recording of music tracks to be used in the production of Internet commercial announcements insofar as the Internet commercial announcement is capable of being used on television or radio in the same form as on the Internet.
4.	Subsidiaries and Controlling Interests
The Employer’s obligations under this Agreement shall also be binding upon (1) its subsidiaries, (2) any interest which controls it, and (3) subsidiaries of any interest which controls it, to the extent that any of these makes or deals with commercial announcements covered by this Agreement. The Employer, any interest which controls it, and the subsidiaries of either shall be
Printing 07/07/06
1
Television and Radio Commercial Announcements agreement
October 17,2004 - October 16,2007
jointly and severally liable with respect to the Employer's obligations arising or due under this Agreement. An interest which owns, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of any class of stock in the Employer shall conclusively be deemed to control the Employer. A corporation shall conclusively be deemed a subsidiary of any person, firm or corporation which, directly or indirectly, owns at least 10% of any class of its stock.
5.	Non-Transferability
This Agreement shall be personal to the Employer and shall not be transferable or assignable by operation of law or otherwise without the written consent of the Federation. Without such consent, the Employer shall not transfer or assign any individual contract or part thereof for the performance of services of any member of the Federation or any other member of the bargaining unit or give anyone else control over such contract or such services. If the foregoing is violated and services are thereafter performed by such members of the Federation or other person, or if the transferee or assignee does any act which the Employer is permitted to do under this Agreement, the obligations and duties imposed by this Agreement shall be binding upon the transferee or assignee.
6.	Termination
With respect to any individual Employer, the Federation shall have the right, at its option, to terminate this Agreement at any time after a transfer of any interest which controls that Employer or in the event that such Employer or any interest which controls it-or any subsidiary of either-makes or deals with commercial announcements covered by this Agreement without having in effect a collective agreement with the Federation covering the same. This Section shall apply only when the signatory Employer and the entity making or dealing with the commercial announcements covered by this Agreement constitute a single employer or joint employers.
7.	Outstanding Claims
The Employer represents that there does not exist against it any claim of any kind arising out of musical services, and that if any valid claim is found to exist, the Employer shall satisfy the same.
8.	Waivers
No conduct or failure to act—with or without knowledge by the Federation—other than a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized officer thereof shall constitute a waiver by it of any provision of this Agreement.
9.	Applicable Laws
With respect to services rendered in the United States, this Agreement shall be construed and applied according to the laws of the State of New York and any action against the Federation shall be brought only in courts located in New York County. With respect to services rendered in Canada, this Agreement shall be construed and applied according to the laws of the Province of Ontario and any action against the Federation shall be brought only in courts located in the County of York.

ARTICLE II:	RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES
1.	Recognition
The Employer recognizes the Federation as the exclusive bargaining representative for those of its employees working in connection with the making of commercial announcements who are included in a bargaining unit (“Musicians”) consisting of instrumentalists, leaders, contractors, conductors, arrangers, orchestrators, music proofreaders, librarians, copyists, sideline musicians and any person who, in exercising musical skills, utilizes a synthesizer or other electronic device to produce music.
2.	Bargaining Unit Work
The Employer shall employ only Musicians for the rendition of musical services for all commercial announcements using live music made in the United States and Canada. The Employer shall not record music tracks outside the United States and Canada for the primary purpose of avoiding employment under this Agreement.
3.	Union Security
To the extent permitted by applicable law, any Musicians performing services in the United States who are members of the Federation on the date of signing or the effective date of this Agreement, or on the date of their first employment—whichever is later shall be continued in their employment by the Employer only so long as they continue their membership in good standing in the Federation. All other Musicians performing services in the United States shall become and continue to be members in good standing of the Federation as a condition of their employment no later than the 30th day following the commencement of their employment or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later. To the extent permitted by applicable law, only the services of members in good standing of the Federation shall be used for the performance of any bargaining unit work in Canada.
4.	Bylaws
All present provisions of the Bylaws, rules and regulations of the Federation are made part of this Agreement as though fully set forth herein to the extent to which their inclusion and enforcement as part of this Agreement are not prohibited by any applicable law. No changes in the Federation’s Bylaws, rules and regulations which may be made during the term of this Agreement shall be effective to contravene any of the provisions hereof. The Employer acknowledges its responsibility to be fully acquainted, now and for the duration of this Agreement, with the present contents of the Federation’s Bylaws, rules and regulations.
5.	Conflict of duties
To the extent permitted by applicable law, nothing in this Agreement shall ever be construed so as to interfere with any obligation which Musicians who are members of the Federation may owe to the Federation as members thereof.

October 17,2004 - October 16,2007
6.	Primary Labor Disputes
All Musicians covered by this Agreement shall be free to suspend or terminate their services by reason of any strike, ban or unfair list of the Federation and shall be free to accept and engage in other employment of the same or similar character, or otherwise, for other employers or persons, firms or corporations without any restraint, hindrance, penalty, obligation or liability whatever, any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding. It shall not be a violation of this Agreement and it shall not be cause for disciplinary action in the event a Musician refuses to go through or work behind any primary picket line of the Federation, including such primary picket line at the Employer’s place of business or at places of business to which Musicians are sent to perform by the Employer.
7.	Right of access
A duly authorized business representative of the Federation and/or the Federation Local in the jurisdiction of which services are rendered shall, upon presentation of proper identification to the Employer, be granted access to the studio or other place where services are being performed hereunder. Each shall be permitted to visit during working hours that studio or other place where services are being performed hereunder for the proper conduct of the business of the Federation or of such Local, including grievance investigation and processing.
8.	Non-Discrimination
The parties mutually reaffirm their policy of non-discrimination. The Employer reaffirms its policy that no employee shall be discriminated against in employment hereunder, because of race, color, creed, sex, national origin, or age provided the employee is qualified and has the physical ability to perform the work required thereunder. The Federation reaffirms its policy of non-discrimination with respect to admission to membership and rights of membership. The Employer shall annually advise all leaders, contractors, and any of its supervisory personnel involved in the hiring of musicians of the contents of this Section.
9.	Employer’s Obligations
For services rendered under this Agreement, the Employer shall pay at least the minimum rates of pay set forth herein and shall fully and faithfully perform and observe all other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in any individual agreements with the persons performing such services. The Employer shall not require, request, induce, or in any manner attempt to influence any Musician to play, perform, or render services in a manner contrary to this Agreement.
10.	Federation’s Obligations
The Federation shall exercise full authority in order to assure that its Locals and members do nothing in derogation of the terms and intent of this Agreement.
11.	Unauthorized Production
The Employer shall not record or aid or assist in the recording of any music for use in a commercial announcement to be produced by any other person, firm or corporation unless authorized in writing by the Federation. The Employer shall not require or permit any Musician
Printing 07/07/06

Television and Radio Commercial Announcements Agreement
October 17,2004 - October 16,2007
in its employ to record a music sound track for any purpose which is not authorized herein or in another written agreement with the Federation. No music sound track recorded under this Agreement shall be used in any way which violates the terms of this Agreement.
12.	Right to Information
Upon request by the Federation, the Employer shall promptly furnish it with a copy of any commercial announcement owned, produced, distributed, used or the use of which has been permitted by the Employer. If the Employer’s right to the use of a commercial announcement and/or music track has been purchased or otherwise acquired by the Employer, a copy of the contract under which such right was acquired shall also be furnished to the Federation, provided that the employer shall have the right to delete information of a proprietary nature from the relevant document(s).
13.	Right to Audit
The Federation shall have the right from time to time, upon reasonable notice, without limitation to the duration of this Agreement and at all reasonable times during business hours, to have the Federation’s duly authorized agent(s) examine and audit the records and accounts of any party to this Agreement concerning all transactions which are or legitimately may be subject to payments under this Agreement to ascertain which sums, if any, may be due and to verify the accuracy of any statement made by any party pursuant hereto. All necessary facilities shall be made available to such authorized agent(s) to enable them to make such examination and audit and to copy and make extracts from said records.
14.	INDUSTRY-FEDERATION COMMITTEE
The parties to this Agreement shall maintain a Joint Industry-Federation Committee which shall review problems which may arise under this Agreement and recommend solutions. The Committee shall also explore matters of common interest including global commercial announcements.

ARTICLE III:	INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS
1.	Conformity with Agreement
The Employer may enter into individual contracts with Musicians provided that such contracts are not in conflict with this Agreement. The provisions contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be included in and made part of all individual agreements between the Employer and individual Musicians, whether or not they are set forth in such individual agreements.
2.	Presumed Clause
Except for contracts on official forms prescribed by the Federation deemed to be incorporated which have been entered into in conformity with the provisions of this Agreement, the following provision shall be included in and—whether or not so included—shall be deemed part of all contracts calling for recording services (whether sound or visual) between the Employer and Musicians: “This contract shall not become effective unless and until it shall be approved by the International Executive Board of the American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada or by a duly authorized agent thereof.”
3.	Individually Created Content
No rate of compensation established in this Agreement relates or is intended to relate to services rendered by an individual instrumentalist performing alone who creates or composes the musical content of his performance. Compensation in excess of the rates provided herein shall be paid to such an instrumentalist in accordance with individual agreement between the Employer and such instrumentalist. To the extent practicable, such individual agreement shall be negotiated prior to the time of performance.
4.	Termination of agreement
Any individual contract in existence at the termination of this Agreement (whether such termination is caused by expiration, breach, or otherwise), made and entered into by the Employer for the employment of and rendition of services by Musicians, shall not impose any obligation on the part of members of the Federation to render further musical services for the Employer on work covered by this Agreement unless this Agreement is renewed or a new one entered into permitting the same. In the event this Agreement is not renewed or a new one is not entered into prior to or immediately upon the expiration of this Agreement, such members may, at their option, render services to any others without obligation or liability to the Employer.

ARTICLE IV:	TRANSFER OF RIGHTS
1.	Federation Approval
Without the prior written permission of the Federation*, the Employer shall not use or grant any rights to use—whether by way of sale, assignment, mortgage, lease, gift, license or other transfer of title or permission to use, and whether by operation of law or otherwise (herein called “transfer”)—in whole or in part, any commercial announcement, film, videotape or recording, which, in whole or in part, embodies pictures of Musicians rendering musical performances or which embodies or is accompanied by performances by Musicians recorded and/or photographed under this Agreement, for purposes other than those permitted under this Agreement.
*The Federation has advised that it shall grant permission provided that:
(a)	the Employer has required a buyer, licensee, or other authorized transferee (“Licensee”) to become responsible for session payments and benefits (including pension contributions, but excluding health and welfare contributions), and any applicable use/re-use payments that would be required under the then effective applicable Federation agreement, and the Employer has provided the Federation with evidence of, or an extract of, the provision in the license agreement by which the Licensee has agreed to make those payments; or
(b)	the Employer has agreed in writing to make the session and benefit payments (including pension contributions, but excluding health and welfare contributions) to those musicians who rendered services in the production of the commercial announcement that would be required under the then effective applicable Federation agreement.
2.	Assumption Agreement
Any transfer of a commercial announcement, film, videotape or recording produced under this Agreement, or any rights therein, shall be subject to the rights and duties of the Employer established by this Agreement. No such transfer shall be effective unless and until (1) the Federation shall have received and approved an assumption agreement substantially in the form and substance set forth in Exhibit A hereof (which approval the Federation shall not unreasonably delay or unreasonably withhold) duly executed by the person, firm, or corporation receiving such transfer (“transferee”), or (2) the transferee, in addition to executing and delivering to the Federation such assumption agreement, shall have posted a surety company bond with the Federation guaranteeing to the Federation and the persons covered by this Agreement the performance by such transferee of its obligations pursuant to such assumption agreement. A transfer which shall become effective in accordance with the foregoing shall relieve the transferor of obligations under this agreement relating to the commercial announcement so transferred.

ARTICLE V:	GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION
1.	Scope or Grievances
Any disputes or controversies of any kind between any Musician(s) or the Federation and an Employer arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (including, but not limited to, disputes concerning the meaning, interpretation, application or enforcement of the provisions set forth in this Agreement) shall be resolved exclusively through the procedure set forth in this Article.
2.	Step 1—Initiation of Grievances
Within 60 calendar days after the occurrence of the event that gave rise to the grievance or after the date that the aggrieved party reasonably could have learned of that event, whichever is later, a grievance must be submitted in writing to the Employer by the Federation on its own or on behalf of the individual Musician(s) or to the Federation by the Employer. The grievance shall be submitted on a form as set forth in Exhibit C. Failure to follow the time limits specified above shall be grounds for rejecting the grievance.
3.	Step 2—Resolution Meeting
Within 15 calendar days from receipt of the grievance, a representative designated by the Federation and a representative designated by the Employer shall meet to discuss the matter and attempt to resolve the dispute informally.
4.	Step 3—written answer
If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute at that meeting, the party against whom the grievance is filed shall submit a written answer to the grievance within 15 calendar days after the resolution meeting.
5.	Step 4—demand for arbitration
If either party to this Agreement is not satisfied with the answer or if no answer is submitted within the time limit specified, the dissatisfied party may elect to submit the dispute to arbitration by notifying both the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and the other party in writing within 30 calendar days after the date the answer was due. The written demand for arbitration shall include a copy of the grievance that was filed and the answer, if any.
6.	Selection of Arbitrator
At the time arbitration is invoked, the party invoking arbitration shall request that the AAA furnish the parties to the dispute a panel of nine arbitrators who are members of the AAA. Arbitration shall be conducted in either New York City, Chicago, or Los Angeles, or such other city which the parties agree to, with due consideration to factors such as where the grievance arose, where the parties are located, where the relevant records are located, or other factors peculiar to the case. The panel of arbitrators furnished by the AAA shall be generally from the area where the arbitration is to take place. Within seven working days from the receipt of the AAA panel, the parties shall select a single arbitrator from the panel utilizing, if necessary, an alternate striking process until a single arbitrator remains who shall then become the selected
Printing 07/07/06
10
Television and Radio Commercial Announcements agreement
October 17,2004 - October 16,2007
arbitrator. If no arbitrator on the original panel is acceptable to either party, the parties may request a second panel of arbitrators from the AAA and go through the same process within the same time limits set out above. No future panels may be requested by the parties after the second panel.
7.	Hearing and Award
When the arbitrator has been selected, the parties shall immediately confer with him/her to determine the earliest practicable date for a hearing. Fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the proceeding itself (e.g., court reporter) shall be borne equally by the parties. The arbitrator’s award shall be rendered within 30 calendar days of the close of the hearing or 30 calendar days after submission of post-hearing briefs, where applicable. The award of the arbitrator shall constitute a final and binding resolution of the dispute with respect to all parties—the individual Musician(s), the Federation and its Locals, and the Employer. The arbitrator shall have the power and authority to issue an award that he/she may deem appropriate, but shall not have the power or authority to amend, add to or subtract from, or alter in any manner the provisions of this Agreement.
8.	Extension
Any of the time limits set forth above may be extended by mutual agreement in writing.

ARTICLE VI:	REPORTING
1.	Obligation to Report
The Employer shall file the Reporting Form set forth in Exhibit B—or such other form used by Employer containing the same information—to report all session, re-use, conversion (called “new use” in prior Agreements) or dubbing information required under this Agreement. The Reporting Form shall accompany each payment required under this Agreement, with three copies sent to the applicable AFM Local, one copy sent to the AFM-EP Fund, and one copy retained by the Employer. No additions to the printed Reporting Form as set forth in Exhibit B are permitted without the prior approval of the Federation and Industry.
2.	Single Payment for Multiple Services
Employers may, at their discretion, combine multiple payments to individuals for services rendered within the jurisdiction of a single AFM Local, provided that the single payment is accompanied by all necessary back-up documentation to the Local, to the Local Health & Welfare Fund when applicable, to the AFM-EP Fund, and to the Musicians specifying each item included in the payment.
3.	Completion of Reporting Forms; Reporting Violations
It is the responsibility of the Leader or Contractor to make sure that the Reporting Form is completed so that all appropriate information is provided including the identification of the instrument played or the musical service rendered by each Musician listed.
The following practices shall be considered to be violations of this Agreement:
(a)	To place any person on the Reporting Form unless such person actually performs a musical service (including arranging, orchestrating, and copying) covered by this Agreement and that Reporting Form.
(b)	For the Leader or Contractor to intentionally misrepresent or repeatedly fail to provide any information required on the Reporting Form.

Instrumentalists, Leaders and Contractors shall be paid not less than the rates set forth below and the conditions set forth shall apply,
1.	Minimum Call Session
There shall be a minimum call session of one hour during which no more than three music tracks may be recorded, the total length of which may not exceed three minutes in the aggregate, except as provided in Articles IX and X. Musicians may be called on a staggered basis for the same session.
2.	Guaranteed Length of Call
Each call must be for a specified and guaranteed period of time, which may be extended although no Musician shall be obligated to more than 40 additional minutes without his/her consent.
3.	Overtime
A.	Continuous Overtime
Overtime continuously following a session, during which one additional one-minute music track may be recorded for each 20 minutes of such overtime (except as provided in Articles IX and X), shall be paid for in 20-minute increments. The overtime rate to be paid shall be based on the total number of Musicians who incur overtime. For one Musician the rate shall be one-third of the single Musician session fee rate for each 20-minute overtime increment. For two or more Musicians, the rate shall be one-third of the “2 or more” session fee rate for each 20-minute overtime increment.
B.	Non-Continuous Overtime
Any work which is not continuous shall be paid for as additional sessions.
4.	Single advertiser
Only commercial announcements advertising the products of a single advertiser may be made during any one session and the overtime related thereto.
5.	Meal period
With respect to any Musician for whom a session call is more than six hours—or for whom the session extends beyond six hours as a result of overtime—a meal period of not less than one-half hour nor more than one hour shall be provided not later than six hours after the Musician reports for work.

6.	Rest Periods
There shall be a rest period of not less than five minutes duration during the first hour of work. In each subsequent hour of work, there shall be a rest period of not less than ten minutes duration. Any breach of the foregoing shall require an additional payment equivalent to a 20-minute overtime increment.
7.	Contractor Required
If ten or more Side Musicians and Leader are employed for any session, a Contractor shall be employed with respect to said session. Such Contractor must be present during the entire recording session. The Contractor may be one of the Side Musicians. No person shall be employed as a Contractor (or continue in employment as a Contractor) who is disapproved by the Federation according to lists published by the Federation in the “International Musician” or to specific notice to the Employer provided that such disapproval shall not be predicated upon non-membership in the Federation under circumstances in which such membership may not be required lawfully.
8.	Leaders And Contractors Paid Double
The base scale for Leaders and for Contractors shall be double the base scale of pay applicable to the Side Musicians employed in the session, but in any event, the base scale for any person performing both as Contractor and as Leader or Side Musician shall not exceed double Side Musician’s base scale.
When a Leader or Contractor also performs as a Side Musician, the scale payment for the Leader or the Contractor includes the performance of a single instrumental part. The scale payment for any additional instrumental part(s) as provided in Article VII (12) shall be the Side Musician’s scale rate for each such part.
9.	Single musician
If only one person actually performs, whether or not more than one person has been engaged for the session, such sole performer shall be paid double the Side Musician’s base scale.
10.	Same Musician
The same Musician may not be reported on more than one line for the same instrument at any session, unless such Musician performs multiple instrumental parts as provided in Article VH (12). This provision shall not affect the right of any Musician to receive residual payments based on overscale.
11.	Doubling
When one or more doubles are played by any Instrumentalist in any one session and the overtime related thereto, for the first double, the Instrumentalist who doubles shall be paid not less than an additional 30% of the base scale otherwise applicable for the session and the overtime related thereto, plus an additional 15% of such base scale for each double beyond the first. When a Leader or Contractor doubles, the additional fee due shall be computed at the Side Musician’s base scale and not on the Leader or Contractor’s base scale even when the Leader is the only Musician employed to render services.

(iv)	Latin rhythm instruments: Any Latin instruments when used in less than eight bars in connection with any other instrument or used not in a rhythm pattern
B.	Electronic Device Doubling
If, in addition to the normal sound of an instrument, an electronic device (i.e., multiplex, divider, maestro, multiplier of octaves) is used to simulate other instrumental sounds, such use shall be construed as a double.
C.	Instruments Requested But Not Played
A $12.00 fee will be paid each Musician directed by the Employer or his representative to bring to an engagement an additional instrument, which would require a doubling fee if played, if such instrument is not actually played at the engagement.
12.	Multiple Parts
If a Musician performs multiple instrumental parts (other than doubles), he/she shall be paid the total of all payments which would otherwise have been payable had separate Musicians been used for those parts.
This provision shall also apply whenever the same music is played and recorded more than once and the tracks are combined in a manner which results in a final music track which sounds as if it had been recorded by a larger group of Musicians than actually rendered services.
Where a Musician is listed on more than one line on the Reporting Form because the Musician performed multiple parts, that fact should be identified on that Report.

ARTICLE VIII:	STANDARD RECORDING RATES
(Called National Recording Rates in previous Agreements)
1.	Base Scale—Session Fees
The Base Scale pay for each Side Musician employed on a session except for all Regional and Local Commercial Announcements (Article IX and Article X) shall be as follows:
No. of Musicians	Base Scale Per Musician
Leader, Contractor, Single Musician......... $220.00
Side Musician................................ $ 110.00
2.	Maximum Number of Commercials Per Session
A maximum of three commercial announcements may be claimed for any original one-hour minimum call session. One additional commercial announcement may be claimed for each additional 20 minutes or part thereof that has been paid as part of the original session.
In computing the maximum number of commercial announcements which may be claimed, the Employer shall be limited to the number of commercial announcements which may be claimed for the Side Musician with the lowest reported hours worked for such session (including overtime, if any). For purposes of this computation, the services of Arranger, Orchestrator or Copyist shall not be considered.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any session where the music is produced entirely by means of synthesizer(s), no more than eight commercial announcements may be claimed even if the number of reported hours worked exceeds two hours and forty minutes.
Example A: For a session lasting two hours and forty minutes of consecutive time in the aggregate, hours worked are reported as follows:
Leader:............................................... 2:40
Side Musician A:...................................... 2:40
Side Musician B:...................................... 2:00
Side Musician C:....................................... 1:20
The maximum number of commercial announcements which may be claimed by the Employer for the session would be four (three for the initial hour, plus one for an additional twenty minutes), because the 1:20 reported for Side Musician C amounted to the lowest reported hours for any of the Musicians who performed at the session.
Example B: Four music tracks are recorded in a session lasting one hour and twenty minutes of consecutive time in the aggregate and hours worked are reported as follows:
Printing 07/07/06
19
Television and Radio Commercial announcements agreement
October 17,2004 - October 16,2007
Leader:............................................... 1:20
Side Musicians A, B	& C:............................... 1:20 each
Side Musician D:....................................... 1:00
Even though four tracks were actually recorded, the maximum number of commercial announcements which may be claimed by the Employer for the session would be three because the 1:00 reported for Side Musician D amounted to the lowest reported hours for any of the Musicians who performed at the session.
Payment for the initial use cycles of the first three commercial announcements incorporating any one of the tracks is covered by the Initial Use payment. If any one of the music tracks recorded at the session is incorporated into an additional commercial announcement or any subsequent commercial announcement, payment of the applicable use fee or re-use fee for the initial cycle shall be due to the Leader, Side Musician(s), Sideline Musician(s) and music preparation personnel who performed services on the tracks so used.

Except as provided in this Article XU, Editing, in Article IX, Regional Commercial Announcements and in Article X, Local Commercial Announcements, changes in the words which accompany or are under or over the music of a sound track shall not thereafter be altered nor shall any words be added after the music is recorded without creating a new commercial announcement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, permission is hereby granted to Employer during the term of this Agreement to do the following:
A.	Add Announcer Copy
To add announcers advertising copy over recorded music not later than ten weeks subsequent to the recording of the music, provided that no announcers copy may be added once there already is announcers copy in the commercial announcement or after the first broadcast in any medium, and provided that Musicians are paid total compensation at least equivalent to the total number of commercial announcements produced.

Television and Radio Commercial Announcements Agreement
October 17,2004 - October 16,2007
D.	Informational and Promotional Changes
(1)	To make copy and/or video changes over the recorded music of a commercial, provided such changes are limited to destinations, points and times of departures, frequency of service, telephone numbers, rates, pricing, availability, dates, and dealer identification. Such changes may be made without creating new or additional commercials, provided all versions are identical except for changes otherwise permitted under this Article XU Editing.
(2)	To make copy and/or video changes over the recorded music of a commercial to reflect modifications necessary for short promotional messages. Such changes shall be limited to special offers, sales or giveaways, sweepstakes or sales events, whether offered by the advertiser or the designated dealer. These changes may be made without creating a new or additional commercial provided all versions are identical except for changes otherwise allowable under this Article XI Editing, and provided that:
(a)The promotion may be referenced only once, although it may appear anywhere in the commercial.
(b)The promotion must be in the nature of a “tag” as that term is commonly used in the industry.
For every 13-week cycle of use of any commercial incorporating any changes referred to in (1) and/or (2) above, including the first use cycle, the Musicians shall receive 200% of the applicable re-use fee set forth in Article XIV, Paragraph 5 at page 43 (e.g., $165.00 for a side musician who has not doubled and $330.00 for a leader/arranger/orchestrator/contractor). This Subparagraph (D) shall not apply to commercials for which regional or local rates are being paid.
3.	Mechanical Editing
Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to permit the mechanical editing of any sound track or recording made hereunder for the purpose of making a shorter or longer version for use hereunder, unless the Musicians are paid therefor under this Agreement, except as specifically permitted by the next section.
A.	Shorter or Longer Music Tracks
Whenever a music track is mechanically shortened or lengthened to a different music track length, the Musicians whose services are utilized on the shortened or lengthened track shall be paid a dubbing fee.
Printing 07/07/06
37
Television and Radio Commercial Announcements Agreement
October 17,2004 - October 16,2007
B.	No Bearing on Total Length of Commercial
This mechanical editing provision applies only with respect to lengthening and/or shortening recorded music track(s) and bears no relationship whatsoever to the length of the commercial in which said music track(s) is incorporated or to the use of music tracks in the length originally recorded.
EXAMPLE:
(i)	In a two-hour session music tracks of the following lengths are recorded: 40 seconds, 30 seconds and 20 seconds. These music tracks may be used in a maximum of six commercials broadcast in the same medium. If two of said tracks are mechanically edited to 15 seconds and 10 seconds, two dubbing fee payments shall be made to the Musicians (one for the 15 second music track and one for the 10-second music track) regardless of whether or not the Employer has utilized all six commercials which he/she is entitled to pursuant to the original session. These two dubbing payments shall entitle the Employer to use the new 15-second music track in one commercial broadcast in the same medium and similarly the new 10-second length music track in one commercial broadcast in the same medium.
(ii)	In a one-hour session music tracks of the following lengths are recorded: 60 seconds and 30 seconds. These music tracks may be used in a maximum of three commercials broadcast in the same medium. If, after three commercials have been broadcast, it is decided to use the 30-second music track in two more commercials and the 60-second music track in one more commercial, three dubbing fees shall be due the Musicians for these additional three commercials broadcast in the same medium.
(iii)	In a one-hour session a 20-second music track is recorded; this music track may be used in a maximum of three commercial announcements broadcast in the same medium.
C.	Use Payments for a Mechanically Edited TV Commercial Broadcast Simultaneously with Original Commercial
With respect to television commercials only:
If the video portion of a commercial is mechanically edited to make a single shorter or longer commercial, and either:
(i)	the music track of both versions is identical, or
(ii)	the music track has been re-recorded solely for purposes of timing and synchronization or has been mechanically lengthened or shortened to fit a longer or shorter version,
Then, with respect to the second and all subsequent 13-week cycles, both the commercial and its version shall be considered a single commercial for the purpose of making use payments.
Printing 07/07/06
38
Television and Radio Commercial Announcements Agreement
October 17,2004 - October 16,2007
EXAMPLE:
(a)	A 30-second TV commercial contains a 12-second music track;
•	The video portion is mechanically edited to make a 15-second commercial; and
•	The identical 12-second music track is included in the 15-second version.
In this example, the 30-second commercial and 15-second version may be considered a single commercial commencing with the second 13-week use cycle because the music track of both versions is identical.
(b)	A 30-second TV commercial contains a 20-second music track;
•	The video portion is mechanically edited to make a 15-second commercial; and
•	The 20-second music track is mechanically shortened (not recorded "live") to 10 seconds to fit the 15-second version or the 20-second music track is re-recorded to 10 seconds to fit the 15-second version.
In this example, the 30-second commercial and 15-second version may be considered a single commercial commencing with the second 13-week use cycle because the music track was mechanically shortened to fit the shorter version or the music track was re-recorded solely for purposes of timing and synchronization to fit the shorter version.
Note, however, that payment of a Dubbing Fee shall be required when a mechanically edited music track is incorporated into a version under this Section. (See Article XII, Paragraph 3(A) of the Agreement.)
4.	Changes Required By Law, Broadcast Standards and Language Translations
The following alterations may be made in a commercial announcement without changing it into a new or additional commercial announcement for the purpose of this Agreement:
(a)	The on and/or off-camera message of a commercial announcement made for a designated advertiser and/or product shots contained therein may be varied (but only to the extent necessary) for compliance with legal requirements, broadcast standards and practices, and any other regulations which affect the acceptability of the commercial for broadcast. The Employer must advise the Office of the President of the Federation of each change made and the reasons therefor. This notice must be sent, whenever possible, before first air date, but in no event later than 10 business days after first air date.
(b)	The off-camera message of a commercial announcement or any words shown in a commercial announcement made for a designated advertiser may be recorded or translated in the United States or in Canada in any language.

ARTICLE XIV:	USE/RE-USE
(Applicable to all Commercials except Regional, Local and Internet Commercial Announcements—Articles IX, X and XI)
1.	Initial Use
Upon the first use of a commercial announcement claimed for an original session occurring on or after May I, 1991, a single, one-time payment at the applicable rate provided below (plus appropriate adjustment for doubling if any) shall be made to each Musician whose services are reported for such session, regardless of the hours of employment at the session:
Leader, Contractor, Single Musician...................... $62.00
Side Musician, Sideline Musician......................... $31.00
Orchestrator, Arranger................................... $62.00
Copyist...................................................$31.00
Upon such payment, all of the commercial announcements claimed for the same session may be used during their respective initial use cycles commencing with their respective dates of first use, without additional payment.
The Initial Use cycle of a commercial announcement shall be a period of 13 weeks (“initial cycle”) from the date of first broadcast either by television stations or by radio stations.
2.	1 3-Week Re-Use Cycles
The first additional broadcast after the expiration of the initial cycle and in the same broadcast medium shall start a new 13-week cycle. The first broadcast in such broadcast medium following the second 13-week cycle shall start a new 13-week cycle, etc. The end of one 13-week cycle and the commencement of the next such cycle need not be contiguous.
3.	8-Week Use and Re-Use Cycles-Radio Commercials Only
Use cycles for radio commercials may be 8 weeks or 13 weeks, whichever the Employer elects. In those cases where the Employer elects to pay for an 8-week cycle,
•	the Use fee
•	the Re-Use fee
•	the Dubbing fee
•	the Conversion fee
shall be 80% of the 13-week Use fee, 80% of the Re-Use fee, 80% of the Dubbing fee or 80% of the Conversion fee, whichever applies.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a music track for a television commercial produced under a prior AFM Television and Radio Commercial Announcement Agreement, if such track is dubbed into a radio commercial produced on or after May 1, 1987, the Conversion fee shall be 100% for the first such use cycle and the Re-Use fee shall be 80% for subsequent 8-week Re-Use cycles.
Printing 07/07/06
42
Television and Radio Commercial Announcements Agreement
October 17,2004 - October 16,2007
The session fee shall not be affected by this provision.
4.	Short Term Use
Upon payment of a dubbing fee, up to three different commercials made for the same advertiser may be broadcast in a single medium during a period of 13 weeks from the date of first broadcast of the first commercial, provided that the three commercials are used for a period not to exceed ten weeks in the aggregate during the 13-week cycle.
EXAMPLE
A single Dubbing Fee is paid for TV use of Commercials A, B and C, all produced with the same Musicians and for the same advertiser. They are used during a 13-week cycle which starts 4/1 and ends 6/30 in the following manner:
Commercial A.............1	week.....................4/1	- 4/7
Commercial B.............3	weeks....................4/15 - 5/6
Commercial C.............3	weeks....................6/1	- 6/22
Aggregate Use:...........7	weeks
In this example all use of the three commercials is covered by payment of a single Dubbing Fee because the aggregate use is less than 10 weeks during the 13-week cycle.
5.	Use/Re-Use Rates
The 13-week and 8-week cycle payments for each commercial announcement made under this Agreement or music track converted for use in a different medium as described in Article XIV, Paragraph 6 below shall be made to each person covered by this Agreement as provided in the 13-Week and 8-Week Use/Re-Use Rate Schedules set forth on page 45.
It is specifically intended that a commercial announcement which has not been changed, visually or orally, in any manner whatsoever may only be claimed as one commercial announcement.
If only one commercial announcement is produced using the music track(s) recorded at the session and such commercial announcement is not changed, visually or orally in any manner, each cycle beyond the first must be paid for at the applicable re-use fees. It is not permitted to produce one commercial only and declare two or three unless the second and third are different commercials either visually or orally.
