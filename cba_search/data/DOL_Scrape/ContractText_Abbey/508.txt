Dear Ms. Morgan:	-	■	. ' '
On August 25, 2003, PG&E and IBEW Local 1245 concluded general negotiations, with the assistance of a Federal Mediator, for the IBEW Physical Agreement. Both parties made'changes to their respective positions to reach'agreement on this table settlement. '
One of the changes contained in the Physical table settlement is to grant a one-time payment equal to the amount employees would have received if the general wage increase had been .implemented on January 1, 2003.. The one-tinie payment applies to employees on the active , payroll on the date of ratification of the Physical Agreement This one-time payment will apply to str3iy ht*tirr!Ck Qv&rtiiYiG 3rid 401 (k.) sncf will be msde 2s soon ss procticsl on 2 psycheck The 401 (kj deduction and Company match will be based on the employee’s 401 (k) contribution election as of August 31,2003.	. '	■ .	.	v ,	•-
The Company proposes upon ratification of the Physical Agreement, that the one-time payment cited above also apply to employees represented by ESC Local 20, taking into consideration the $900 lump sum payment that has already been made. The 401 (k) deduction and Company match , will be based on the employee's 401 (k) contribution election as of May 31, 2003.’ The retroactive .amount will be calculated for each ESC employee. If the retroactive amount comes out to more than $900, the employee will receive the difference. If the amount comes out less than $900, no deduction will be made and the employee will not receive any additional pay.	'
The inclusion of 401(k) deductions to be made from the retroactive pay is contingent upon approval by the Employee Benefits Committee. Company will submit a similar letter agreement to IBEW Local 1245, proposing to treat IBEW Clerical bargaining unit employees in the same manner.	’ ■.'	'

.	The submission Agreement in Item 4 provides that the parties may at any time agree to resolve the .issue and withdraw it from arbitration. As a means of accomplishing this, we propose the following understanding:	■	•	.
_	1. The Company does not intend that authorized Division Engineering Estimator classifications be replaced by General Construction Field Engineers, Field Engineering Technicians, or Senior Field Engineering Technicians, nor that such field engineering personnel be utilized for the
■	purpose of precluding the ultimate authorization of additional regular Estimator classification. '
The assignment of such personnel to a location where a Gas or Electric ADE works for the
• ’ purposes set forth hereafter in Item 2 of this Agreement for more than a cumulative total of 18 months in a 24-month consecutive period shall be presumed to be " ... for the purpose of precluding the authorization of additional regular Estimator classifications..." in that location and line of progression.	’	.	, ' ■	'
2.	General Construction employees classified as Field Engineering Technician, Senior Field ■ Engineering Technician and, when operational needs are demonstrated, Field Engineer may be
. assigned to work under the direct.supervision of Division personnel provided, however, that ■ such assignment shall be restricted’to a period riot to exceed 9 months except for an additional
. period of time required to complete his present work assignment not to exceed 30 days. * . ■
3.	The parties recognize that special or emergency circumstances may arise which, though temporaryJn nature, may require assignments exceeding the time limitations set forth in items 1 . . . and 2 above. ■ Should such circumstances arise, time limitations will not be extended without
prior discussion between Company and Union. .	-	■
4.	Upon completion of such an assignment to a Division, General Construction field engineering personnel described above shall be given a performance review by Division supervision, a copy ' of this review shall be forwarded to General Construction supervision for inclusion in the . ' employee's personnel record.	■ ’

5.	The Company will provide training as appropriate to those employees in General Construction performing estimating services, arid rotate such employees between estimating and other Field Engineering Technician assignments with the intent-to'provide the requisite experience for progression to'the Senior Field Engineering Technician classification. Once an employee has progressed to Senior Field Engineering Technician such rotations need not be effected.
6.	General Construction employees classified as Field Engineer, Field Engineering Technician, and Senior Field Engineering Technician who have completed six months estimating as defined in Item 2 above, after appointment to the Engineering Estimator classification, shall be entitled to accelerate through the Estimator Training Program at '4.5 months per module. Additionally, Field' Engineering Technicians will be credited with having completed module one. Field Engineers and Senior Field Engineering technicians will receive credit for having completed the first two ETP modules.	*	'	.	' .	' a
7.	After appointment to a Senior Engineering Estimator, classification, such employee’s time spent in the'classifications of Field Engineer, Field Engineering Technician, (or Senior Field Engineering Technician, while on loan to a Division, or while preparing estimates charged to a Division'fto the extent that it cdn be reasonably ascertained at the time), shall be considered as Engineering Estimator or Senior Engineering Estimator time for purposes of wage progression
. (Title 15), promotions (Title 21), and demotion and layoff (Title 22).-	'	.

Pursuant to Letter Agreement 93-27 -and in accordance with Section 26.1 of the Agreement between -the Company-and ESC,'the parties propose as a result of negotiations the following:
1.	■ Company agrees'to the establishment of a monthly Labor Management Committee whose ‘ ■ goals will include free and open communication, mutual respect for the legitimate needs of the respective parties, informal problem solving, and the" promotion of harmony and efficiency to .
' ' the end that the Company, the Union and the general public may benefit.
2.	' Voluntary Severance offer to all Design and Drafting classifications (including EA positions) ■ capped at 16.

No layoffs through September 30,1994.- This no-layoff policy does'not include ■ those employees who elect severance rather that relocate to field positions.	>
3.	Company agrees to redeployment as follows:	.	’	.	■
A. Redeployment within the General Office complex will follow the principles of Section ■
,	'	22.9 of the Agreement in so far-as possible considering the Company's operational
■	requirements regarding the Engineering disciplines needed.for particular work groups.
-	B.	If redeployment of personnel from the San Francisco General Office Complex to remote <

' - * - * ’ * ' * ,
4.	Company and Union agree to cooperate in an effort to accomplish Engineering and Drafting workiutilizing PG&E personnel to the fullest extent feasible within operational constraints. The ■	■ mutual’gbal will be.to contract out work to accommodate peak work loads that-can’t be •
t accomplished by existing staff at the time the contract is let, for specific expertise not ' available in house, to meet unanticipated time constraints set by clients, or if it is more cost effective. The parties agree that contracting will not be used for the purpose of dispensing with the services of PG&E employees. .	■	.	‘,
‘ A. ■ Exhibit 1 is Company's proposal for the Building and:Site Unit formerly a part of ENCON ,	Business Unit and currently residing in the General Services Organization.	.

Further, this joint ad hoc committee will review, and negotiate a clarification of the language set forth in paragraph 12.a of the 1987 cover letter to the Agreement.
,	‘ Further, the Company agrees to utilize-the procedures set forth in LOA 93-7 with regard
to the contracting of work.	.	■
5.	Company and Union agree that training and maximum utilization of employee skills optimize . productivity and performance. Company proposes to delineate the desired qualifications - including demonstrated skills oreducation requirements for classifications and to provide ’
training where it is needed. Union in turn recognizes that training is mandatory and - _ ‘ employees must be willing and able to adapt to the new technologies and methods of doing
‘ work. Both parties agree that the employee has a role'in assuming responsibility for.his/her ' development. Company.recognizes that different employees learn at different speeds, and the importance of creating an environment that is encouraging and conducive to learning.
‘ • ■ ■* » » . , 6. FJG&E Management arid ESC are committed to efficiency, timeliness and quality in the work place. These goals are furthered by utilizing each worker to the maximum of his/her current ■ abilities and making work assignments that promote growth of those abilities. ,	'
Current rigid jurisdictional guidelines are often impediments to the above stated goal.
. ■ Therefore, for a six month pilot period, the parties shall institute the following system to • ’ promote mutual trust and cooperation in the achievement of the above stated goal. At the end of the pilot period, the system will be evaluated for possible improvements or may be abandoned if either party is dissatisfied. k	'
A., If a bargaining unit employee is assigned exempt duties in accordance with the above
■	. goals, the Union will neither claim jurisdiction to the assigned work, nor will the Union
■ demand upgrade pay for Senior Design Engineers. Company agrees to pay Design	‘
Engineers performing exempt functions upgrade pay to Sr. Design Engineer, .	,
Assignment of exempt job functions to particular employees shall be at Management's
- discretion, but will be voluntary. Employees performing such duties will not be subject to discipline during the pilot for work beyond their job description. Work experience s gained during'the pilot will not be cited as qualifications for promotion within the
. . bargaining Unit	.	'
B. ‘ The parties agree that the most efficient procedures may occasionally require performance of a minor amount of bargaining unit work to exempt engineers. If a ‘ dispute arises over the question of exempt employees doing bargaining unit work; the, ■ issue will first be raised at a monthly ^.abor Management Meeting. The purpose of ■ ' discussion will be to resolve the problem in light of the above stated goal? Once the - 1 issue is resolved to the satisfaction of both parties, it will no longer be subject to the ‘ grievance procedure. It is anticipated that the vast majority of issues raised will be
v -resolved in Labor Management. -	-	.
7.	' The Ad Hoc Committee and its sub-committees will continue to work toward finding mutual solutions to identified problems, and to propose methods-for accomplishing the goals set forth

1.	The BSEC Design Unit will retain all Design and-Drafting employees remaining after VS I is '
' ■ completed, with the exception that one of the three Civil Design Engineers will be reassigned ' to the Transmission Group. ’	'	'
2a. PRIMARY FUNCTION—The Design Unit will specialize in building interior architectural work, . including new and existing-space planning'and programming, interior HVAC, plumbing, power ■ and lighting design, and interior renovation work. ,	■	■_
’ 2b. SECONDARY FUNCTION-The Design Unit will also perform other work for which its '	•
employees are qualified, including Green Lights program electrical and lighting design,
* Americans with Disabilities Act modifications, underground tank and wash rack mechanical design, and landscaping renovations and maintenance design and planning and civil site ' maintenance. Work assignments outside the scope of Paragraph 2a will be performed -' - subject to the availability of qualified employees.	' .
■ '	■	.	'	i
2c. Tasks performed by Bargaining Unit employees in this unit include: client contact, defining ' scopes of work, preparing and issuing proposals, preparing cost estimates, preparing , ■	construction .documents, conducting field .inspection, preparing preliminary sketches and ‘
. layout, preparing design criteria, performing design, preparing drawings, preparing , ■ . calculations, approving and stamping desigris/drawings, preparing procedure documents,' checking shop drawings, responding to field questions, preparing as-built drawings, obtaining . permits, recording drawings; performing technical review of submittals, and providing field and ' construction support. The performance of management duties will not be voluntary in this group. Company recognizes that it is advantageous to both parties to have only those .
'	1 employees with the most capabilities perform such duties; In the event it is necessary to fill a
vacancy in a Senior position, Company and Union will meet to mutually determine if a license .. should be a mandatory requirement for that vacancy.	■ *
2d.' Senior Design Engineers performing previously exempt duties will not receive upgrade pay. Company agrees to pay Design Engineers performing previously exempt functions upgrade
. pay to Senior Design Engineer. Management retains jurisdiction over ail exempt duties ’ assigned to the Bargaining Unit-and can at any time elect to no longer have those duties performed by the Bargaining Unit. The Union agrees that exempt duties performed as a ■ result of this Agreement will not be used-as a precedent for expanding Bargaining Unit • jurisdiction in the future. In the event management elects to no longer have exempt duties ' performed by the Bargaining Unit, this work reduction will not be used as a basis to declare ■ lack of work. 1 '	'	.	■.	■

t
3a. Bargaining Unit employees will have full responsibility for all jobs assigned. Job assignments will come from Project Managers and the Design Unit Supervisor. Senior Design Engineers will perform professional engineering and architectural work and direct the work of others. The
' performance of exempt duties for Design Engineers will be done as needed and assigned by the Senior Design Engineers. Assignment of these duties must be for the substantial portion " of a day before upgrade pay is required. The Design Unit Supervisor maintains final authority over the assignment of exempt duties. The Design Unit Supervisor will coordinate the scheduling of jobs, facilitate communications between the Project Managers and the Design '
. Unit, and perform administrative functions.	‘ ‘	> . ■
3b. Because a collaborative relationship between the Design Unit Supervisor and Bargaining Unit employees is critical to the success’of this innovative approach, Union will appoint 3-5 ‘
. members from the Design Unit to represent Bargaining Unit employees and assist the Design Unit Supervisor in coordinating the work of the unit. Union will also be given an avenue to ’ provide.input in the selection of a Design Unit Supervisor with management retaining all rights to selection.	.-	<	.	'	.
4a. - The long range success of this group will depend on its ability to complete projects on time • with high technical quality at a competitive price. To assure this outcome the transition to selfdirection must be well-planned and supported with appropriate technical training and equipment. The coordination committee established in Paragraph 3b will work with the '
. Design Unit Supervisor to jointly develop recommendations on required training and	'
equipment and will assist in its scheduling and implementation. '	.
► * . * ■ — ’
4b. In calculating the cost of work performed by the Design Unit, fully loaded costswillbe used. -Fully loaded costs include nonproductive and nonbillable time, overtime, benefits, employee
. expenses, space and equipment costs and Corporate overheads and indirects specific to the , • Design Unit The cost of start-up training and equipment provided in 1994 will not be included ■ in calculations of the Design Unit's cost-effectiveness. Company and Union will jointly agree - on a methodology for calculating the Design Unit's comparative costs.	'
4c. To benchmark the competitiveness of the Design Unit, 5% of the work included in the scope of Paragraph 2a will be contracted out on an ongoing basis for the term of the general *
'	Agreement between the Company and ESC. At the end of the four year term, this procedure
’	will be reviewed by both parties and mutual agreement will be needed to continue. This ’
contracting will be done to ensure that projects similar in scope to those regularly performed
. by the Design'Unit are used to gather benchmark information. The Company will not be required to offer overtime before contracting this work. Company willconsult with the Union
. concerning the selection of contracts to be benchmarked. Further, Company will not layoff for • . lack of work while contracting Design Unit work for benchmarking purposes.
5a. Former Building and Site work not within the scope of Paragraph 2a may be contracted out	.
with no requirement for the Company to offer overtime to the Design Unit provided that the employees are fully utilized on 2a work. Before contracting out 2a work, overtime will be offered in accordance with the provisions of the contract.	• '
5b. Union recognizes that targe contracts or contracts for work outside the scope if 2a and 2b may include some portion of 2a and 2b work. Company will not be required to extract that. ‘ work or offer overtime. ■	'	’
5c. decisions to contract out work within the scope of Paragraph 2a will be made in conjunction with the coordination committee established in Paragraph 3b, except in case of an • '
' emergency. The mutual goal will be to contract out work within the scope of Paragraph 2a ‘ only to accommodate peak work loads that can’t be accomplished by existing staff at the time the contract is let, for specific expertise not available in-house, to meet unanticipated time ■
125
I
constraints set by clients, or if it is more cost effective. Contracting will not be utilized for the purpose of dispensing with PG&E employees.	.
5d. If work within the scope of Paragraph 2a is contracted out for any reason the Union steward . . will be notified, given a'Copy of the contract and the reason it was let. Company and Union will work cooperatively to develop a common understanding of the appropriate use of
‘ contracting.'	■	-	■ .	-
«	.	*	J
5e. Except as otherwise provided in this Exhibit, contracting and offering overtime for the Design’ Unit shall follow the provisions of the General Contract between PG&E and the ESC and any ‘ • additions or modifications of that Agreement that have been or will be negotiated between the
. ■ parties. , ’	'	‘	,
■	V	'	, ■	’	• I	■	>
6. ; In the event of a lack of work within the scope of Paragraph ^a.and 2b, Bargaining Unit .
• employees of the Design Unit will be assigned former BSEC work outside the defined scope or assigned work normally performed by other design groups for which they are qualified, or temporarily assigned to another design group. These assignments will only be made if the receiving department has a need. Such temporary assignments are not intended to result in . the contracting out of work within the scope of Paragraph 2a and 2b. If however, employees ' .are committed to other work projects or on loan to other design units, they will be considered unavailable for 2a and 2b work for the period of that commitment. In the event work within 2a or 2b scope is available during this time, Company may contractwithout having to recall those
t employees currently committed.'It is not Company's intent to contract'out large portions of . work during this time and exacerbate the reduced workload upon the return of loaned ’ . employees.	...	'	,
7a. Company and Union will annually review the success of the Design Unit, including cost- . effectiveness, technical quality of the work performed and client satisfaction. Either party may suggest improvements or changes to improve the Design Unit's competitiveness.
7b. Through labor management cooperative efforts, Company and Union will work together to . ' resolve issues involving the self managed work group. The grievance process will only be utilized for self-directed work unit issues that can not be, resolved through these efforts.

Gentlepersons:	,	■	.
Pursuant to Section 22.10 of the Agreement between the'Company and the Engineers and Scientists of California, the parties propose the following agreement concerning the decentralization of the Telecommunications Design and Drafting Unit; .	’	.	_
1.	, Company will ask for volunteers within the Telecommunications Design Unit to relocate to the
■ various field locations identified in Attachment I. In the event there is more than one volunteer, per location, preference will, be given to the senior employee.	.
2.	In any field locations where there are no volunteers, Company may at its discretion upgrade one or more of the remaining vacant positions. These upgraded .positions will once again be offered on a voluntary basis to Telecommunications employees and senidrity^will prevail. In no event ■ will a more-senior employee be permitted.to bump a junior employee who has volunteered for a field position as a result of the application of No. 1 above. '	■	■ ,
‘3. Anyone awarded a position that increases his/her commute to 30 miles or 45 minutes will be , ' awarded a’one-time bonus of $2,000.00 upon transfer. An employee who elects to-move and
receive benefits under Section 22.7 of the Agreement will not be eligible for this bonus. .
4.	In the absence of volunteers as outlined in 1 and 2 above, employees from other departments t (where operations permit) will be afforded the opportunity to volunteer for Telecommunications ' field positions. Positions will be awarded on the basis of seniority and the employee must be
. qualified. .'	'	,	■
' ‘ ‘ * ►
5.	These positions are being filled in accordance with the provisions outlined in Section 22.9.	'
Employees to be displaced will be offered the vacancy at the new headquarters, a vacancy in..
. . their current classification in the General Office Complex, or severance with rehire rights. If the . position is Design Engineer, it wilt be the least senior in the Telecommunications Design Unit. If
• the position is Design Drafter, it will be the junior Design Drafter in the system..	.
127
6.	Company agrees to consider all means possible to fill remote positions prior to displacements. x ' Those means include consideration of other than Unit employees, other line of progression ' ■employees, critical classification status, etc. Company and Union may, if necessary, enter into ,	. ■ >
additional Letter Agreements for the purpose of accomplishing the decentralization in a manner
' most acceptable to both parties. Additionally, if a Design Engineer is forced to relocate/	■
Company will meet with the Union prior to the move to discuss any alternative solutions.	’
7.	An employee who accepts a position in a remote location and incurs a move greater than 75	.
mileswill not be displaced or laid off for a period of two years from the signing of this '	' .
, Agreement.	■

D.	Following successful completion of the Estimator Training Program, an employee shall be reclassified to Senior Engineering Estimator at the lowest step in the progression that will result in at least a 2*1/2 percent wage increase.	>
E.	Within*'30 days from the effective date of this Agreement, Service Planners will be reclassified * . as gas orJelectric Engineering Estimators, -	*
F,	Service Planner duties described in LOA 96-21-ESC are included in the'Estimator .

■ Exhibit I.' These duties, underscored in Exhibit I, may be assigned to all classifications within the Estimator line of progression, ETP modules 1 and 2 are available to help employees develop basic estimating skills in opposite commodity work. \	.
G.	It is the intent of this Agreement.that progression through the ETP Modules and associated On-the-Job training be continuous. Delays in program progression, initiated by the trainee may impact future wage treatment and/or placement status in the Estimating line of 'progression. . "	;	■	'

■	'	.	■	' t
II.	Wage & Training Progression-	.	,
■	A. New hires entering ETp shall be placed at the beginning wage step of Estimator 'and

of this Agreement (at six month intervals). Upon1 successful completion of the training ' ’ program these employees will progress to the Senior Estimator classification.
C. ,When an employee successfully completes a module; his/her wage rate will be increased the next workday to the appropriate wage step, but.no sooner than six months from the •
. start of the module or the last progressive wage increase.	. .

■	D. Progression’shall be contingent on the successful completion of each module until the employee completes.the final ETP' module. The employee will then progress to Senior T Engineering Estimator at the appropriate wage step. The effective date will be either the
.	next workday, or six months from the start of the final module; whichever comes later. '	.
■	• Promotion dates for employees entitled to accelerate may be as early as 4.5 months from -
t start of the final module.	- - .
E.	An employee entering the Estimator classification with a wage rate above the. beg inning ' step of Estimator may .retain that rate as long as it does not exceed the 12-month step of
' Senior Engineering Estimator. If above the latter, the wage rate wilfbe reduced to the 12' month step of Senior Engineering Estimator, The employee will receive no further 'increases (except for general wage increases) until progressing to a module with a wage step higher than his/her own. Upon successful completion of the training program, the .	-

B.	Employees who havfe been removed from the program may npt re-enter ETP in the same commociity without the approval of the ETP Ad Hoc Committee, If they have not already passed the EEI Technical Test Battery, they must meet that test standard before entering an Estimator position in another line of progression/commodity/ Failure to meet the EEI test standard will not preclude employees as defined in Section 3.2 of the Agreement, ■ , from entering non-estimating classifications such as Mapper.	t '
C.	The process for “Incumbents” (Estimators of record as of October 2,1992) and former-	'
Service Planners covered by LA 96-21-ESC differs from the foregoing guidelines. Exhibit . IV describes the procedure for addressing unsatisfactory progress for these employees.

Attention:, Mr. Ben Hudnall, Business Manager	■

This letter cancels and supersedes Letter Agreement R1-92-18-ESC.	‘	,
The purpose of this letter is to further clanfy holiday pay of.employees under the "nine-80'' schedule as described ih-Letter Agreement 93-12, The Company proposes, in certain'situations, employees.be allowed to forfeit only one floating holiday instead of the two .floating holidays currently specified in Letter Agreement 93-12.	.	■
Currently, all employees are entitled to 104'hours of holiday pay, which is the equivalent to, 13 eight-hour holidays. In an eight-hour pay schedule, floating holidays are split up into, three holidays and the 10 fixed holidays listed below:	.	■ -	■ '
New Year's Day	(January 1)	' . ,	.	.	\
Martin L, King, Jr Day	> (Third Monday in January)	'	'	'
President’s Day	t	(Third Monday in Feb)

Veteran's Day	(November 1)	.	‘
■ Thanksgiving Day . ,	(Fourth Thursday in Nov)	,	-■
' Friday after Thanksgiving -/ Christmas Day ~ (December 25)	’	■	' '	■
Broken up into hours the holiday pay amounts to 104 hours:	. '	.
. 10 Fixed Holidays x 8 hours a day ' '	•	=	80 Hours	•	‘
3 Floating Holidays x 8 hours a day	\ =. 24 Hours •	.
' ' ‘	■	* . 104 Hours Total Holiday Pay
The above holiday schedule does not accommodate workers-under the "nine-80" work week because, under this schedule, most days are nine hours instead of the above example of eight hours. The "nine-80" work week has both nine and eight-hour work days, as a result, the' Company and Union have decided, .in Letter Agreement 93-12, that the employee under the "nine-80" work week must forfeit two of the three floating holidays and be paid for the remaining hours . at the end of the year. Ah example of an all nine-hour holiday'schedule is listed below: ,.	'
10 Fixed Holidays x 9.hours a day •	■	'=■ 90 Hours '	.	.	.
1 Floating Holiday x 9 hours a 'day '	'	. =	9 Hours	,	.	.
.	.	.	; 99, Hours Total Holiday Pay '
. ■	. -	...	5 Hours Back Pay	' f
165
■ . ' ■> . '
• Under this agreement the employee is entitled to only one floating holiday even if they have more than one full day of back pay.	* . ’
. The Company proposes, as soon aS an employee has secured eight or more hours of back pay, they may opt to cdnvert this holiday pay into an additional second floating holiday.
' The accumulation of additional holiday pay will occur only when the employees fixed or floating holidays fall on eight-hour days. The following rs an example of an employee who works eight hours every other Monday, while alternate Mondays are non-work days. In this example five fixed holidays land on eight-hour Mondays: ‘	'	.	. •	•
Holiday ‘	■ Date / Day <	•	Holiday Pay	’

' Friday after Thanksgiving '	'	9 hours	'
, Christmas Day (December-25) .	9 hours '	•	■
Floating Holiday	’	> 9 hours- t	'
In this example the employee, receives a total of ninety-four hojiday hours. Therefore, the employee will receive ten hours of back pay. This broken down further below: ■
5 Fixed Holidays x 9 hours a day	•	= 45 Hours	‘	*
1 Floating Holiday x 9 hours a day	‘	=	9 Hours
5 Fixed Holidays x 8 hours a day	• ;	= 40 Hours "	:	•
.	'	94 Hours Total Holiday Pay .
’	>	■ '	- .	, 10 Hours Back Pay ■	'	’
.	*	, I- '	'
In this example.the employee.has the option to either receive ten hours of back pay or take an additional floating holiday of either eight or nine hours and receive the remaining time (one or two ‘ hours) as back pay. . • .	-	'	'	-
*	t
The employee may exercise this option as soon as .it is apparent they will have the sufficient hours to enable them to take the additional floating holiday. "	■	■	.	(
