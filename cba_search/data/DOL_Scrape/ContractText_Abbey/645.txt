C-14 Procedure for Scheduling Employees with Conscientious Objections to Working on Their Day of Sabbath. Unsigned and undated agreement between Safeway and UFCW Local 7.
PROCEDURE FOR SCHEDULING EMPLOYEES WITH CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTIONS TO WORKING ON THEIR DAY OF SABBATH
We have had a number of requests for the procedure in the handling of employees scheduled on a day which is their day of Sabbath. Safeway has entered into an agreement with UFCW which provides certain procedures for accommodating individuals who have such conscientious objections.
Problems can result in a grievance under the contract as well as a possible violation of the laws against discrimination on the basis of religion, so please follow these procedures carefully and call Safeway Inc. Human Resources if necessary.
This procedure, of course, applies only to any employee who advised you:
1.	that they have conscientious objections to working a particular day of the week.
2.	the nature of their conscientious objections, and
3.	the particular day of the week which they are unable to work.
If you have any questions concerning whether the employee actually has bona fide conscientious objections, be certain to contact Employee Relations and review the matter. You also should complete the form attached to these instructions. ask the employee to sign it, and route it to Safeway Inc. Human Resources Department for future reference.
The procedure for scheduling is as follows:
1.	Until noon on Saturday for the following week's schedule an employee may identify and request
an exchange of shifts with any employee junior to him in the same job classification in the store which will result in the employee obtaining their Sabbath as a day off. You may deny this request if the exchange would require an employee to perform duties for which they are not trained, or for some other equally substantial business reason. Otherwise you must grant the request. Seniority shall prevail, and the junior employee cannot refuse to make the trade.
2.	As an option, an employee may identify and request an exchange of shifts with a senior employee
who is willing to make such an exchange. Again, you may deny this request ifthe exchange would require an employee to perform duties for which they are not trained, or for some other equally substantial business reason. Otherwise you must grant the request Seniority shall prevail and the senior employee may refuse lo make the trade.
3.	As a third alternative, an employee may simply decline to work on their day of Sabbath if they cannot trade shifts with anyone else. Such an employee will not be disciplined under the Absenteeism Program except for failure to notify the Company prior to a scheduled shift that he will not work on their day of Sabbath. You will then assess points for failure to call, but not for the absence itself.
66
4.	It an employee cannot make a change of shifts and is scheduled on Iheir day of Sabbath for the entire bid period or for any extended period of lime, it is permissible for that employee to advise you at the beginning of the bid period or other extended period of time that they will not work on such day for the entire three months. Such an employee, if full-time, will not in fact be scheduled 40 hours, but 32 hours. The Company has no obligation to provide 40 hours work under these circumstances.
Attached you will find a form for keeping a record of any such scheduling accommodation.
It is very important that we follow these procedures and complete the attached form in the event we are challenged on our application of the settlement agreement

4.	Before transferring head clerks or other bargaining unil management employees into the Estes Park store, the Employer will first notify Estes Park employees of the position and will consider any Estes
7(J
Park employees who have applied for the position. The Employer will have full discretion, however, to decide whether or not to select an Estes Park employee for the position.
