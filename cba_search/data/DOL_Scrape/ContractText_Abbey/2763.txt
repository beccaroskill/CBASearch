Attainment of the objective of high quality education requires mutual understanding and cooperation between the Board and the Association. To this end, negotiations in good faith between the Board and the Association with a free and open exchange of views are desirable.

9 Grievance Procedure
9	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
9.1	Grievance Claim
A grievance is a claim which alleges that one or more provisions of this Agreement or established District policy has been incorrectly interpreted and applied. Such claim must be based on an event or condition which affects wages, hours and/or conditions of employment of one or more teachers.

The purpose of this procedure is to secure equitable solutions to the problems which from time to time arise, affecting the welfare or working conditions of teachers.

If a teacher or the Association does not present a grievance in writing at Level One within fifteen (15) school days after the event or condition occurred on which the complaint is based, any grievance respective to that matter shall be considered as waived provided the teacher or designated representative knew, or should have known, of the event or condition.
9.3.1.4	Non-Conformance Issues
For issues filed by teachers with the District Non-Conformance Reporting System, the fifteen (15) day limit in Section 9.3.1.3 begins at the time the teacher is informed verbally or in writing of how the District plans to address the non-conformance. This is to allow the possibility of resolving the issue without necessitating a grievance.
9.3.2	Level Two - Superintendent/Designee
9.3.2.1	Written Grievance
If no satisfactory written decision has been rendered within ten (10) school days after the teacher presented the written grievance in Level One, the aggrieved teacher or

10.1	Class Size
10.1.1	Academic Subject Class Sizes
Board policies on academic subject class sizes are subject to modifications for educational organization or specialized or experimental instruction, which shall not violate the intent set forth in such Board policies.
10.1.2	Preparation Time (Elem. Teachers)
In elementary schools, the principal, working with the teaching staff, shall determine the staffing pattern and staff utilization of the school within the Board's teacher-student ratio policy; so long as students receive the instructional time designated by the Board, the principal, working with the teaching staff, may utilize staffing patterns so as to provide preparation time. Educational assistant(s) may also be assigned to assist teachers in or to assume supervisory duties. For the purposes of calculating the number of minutes of preparation time being provided, no block of time less than twenty (20) minutes shall be counted nor shall time before the start of the student contact day or after the end of the student contact day.
Preparation time is for the purpose of improving teaching and learning. The District and the Association have a mutual interest in achieving an average minimum of two hundred (200) minutes per week and forty (40) minutes per day as a goal for individual teacher preparation time. However, in recognition of individual teacher and program needs, a minimum of three hundred sixty (360) minutes of individual teacher preparation time per two-week period (i.e., pay period) will be established for each teacher. Teachers not provided this amount will be compensated per Section 18.22 for the difference between the established threshold and the actual amount of individual teacher preparation time provided. Examples of exceptions to this eligibility for compensation include school assemblies, early release/late start days, emergency drills, field trips, holidays, acts of God, inclement weather and non-student contract days. Building principals, working with the teacher staff, will develop a plan to provide for individual teacher preparation time on early release/late start days on an equitable basis.
10.1.2.1	Provide the Association
Prior to the commencement of each regular school year, the District will provide the Association with the scheduled number of preparation time minutes for every teacher at each elementary school. The District will advise the Association of any material change to these numbers during the course of the school year.

Primary elementary teachers (grade K-3) who have class loads exceeding twentyeight (28) (FTE as calculated in Board policy 4115.2) may, at the teacher's option, have an educational assistant assigned to that teacher's classroom. Intermediate elementary teachers (grades 4-5) who have class loads exceeding thirty (30) (FTE as calculated in Board policy 4115.2) may, at the teacher's option, have an educational assistant assigned to that teacher's classroom. The count will be made after the third Friday in September when official reporting counts are calculated. If the class load drops below the required number, the assignment of the assistant would continue only for the duration of the semester in which the overload occurs, unless the class is subsequently split.
10.1.7.2	Time Line for Assignment of Assistant
After a teacher qualifies for an assistant and makes known his/her willingness to accept such assistant, the District will assign such assistant as soon as practical but not to exceed three (3) weeks. No assignment will be made after April 15 of any year.
10.1.7.3	Exclusion of P-5/Optional Schools
P-5 schools and optional schools would be excluded from the above requirements as long as the staffing pattern and planning time schedules are reasonably comparable to those utilized in those particular schools during the 1989-90 school year.

10.1.8.2	Building Average
Section 10.1.3 of the labor agreement is currently not being utilized because of Section 10.1.11.6. In the event Section 10.1.3 of the labor agreement again becomes operative, the parties will meet to discuss how the building average is to be calculated. In the event the parties cannot reach agreement on this issue, the parties agree to select an arbitrator in the manner set out in Section 9.3.3.3. of the Labor Agreement. The parties will each submit to the arbitrator, in writing, a method to determine the building class average. A hearing will be held in which either party may present any relevant evidence on this issue. Briefs may be submitted and the arbitrator will determine which method of averaging is in the best interest of the District.
10.1.9	Assignment of Students to Classes
In assigning students, educational assistants and/or additional teachers in a primary elementary school, pursuant to Section 10.1.7 the following method would be followed:
The principal will equitably distribute students between the teachers at each grade level. When the class load in any class exceeds:
twenty-two (22)	for 4-year old	K
twenty-eight (28)	for K-3
thirty (30)	for	4-5
(FTE as calculated in Board policy 4115.2),	the	principal may, after assigning an education-

It is acknowledged that teachers and IEP case managers confer frequently about student learning and behavior. However, if a teacher(s) to whom a student with an IEP is assigned for instruction is of the opinion that the behavior or learning of the student results in a significant concern, the teacher(s) to whom the student is assigned for instruction may request in writing assistance from the principal. The principal will facilitate communication between the teacher and the IEP case manager. If feasible, by the end of the contractually defined workday, following the day on which the request was made, the circumstances of the concern will be examined by the student's IEP case manager and the teacher(s) who initiated the request. They will develop the procedures to remedy the situation, which may include addressing the concern through scheduling of a formal IEP Team meeting. Every reasonable attempt will be made to appoint the teacher with the significant concern about the student to the IEP Team.
If any involved teacher disagrees with the remedy developed, s/he may explain their disagreement and offer alternative solutions to identified problems in a written report to the principal and/or the IEP Team. If the process involves a formal IEP Team meeting, the teacher's written report shall be attached to the IEP. The principal will facilitate a resolution to the disagreement.

13.1.2	Non-Tenured Teachers
As to teachers who have not attained tenure, the Human Resources Department shall select which non-tenured teacher shall be laid off.

No new or substitute (long-term) appointments shall be made while there are teachers on layoff status available who the Human Resources Department determines are qualified to fill the vacancies.
13.1.5.1	While the arena staffing language in Section 15.6 remains in effect, teachers who have been recalled will be temporarily assigned to positions for which they are qualified and that have been vacated during the school year. (These positions will be designated as "mid-term vacancies.") These teachers will then be displaced and the vacated position(s) will be posted and staffed in accordance with Section 15.6 of the Agreement. If mid-term vacancies do not occur, laid off teachers will be obligated to participate, in seniority order, in Arena Staffing events. In the event a laid off teacher is not assigned by July 15th, the District will place the laid off teach

15.3	Voluntary Assignment Criteria
The Board and the Association recognize it is desirable in making assignments to consider the interests and aspirations of teachers. Each further recognizes that an effective educational system requires a fair distribution of experienced teachers throughout the system. All voluntary assignments will be made on the basis of length of service, certification, experience, specialized competence and how these criteria can best meet the educational needs within the District. In the event these factors are determined to be substantially equal, the deciding factor will be length of service.
15.3.1	Qualified teachers exercising transfer rights under Section 15.3 of the collective bargaining agreement take precedence over new hires regardless of the new hire's qualifications, sex, age or race.
15.4	Vacancy Notices Posted
Notices of any vacancy occurring in the bargaining unit will be posted in all buildings within five (5) school days after the Human Resources Department has officially received written notice of such vacancy. The notice shall set forth the job title, the location where the job is to be performed and the date after which applications will not be received. There shall be a ten (10) school day period from the date of posting to make application.

15.5	Filling Vacancies (Mid-Year)
Vacancies occurring during the first semester of a school year shall be filled after a voluntary request under procedures set out in subsections 15.3 and 15.4 above. The position made vacant by this transfer, although posted, may be staffed by a new teacher temporarily assigned and shall be permanently filled no later than the beginning of the next school year. Vacancies occurring during the second semester, will be temporarily staffed in the same manner. Except as stated in this section, all vacancies will be filled no later than the start of the next school year. The District may waive these time restrictions to make assignment at additional times if it deems such to be desirable.
15.6	Arena Style Staffing
15.6.1	Two weeks prior to the Arena Staffing event, notices of any vacancy occurring in the bargaining unit for the next school year will be posted in all buildings, and distributed electronically to all teachers and the Association. The vacancy notices will contain at least the following information: name of school, required licensure and FTE of position. The vacancy notices will also include notice of the intent to conduct staffing through an arena staffing meeting. Such meeting will be held the third Wednesday in March after school hours, unless the parties agree to an alternate date.

15.6.8	The applicant will be allowed no more than two (2) minutes to confirm his/her decision.
15.6.9	Assignments selected through this process will be considered voluntary.
15.6.10	When a teacher who is not displaced selects a position the position previously held by said teacher will be added to the list of available positions. Adding such a position will allow those making earlier selections to re-enter the selection process. The process will then be repeated using the next most senior teacher, and will repeat until all displaced teachers have been assigned.
15.6.11	All voluntary transfers require a minimum commitment of two (2) years, provided there is no administrative change in the building to which the teacher has transferred.
15.6.12	Any displaced teacher not assigned through this process shall be assigned to a position held by a teacher with lesser length of service within his/her area(s) of certification. Said assignment will be considered involuntary.

15.9	Involuntary Transfers - Super Length of Service
In the event that no person applies for a posted vacancy, the Human Resources Department may involuntarily assign a qualified teacher to the position or hire a new teacher. If the assignment is involuntary, the teacher assigned will acquire Super Length of Service for the purpose of assignment after spending at least two (2) academic semesters in the position. Any portion of a semester shall be counted as a semester for the purpose of this Section. This Super Length of Service will only be considered in any subsequent opportunity for voluntary transfer and will terminate after a transfer is made.
15.10	Displaced Teachers - Posting for Vacancies
A teacher who has been notified that s/he will be displaced is required to post for all vacancies for which s/he is certified and has taught within the District within the last five (5) years; notwithstanding the limitations in Subsection 15.4 above. When a displaced teacher posts for an area/subject vacancy that s/he has not taught within the District within the past five (5) years a meeting shall take place between the Human Resources Department, the Executive Director of the Association, and the teacher affected at which time any party may object based upon qualifications and certification for the position(s) which will cancel the transfer request.

15.12	Team Teaching Assignment Criteria
15.12.1	Team teaching is defined as two (2) or more teachers working together full-time in a classroom setting.
15.12.2	If there are insufficient volunteers for a full-time team teaching position in a building, the position will be posted as per Section 15.6 and selected as per Section 15.3 of the Teacher Labor Agreement. The posting will clearly state that it is a team teaching position. The teachers who will be teaming will make the decision as to how the class will be structured. The team will be responsible for all parent/teacher conferences, grade reports and daily attendance. Daily planning and/or weekly team meetings will occur depending on the structure of the class. Supervision will be assigned as a team with consideration given to protecting team planning. The team will be evaluated individually per Section 16 of the Teacher Labor Agreement. Evaluation criteria will include both individual and team performance. The senior teacher on the team shall be the "Lead Teacher."
15.13	Inclusive Practices Team Teaching

ment. The posting will clearly state that it is a team teaching position. Once a teacher transfers into a teaming position, that person must remain for a minimum of that school year before a transfer may occur. A teacher requesting a transfer will submit a written request to the Human Resources Department prior to January 15 of any year.
Reasonable efforts will be made to provide inclusive practices team teachers with weekly team preparation time within the established school day for pupils. This preparation time will be designated for team planning time (e.g., grade level team planning time). Team teachers will make the decisions as to how preparation time and instruction will be structured.
If one of the inclusive practices team members is absent, a substitute will be secured. In the event a substitute cannot be retained, the emergency substitute rotation schedule will be activated.
15.14	Assignment/Transfer Walden III
For assignment and transfer purposes, the Board and the Association agree to treat Walden III School as separate schools between middle and high schools.

An internal elementary transfer is the transfer of an elementary teacher designated for displacement per Section 15.7 of this Agreement to a vacancy known to exist during the next semester within the same building.
15.15.1	Eligibility
Only elementary teachers notified by the Human Resources Department in writing of displacement the following semester qualify for internal elementary transfer. Notification by the building principal alone does not qualify teachers. Any teacher seeking internal elementary transfer must be fully licensed for the new position at the time of transfer. Tenure is not a consideration for eligibility.
15.15.2	Selection
Designated representatives of the Human Resources Department will contact teachers eligible per Section 15.15.1. These meetings will not take place at arena scheduling. In the event there is more than one (1) displaced teacher interested in a position, selection will be based on seniority.

RUSD & REA 2009-13 LABOR AGREEMENT
SAGE (Appendix E)
34 CLASS SIZE REDUCTION PROGRAMS (Appendix E)
The purpose of this Section is to implement the class size reduction program (SAGE).
1.	If there isn't enough classroom space available in the SAGE school, teachers within the grade level selected may volunteer to team teach in the newly created position. Should more than one teacher volunteer, the selection will be made on the basis of seniority.
2.	If there are insufficient volunteers within the building, all selected positions that are to be team taught will be posted as per Section 15.4 (Vacancy Notices Posted) and selected as per Section 15.3 (Voluntary Assignment Criteria) of the Teacher's Labor Agreement.
3.	All positions that will require teaming will be posted as units. Teams of two (2) teachers will post for the various units.
4.	The two teachers who will be teaming will make the decision as to how the class will be structured. (For example, will all subjects be taught together? Will one teacher teach language arts and reading while the other one teaches science and math, etc?)
5.	The team will be responsible for all parent/teacher conferences, grade reports and daily attendance.
6.	Daily planning and/or weekly team meetings will occur depending on the structure of the class.
7.	Supervision will be assigned as a team with consideration given to protecting team planning time.
8.	The team will be evaluated as a team under Section 16 of the Teachers' Labor Agreement.
9.	The senior teacher on the team shall be the "Lead Teacher."
10.	All classes must be heterogeneously grouped as per District guidelines.
11.	Special education students will be counted in the total number that's allotted for a particular grade [i.e., If the student is mainstreamed more than fifty percent (50%) of the time, s/he will be counted as 1.0. If the mainstreaming occurs less than fifty percent (50%) of the time, s/he will be counted as .50.].
12.	In team situations, Section 10.1.7 does not apply.
13.	Specialists' loads will not exceed a ratio of 30 to 1.
14.	If one of the team members is absent, a substitute will be secured.
15.	Once a teacher transfers into a teaming position, that person must remain for a minimum of that school year before a transfer may occur.
This Section will be null and void in the event the District no longer participates in the SAGE program or the SAGE program is modified in any significant way after the date of this agreement.
This same procedure, where applicable, will apply to the Federal Class Size Reduction Program (Clinton).
