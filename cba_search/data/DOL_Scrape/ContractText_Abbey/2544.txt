AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of the 1 st day of November 2016, by and between MEI-GSR Holdings, LLC dba Grand Sierra Resort and Casino (hereinafter, called the “Employer”) and its successors and assigns, and the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 (hereinafter, called the “Union”).
WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, the parties, by negotiations and collective bargaining, reached complete agreement on wages, hours of work, working conditions and other related, negotiable subjects to be incorporated into a new Labor Agreement which shall supersede all previous verbal or written agreements applicable to the employees in the bargaining unit defined herein which may have existed between the Employer or between the predecessor of the Employer, if any, and the predecessor of the Union, if any.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the forgoing, the execution of this Agreement and the full and faithful performance of the covenants, representations and warranties contained herein, it is mutually agreed as follows:
ARTICLE 1:	RECOGNITION AND CONTRACT COVERAGES
1.0	1. Recognition of the Union.
The Employer recognizes the Union as the collective bargaining representative for the Employer's employees working under the Union's jurisdiction at the Employer's facility located at 2500 East Second Street, Reno, Nevada 89595, and working in those job classifications listed in Exhibit 1 attached hereto and made a part of this Agreement. The Housekeeping Department (including only Guest Room Attendants, Housekeeping Runners, Housekeeping Utility Porters and Housekeeping Porters), Slot Associates and Slot Attendants will no longer be part of the bargaining unit. The term “employee” or “employees” as used in this Agreement means all persons directly employed by the Employer within the classifications set forth in Exhibit 1 attached hereto and made a part of this Agreement. The term “employee” or “employees” as used in this Agreement means all persons directly employed by the Employer within the classifications set forth in Exhibit 1, but excluding all other employees and excluding supervisors, as defined in the Labor Management Relations Act, as amended. Any classification established by the Employer not listed in Exhibit 1 where the employees perform duties covered by this Agreement shall be a part of this Agreement at a wage rate comparable to related job classifications. If the Union and the Employer cannot agree on the wage rate or the inclusion for any new classification, the issue may be submitted to the grievance procedure. The present practice of the hotel in regard to bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit work will continue, but cannot be expanded unless the Employer meets with the Union and bargains for any changes.
1.0	2. Masculine Gender.
In this Agreement the use of masculine gender shall be construed to equally include the feminine.

Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
ARTICLE 2:	HIRING OF EMPLOYEES
2.01. Hiring Procedure.
Whenever the Employer finds it necessary to hire new employees for vacancies in job classifications covered by this Agreement, the Employer, upon hiring such new employees, shall make available for the Union, on a monthly basis, their names, classifications and wage rates for inclusion into the Union's list of employees represented. In the event the Union has available qualified employees for the job classification within the unit, the Union may furnish the same to the Employer for consideration by the Employer. The Union's selection of applicants for the referral shall be on a nondiscriminatory basis and shall not be based upon, or in any way affected by, membership in the Union or the Union's bylaws, rules, regulations, constitutional provisions, or any other aspect or obligation of Union membership policies or requirements, or upon an applicant's race, color, religion, sex, age, sexual orientation, or national origin.
The Employer shall be the sole judge of an applicant's suitability, competence and qualifications to perform the work of any job to be filled. The Employer may accept or reject any applicant for employment referred by the Union, provided that the Employer's acceptance or rejection of an applicant shall be solely upon the Employer's judgment and determination as to the factors set forth in the preceding sentence. The Employer's decision in matters pertaining to hew hires shall not be subject to grievance and arbitration procedures.
2.02. Employee Orientation
The Union shall be notified of orientation sessions for new employees and shall be afforded the right to meet with all new hires in the bargaining unit for a minimum of thirty (30) minutes during the orientation. The Union will be provided with the names, classifications and hire dates of all new bargaining unit employees prior to the orientation.
The Employer will not make any negative references about the Union during the Employer's interviewing, hiring and orientation process. The Employer shall not advise applicants or employees as to the need for or desirability of the Union membership.
2.03. No Individual Contracts
No employee covered by this Agreement shall be compelled or allowed to enter into any individual contract or agreement with the Employer concerning conditions or employment which varies the terms or conditions of employment contained in this Agreement.
2.04. Recruitment Wage Adjustment
If the Employer finds its wages are not competitive in the current market, causing the Employer to lose employees and/or be unable to recruit new employees, the Employer shall notify the Union of the need to increase the starting wage of a non-competitive classification. The Union shall respond within two (2) weeks of notification to bargain over the increase. If the new starting rate is higher than the rate of any current bargaining unit members within that classification, the Employer shall automatically adjust those members’ current rate, independent of any scheduled wage adjustments pursuant to this Agreement. Any increase will be retroactive to the date of notice. If the Union and Employer do not agree on the increase or if the Union fails to respond within two (2) weeks of notice, the Employer may implement the increase. Otherwise, the
2
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
Employer may not implement any such increase without notification to the Union and a signed agreement between the Union and the Employer.
ARTICLE 3:	STATE LAWS
3.01. Invalidity of a Portion of Agreement.
If any portion or portions of this Agreement are found to be invalid or void by a competent court, board or authority, the remaining portions of the Agreement shall remain intact and in effect.
3.02. Indemnification.
The Union will indemnify and save the Employer harmless against any and all claims, demands or other forms of liability, which may arise out of or by reason of, any action taken or not taken by the Employer, at the request of the Union, in violation of the Nevada Right-to-Work law.

(c)	Indemnification. The Union shall indemnify and hold the Employer harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits, and other form of liability which shall arise out of or by reason of action taken or not taken by the Employer at the request of the Union under the terms of this Article.

The parties agree that there shall be no more than twenty (20) Shop Stewards and twenty (20) alternates. The Union shall notify the Employer in advance and in writing of the names of all Shop Stewards and alternates.
It shall be the recognized duty of the Shop Stewards to assist the bargaining unit representatives of the employees in monitoring contract compliance. Union business will be conducted by Union members, employees and Shop Stewards on their own time. The Shop Stewards shall confine themselves to the business of the Employer during working hours and they will not engage in any Union activities during working hours which will in any way, either directly or indirectly, interfere with operations, except as is expressly provided for in this Agreement.
The Employer agrees that it shall not discriminate against Shop Stewards because of their activities as such. When practical, and in accordance with the needs of the employer’s business, Shop Stewards shall be scheduled to be off without pay to attend Union meetings so long as at least one (1) week's written notice has been given of the meeting date to the designated Employer representative.
4.03. Employee Information.
To permit the Union to properly and efficiently carry out its responsibilities, the Employer shall provide the following information to the Union:
(a)	By the tenth (1 Oth) day of each month a list of all employees hired into the bargaining unit or transferred into the bar gaining unit during the preceding month, including each employee’s name, social security number, department, job title, home address, phone number, gender, status (full-time, part-time, etc.), date of hire, date of birth and ethnicity.
(b)	By the tenth (10th) day of each month a list of all bargaining unit employees terminated, placed on leave of absence or transferred out of the bargaining unit during the preceding month including each employee's name, social security number, the reason for such termination, leave of absence or transfer and the date(s) of such personnel transactions, and the expected date of return for leaves of absence.
The reports described in subsections (a) and (b) shall be sent to the Union by fax or mail or downloaded from the Company's FTP site by the Union or uploaded by the Company to the Union's FTP site or via email after the Union has demonstrated to the Employer that the proper “PGP" security encryption measures exist in the Union's network.
4
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
The Employer shall furnish the Union with a quarterly list of all employees in the bargaining unit, including each employee's name, social security number, department, job title, home address, phone number, status (full-time, part-time, etc.) and date of hire, date of birth and ethnicity. Data regarding employee ethnicity will not be shared with any person, media or entity outside the Union and employee benefit funds. The Union agrees to sign confidentiality form pertaining to the use of such data. This report shall be in an Excel spreadsheet or in a formatted test format like .csv format, containing header information in any one of the following media:

2.	Uploaded by the Company to the Union's FTP site;
3.	Via email transmission (See 4.02(c) above); and
4.	CD-ROM.
ARTICLE 5:	SALARIES AND WAGES
5.01. Weekly Payment.
Regular employees shall be paid weekly, semi-monthly or bi-weekly as is the practice of the Employer, in accordance with the wage scales set forth in Exhibit 1. The Employer may change the pay cycle with thirty (30) days' advance notice to the Union. Records on the source and dates of any gratuities included on paychecks shall be made available to the employees on request.
5.02. Equal Pay.
The wage scales set forth in Exhibit 1 shall apply equally to male and female employees covered by this Agreement.
5.03. Deductions and Donations.
(a)	No employee shall be required to subscribe to any form of insurance or to make contributions or suffer any deduction from wages without written authorization of such employee, except as may be required by law.
(b)	Cash Shortages. The Union agrees that the Employer can change its cash shortage procedures upon providing a 30-day notice to the Union. In no instances will the Employer make automatic cash deductions from employees' wages for any cash shortages until after consultation with the employee and the responsibility for the shortage has been established by the Employer.
5.04. Gratuities.
All gratuities left by the customers are property of the employees exclusively, and no Employer or department head not covered by this Agreement shall take any part of such gratuities or credit the same in any manner toward the payment of an employee's wages. This provision does not apply to any present gratuity distribution in a department where splits include payment to supervisors/managers.
When the Employer has special events, sales promotions or other functions where the price charged includes gratuities, the Employer may publish and distribute literature, brochures and tickets for same which contain a notice or statement that gratuities are included in such price.
5
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
Gratuities, regardless of the amount, signed by a registered hotel guest on the guest's individual hotel check, or by a registered hotel guest or other customer on his individual credit card, shall be paid to the employee in cash either after the end of the shift or immediately prior to the commencement of the employee's next shift; provided that, in the case of gratuities signed on a hotel check, the employee must have followed the Employer's established policy for verifying that the person who signed for the gratuity is a registered hotel guest and is not exceeding his established credit limit. No employee shall solicit gratuities from other employees or guests.
A special event shall be deemed to be any event for persons or groups arranged by a travel agent, booking agent, hotel sales representative, convention agent, promotional representative, operator or any other individual or agency where pre-delivered tickets or coupons, or package prices for food and/or beverages to be served to patrons of such events are involved and where regular employees of an establishment covered by this Agreement provide such service, excepting those from the exceptions listed in Article 5.
Presentation of Checks. Management reserves the right to present checks to guests in situations deemed appropriate; however, it is understood that gratuities associated with the check are the property of the Food Server.
5.05. Complimented Guests.
On those occasions when individuals or members of a group are provided with food and/or beverages which are complimented by the Employer, there shall be no guaranteed gratuity; provided, however, that the Servers who provide service shall be given the opportunity to present a check to the guest or guests being complimented.
(a)	Complimented Groups. On those occasions when members of a group, which is not a special event as defined in Section 5.04(c), are complimented as a group and not individually, with food and/or beverages, except as provided in Section 5.04(6), there shall not be any guaranteed gratuity payable by the Employer.
(b)	Officers Checks. Officers' checks and the employees' dining room are exempt from the provisions of Section 5.04.
(c)	According to the schedule provided at negotiations, gratuities paid by the Employer for all other complimentary services shall be in the Employer's discretion and proceed through Payroll so as to appear on the employee's check.
5.06. Terminated Employees.
(a)	Applicable Laws to Article 5, Section 607.020-Discharge of an Employee-Immediate Payment: Whenever the Employer discharges an employee, the wage and compensation earned and unpaid at the time of discharge shall become due and payable within twenty-four (24) hours.
(b)	Section 608.030-Payment of Employee Who Resigns or Quits His Employment: Whenever an employee resigns or quits his employment, the wages and compensation earned and unpaid at the time of his resignation or quitting must be paid no later than:
1.	The day on which he would have regularly been paid the wage or compensation; or
6
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
2.
Seven (7) days after he quits or resigns, whichever is earlier.
5.07. Health and Welfare.
The Union and the Employer agree that eligible employees will be covered by the Grand Sierra Resort Health & Welfare Plans for the life of this Agreement. Bargaining unit employees will be required to pay the same monthly rate as non-bargaining unit employees. The Union understands and agrees that the current healthcare benefit costs are split on an approximately 75 percent/25 percent basis between eligible employees and the Employer, with the 75 percent being paid by the Employer. Future increases in healthcare benefits costs will similarly be passed through to bargaining unit employees on an approximately 75 percent/25 percent basis, with the 75 percent being paid by the Employer. Upon renewal of insurance contracts, the Employer may modify the terms, benefits, deductible and other terms of the Health and Welfare plans at its discretion; however, the bargaining unit employees will be subject to the same terms and conditions as nonbargaining unit employees. Finally, the Employer is and has been offering a Health and Welfare program for part-time employees, at 100 percent cost to the employee.
GSR agrees to negotiate in good faith with the insurance carrier for the continuation of these benefits and pass the cost to part-time employees based on the contract the Employer is able to negotiate.
5.08. Superior Worker.
The wage scales in this Agreement are minimum scales and do not prohibit the Employer from paying higher wages. It is specifically agreed that employees compensated at said higher wage rates may be returned to the scales published herein at the sole discretion of the Employer.
Employees paid Superior Workmen rates shall have their wages increased by amounts of not less than the increases in the minimum wage scales as specified in Exhibit 1, attached to and made part of this Agreement, for the classifications in which they are employed.
5.09. Combination Jobs and Cross-Training.
When an employee works in two (2) or more job classifications in any day, he shall be paid for that day at the rates of pay for the time worked in each classification; provided that this shall not apply in cases of relief for meal and rest periods. Further, the different pay rates for different job classifications apply only if employees actually work in a different classification for more than one (1) hour. If employees perform the duties of both classifications interchangeably throughout the day, they will be paid a blended rate, which would be the average of the rates applicable to the different classifications.
Bar helper and bar porter combination. The Employer will eliminate the bar porter position and combine the duties of bar helper and bar porter. As bar helper is the higher classification, it will remain in existence, while the bar porter classification will be eliminated. Bartenders will be expected to perform the duties outlined in the bartender job description as it presently exists, which include light cleaning. At the Union's request, as a one-time and non-precedential arrangement, the eliminated bar porters will have priority in any bar helper and utility steward positions that may become available, on the condition that they have the requisite qualifications or are readily trainable.
7
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
Cross-training is to occur throughout the organization-up, down, and on peer level classifications to ensure that employees are trained in multiple positions and can assist as business need requires. If cross-training is voluntary, the cross-training will be by seniority. If cross-training is involuntary, it will be conducted in reverse seniority. Further, in all jobs and classifications, employees' duties will now include light cleaning in their usual areas of work (e.g., wiping things down, picking up items left by customers, removing trash from the floor). This will not result in any change of pay or classification.
ARTICLE 6:	DISCHARGE
6.01. Cause for Discharge.
(a) No regular employee, after having completed the probationary period under Section 17, shall be discharged except for just cause. Prior to any discharge for reasons other than dishonesty, willful misconduct, drunkenness, drinking on the job, being under the influence of a controlled substance on duty, unlawful possession of a controlled substance, or using a controlled substance at any time while on the Employer's premises, unlawful usage in accordance with the Employer's Drug & Alcohol policy, serious improper behavior or discourtesy toward a guest, insubordination, failure to report for work in accordance with the Employer's Attendance policy, walking off the job during a shift, possession of weapons on the Employer's property, gross incompetence, workplace violence, theft of Employer, co-worker or guest property and sexual harassment or any other inappropriate harassment of a co-worker or guest, such an employee must be given a written warning and an opportunity to correct the deficiency. The above provisions relating to controlled substances will not apply to medicine lawfully prescribed for the employee using the substance by a licensed physician and used in accordance with the prescription.
Upon the discharge or suspension of any employee for reasons other than dishonesty, the reason therefore shall be given to the employee in writing, and a legible copy thereof shall be mailed or given to the Union within seventy-two (72) hours after the discharge or suspension. When an employee is discharged or suspended for willful misconduct, the notice shall contain the specific conduct or offense deemed by the Employer to constitute willful misconduct. Upon request by the Union, legible copies of all documents relied upon by the Employer in making the discharge or suspension, including copies of any written complaints or reports concerning the employee, either by the customer, an outside agency, or by the Employer's own employees, and copies of any relevant cash register tapes, shall be furnished to the Union within three (3) working days after such request. An employee may not be discharged solely on a basis of verbal complaints by customers. The Union shall furnish the Employer with any statements and/or documents pertinent to the investigation within seventy-two (72) hours of request. The Union will have the right to view copies of videotapes at the hotel during an investigation of a case.
6.02. Warning Notices.
(a) Warning notices issued to employees must specify the events or actions for which the warning is issued. Warning notices shall be issued to employees as soon as possible after the Employer is aware of the event or action for which the warning notice is issued and has a reasonable period of time to investigate the matter, and may be issued by the Employer any time throughout the day, as business allows. All warning notices must be given to employees no later than fifteen (15) days from the occurrence or knowledge of the event which results in the warning, except for ongoing investigations. A legible copy of any written warning notice shall be given to
8
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
the employee for review by himself and, if desired, to the Union. Legible copies of all documents relied upon by the Employer in issuing the warning notice, including copies of any written complaints or reports concerning the employee, either by a customer, an outside agency or by the Employer's own employees, and copies of any relevant cash register tapes, shall be furnished to the Union within three (3) working days after such request.
The names and addresses of customers who make written complaints against an employee shall be furnished to the Union on request if such are relied on by the Employer as a basis for the warning notice. An employee may not be issued a warning notice solely on the basis of verbal complaints by customers. Warning notices, written customer complaints and reports of outside agencies or the Employer's own security force concerning conduct of an employee (except sexual harassment or any other inappropriate harassment of a co-worker or guest) shall become null and void one (1) year after the date of issuance and may not thereafter be used as a basis for or in support of any subsequent discharge or disciplinary action.
6.03. Final Warning.
No employee shall receive a final written warning or be paid off or have his shift, station or days off changed for discriminatory reasons, or for disciplinary purposes unless a prior written warning has been given to the employee. If an employee is arrested or charged with a crime related to job conduct, the Employer may take disciplinary action for just cause without regard to the disposition of the criminal charge. In such circumstances, the Employer bears the burden of demonstrating just cause independent of the legal process, and the disciplinary actions can be grieved pursuant to this Agreement. In such cases, the employee's job status shall be determined by this Agreement. Alternatively, if an employee is arrested or charged with a felony, or a misdemeanor offense that tends to discredit the Employer or its operations, or tends to reflect unfavorably on the Employer or its operations, the Employer may suspend the employee without pay pending the outcome of the charge. If the employee is found not guilty, the employee shall be reinstated, and the Employer shall not then be able to take disciplinary action. If the employee is found guilty, the employee may be terminated. No employee shall be disciplined on account of a criminal proceeding which is not employment-related. After a period of eighteen (18) months, final written warnings shall not be considered in any disciplinary proceedings, except sexual harassment or any other inappropriate harassment of a co-worker or guest.
6.04. Time of Discharge.
The Employer has discretion to discharge employees at any time, subject to the provisions of this Agreement.
6.05. Controlled Substance.
In accordance with the Company practice, where there is reasonable cause to believe that an employee is under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, the employee, after being notified of the contents of this sub-Section, must consent to an immediate physical examination at an independent medical facility or suffer the penalty of discharge. The Employer shall pay for the cost of the examination. A blood alcohol level of .08 provides an absolute presumption that the employee is under the influence of alcohol or, in the event there is a statutory revision lowering the blood alcohol level by the state.

ARTICLE 7:	EARLY SHIFT RELEASE
7.0	1. Voluntary.
An employee, with the Employer's approval, may voluntarily leave work early if he so desires and shall be paid only for the time actually worked on that shift. The Employer may solicit volunteers for early shift release who shall be paid only for the time actually worked on that shift.
7.0	2. Involuntary Release.
The Employer may request that employees leave their shifts early due to lack of business, whereupon employees shall be paid a minimum of two (2) hours or one-half (1/2) of their scheduled shift, whichever is greater; provided however, that this provision is not intended to be used in bad faith or to deny an employee legitimate overtime pay and provided further that the Employer will take first take request for early outs and then require early outs in ascending order of seniority of those employees on duty, provided this does not require the Employer to pay overtime. When a tipped employee is required to take an early out, under this section, the open station, if any, shall be offered in descending order of seniority to those employees on duty.
ARTICLE 8:	DISCRIMINATION
8.0	1. Prohibited Discrimination.
There shall be no discrimination by the Employer or the Union against any employee because of membership or non-membership in or activity on behalf of the Union, provided that an employee's Union activities shall not interfere with the performance of his or other employees' work for the Employer. In accordance with applicable laws, there shall be no discrimination against any employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, privileges of, or opportunities for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, age or national origin, ancestry or disability, or sexual orientation.
8.0	2. Confessions or Statements.
When a supervisor, manager, or security person interviews an employee for disciplinary reasons, or in a fact-finding interview which might reasonably lead to discipline, the employee shall have the right to be represented by an authorized Union Representative or Shop Steward. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to request such a representative or steward. Upon the employee's request, the Employer shall contact the representative or steward, provided that the Union has supplied an updated list containing the contact information and schedule of the representative or steward. If the Union has not provided such a list, it will be up to the employee to contact the representative or steward. If an authorized Union Representative or Shop Steward is not available, the employee can request that the interview be rescheduled or continue with the interview without the representative or steward, if the employee so chooses.
Each employee shall be required to sign a background investigation release for the purpose of allowing the Employer, Gaming Control Board, Nevada Gaming Commission, or any law enforcement agency to check the background and history of the employee or prospective employee.

ARTICLE 9:	WORK SHIFTS, WORKWEEK AND OVERTIME
9.01. Shift and Weekly Overtime.
The workweek pay period shall be from Friday through Thursday. For purposes of computing overtime, for an employee scheduled to work five (5) days in one (1) workweek, any hours in excess of eight (8) hours in a day or forty (40) hours in a week shall constitute overtime. For an employee scheduled to work four (4) days in one (1) workweek, any hours worked in excess of ten (10) hours in a day or forty (40) hours in a week shall constitute overtime. Overtime shall be effective and paid only after the total number of hours not worked due to early outs is first subtracted from the total number of hours actually worked per shift, per workweek. Overtime shall not be paid under this Section for more than one (1) reason for the same hours worked.
Employees absent for personal reasons on one (1) or more of their first five (5) scheduled days of work in their workweek shall work at the Employer's request on a scheduled day off in the same workweek at straight time. If the Employer anticipates such scheduling, the Employer shall provide five (5) days' advance notice.
This provision will remain in effect for the duration of this Agreement. However, at the expiration of the Agreement, the Employer shall have the right to compute and pay overtime in accordance with the provisions of existing federal and state law, and Union employees shall not have the right to overtime pay above and beyond the applicable federal and state law requirements.
9.02. Days Off.
The Employer supports the principle of providing its employees with two (2) days off, or three (3) days off for employees on a ten (10)-hour per day schedule, during each seven (7)-day work period. The Employer will schedule them consecutively, except that when business conditions dictate, the Employer may split them. In those instances, scheduling of split days off will be done according to the provisions of Section 17.04(b) of this Agreement. An employee may voluntarily split his/her days off.
9.03. Single Shift.
No employee shall be required to work more than one (1) shift on any one (1) calendar day. This shall not prohibit the performance of overtime work consecutive with the employee's regular shift, as requested by the Employer.
9.04. Posting.
The Employer shall post each week in a conspicuous place in each department, available to Union Representatives, a work schedule showing the first and last name and classification of each employee, and specifying days off and starting and finishing time. When employees not originally scheduled to work during any week are later called to work during that week, their names and classifications shall be added to the posted work schedule not later than the end of the first shift they work.

ARTICLE 10:	CATEGORIES OF EMPLOYEES
10.01. Regular Full-Time Employees.
Regular Full-Time employees are employees carried on the Employer's regular payroll who are hired to work thirty (30) hours per week or more and are eligible for all benefits provided for in this Agreement.
10.02. Regular Part-Time Employees.
Regular Part-Time employees are employees carried on the Employer's regular payroll who are hired to work less than thirty (30) hours per week.
10.03. Extra Employees.
Extra employees are employees hired to perform work in addition to or as vacation, LOA or temporary absence replacements for regular employees. Extra employees shall not be covered by Articles 6,11,13 (except in relation to FMLA), 17, or by Sections 5.07, 9.02, and 9.03.
10.04. Reduction of Full-Time Employees to Part-Time.
At any point in time, no more than 25% of the entire bargaining unit may be comprised of part-time employees. Additionally, no more than 50% of cocktail servers can be part-time employees. Regarding the cocktail servers, 15% of the 50% limit stated in the prior sentence shall be achieved through attrition and hiring new employees. With respect to all other classifications, no more than 35% of the employees in each classification can be part-time employees, and the attrition requirements do not impact Employees who are on-call (or “extra”) and are not considered for purposes of determining the applicable percentages.
The Employer may freely, and in its absolute discretion, within the limits set forth in this paragraph as to the percentages of full-time vs. part-time employees, move employees by order of seniority from full-time to part-time and vice-versa. If a classification or total limits are exceeded, for any reason other than the Employer moving an employee from full-time to part- time (such as termination, resignation, retirement, transfer, etc.), the Employer will have a reasonable opportunity to adjust the work force (including hiring, transfer and/or moves from part-time to full-time) without being in violation of the applicable limits. The Employer may elect to move some of the employees to part-time by attrition (e.g., keep current full-time employees and replace them upon separation of employment with part-time employees). However, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the Employer has the absolute discretion to move employees by seniority, at any time, between full-time and part-time classifications.
ARTICLE 11:	PAID TIME OFF
11.01. Amount of PTO.
All Union regular full-time eligible employees scheduled to work an average of at least 30 hours per week earn PTO based on length of service. PTO time accrues on a monthly basis from the date of hire as follows:
Months of Years of Continuous Service With Employer	Amount of Paid PTO
Hire to 1 year (6.66 hours per month)	80 hours per year
12
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
Months of Years of Continuous Service With Employer		Amount of Paid PTO
1 year	(10.00 hours per month)	120 hours per year
5 years	(13.33 hours per month)	160 hours per year
Employees will continue to accrue PTO until their bank reaches 2 times their annualized number of allowable PTO hours. However, the maximum number of accrued PTO hours will be 240.
Employees who reach the 240 hours cap will not accrue any more PTO until they use some of the PTO already accrued.
All regular part-time employees who work 16 hours per week will accrue PTO at the rate of 3.33 hours per month and will continue to accrue until the bank reaches 80 hours. Once they reach the 80-hour maximum, employees will not accrue any additional PTO until they use some of the PTO already accrued.
For employees who have accrued PTO above the 240-hour limit as of the day when this Agreement is signed, all current accrued but unused PTO over 240 hours will be grandfathered in and employees will be allowed to use it for 1 year after the effective date of the new contract, or sell it back to the Employer for 50 cents on the dollar, as provided above. If grandfathered PTO is not used within 1 year after inception of the new contract or sold back to the company, it will be lost.
Additionally, Union employees can sell their accrued PTO hours back to the Employer (twice a year on the announced dates in June and December) at 50 cents on the dollar. Employees can sell their accrued, but unused PTO to the Employer at 100 percent if they fulfilled the requirements for a PTO request.
An employee whose employment terminates, for whatever reason (voluntary or involuntary), prior to completion of the employee's introductory period will not receive payment for his or her accrued but unused PTO. An employee whose employment terminates, for whatever reason (voluntary or involuntary), after completion of the employee's introductory period will receive payment for accrued but unused PTO with the employee's final paycheck.
11.02. Break in Employment.
A change in ownership of the Employer shall not break an employee's continuity of service for the purpose of PTO eligibility. Except as provided otherwise in Section 13, time absent from work while on authorized leave of absence shall not break an employee's continuity of service.
Neither time absent from work while on authorized leave of absence nor while on layoff shall change an employee's anniversary date.
11.03. Time of Taking PTO.
PTO is due on the employee's anniversary date of employment as set forth in Section 11.01, and shall be requested in accordance with these time limits: by November 1 for the following January through April period; by March 1 for May through August period; and by July 1 for September through December period. The Employer shall grant PTO to those employees who have given proper notice. PTO requests shall be made in writing to the Employer, and the Employer shall
13
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
provide the employee with a copy of the request indicating that such request was received. The Employer shall respond to the PTO request within three (3) weeks. An employee's PTO request may be denied if any of the following conditions apply:
1.	The employee did not comply with the time limits for requesting PTO.
2.	The employee is not eligible for PTO by the date the requested PTO would begin.
3.	The employee requesting the PTO has less seniority than another employee
requesting the same PTO period.
When an employee is denied his/her initial PTO request, the Employer shall provide the employee with a list of available PTO periods. The employee may then request PTO from the provided list within one (1) week. The Employer shall respond to the second request within two (2) weeks.
After the outlined timelines and procedures for PTO requests are followed, awards will be given on a first-come basis.
An employee's second request may still be denied if any of the above-enumerated conditions apply. No more than five percent (5%) of regular employees in any job classification or restaurant may take the same PTO period during blackout periods. The blackout restriction applies to:
Super Bowl Weekend;
Memorial Day Weekend;
Fourth of July Weekend (including whichever day of the week the Fourth of July falls on);
Hot August Nights;
Labor Day Weekend;
Burning Man Week;
Thanksgiving Day and the corresponding weekend; and
Winter Break (December 24 through January 2).
No more than ten percent (10%) of regular employees in any job classification or restaurant may take the same PTO period during non-blackout periods. However, if business conditions allow, the Employer may increase that percentage at the Employer's sole discretion.
11.04. PTO Pay.
PTO must be taken as paid time off, and no employee shall be allowed to work for the Employer during his PTO. PTO pay shall be computed on the basis of the employee's current rate of pay. Provided, however, that if an employee is regularly scheduled to work in two (2) or more classifications with different rates of pay, his PTO pay shall be computed at the rate of pay at which the majority of hours have been worked in the preceding anniversary year. For temporary layoffs of less than ninety (90) days, employees have the option of taking their PTO earned or
14
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
continuing to carry it. If a layoff exceeds ninety (90) days, all earned PTO is paid out. Only earned PTO is paid. Employees may request upfront pay of PTO when their PTO is to last 5 days or more, provided that the employee pays a $5.00 administrative fee for the special processing of a separate check. The Employer may charge the $5.00 administrative fee as a payroll deduction. Unless the employee requests special processing and upfront pay, the Employer will include the PTO pay in the employee's regular paycheck. Pay for PTO lasting less than 5 days will be included in the employee's regular paycheck.

The Employer will make soup, salad, cold breakfasts and beverages available to Union employees in the front area of the cafeteria, where employees will not need to swipe their employee cards to access such items. The existing rule that employees may not remove food or drinks from the cafeteria remains in effect.

Employees do not accrue vacation or other benefits based upon particular plan policies during such loss of employment. In such a case, where the employee lost his/her employment through no fault of the employee, the Employer will rehire the employee into the next available opening in the employee's former classification, without loss of seniority, upon the former employee’s providing proper work authorization within a maximum of twelve (12) months from the date of termination.

17.02. Definition of Seniority.
House seniority is an employee's length of continuous service in years, months and days from his most recent date of hire by the Employer. Classification seniority is the employee's length of continuous service in years, months and days from his most recent date of hire or transfer, at a particular establishment covered by this Agreement, into his present job classification with the Employer. Transfers from one department to another or from one restaurant to another (Food Servers, Bus Persons and Food Runners only) shall constitute a change in job classification.
17.03. Layoff and Recall.
In the event of layoffs due to a reduction in force, probationary, Part-Time and extra within the affected classification(s) will be the first to be laid off. Employees will be laid off from and recalled to their regular job classification in accordance with their house seniority, provided they have the qualifications to perform satisfactorily the work available in their regular job classification. Employees have the initial obligation to provide the Employer with correct contact information. At the time an employee is laid off, the Employer shall ascertain the current address and telephone number of the employee.
Subsequent to that time, it is the responsibility of the employee to advise the Employer of a change in either address or telephone number. In order to maximize work opportunities for an employees, the Employer, during times of layoff/recall, may utilize the following method of reductions:
1.	volunteer days off
2.	volunteer early outs
3.	reduce work equally where currently practiced or by house seniority where done by length of service
These options are purely optional and can be used by any department or group in any order, or can be skipped altogether and a layoff can be effectuated. Before implementing any of these three options, the Employer shall meet with the affected employees and use best efforts, as determined by the context of the situation, to reach an agreement with the employees. If the Employer and the employees are unable to reach an agreement, the Employer may implement any of the three options set forth above, at its discretion. The requirement that the Employer meet with the affected employees does not apply to situations when the Employer decides to conduct a layoff.
In accordance with their house seniority, regular employees in layoff status will be offered but not required to perform, all extra work in their classifications except for banquets or parties, before probationary employees are hired; provided, however, that such employees who have not completed their probationary period who are offered and accept extra work shall be paid as extra employees for such work.
17.04. Promotions and Preference for Shifts.
(a)	Promotions. When the Employer promotes an employee to another covered classification, the Employer will consider the employee's house seniority, qualifications to perform satisfactorily the work in the other classification, and prior performance. Where qualifications to perform the work and prior performance in the other covered classification are relatively equal among employees, the senior employee shall be the one promoted. For purposes of this paragraph (a) and
22
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
Section 2.01(a), a “promotion” shall be deemed to be a transfer to another covered classification in which the transferred employee has an opportunity for increased compensation or for subsequent job progression as a result of the transfer. An employee promoted under this Section who cannot perform satisfactorily the work of the job to which he or she was promoted, may be transferred back to his/her former job, within thirty (30) shifts after the date of the promotion. If the employee's former shift and station are no longer available, the employee shall be entitled to displace the least senior employee in the former classification. Permanent vacancies to be filled by promotion under this paragraph shall be posted for seventy-two (72) hours near the employee time clock or other locations to which employees have regular access. The Employer may fill the vacancy temporarily during the posting period.
(b)	Preference for Shifts. When there is a permanent vacancy on a particular shift or schedule, or in the case of temporary summer shifts, employees in the same job classification on other shifts or schedules who desire to transfer to the vacancy will be transferred on the basis of their classification seniority, provided that the senior employee desiring transfer is qualified to perform satisfactorily the work on the shift and/or schedule applied for and that a qualified employee is available to replace the employee desiring the transfer. An employee transferred under this Section shall assume the weekly and daily shift schedule, days of work and days off applicable to the vacant position to which transferred. The resulting vacancy or vacancies created by a transfer under this Section shall be filled by the next senior qualified employee(s) from another shift and/or schedule who desires to work on a shift or schedule where the vacancy exists. All employees in bargaining unit classifications on the date this Agreement is effective will retain their current seniority date for classification purposes. In the event that employee shifts overlap resulting in a division of a work area, the manner in which the area is divided will be determined by the Employer, and the employee with the most classification seniority will have first preference of work area. Permanent vacancies under this Section shall be posted for minimum of seventy-two (72) hours and up to five (5) days, depending upon the reduction of the workforce in a department. The vacancies shall be posted where employee notices are normally posted. The Employer may fill the vacancy temporarily during the posted period.

17.07. Notification.
An employee who is to be recalled to work by the Employer under Section 17.03 shall be notified to return to work by the Employer advising the employee by telephone, certified mail, return receipt requested, or other available means of communication of the date and the time employee is to report; and by confirming such communication by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the employee's current address of record on file with the Employer. Employees are initially responsible for providing the Employer with correct contact information and have the obligation to continue to provide the Employer with a current and correct phone number during the period in which they are subject to recall, so that the Employer can contact them immediately for any applicable recall position. A copy of the confirmation letter shall be sent to the Union. Reasonable advance notice must be given to an employee being recalled. If such employee fails to report to work within forty-eight (48) hours after the time specified for the employee to report, his seniority and continuous service shall be terminated, and the Employer shall be free to hire a replacement in accordance with Article 2 of this Agreement.

EXHIBIT 4: BARTENDER AND COCKTAIL SERVER WORK RULES
The following Agreement serves to define specific work rules for Bartenders and Cocktail Servers at the Grand Sierra Resort. All employees recognize management’s rights and responsibilities under this Agreement. The Managers shall consistently apply the work rules on all shifts. Any policy contained in this Agreement deemed inconsistent with the Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be void. Any policy contained in this Agreement which is duplicated in the Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be applied as set forth in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. This Agreement is subject to be renegotiated if the two parties deem it necessary.
BIDDING PROCESS:
Any employee in a beverage classification may sign a posted bid. When vacancies occur in a bidded area, posting of the bid is based upon business needs and staffing levels. The Beverage Manager shall determine the timing for posting bids. Days off for vacant bids may change prior to posting.
A vacant bid will have the time and date stamped on the bid. The bid will be posted in the Beverage Department for seventy-two (72) hours. Bids are awarded to the employee with the most classification seniority who signed the bid, and meets the requirements as referenced in 17.04 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
A bid is considered awarded when the employee accepts and signs for the new bid. The employee will then have twenty four (24) hours in which to change their minds. At the end of the 24 hours, the thirty 30 day lock in period will begin. Management may then post their original bid. Classification seniority will begin at that time in the event of a change in job classification. When an employee declines a bid with their signature or initials, that will be binding and they will not be permitted to change their minds at a later time. If an employee wins a bid while on PTO days or LOA, the bid will be considered awarded when the bid is accepted with a signature, and the 24 hour rule will apply as stated above. The employee will begin the new bid as soon as possible but in no more than two weeks from the signing of the bid.
When a posted bid remains unsigned for seventy-two (72) hours, any employee still in the lock-in period may sign the bid before it is filled by a new hire.
If a qualified employee is on PTO days or on an approved LOA and desires to be informed of a posted bid, they must provide the Beverage Manager or designee with the employee’s contact number. A reasonable effort will be made to contact the employee, and such attempt will be documented. The employee’s name may be written on the bid sheet by Beverage Management or by the employee’s designated representative.
When a posted bid is pulled and postponed or held by Management for longer than thirty (30) days, the bid will be reposted for seventy-two (72) hours before being made available for new hires.
39
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
PROMOTIONS:
When a bartender bid is posted and not signed or accepted by a currently-employed Bartender, it should be awarded to qualified internal barbacks or servers before hiring external candidates. Barbacks and/or servers that have been trained and are dual-coded as Barback/Bartender or Server/Bartender will be awarded based on classification seniority ahead of untrained Barbacks or Servers.
Beverage Management will evaluate the employee’s job performance within the first fifteen (15) shifts of their initial bid to determine the employee’s job skills. If the Beverage Managers determine the employee’s job performance to be below standard, the employee will be counseled re-evaluated and given fifteen (15) shifts to bring their performance up to standard. The employee may be transferred back to their former job within thirty (30) shifts after the date of the promotion. If the employee’s former shift and station are no longer available, the procedures set forth in Article 17 will be followed. The above mentioned time frame may be extended with the approval of both Management and the Union.
CHANGES IN BIDS:
If business needs deem it necessary to change days off or work areas assigned to a bid by forty percent (40%) or more for full-time or reserve employees, an employee may opt to vacate their bid and go on the reserve list. If the changed bid affects any other bidded shifts or schedules, a joint committee comprised of the Union Representatives, Shop Stewards, Committee Leaders and Beverage Management shall meet to determine the appropriateness of the changes. If the station is materially changed by forty percent (40%) or more, the affected employee(s) shall have the option of vacating the bid and going “open” with the same days off. Upon reopening of the original station the affected employee(s) shalt be given the option of remaining open or returning to the original bid within ninety (90) days unless they have signed a new bid.
Full-Time employees working reserve due to the combining of stations will be considered bidded employees for the day and will maintain their seniority in the station they choose to work on that day. Any combining after commencement of the shift will be by seniority. Vacancies created by maternity, medical and personal leaves of absence shall be fitted on a daily basis by open reserve first, then on-call extras in order of classification seniority.
Written requests for temporary exchange of days off between employees will be considered for approval by Management on a case-by-case basis, but only when an extra day off cannot be granted to the person making the request. The days off being exchanged must be within the same pay week so that no overtime is involved. When exchanges are in effect, the employees involved will assume each other’s seniority throughout the shift. If either employee does not fulfill the obligation to cover the exchanged shift, that employee will not be eligible for an exchange for the following three (3) months.
When an employee is moved from their bidded station to cover another area due to business needs, and their station is closed or combined, upon the reopening of the station, the employee will
40
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
be given the option of returning to their bidded station as long as a qualified replacement is available.
BARTENDERS
CLOSING OF STATION:
When slow business dictates a temporary/daily reduction in the number of Bartenders on the floor, the Primary Station will remain open taking into consideration cocktail service Bartenders hours and hours of the bar operation. Bars that do not have a designated Primary Station will be combined by seniority. The Bartender in the closed station may either take an early out or complete the shift if another Bartender in an open station requests an early out. When a station is closed for the shift, the Bartender in the closed station will be placed on the Open Reserve list.
BARTENDER BREAK SCHEDULES:
Break schedules are a bidded schedule and any changes to the break schedule must be approved in advance, or during the shift by the Shift Manager, and the Manager must inform the Breaker. Break schedules must have a minimum of 3 breaks, or 2 breaks and an area to go into afterwards for the remainder of the shift. The Breaker must be able to run the full Break shift. This information will be made known to the Breaker prior to the daily selection of break schedules. Breakers will select their break schedules by seniority.
OPEN RESERVE BARTENDERS:
Open Reserve Bartenders will pick their stations the day before by seniority. Once they have selected their station they will be considered bided to that station for the day. If it is the Bartenders day off on the day they are to pick, it will be the Bartenders responsibility to contact Management at 10 a.m. for Days, and 6:00 p.m. for Swing, if they have not already spoken with Management. If Management is not able to contact the Bartender within thirty (30) minutes after The above mentioned times, the Bartender will go to the bottom of the reserve list and will pick last. If the Bartender knows ahead of time that they are not going to be available at these times, they can give Management a list of their choices in descending order allowing Management to pick for them. Once Management contacts the Bartender, they will pass on all information of available stations and start times as well as any other information necessary to facilitate the Bartender in making their choice. The Bartender will make their choice immediately and will be locked in. If there is a sick call or a change in scheduling, the Open Reserve Bartenders in order of seniority will be given the option of staying with their original selection, or selecting the newly available station. In the event that a station with an earlier start time becomes available, and Management needs to fill it ASAP, Management will call, by seniority and go with the first available that they are able to contact. A message will be left by Management (answering machine, spouse, etc.) to verify the attempt to contact the employee. The employee will have ten (10) minutes to return the call before Management moves to the next on the list. It is the responsibility of the employee to provide Management with any alternate phone numbers.
41
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
SICK CALLS:
All sick call coverage is handled in the following manner:
Open Reserve employees will be given the opportunity to fill the vacancy by seniority. Staffing and business may be at such levels that an additional employee is needed. The Shift Manager will make a reasonable effort to contact an employee on their designated day off provided overtime is not an issue. Calls will be made in descending order of seniority. If coverage cannot be obtained, the Shift Manager will commence calling employees by classification seniority without regard to overtime. The most senior employee who was called in to cover a sick call will have first consideration for an early out. If a forced early out is necessary in order to reduce labor costs the reduction will be done according to classification seniority.
An employee who calls in sick must call two (2) hours prior to the commencement of their scheduled shift. If an employee is unable to report for work they shall be personally responsible for notifying the Shift Manager in person on duty on ext. 2088 or on the individual manager’s beeper, or company issued mobile telephone voicemail. If the employee is calling in close to the 2 hour deadline, and the Manager is not in the office, the employee will leave a message on the Beverage Office voicemail which notes the time of the call in the event that the employee is on hold waiting for the Shift Manager to answer the voicemail.
EARLY OUTS:
Early Outs are based on seniority.
It is the responsibility of the employee to notify the Shift Manager at the beginning of their shift of any request of taking an early out. The Shift Manager may disseminate this information to any employee who should find that their station has been closed or combined or to the breakers who wish to work their full shift.
EXTRA DAYS OFF/ PTO REQUESTS:
A request for extra offs may be utilized by calling two (2) hours prior to commencement of the shift. The Shift Manager will be available to receive calls either in the office or by mobile telephone PTO requests will be given priority over extra days off when submitted twenty-four (24) hours in advance.
In order to change shifts, Bartenders and Cocktail Servers must sign a vacated bid, with the following exception: in order to temporarily cover PTO days, extra days off and sick calls, a Bartender or Cocktail Server, by their own choice, may cover a shift provided that overtime is not created and provided that the minimum PTO days on their original shift are covered. If the minimum PTO days have already been provided on both shifts the employee must cover extra PTO days on their original shift. This exception shall apply only when all of the reserve or open bid employees on that shift have a station to work on that day. All reserve or open employees will pick their stations based on seniority.
42
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
If the company needs to reduce labor on the floor after the weeks schedule has been posted, management will make every effort to notify the affected employees at least three (3) hour before the start of the shift.
RE-BID:
In the case of an entire re-bid of cocktail servers or bartenders, if a bid is vacated the thirty (30)-day lock will not apply.
During a full re-bid of cocktail servers or bartenders, the full-time employees bid first, followed by part-time employees, then on-call employees. Bids shall be awarded based on classification seniority. If a vacancy remains after on-call employees have an opportunity to bid, then qualified employees in other classifications may sign bids. Note: “on-call” and “openreserve” have the same meaning.
ADDENDUM FOR COCKTAIL SERVERS
This document serves to further define the work rules as they pertain to the Cocktail Servers. The goal is to maintain a set of rules that are consistent on each shift, and when working with each Manager. This addendum is intended to serve as an attachment to the Bartender and Cocktail Server Work Rules.
GENERAL RULES:
PIT AREAS: When the Pit is combined to reduce staff, the entire Pit will be combined by seniority.
When one Crap Game opens, it goes to the Senior Server. When a second game opens it will go to the next Senior Server. If two games open at the same time, or within fifteen minutes of the beginning of the shift, it will go AA/BB. When a third game opens, it will go to the Senior Server.
If only one (1) Cocktail Server has bid into a Pit area and an additional Cocktail Server is added due to an increase in business, the bidded Cocktail Server has the choice of the A or B sides of that Pit.
As more games open in the pit, the senior-bidded or only-bidded cocktail server divides the newly-opened games evenly among the pit cocktail servers. The craps table counts as two (2) games when the dividing occurs.
BREAKS: Break schedules will consist of a minimum of three breaks. Pit breaks will be provided by the Pit Breaker, unless there are not enough to fulfill the three break requirement. Upon completion of the breaks, the Server retains the right to either EO another Server, or to take, the EO themselves, unless needed due to business needs. In the event that the Breaker is needed to go to another area after the completion of the breaks, this information will be made known to the
43
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
Server prior to the selection of open areas. The Senior Breaker has first choice of station regardless of station.
ALL AREAS: To ensure that all areas of the Pits, Slots, Poker and Race remain equitable, especially after major changes or construction has occurred, the maps will be reviewed by a committee made up of Management, Shop Stewards and one or more Cocktail Servers in the affected areas whenever necessary.
When a Server is pulled from their bidded area to cover another area due to business needs, once that Server is no longer needed in that area, the Server will return to their bidded area as long as their bided area exists. If their bidded area is closed they will go open. Management may ‘uncombine” if business needs warrant.
OVERTIME: Overtime (OT) is awarded by seniority. A sign-up sheet will be maintained in the Beverage office on the bulletin board. Those willing to work OT on particular days will utilize this sign-up sheet. Management will assign and notify anyone who has signed up on the sign-up sheet of days needed for work.
DEFINITIONS:
Bidded: Someone who has signed a bid for a specific area such as one of the slots, pit, etc.
Open or Reserve: These Servers who have signed bids for their days off and shift only. These Cocktail Servers pick their areas to work on a daily basis based on their seniority.
Part Time: These Servers work in Part Time bids or are called in to cover busy times, PTO days, and extra offs.
The Order of selection will be Full-Time Servers in order of their classification seniority, Part-Time Servers in order of their classification seniority, and lastly On-call Servers in order of their classification seniority. Full-Time, Part-Time and On-Call Cocktail Servers shall be called to work before shifts are given to J-l employees.

All Lead Captains scheduled by management will receive 1.5 shares of the gratuity. The number of Lead Captains will be determined by the Standard Count Table of this Memorandum of Agreement.
All other Captains will be scheduled by management to control excessive hours worked by a Captain to provide coverage for understaffed events or, if neither are necessary, to maximize contributions to the Captain's pool.
All Captains not scheduled as Lead Captains by management will be signed up in Core or Server slots and will receive 1.0 share of the gratuity. Captains retain the responsibility of their job position whether working as a Lead Captain or a Food Server.
Work Distribution
The Banquet Managers will determine how many Captains are necessary for the day and will schedule Captains unless a Captain has asked for one-half (1/2) day off. If there are not enough Captain or Server slots to work all Captains that day, Captains will be scheduled by job position seniority.
Each food function must have supervising Captains. If possible, all Captains available will be scheduled for at least one (1) shift per day. All available Captains will be scheduled for two (2) functions per day before Core or Servers are scheduled.
45
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
Banquet Managers will be solely responsible for scheduling Captains-in-training (Scrub Captains) to enhance development.
Some Captains may not be booked for the day.
Captains will not be signed up for less than two (2) functions per day unless:
•	they write the day off on the scheduling calendar;
•	they sign up for one-half (1/2) day off on the scheduling calendar;
•	the Banquet Manager determines that one (1) party to which a Captain has been assigned will require the maximum amount of work an employee is able to do in one (1) twelve (12)-hour day;
•	there are not enough functions to schedule the Captains for two (2) functions per day, in which event, the most senior Captain is given first chance to have one (1) shift for the day.
Captains who not able to fill their schedule of two (2) functions per day in Captain assignments per “Standards per Function” will fill their schedule in Core or Server assignments.
After being scheduled for a shift, a Captain can request to be cancelled on that shift if management feels there is sufficient coverage and ample opportunity to replace that Captain. All other rules apply to this change. Captains may exchange shifts with other Captains with management approval.
Pop-Up Functions
In the event of a Pop-up function, the Captains will be scheduled by Banquet Managers. A Captain asked to work less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to the scheduled shift time may refuse the function the first time without going to one-half (l/2)-day gratuity.
If all Captains available have been asked to work, the least to most senior Captains available will be asked again and will then go to one-half (l/2)-day gratuity split if they cannot work. The Banquet Manager retains the right to insist the Captain work if no other Captain is available or if the Captain is the last to write his/her name off in the scheduling calendar.
Cancellations/Count Drops
In the event of cancellations or count drops, Captains will be moved to other functions that day, least senior to senior, displacing any employee except another scheduled Captain. If Captains choose not to displace a Server, they will be subject to the one-half (l/2)-day rules stated below.
If there are no Servers working and the count drops, the early out rules set forth below will apply. If a function cancels and no Servers are working, Captains will have the shift off.
Days Off
Banquet Captains may request days off for the following week commencing on Sunday by writing their requests on the Banquet Managers calendar prior to Wednesday of the preceding week. Captains may also request up to two (2) one-half (1/2) days off per pay period. Captains will be
46
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
allowed only additional one-half (1/2) days off with permission from the Captain- scheduling Banquet Manager. Banquet Managers may deny all requests if business warrants.
Gratuity Pooling
All Captain gratuities, whether or not the Captain is designated as a Captain or a Server for the shift, go into the Captain's gratuity pool for the day. Client Gratuities above the contractual amount which are added to the check or left post-function are split only among the Captains who work that function. Gratuities specified by the client to go to an individual Captain are not included in the split.
Employees hired as Banquet Captains will pool gratuities which will be on a twenty- four (24)-hour basis (defined as call-in times started after midnight to call-in times before midnight) among Captains who worked that day. Scrub Captains will be considered Captains for gratuity purposes. All Captains' shares of a function gratuity will go into the Captain pool. A Captain will receive a full share of that gratuity pool for the days worked if available to work any shift.
A Captain will be paid only one-half (1/2) the tip for the day, with the remaining one-half (1/2) going into the Captain gratuity pool to be divided equally among the Captain, if:
1.	the Captain calls in or cancels a scheduled shift for any reason; or
2.	the Captain requests one-half {1 /2) day off, resulting in the Captain working only
one (1) shift for the day and there is more than one (1) Captain working that day Captains on the Captain's rate-per-hour shift will receive a full share of the gratuity if they work another function that day contributing to the gratuity pool. If they do not work to contribute to the pool, they will not receive a share of the gratuity pool for the day.
Multiple Function Pooling
If a Captain is in charge of more than one (1) concurrent function, those functions' gratuities will be pooled together. The functions will be posted for scheduling as pooled functions. The Captain gets 1.5 share gratuity of the pooled total.
Early/Late Captains
One Captain appointed by the Banquet Manager will review the schedule and adjust Captains for opening and closing using the following guidelines:
•	Lead Captain will always open. The schedule will be checked so that Captains on breakfast the next day will not close. Captains on singles for the day will arrive at the scheduled time and close the function. If an individual function lasts over six (6) hours and two (2) or more Captains are scheduled on singles, the Captains may split the shift.
•	Closing Captains will arrive no later than one (1) hour prior to the meal service.
•	If all Captains are on doubles, the closing Captains will be assigned least senior to most senior, excluding the Lead Captain. Only the necessary number of Captains will remain to close.
•	The closing Captains will be released from the luncheon function early, if possible.
47
Grand Sierra Resort and Casino
•	There will be one (1) closing Captain per forty (40) Servers.
•	The schedule will be re-checked each day to adjust for management changes to the schedule.
•	Efforts will be made to adjust the schedule to equal out hours for the day, on the assumption that the Lead Captain will clock in one (1) hour prior to a large party.
•	Captains scheduled as Servers will be included in the early/late rotation.
Miscellaneous
Captains may clock in early with pay to prepare for upcoming functions. Captains may request volunteers among the Serving crew to come in early for functions. Mandatory time changes for Servers will be handled solely by Banquet Managers. Monetary designations have been used to determine the counts set forth below because they regularly denote VIP status of menus, guaranteeing superior service for those functions. Management has the right to adjust scheduling to control excessive hours worked by a Captain or to provide coverage for understaffed events.
