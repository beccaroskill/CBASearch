Upon request from the Union, the employer agrees to meet and discuss with the Union any information contained in solicitation for bids for subcontracting. Such meeting will take place within ten (10) days of request. The Board will meet with the Union to negotiate the impact of any decision to subcontract out any bargaining unit work.
6.	The Union recognizes the exclusive right of the Board and the superintendent to establish reasonable work rules. Changes in work rules may be made by the Board and the superintendent as they deem necessary, but any dispute with respect to the reasonableness of any such change may be submitted to advisory fact finding in accordance with Section 111.70 of Wisconsin Statutes, provided written notice of intent to submit is provided to the Board by the Union within forty-five (45) workdays after Board adoption of the work rule sought to be challenged.

This provision will not serve as a basis for continuation in the health insurance plan as a retiree.	*
Coverage for the new employe normally begins with the second month following acceptance of an approved application. An applicant who wishes health insurance coverage to become effective on the first day of employment may have such coverage by submitting to the Board a sum equivalent to two (2) months’ payment of the premium along with an approved application.
2.	The Board shall continue to provide hospital-surgical and major medical benefits for its employes as at present, subject to the following changes:
a.	Effective November 1, 1996, surgical care program (equivalent to that in effect on June 30, 1989) not to exceed a maximum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for any one (1) illness for employes and their dependents.
b.	Unlimited payment of diagnostic, x-ray, and laboratory charges for each covered participant per calendar year.
c.	The deductible feature of the major medical plan is fifty dollars ($50) per individual and one hundred fifty dollars ($150) per family.

4)	The UCR ’’hold harmless” provision shall be modified to include the following procedure pertaining to UCR ’’cutbacks."

The complaint will specify the perceived reason for the problem (lack of substitutes, vacant open positions or hours, inadequate number of assigned hours, peaks in workload such as inventory, etc.), how long the problem has existed, and what is needed to correct the problem. If the complaint is not resolved to the employe’s satisfaction, thereafter, the Union and School Nutrition Services may meet in an attempt to resolve the matter. The employer will not discriminate against employes for filing such complaints. The parties agree to view this procedure as a positive method for employe input in improving the work environment.

The next higher authority shall give a written answer within five (5) workdays of receipt of the written grievance.
The next higher authority shall advise Labor Relations in writing of his/her disposition of any grievance presented without the presence of a Union representative with copies for the department head and the Union. All written grievances shall be set forth on a form provided by Labor Relations.
SECOND STEP - If the grievance is not adjusted in a manner satisfactory to the employe or the Union within five (5) workdays after the presentation and discussion, then the grievance may be set forth in writing within five (5) workdays by a representative of the Union on a form provided by Labor Relations which is signed by the grievant and presented to the department head. The department head shall, at the Union’s request, set a mutually convenient time for discussion of the grievance. Such discussion should take place within ten (10) workdays of presentation of the written and signed grievance to the department head. The department head shall advise the Union in writing of his/her disposition of the grievance within five (5) workdays following the discussion with a copy of the disposition being simultaneously delivered to Labor Relations.

e.	In those cases where either party deems it necessary, it may be arranged that a transcript of the hearing be made by a qualified court reporter. The party making such arrangements shall bear the full cost thereof. The other party may purchase a copy. If the impartial referee requests that he/she be furnished with a

26	selected as follows:

29	within two (2) weeks after desired certification of a grievance, either party may
30	initiate a request to the WERC to submit to them a list of names of five (5)
31	persons suitable for selection as impartial referee.
32
33	b. The parties shall strike a name alternately, beginning with the Union, until
34	one (1) name remains. Such remaining person shall act as impartial referee. In
