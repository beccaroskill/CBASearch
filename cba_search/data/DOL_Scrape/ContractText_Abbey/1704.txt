An Individual Employer is not obligated by this Agreement to have a substance abuse policy. Implementation of this Policy is not mandatory by any Individual Employer, but this Pilin' is the only Policy the Individual Employer may implement for Employees. Once implemented, the Policy shall remain in effect unless otherwise agreed to by the Union and the Individual Employer.
II.	NOTICE

D.	An Individual Employer who implements this Policy shall provide written notice of this Policy to all Employees including those dispatched to it by the Union and shall provide each Employee with a copy of the Policy.
E.	Failure to give a form of notice of this section shall make any drug testing engaged in by the Individual
Employer a violation of the applicable master agreement, and no results of any such test shall be relied upon to deny employment or pay or to discipline any Employee.
HI. PURPOSE OF POLICY
A.	Tile Employer, Individual Employer(s) and the Union are committed to providinga safe and productive work environment for Employees. The Employer, Individual Employer(s) and the Union recognize the valuable resource we have in our Employees and recognize that the state of an Employee’s health affects attitude, effort, and job performance. The parties recognize that substance abuse is a behavioral, medical and social problem that causes decreased efficiency and increased risk of accidents and injury. The Employer, Individual Employer(s) and the Union therefore adopt this Policy. The intent of the Policy is threefold:
1.	To maintain a safe, drug and alcohol free workplace;
2.	To maintain our workforce at its maximum effectiveness; and
3.	To encourage confidential referral to the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) by Employees Health and Welfare Program.

professional counseling, and treatment before job performance has become a disciplinary problem. Employees are urged to use the services available through the union EAP Health and Welfare Plan
1.	Treatment for substance abuse and chemical dependency' is provided under the Health and Welfare plan, up to the limits described in the plans.
2.	An Employee shall be granted necessary' leave of absence for treatment.

HUTCHESON LETTERS
Carpenters’ Bldg.
222 E. Michigan Ave., Indianapolis, Indiana
MA Hutcheson, General President
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America
May 13,1955
Mr. O.J. Lindell, R.S.,
Local Union No. 34,
457 Bryant Street
San Francisco,California
DcarSirand Brother:
I am herewith submitting the findings of the General Executive on the controversy between carpenters and pile drivers classifications in the West Coast area.
The subcommittee convened Wednesday, July 15,1954, and Thursday, July 16,1954, in the Empire Room of the Sir Frances Drake Hotel, San Francisco, California. Testimony was received from forty-seven (47) witnesses representing Ijocal Unions, District Councils and State Councils from the States of Califomia, Oregon and Washington.
As indicated in the matter supplied to the subcommittee, from the General Office, we found that the main points of difference existing between the branches of our membership on the West Coast were:
(1)	An interpretation of what constitutes the “girder capping the piles."
(2)	What classification of our membership shall apply in the placing and erection of false work.
Additional clarification of what work properly comes under the classification of Hie Driver would help in clarifying the issues involved between both branches of our Brotherhood on the west coast:
(1)	In the construction of waterfront and marine facilities, such as docks, piers, wharves, bulk heads, jetties, and similar structures, the pile driver classification should continue to apply, up to and including the decking thereof.
(2)	On all pile driving and caisson work on both land and water, Pile Driver classifications should apply.
(3)	In the construction of wooden bridges whether over land or over water, when composed of heavy timber,
the Pile Driver classification should apply.
CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATED GENERAL CONTRACTORS OF CALIFORNIA
(4)	In the construction of concrete or steel bridges over land, the Pile Driver classification shall apply to the
driving of the piles and/or caisson work including the forms required for the capping of the piles or caisson. The “capping of the piles" is herein interpreted as beingthat concrete, wood or other material restingon top of the piles, where driving or placed and does not include any further form work above the capping. In many instances, it has been found that the capping is called “the girder." The above shall apply on such concrete or steel bridges constructed over land, highways, railroads, overpasses, and include cloverleafs, interchanges, etc.

and including all of the form work to the top of the column, piers, or abutments supporting the steel and/ or any other superstructure.
(6)	In the erection of false-work, when necessary for the support of work under the Pile Driver classification, then such false work shall fall within their classification. Fhlsc work necessary for the support of work under the Carpenter classification, with the exception that where pile driving or power equipment is used for heavy timber false w’ork, then such work shall come under the Pile Driver classification. This would include all rigging, signaling, and tagging incidental to the placing of the heavy timber.
(7)	In the construction of open-cut sewers, the Pile Driver Classification shall apply on all piling including
wood, steel or concrete sheet piling, all bracing timer and form work incidental to the construction thereof.
In concluding this report the General Executive Board believes that the defining of the words “girder capping the piles” herein outlined will tend to solve much of the misunderstanding that has existed between the two classifications of our membership on the West Coast. All of the above shall be effective only in the West Coast where the controversy occurred.

July 17.1955
Mr. M.A. Hutcheson, General President
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America Carpenters Building, 222 East Michigan Street Indianapolis, Indiana
Dear Mr. Hutcheson:
The Northern California Chapter and the Central California Chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America, Inc. and the Pile. Driving Contractors Association are parties to the Pile Driving Agreement with Ixical No. 34 of the Pile Drivers, Bridge, Wharf and Dock Builders Union covering the 46 Counties of Northern California. The A.G.C. Chapters are also parties to two Master Agreements covering Carpenters in the same geographic area. In order to perpetuate the fine relationships which have been built up over the years between our organizations, representing the contractors and the Pile Driver and Carpenter organizations in Northern California, it is strongly felt that there is a definite need for clarification of your letter of May 9,1955, containing the findings of the General Executive Board of the United Brotherhood concerning the controversy between the Carpenters and Pile Drivers’ classifications on the West Coast. Specifically, clarification is desired on the following five points covered in the above-mentioned letter:
CALIFORNIA
1.	What did you intend to constitute a ‘bridge over water” within the meaning of paragraph five (5) of your letter dated May 9,1955?
(a)	For example, near Petaluma, California, two parallel concrete highway structures were constructed under a single contract over U.S. Highway 101, the railroad tracks of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad and Petaluma Creek. The overall length of the structures were erected in three sections. The first section, which was approximately 360 feet long, was constructed over the highway and the railroad tracks and terminated at a coffer-dam and piers at the south bank of the creek. The second section, which was approximately 415 feet long, extended from a highway fill across agriculture land to a cofferdam and piers at the north bank of the creek. The third section, which was approximately 115 feet long, consisted of 16 pre-cast 75-ton concrete girders extendingover Petaluma Creek which were put in place bya floatingderrick.
Would you have intended that the 115-foot section spanning the creek, which constitutes less than 1/8 of the entire structure, would make the entire structure a “bridge over water?”
Or would the term “bridge over water” be limited to the section which actually spanned the creek?
(b)	For another example, near King City, California, a concrete structure is being constructed across the
Salinas River. During the dry season, which will cover the entire construction period, the river bed is crossed by a road which carries heavy truck traffic.
Would you intend this structure to be a “bridge over water?”
(c)	Did you intend the term “bridge over water" to include a structure being constructed over a dry bypass
which is designed to carry water only during flood conditions, which occur only once in several years?
(d)	Did you intend a structure over a ravine or other depression which carries water, if at all, only during the spring run off and outside of the construction period?

(e)	Did you intend the term ‘'bridge over water’ to include a structure over a man-made canal or aqueduct?
2.	Under paragraph six (ti) of your letter dated May 9.1955. did you intend the falsework necessary for the support of the deck of a concrete or steel bridge over water to carry the Carpenter classification, except where pile driving or power equipment is used for heavy timber falsework?
3.	Did you intend the term “pile driving or power equipment,” as used in paragraph six (6) of your letter, to mean
pile driver, derrick or similar power equipment, which is the terminology that has been used in our Pile Driving Agreement for many years?
4.	Do forms constructed on the ground out of 2"x 4" and 2"x 6" lumber and 5/8“ plywood constitute “heavy timber
falsework,” within the meaningof paragraph six (G) of your letter, merely for the reason that, when assembled, theymust be put into place by power equipment?
5.	Does paragraph seven (7) of your letter refer only to work within the recognized jurisdiction of the Pile Drivers Union?
The foregoing examples and questions are typical of the problems which arise in applyingyour letter of May 9.1955, to construction projects in this area. Projects very similar to those given as examples under question 1 above are soon to be advertised forbids. As you are aware, it is important to the contractors that they clearly understand your letter, since if there is any misunderstanding, as to particular work, those contractors who interpret your letter as placing the work under the Pile Driver classification wall lose out in bidding for such work, while the contractor who obtains the work upon the assumption that it comes under the Carpenter classification will suffer serious loss if he has to perform the work under the Pile Driver classification. You are the only one who can settle these problems, since on matters of this sort our Pile Driving Agreement provides that the partieswill recognize formal rulings of the International President of the United Brotherhood.

CLARIFICATION OF REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE OF GENERAL EXECUTIVE BOARD ON CARPENTER-PILE DRIVER MATTER ON WEST COAST
November 11,1955
DearSirand Brother:
At your request the sub-committee, consisting of Board Members Rajoppi, Chandler, and Johnson, considered the requests of the Northern and Central Chapter of the Association General Contractors of America, Inc., dated July 17, 1955, for clarification of certain port ions of the findings of the General Executive Board on the controversy between Carpenters and Pile Drivers in the West Coast area as contained in your communication dated May 13,1955, and forwarded to all Local Unions, District and State Councils in the States of California, Oregon and Washington.
The sub-committee has drawn up clarifications to the five questions contained in the contractors’ request. Some of these questions have various sub-divisions and the clarifications will follow each question or subdivision.
Question 1 (a) of the Association General Contractors refers to paragraph (5) of the findings of the General Executive Board of May 13,1955.
Clarification: On “bridge over the water” the columns or abutments in water and at the water's edge, or the first column or abutment on land adjacent to water’s edge, shall come under the Pile Driver classification.
Question 1(b) refers to rivers that are dry in season.
Clarification: Still considered a “bridge over water” and covered by clarification of paragraph (5) in answer to question 1(a).
Question 1(c) refers to “bridge over water” being constructed over a dry by-pass designed to carry floor waters. Clarification: The answer is Yes. Similar to clarification of question 1(b) and is considered a “bridge over water.”
Question 1(d) refers to structures over ravines or depressions which carry water during spring runoff.
Clarification: The answer is Yes. Same as answer to question 1(b) and is considered as a “bridge over water” and as qualified in clarification of question 1(a).
Question 1 (e) refers to “bridge over water” and also man-made canal or aqueduct.
Clarification: Same answer as in 1(a), 1(b), 1(c), and 1(d).
All clarifications of paragraph 5 of findings of the General Executive Board of May 13,1955, and referring to “concrete or steel bridges over water” is based upon piles being driven, caissons sunk or cofferdams erected by Pile Drivers under Pile Driver classification on such concrete or steel bridge foundations.
Question 2 refers to Paragraph (6) of the findings of the General Executive Board.
Clarification: The answer is Yes. Fhlsework necessary for the support of the decking of a concrete or steel bridge over water shall come under the Carpenters classification. Fhlsework for such decking is under the Carpenter classification excepting where pile driving or power equipment is used.

Page 63 Question 3 refers to pile driving or power equipment.
Clarification: The sub-committee feels that the words “pile driving or power equipment” are in themselves completely explanatory and feels no further definition is required for anyone acquainted with the construction industry.
Question 4 refers to forms constructed on the ground out of 2 x 4 and 2 x 6 lumber and 5/8 plywood.
Clarification: The sub-committee does not interpret “forms” to be “heavy timber falsework" within the meaning of paragraph (6). If any dimension forms are fabricated on the ground for work coming under the Carpenters classification, then such forms can be put in place by power equipment under the Carpenter classification. Fbrms coming under the Pile Driver classification as outlined in the findings of the General Executive Board shall be installed or placed under such Pile Driver classification. If heavy timber falsework, consisting of support for forms, installed under Carpenter classification and pile driving or power equipment is used, then such installation of “heavy timber falsework” shall be done under the Pile Driver classification as plainly stated in paragraph (6) of the General Executive Board’s findings.
Question 5 refers to paragraph (7) of the General Executive Board’s findings and refers to the construction of opencut sewers.
Clarification: The sub-committee of the General Executive Board feels that paragraph (7) is so plainly worded without any limitations that anybody familiar with the construction industry'can clearly understand this paragraph without any interpretations being required.
The above clarifications requested by the Associated General Contractors' organizations in the West Coast area are recommended to the General Executive Board by the sub-committee, who feels that many of these requests could be settled by discussions between the contractors and our membership affected in the West Coast area. It would be impossible to answer the myriad of questions that maybe asked for interpretation of any finding, contract, or agreement and your sub-committee feels that the industry as a whole in the West Coast area should make a genuine effort to work out equitable solutions of further questions that may arise on the findings of the General Executive Board in this subject matter, as contained in the letter addressed to all Local Unions, District and State Councils in the States of California, Oregon and Washington and signed by you as General President under date of May 13,1955.

Re: Carpenter-Pile Driver matter in West Coast area
December 12,1967
DearSirand Brother:
In complying with your request, the Sub-Committee of the General Executive Board, appointed byyou to review the 1955 General Executive Board Decision on West Coast Carpenter-Pile Driver matter, have met several times to consider the new problems that have arisen since the 1955 Board Decision,
Your Sub-Committee held two days of hearings at the Del Webb Town House in San Francisco, California, on March 21 and March 22,1967, at which sixty-three Officers and Business Representatives of our subordinate Locals and District and State Councils testified on the subject matter. In addition, twelve representatives of various Contractors Associations met with your Sub-Committee and presented their points of view on several issues relative to new methods and techniques developed in the years since the original 1955 decision. The transcript of the hearings consisted of several hundred pages and the General Office is in possession of a copy of same.
The hearings brought out that the principal items of work where there were different opinions and interpretations amongst our membership, and also between the employers and our membership, mainly consisted of the following
(A)	Dry Aqueduct or canal structures
(B)	Building Foundations
(C)	Tank Foundations
(D)	Base foundations for Machinery, Equipment and Stanchions
(E)	The erection of falsework, including metal tubular or “tinker toy” material usedin falsework.
Your Committee, aftercareful review of the transcript of the March 21 and March 22.1967, hearings, finds it necessary to further clarify intentions of the General Executive Board decision on May, 1955, and to modify where necessary consistent with the evidence presented to the Subcommittee at this March, 1967, hearing, in order to guide our West Coast membership in their jurisdictional differences on work issues and to assist our Employers in the correct and harmonious operations of their projects.
The work jurisdiction of our Carpenters and Pile Driving branches of our Brotherhood on the West Coast shall be as follows:
CALIFORNIA
A, (1) In the construction of waterfront and marine facilities, such as docks, piers, wharves, bulkheadsjetties and similar structures, the Pile Driver classification shall continue to apply, up to and including the decking thereof.
A.	(2) On all pile driving and caisson work, on hoth land and water, the Pile Driver classification shall apply.
A.	(3) In the construction of heavy timber, wooden bridges, whether over land or over water, the Pile Driver
classification shall apply.

A.	(4) In the construction of concrete or steel bridges over land, highways, railroads, overpasses, cloverleafs, interchanges, or bridges over man-made canals, aqueducts, spillways and man-made water retaining areas, the Pile Driver classification shall apply to the driving of piles, caissons and “drilled-inplace” piling. The fabrication and erection of the forms for capping of piles, caissons or‘‘drilled-in-place” piling shall come under the Pile Driver classification. This shall include the placing of wooden or steel cappingoranysubstitute thereof.
Any other form work above the cap. pertaining to the construction operations herein noted above, shall be performed under the carpenters classifications. This shall also include bridges over man-made canals, aqueducts, spillways and man-made water retaining areas, if constructed prior to water being released or turned into the area.
A.	(5) In the construction of concrete or steel bridges over water, the fabrication and erection of the form work for the pier or piers in the water area, and the pier or abutment on land, nearest to the water’s edge, shall be under the Pile Driver classification. This shall include the fabrication and erection of the formwork to the top of the pier, column and abutment supporting the steel and/or any other super structure.
The fabrication and erection of forms for the piers, columns or abutments for the approaches to the first pier or abutment on water's edge, shall be under the Carpenters classification. This shall apply also on a bridge over an area where the flow of water has been temporarily diverted.
B.	BuHdingfoundations
All form work required on building foundations shall be under the Carpenters classification, irrespective of the use of piles or caissons.
C.	Cappingofpiles or form work on Tank foundations
The capping of piles and form work in connection therewith, where there is no other carpenter form work involved above the capping or floor base of tank, shall be under the Pile Driver classification. Where further carpenter work is required above the capping or tank base, then the Carpenter classification shall apply on entire operation, including the forms for pile capping and/or tank base.
D.	Base foundations for Machinery Equipment and Stanchions
The fabrication and erection of all forms of machinery, bases, equipment or stanchions shall be under the Carpenters classification.'
