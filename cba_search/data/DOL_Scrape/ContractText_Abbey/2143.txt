Section 1.	The Employer will call upon the Local Union in whose territory the work is to be accomplished to refer qualified applicants for work in the classifications herein contained. In requesting applicants for work, the Employer shall notify the Local Union office either in writing or by telephone, stating the location, starting time, type of shift schedule (i.e., 5 days at 8 hours or 4 days at 10 hours), approximate duration of the job, the type of work to be performed and the number of employees required.

Section 2.	When the Employer has placed a verbal or written order for referral of workers from the Local Union and should a shortage of applicants exist and they cannot be supplied by the Local Union within twenty-four (24) hours from the time workers ordered are required to report to the job, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excluded, the Employer may then seek applicants from other sources. When an Employer so hires employees from sources other than the Local Union, the Employer shall notify the Union, giving the names and addresses and classifications of the employees hired, within five (5) days of the date of employment.
Section 3.	The Employer shall have the right to reject any job applicant, but the applicant and the Local Union shall be entitled to the reason for such rejection in writing.

To assist the Union with implementation of this Code of Performance, the Employers agree to designate discharges "for cause" in writing, when appropriate. This clause is intended only to assist the Union in implementing its Code of Performance with future referrals under the Union's hiring hall procedures. Otherwise this clause does not create any new or additional rights for the workers or additional responsibility for Employers under this Agreement.
Section 5.	Whenever an employee is discharged for cause, including failure to pass a substance abuse test, not able to perform the assigned work due to lack of skills or as unsatisfactory, the Employer agrees to send a written termination notice, within fifteen (15) working days to the Union, stating the reasons for termination. If no notice of cause is provided, the individual shall be eligible for rehire without exception.
Section 6. General Termination: When a registrant has been terminated as unsatisfactory or has been discharged for cause by at least three (3) Employers within a twenty-four (24) month period, he/she shall be denied further use of all hiring halls covered by the District Council provided the Employers have furnished the Local Unions in writing the reasons for such terminations or discharges. Members wishing to demonstrate that corrective action has been taken by them, and therefore should be allowed access to the hiring hall facilities, may petition the District Council's Executive Board for an opportunity to appear and give their position. The member's petition to the District Council Executive Board shall be filed within one year from the date he/she has been denied further use of the hiring halls covered by the District Council. A member may petition no more than twice for the restoration of his/her use of the hiring hall facilities covered by the District Council. The burden is on the petitioning member to demonstrate that corrective action has been taken to remedy the issue(s) outlined in the termination letters. The District Council's Executive Board shall be the sole judge as to whether such corrective action is sufficient for reinstatement.
Section 6.1 Skills Termination: When a registrant has been terminated for lack of possessing the necessary skills to perform assigned duties by at least three (3) Employers within a twenty-four (24) month period, satisfactory completion of additional training will be required before hiring hall privileges are restored in the classification in question.

Should the registrant be terminated a second time within a twenty-four (24) month period for failure to pass a substance abuse test, the registrant shall be denied use of all hiring facilities within the area of the District Council until he/she has successfully completed a State certified drug/alcohol program or has been released for employment purposes by a State certified counselor and continues to remain free of all prohibited substances as defined in the AGC-Labor Substance Abuse Program. In order to determine compliance with this section, prior to having hiring hall privileges restored, the registrant must sign a privacy release to allow the Union to discuss and to exchange with the drug/alcohol program or counselor any necessary information pertaining to the registrant's case.

Section 8.	The referral procedure as contained herein shall be followed except:
Requests by the Employer for key personnel to act as supervisors or foremen shall be honored without regard to the requested employee's place on the out-of-work list. To qualify for a request under this Section, the employee must actually perform the duties of the position requested.
Bona fide requests will be honored for individuals previously employed by the Employer when requested by name and whose name appears on the out-of-work list and who have been legally employed by the Employer in the area of the jurisdiction of the Local Union.
Note: Any individual, who was previously hired illegally or improperly by the Employer, may not seek priority of dispatch under this Section.
The Employer may bring three (3) present employees at his discretion into the geographic jurisdiction of the Local Union for each job. In such cases, the Employer transferring such employees from one Local jurisdiction into another Local Union jurisdiction shall be required to check in and receive clearance from the Local Union having jurisdiction over the project. Failure to comply with this provision may be grounds for the Union to request termination of said employees.
Additionally, the Employer may request by name, regardless of their respective position in Group A, one (1) individual for each three (3) Laborers hired. (Exception for Central Washington only: one (1) individual for each one (1) Laborer hired.) The provision will apply to Group A registrants only.

However, this ratio may be waived by mutual agreement of the Union and the Employer
A college student must demonstrate that he/she has been accepted as a full time student and is currently registered in school with no less than twelve (12) credited hours of instruction.
In the case of a formal construction related college internship, mutual agreement is implied herein and the student shall be called for by name and will be referred to the Employer without regard to their place on the out-of-work list, provided such request shall not displace any current employees. All conditions related to ratios indicated above shall apply to this provision. Formal construction related college interns shall be allowed to work at any time during the year when mutually agreed to by the Employer and the Local having jurisdiction over the job. Hours worked by interns shall not count towards any Hiring Hall list qualifications.

In the event the job is down due to weather conditions, then Saturday (when working Tuesday through Friday), may, at the option of the Employer, be worked as a voluntary make-up day. All hours worked in excess of ten (10) hours a day or forty (40) hours a week must be compensated at the overtime rate. However, Saturday shall not be utilized as a make-up day when a holiday falls on Friday.
D.	No employee shall be discharged, laid off, disciplined, replaced or transferred for refusing to work a voluntary make-up day, provided they inform the Employer they will not be working.
E.	In the event of a civil emergency such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, floods, or fires, starting time of the shift may be made to fit the emergency and eight (8) hours in any twenty-four (24) hour period may be worked at straight time. In order to work such shift, mutual agreement shall be received.
F.	Special Shifts: When due to conditions beyond the control of the Employer or when contract specifications require that work can only be performed outside the regular day shift, then a special shift may be worked at the straight time rate. The starting time of work will be arranged to fit such conditions of work. Such shift shall consist of eight (8) hours work for eight (8) hours pay or ten (10) hours work for ten (10) hours pay for four ten hour shifts worked in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.
The Employer shall provide three (3) days written notice to the Union prior to starting a special shift.
G.	Holiday Week: In the event that a holiday is celebrated during the week (Monday through Friday), the remaining four days of the week may be worked as four ten hour shifts, as defined in paragraph (c) of this Section.
Section 2.	Multiple Shift Operation:
Shifts may be established when considered necessary by the Employer. Shift hours and rates will be as follows:
A.	Two Shift Operation: On a two consecutive shift operation, no shift penalty is involved for work performed on either of these two shifts. Each shift must be scheduled for at least eight (8) hours except as provided for in Section 1 of this Article. On a two shift operation, the second shift shall be established for a minimum of three (3) days. The Employer shall notify the Local Union prior to the start of a two (2) shift operation.

B.	Three Shift Operation: On a three (3) shift operation, the following shall apply:
First Shift - The regular hours of work on the first shift of three shift operations shall be eight (8) hours of continuous employment, except for lunch period at mid-shift, between the hours of 5:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M.

11
C.	Multiple shift: (a two or three shift) operation will not be construed on the entire project if at any time it is deemed advisable and necessary for the Employer to multiple shift a specific operation. Those groups of employees only who relieve first shift groups of employees and such first shift groups of employees who are relieved by groups of employees on a second shift, and on a three shift operation those groups of employees who relieve the groups of employees on a second shift, shall be construed as working multiple shifts. The intent of this clause shall be construed so as to recognize that a "reliever group" and a "relief group" does not necessarily mean "employee for employee" relief.
It is understood and agreed that when the first shift of a multiple shift (a two or three shift) operation is started at the basic straight time rate or at a specific overtime rate, all shifts of that day's operation shall be completed at that rate.
D.	The Employer shall notify the Local Union prior to the start of a multiple shift (a two or three shift).
Section 3.	General Provisions:
A.	Call Out. When employees have completed their scheduled shift and are "called out" to perform special work of a casual, incidental or irregular nature they shall receive premium pay in accordance with the proper overtime rates with a minimum guarantee of two (2) hours' pay at the employee's overtime wage rate. When an employee is called out to work without at least eight (8) hours off since his/her previous shift, all such call out time shall be paid at the applicable overtime rate until the employee has had a break of eight (8) hours or more.
B.	Paving Operations. To take full advantage of weather conditions, starting time of operations for the paving of asphalt paving, road oiling and concrete paving will be at the option of the Employer. However, standby time will be considered as part of the regular operation and will be paid at the regular rate.
C.	Tide Work. When employees are called out between the hours of 6:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M. to work broken time on tide work, all time worked shall be at time and one-half (1-1/2) the basic hourly rate of pay, and a minimum of four (4) hours will be paid at the employee's straight time rate. Except for the above, all tide work shall be worked in accordance with provisions of the general Agreement.
D.	Maintenance, Watchperson and Flagger. When no other work is in progress and it is necessary to keep a maintenance person, watchperson or flagger on duty on Saturdays and Sundays, they will be paid at straight time rates, but allowed two (2) regular consecutive days off each week. If these employees work more than five (5) consecutive days in any one week, the sixth (6th) day shall be paid for at time and one-half (1-1/2) the basic rate and the seventh (7th) day shall be paid for at double (2) the basic rate.
ARTICLE 18

ARTICLE 19 REPORTING AND MINIMUM HOURS PAY
Section 1. Reporting Pay: Employees reporting for work and not put to work shall receive two (2) hours pay at the regular straight time rate, unless inclement weather conditions prohibits work, or notified not to report at the end of the previous shift or two (2) hours prior to the start of a shift. Employer may require employees to remain at the jobsite for the two (2) hours to receive such reporting pay.
It is understood that it shall be the responsibility of the Employer to secure from each employee a telephone number by which to be contacted. The Employer will make every effort to notify employees of inclement weather conditions. If the employee does not, at the Employer's request, furnish a telephone number or fails to inform the Employer of any change of number at which he may be reached, then the Employer shall be relieved of any responsibility of notification and shall not have to pay show-up time.
When employees, including new hires, reporting for work arrive on the job unprepared to perform the work required (for example, including but not limited to: under the influence of alcohol or drugs, not possessing the right requested certifications, or inadequately clothed), the Employer shall not have to pay show up time. If the employee is put to work and lacks requested qualifications employer shall pay actual time worked only.

Section 3.	If any employee refuses to start work or if any employee stops work of his own volition, the minimums set forth in Section 2 above shall not apply.
Section 4.	Any applicant who is required to report to	the Employer's designated location for
employment orientation	shall be	paid a minimum	two (2)	hours reporting time. Any applicant
who is required by the	Employer	to travel more	than 30	miles from the dispatch point to the
employment orientation	shall be	paid a minimum	of four	(4) hours reporting time. The Employer
who conducts the orientation at the job location and puts the applicant to work shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section (4).
ARTICLE 20

In the case of a situation described above whereby the Employer requests the employees to stand by, the employees will be compensated for the "stand by" time.
13
If such a condition continues, the Employer agrees to give at least two (2) hours notice to members of the next shift scheduled to report for duty.
