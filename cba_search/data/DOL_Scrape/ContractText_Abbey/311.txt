8.1(c) The terms “employee” or “employees" wherever used in this Article will be subject to the foregoing limitations.
Section 8.2 Objective. The general objective of the procedure stated in this Article is to provide for the accomplishment of workforce reductions for business reasons, to the end that, insofar as practicable the reductions will be made equitably, expeditiously and economically, and at the same time will result in retention on the payroll of those employees regarded by management as comprising the workforce that is best able to maintain or improve the efficiency of the Company, further its progress and success and contribute to the successful accomplishment of the Company’s current and future business. The location, occurrence and existence of any condition necessitating a workforce reduction, and the number of employees involved, will be determined exclusively by the Company. Following such determination, the Company will notify the Union of the location and the estimated size and job family and skills management code(s) involved in the anticipated workforce reduction. Wherever practicable, affected employees will be given two (2) weeks’ notice prior to layoff.
It is recognized by both parties that it is necessary to work certain skill coded employees overtime while at the same time workforce reductions involving the same skill codes will be taking place. Management will review the use of overtime in any skill code in which layoffs are contemplated with the intent of minimizing the use of such overtime. Management, at its sole discretion, will determine rhe level of overtime to be worked.
Section 8.3 Terminology for Use in Procedure. Preliminary to, and as affording information necessary to the application of the procedures stated in 8.6, employees will be classified in two ways:
8.3(a) Management periodically will make a comparative rating of each employee as provided in 8.4. The individual rating will be referred to as a “retention rating,” and the process of applying these ratings and compiling them in order of rating, as retention indexing. Similar usage of these terms is made herein. A retention index review will be held ar least three (3) times during the term of this Agreement and not less frequendy than once each twelve months following the execution date of this Agreement, with the precise intervals to be determined by the Company. The Company will attempt to complete retention reviews as near as practicable to completion of the final review phase of the Performance Evaluation process.
8.3(b) Each employee will be assigned a job family and skills management code (SMC) as provided in 8.5.
8.3(c) The term “Major Organization" as used in this Article will mean a major organizational element of the Company reporting to the Chief Executive Officer of The Boeing Company or identified as such by the Chief Executive Officer of The Boeing Company. The units described in 1.1(b), 1.1(c), and 1.1(d), although not identified as Major Organizations, will be administered as such, with the exception of 8.6(c). The Company shall provide to the Union in writing an up-to-date list of Major Organizations and advise the Union as soon as practicable of changes made thereto.
Section 8.4 Retention Indexing/Rating. The comparative rating required by 8.3(a) will be accomplished as herein described. Retention ratings assigned to employees prior to the execution date of this Agreement will remain in effect until changed under provisions of this Article.
8.4(a) Management will assign a retention rating by SMC to each employee to whom this Article applies, with the basic objective of identifying those employees who, in the opinion of management, are best able to maintain or improve the efficiency of the Company, further its progress and success and contribute to the successful accomplishment of the Company’s current and future business. Consistent with this objective, management will consider each employee’s competence, diligence and demonstrated usable capabilities based upon the employee’s current performance and a review of the employee’s previous performance. Employees on part-time work schedules as defined in Attachment 17 will be retention indexed with employees on full-time work schedules. Length of Company service will be a positive factor to the extent that the experience so gained continues to be reflected in increased capability.
12
8.4(b) Subject to 8.4(c) and 8.4(d), retention indexing will result in each employee being rated in one 1 of three (3) categories, hereinafter referred to as RI, R2 and R3.	2
3
8.4(c) It is recognized that any practical process of retention indexing can no i be completely free of	4
error as to method used or as to resulting retention ratings, taking into accoi nt: the large numbers	5
of employees, skills, organizations, and requirements involved; the fact that numerous management 6 representatives necessarily must participate in the process; and the additiona' facts that professional 7 employees are involved and many of the factors that must be dealt with in the process are intangible in	8
nature. The Company will determine the retention rating of each employee, the times at which such	9
ratings will be assigned, the members of management who will determine ratings or participate in the	10
indexing process, the groupings to be utilized and the other mechanics and details of such process. The	11
Company will instruct and periodically will reinstruct members of management participating in the 12 process to assign retention ratings with the greatest possible care and objectivity, giving full	13
consideration to the objectives stated in 8.2. Such instructions will stress that retention indexing is to	14
be accomplished without regard to potential adjustments for Company service t; provided for in 8.4(e).	15
16
8.4(c)(1) Retention Rating Appeals. The retention indexing proces: will not be subject to	17
the grievance procedure; however, an employee who feels the assigned retention rating is	18
inappropriate may at any time discuss the matter with his or her immediate supervisor. If	19
within 30 calendar days following notification of the assigned retention rating, the employee	20
elects to appeal the rating, and discussion with the immediate supervisor has not resolved the	21
employee’s concern, certain ratings may be appealed for further review as provided below:	22
23
8.4(c)(1)? The assigned retention rating represents a one or mere position drop from 24 the previous assigned rating and it is substantiated that the drop is tot due to the effect of 25 a workforce reduction and/or consolidation of retention index grou is.	26
27
8.4(c)(l)b The employee has remained in the same skill code and been assigned a retention 28 rating of R3 during four (4) or more consecutive retention reviews.	29
30
8.4(c)(l)c Employees who currently hold an assigned retentii a rating of R3 whose	31
retention rating was previously adjusted to RI for Company service may appeal an assigned	32
R3 rating during the first retention review process of this Agreeniei :.	33
34
8.4(c) (l)d The employee so affected will address his or her concern: in writing to the Union 35 setting forth the basis for such appeal.	36
37
8.4(c)(l)e If the Union believes the employees appeal warrants ft rther review, the Union 38 will notify the Enterprise Senior Workforce Manager within ten (16) workdays of receipt of 39 the employee’s appeal.	40
41
8.4(c)(l)f Within ten (10) workdays following such notice, a Skill Tram/Function al Human 42 Resources Representative, a Workforce or Employee Relations Rep esentative and a Union 43 Representative will meet to resolve the appeal. Pertinent informatit n may be obtained from 44 the employee, the immediate supervisor, and/or the Retention Captain for this meeting. 45 46
8.4(c) (l)g The parties identified in 8.4(c)(l)e, above, will resolve the appeal by majority	47
decision ar the meeting or within five (5) workdays thereafter, 'n the event the Union	48
considers the decision to be inappropriate to the facts of the case, the Union may advance its	49
appeal to rhe Enterprise Senior Workforce Manager. Such resolution by majority decision	50
or by decision of the Enterprise Senior Workforce Manager will be f nal and binding and will	51
conclude the appeal process.	52
53
8.4(c)(l)h If the result of an appeal over a two-position drop in r< tention rating is in favor 54 of the employee, one of the following options may be selected as determined by Company 55 and Union representatives:	56

•	Restoration to the previous retention rating of RI, or
•	Modification of the assigned retention rating to R2.
8.4(d) Distribution* Each employee will be assigned a retention rating such that, as nearly as is mathematically practicable, the retention rating distribution is RI - 38 to 42%, R2 - 38 to 42% and R3 - 18 to 22%, Employees classified as Technical Fellows and Associate Technical Fellows shall not be subject to those distribution requirements.
Since personnel transactions will occur subsequent to each periodic review, it shall not be necessary to maintain this distribution during intervals between periodic reviews.
8.4(e) As a part of each periodic retention index review, and immediately following completion of the distribution procedure set forth in 8.4(d), adjusted retention ratings will be assigned in compliance with the following:
Employees with twenty (20) or more years of Company service whose assigned retention raring is R3 will be given an adjusted retention rating of R2.. Employees with thirty (30) or more years of Company service whose assigned retention rating is R2 will be given an adjusted retention rating of RI. Such adjustments will be reflected in the written notification to each employee described in 8.4(f). (Employees who reach the aforementioned Company service dates between periodic retention indexings will have their assigned retention ratings adjusted accordingly.) Employees designated pursuant to the process described in the Letter of Understanding entitled “Designated Employees" for two (2) consecutive retention index reviews will not be eligible for service adjustments upon receipt of the second designation. Such employees may appeal their designation using the process described in 8.4(c)(1). Employees may elect to temporarily waive any service adjustment.
8.4(f) Management will provide each employee with written notification of his or her new periodic retention rating not later than the effective date of the new periodic retention indexing, except where such a schedule is made impractical due to the unavailability of the employee or the supervisor occasioned by vacations, travel assignments, etc. In addition, management will offer to discuss the new retention rating with employees. The written notification will contain that employee’s:
8.4(f)(1) Job family and skills management code
8.4(f)(2) Skill Team Captain or Functional manager’s name
8.4(f)(3) Retention rating prior to and following any adjustment under 8.4(e), effective date, and the number of employees in each of the three retention rating categories as adjusted under 8.4(e) within the employee’s job family and skills management code and Major Organization.
8.4(g) An employee hired into a unit who has less than two (2) years of directly applicable work experience will not be included in or subject to the retention index review and will not be assigned a retention rating until (1) management is able to evaluate the employee’s capability and elects to assign the employee a retention rating, or (2) a period of twelve (12) months from the employee’s date of hire into the unit, whichever occurs first. During times of surplus, management will attempt to evaluate these employees relative to their peers and assign an appropriate retention rating.
8.4(h) An employee who returns to active employment from Layoff status or (eave of absence will retain the job family and skills management code and retention rating held at time of layoff or leave of absence until such time as management is able to evaluate the employees capability and elects to assign the employee a new retention rating.
8.4(i) An employee transferred between the bargaining units described in 1.1(a), 1.1(b), 1.1(c), and 1.1(d) will be regarded as having the retention rating held immediately prior to the transfer, until such time as management is able to evaluate the employee’s capability and elects to assign the employee a new retention rating.
14
8.4(j) Employees entering a unit other than as described in 8.4(g), 8.4(h) and 8.4(i), and those	1
employees whose job family and skills management codes are changed, will receive new retention	2
ratings within the six-month period following the date of such entrance or change. Prior to receiving	3
the new ratings, employees whose job family and skills management codes were changed will	4
be regarded as having the retention ratings held immediately prior to the job family and skills	5
management code change.	6

Accordingly, employees on file for recall pursuant to 8.9(b)(4) will be offered return to active employment within the applicable job family and skills management code, in approximate reverse order of lay-off, prior to workforce additions from sources external to the Company, subject to the following limitations:
8.9(b)(l)a Eligible employees must set up and maintain a profile in the Company’s Employment Staffing System.

The review will be performed by the cognizant Skill Team Captain for the employee’s job family and skills management code. Based on the review the employee will be advised no later than the time layoff notice is issued as to his or her eligibility for reemployment consideration under 8.9(b)(1). An employee determined ineligible may appeal such determination to the cognizant Skill Team Captain, If the appeal does not resolve the matter, the employee may then file a grievance in accordance with Article 3. Such grievance shall be limited to the first three steps of the grievance procedure and shall not be subject to arbitration.
8.9(b)(4) Within forty-five (45) days of layoff, the employee must file for priority consideration return to active employment. The Company will maintain a list of the names of all laid off employees, except those determined ineligible under 8.9(b)(3), those who have received layoff

and telephone number. Individuals who do not properly register in e; ch calendar period will	8
be removed from the priority consideration eligibility list. Failure t;> register properly will 9 result in priority consideration eligibility being revoked for the reminder of the three-year 10 period. Eligible employees on file for return to active employment are : abject to the provisions 11 of8.9(a).	12
13
8.9(b)(5) If any employee on layoff status disputes his or her recall status .is reflected in Company 14 records, Company records shall prevail unless the employee can produce either	15
16 (a) a Company receipt, or	17
18
(b) a profterly addressed U.S. Postal Service return receipt evidencing filing of the 19 registration letter during the calendar period in question.	20
21
8.9(c) Salary and I^vel of Returning Laid Off Employees. Company ofiurs to laid off employees	22
for return to active employment will be extended at whatever salary and level is deemed by	23

11.1(c)(1) Employees eligible to participate in the selective adjustment funds under 11.1(b) may also receive Cost of Living Adjustments to the extent such adjustments become effective under and in accordance with all of the terms, conditions and limitations stared in 11.1(c). The terms, definitions, and limitations stated in 11.1 (b) and 11.1 (c) also apply to such adjustments. Cost of Living Adjustments would be delivered to each eligible employee separately from those selective adjustment funds derived in 11.1(b). Cost of Living Adjustments would be effective on the dates specified in Table III.
11.1(c)(2) Determination of Cost of Living Adjustments shall be made in reference to the series U.S. city average “Consumer Price Index Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers" published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, with the following base period: 1982-1984 = 100, such Index being referred to herein as the BLS Index.
11.1(c)(3) Computations will be made using the three-monrh average of the BLS Index for July, August and September, 2005 (192.7), as the base period.
11.1(c)(4) During the life of this Agreement, Cost of Living Adjustments shall be computed using the three-month average of the BLS Index for the periods specified in Table III and the corresponding BLS Index threshold values expressed as percentage increases over the 2005 base period. The formula will be; percentage of Cost of Living equals fifty (50) percent of the percentage increase in the BLS Index, from the 2005 base period to the BLS Index Comparison Quarter, that exceeds the BLS Index Threshold Percentage, as shown in Table III. In order to preclude recognition, on more than one effective date, of the same percentage increase in the BLS Index, any recognition on one effective date of a percentage increase over the applicable BLS Index Threshold Percentage will cause that percentage to be set aside and disregarded in ensuing computations, [e.g., if the BLS Index for October, November, December 2005 represented a 15 percent increase over the base period (yielding a 1.0 percent Cost of Living Adjustment effective 3/3/2006), no Cost of Living Adjustment would result for the 3/2/2007 effective date unless, and to the extent, rhe BLS Index for October, November, December 2006 represented an increase in excess of 23.52 percent over the base period.] BLS Index three-month averages, BLS Index increase percentages, and salary increase percentages will be rounded to the nearest tenth, with five hundredths rounded upward to the nearest tenth. The BLS Index Threshold Percentages will be adjusted accordingly in the event of a market adjustment in review periods 2 or 3.

22.3(b) Each occupation code, job family code, level guide, and SMC is defined by a unique description as identified within the SJC system,
22.3(c) An employee may perform some of the work of a higher level and/or some of the work of a lower level in the performance of the work assignment. It is not anticipated that any employee will perform all the duties set forth in the job description. Any work assignment may include:
22.3(c)(1) Teaching, instructing, leading or providing assistance to others.
22.3(c)(2) The use of equipment to facilitate the work assignment,
22.3(c)(3) The submission of completed work or any portion thereof for checking or approval.
22.3(c)(4) The reporting of any work impairment such as errors in materials, processes, equipment, etc.
Section 22.4 New or Revised Job Family, Level Guides, and SMC Descriptions. If, after the effective dare of this Agreement, the Company or the Union determines that no existing job family, level guide, or SMC description appropriately covers a new or reorganized work assignment, either party may initiate a request for evaluation and review through the established SJC Maintenance Process. The Union will participate as a voting member on the Company’s SJC team in the identification, evaluation, and review of all proposed changes to job family descriptions and level guides for SJC job classifications listed in Article 11, Table I, and their associated SMC descriptions. The Company will implement changes (1) by revising or deleting an existing job family, level guide, and/or SMC description; or (2) by developing a new job classification code, with supporting descriptions, which will be incorporated into Article 11, Table I through the issuance of an installation memo; or (3) the Company will establish a temporary job classification and/or SMC in accordance with 22.4(b).
22.4(a) Union Challenges of Level(s) for New or Revised Job Level Guide. In the event the Union disagrees with the number or description of level(s) of a new or revised job level guide, it must, within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the new or revised level guide is forwarded by the Company, challenge the level, setting forth in writing the reasons why the Union disagrees. Otherwise, the level guide as determined by the Company will stand.
22.4(a)(1) If the Union challenges a new or revised level guide, the Company’s Director of Compensation and Benefits, and his/her appointees, and Union representatives shall meet within forty-five (45) calendar days of the request for the purpose of attempting to reach agreement as to the appropriate level guide. Disagreements between the Union and the Company shall be resolved exclusively on the basis of the level guide assigned as a result of the Company’s application of 22.4. A Union challenge shall in no way prevent or delay the Company from assigning personnel to the job classification involved in the challenge.
22.4(a)(2) If the Union challenges a new or revised level as submitted by the Company, and it is determined that the level is not correct, the Company will pay each employee involved at a rate that is within the range of the corrected level, for the time in which the employee has performed the duties of the corrected level.
22.4(b) Temporary Job Family, Level, or SMC. A temporary job family, level, or SMC may be established by the Company for new or revised work for which no current job family, level, or SMC is applicable and which requires a period of time to stabilize job duties. This period will not exceed ninety (90) days unless extended by mutual agreement. The Union will be notified of the effective date and approximate duration. Employees will be assigned to such new work at not less than their current levels until the job family and level is made permanent. If the temporary job family code or level is made permanent at a higher level than the levels of the assigned employees, these employees will be paid within the range of the higher level for the time assigned to the work covered by the
38
permanent job family or level. Effective upon and after the Company’s determir ation that a temporary 1 job family and/or level has become permanent, the provisions of 22.4 shall apply.	2
3
Section 22.5 Individual Employee’s Job Classification,	4
5
22.5(a) It is a mutual objective of the Union and the Company that the job classification of each	6
employee be an accurate and timely reflection of the work assigned and the demonstrated capabilities	7
of the employee. However, the Company shall retain the exclusive right to reassign employees as	8
necessary to meet work requirements, and employees shall comply wit i such reassignments	9
notwithstanding the employees’ job classifications of record at the time. If the Company determines,	10
by reference to the applicable job family description, that an employees level is higher than is	11
appropriate for the work to which the employee is assigned, the Company ma y permit the employee 12 to continue in the same assignment without reclassification for whatever period of time rhe Company 13 elects; or the Company may add to the employee’s current assignment or reassign the employee to 14 other work for which the employee’s level is appropriate.	15
16
22.5(b) Because an employee may be assigned work at a level lower than the t mployee’s current level 17 without being reclassified to the lower level, the levels of work assignments of individuals other than	18
the employee shall not be introduced or regarded as pertinent evidence for he purposes of 3.6(a),	19
unless by mutual agreement of the parties.	20
21
22.5(c) Employees may be reclassified to a higher level irrespective of their as ,igned retention rating. 22
23
22.5(d) Challenges Concerning Individual Employee’s Job Family, Level, or SMC. An individual 24 employee may requesi a review of his or her job classification or level based on the contention the work 25 assigned by the Company differs from the job classification or SMC to t:ie extern and in such	26
a manner as to warrant reclassifying the employee to a different existing job classification or skills	27
management code. Employees will attempt to resolve classification first by discussion with first-line	28
management. In the absence of a resolution mutually agreeable to both management and the	29
employee, the following steps will be utilized in the review process:	30
31
22.5(d)(1) If the employee contends that a classification or level issue sti.l exists, he or she along	32
with his or her Union Representative will notify the Skill Team Manager :o request a review.	33
34
22.5(d)(2) The Skill Team Manager will meet with the employee and tin? Union Representative	35
to fully discuss the employee’s issue in an effort to reach mutual resolution.	36
37
22.5(d)(3) If the employee and Union Representative do not agree with the Skill Team decision, 38 the Skill Team Manager, the appropriate Human Resources Representative and the Union 39 Representative will meet to resolve the matter by a majority decision.	40
41
22.5(d)(4) Short-term variations will from time to time occur in the am :>unts and types of work	42
assigned to any activity, project, program or organization. Such variations, including, but not 43 limited to, work assignment adjustments made necessary by vacations and other employee 44 absences, are recognized by the Union and the Company as condi ions which justify the	45
short-term assignment of employees to work that is different than the employees’ current job	46
family classification or level. Accordingly, individual job family classification or level challenges 47 acceptable under the provisions of this Article 22 are limited to assignments of not less than 48 thirty (30) continuous calendar days.	49
50
22.5(d)(5) If, subsequent to the processing of a challenge in accordance with 22.5(d), it is 51 determined by the Company through the challenge that an existing hif,her level is appropriate, 52 the Company will classify the employee and pay the employee at a rare that is within the range of 53 the appropriate level for the time the employee has performed the vmrk at the higher level 54 subsequent to the date on which the notification required by 22.5(d)(1) was received by the 55 Company and within thirty calendar days prior to that date.	56

Section 22.6 Reclassification to a Lower Level. The Company may in its discretion alter employee work assignments or reassign employees to lower-level bargaining unit work for which the Company deems they are qualified. In these cases, the employee shall retain their SJC level and will not be reclassified to a lower level. Reclassifications to lower levels may be made as a result of an employee’s documented unacceptable performance.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING	2
RELATING TO SEX CRIMES	3
4 The Company and the Union recognize (1) the growing awareness and abhorrence in our society of sex 5 crimes victimizing children, and (2) the deleterious effect the presence in the worl force of perpetrators of 6 such crimes would have on the efficiency and morale of professional/engineering ; id technical employees 7 of the Company and on the reputation of the Company and its products.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
RELATING TO JOINT COMMITMENT ON EMPLOYMENT SECURITY
Reductions in employment in Commercial Airplanes have been very painful for everyone involved. The negative effects on both morale and productivity have been substantial. This, along with uncertain economic conditions, has resulted in a great deal of focus on both job security and our future.
SPEEA and the Company understand the impact these issues have had on employees, their careers and Boeings overall performance. Therefore, we have developed constructive approaches to address them. The foundation of our company’s success is the technical workforce, and it is clear that business success starts with commitment to people first. This commitment must be demonstrated by our actions, and our agreement to form a real partnership was an important step forward.
As we know, job security is enhanced by preparing ourselves to compete more effectively in a dynamic, global marketplace. SPEEA and the Company are jointly committed to a number of critical initiatives where we will work together for the mutual success of employees, SPEEA and Boeing. These include:
*	Breakthrough improvements in productivity and morale through effective utilization
•	Retention and transfer of key knowledge
•	Exploring more effective ways to link compensation to productivity
•	Improved approaches to increase stabilization of employment levels
■	Life-long learning as an investment in our knowledge and skills and an avenue for retraining
As we define and implement these key initiatives, our desire is that we use attrition whenever practical to accomplish any further reductions in employment and avoid layoffs in the future. We are committed to exploring new and innovative approaches to employment transitions. Due to the cyclical nature of our business, it is difficult to predict and control conditions that affect employment levels. Therefore, to the extent practical, the Company will provide job transition support and services to the technical workforce affected by employment reductions through, but not limited to, the following:
•	Skills retraining (Ed Wells Partnership)
•	Career Transition Services
•	Career Counseling
*	Resume preparation
•	Boeing Enterprise Staffing System (BESS)
•	Intellectual capital management
•	Skills management through Process Councils and Skill Teams
•	Partnerships with local educational institutions
•	Financial counseling
*	Medical benefits continuation
•	Income benefits continuation
62
We will continue programs for knowledge retention and transfer and skill retrain ir ’ to support employees as Boeing transitions over time. We have committed additional funds to the Ed Wells Partnership. We will also commit to continued discussions in our Joint Workforce Committee on these important topics.
Lastly, we will to continue to work together to build a positive and successful fotu:e for our company and our team.
Nothing in this Letter of Understanding will be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of Article 3.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
RELATING TO JOINT TEAM TO EVALUATE REPLACEMENT OF RETIREE MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR NEW HIRES
The parties commit to form a joint team to develop an option to provide employees a means to pay for future medical expenses on a tax-advantaged basis. The parties acknowledge that pursuant to Article 16 and Attachment B, retiree medical benefits will no longer be offered to newly-hired employees. Our desire is for an option to be implemented no later than January 1, 2007. Accordingly, the joint ream study effort should conclude no later than June 1, 2006, unless the parties agree to mutually extend the study.
Any recommendations reached by the joint team will be subject to approval by the Company and the Union.
Nothing in this Letter of Understanding will be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of Article 3.

Attachment 30 LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
RELATING TO DESIGNATED EMPLOYEES
A mutually agreed upon process has been developed and implemented for the purpose of identifying employees who, while not subject to 8.9(b)(3), will be declared ineligible for first consideration recall rights. This process includes the following elements:
■	Designated employees will be identified as part of the retention indexing process and advised in writing that, in the event of layoff during the period of time between retention indexes, they will have no priority recall consideration.
•	Designated employees must have an assigned R3 retention rating.
■	Designated employees will be identified by skill teams.
*	Designated employees who have one full year of service and who elect to receive income continuation benefits under 21.3(b) will nevertheless be ineligible for priority recall consideration.
Employees who have been so designated will be provided with an Employee Improvement Action Plan which will identify the specific conditions leading to the designation and improvements necessary to avoid such designations in the future. Management and the employee will have on-going discussions about the employee’s progress in achieving the objectives outlined in the action plan. The Company will prompdy notify the Union of the identities of designated employees. The identification of designated employees shall not be subject to Artide 3; however, designated employees may appeal the designation regardless of their previous retention racing in accordance with 8.4(c)(1).
Designations pursuant to this Letter of Understanding will remain in effect until the next scheduled retention review exercise.

Annual certification of eligibility is required to continue coverage from age 19 through age 24.
In accordance with Federal law, the Company also provides medical and dental coverage to certain dependent children (called alternate recipients) if the Company is directed to do so by a qualified medical child support order (QMCSO) issued by a court or state agency of competent jurisdiction.
Documentation is required to request coverage for a child named in a QMCSO or a child for whom you have been given legal custody or guardianship, and may be required for a spouse or same-gender domestic partner and his or her children.
Special Provisions When Family Members Are Boeing Employees
If your spouse, same-gender domestic partner, or dependent child is employed by Boeing and eligible for any type of benefit plan offered by Boeing, your dependent must be covered separately under the plan or plans available to that person.
No person may be covered both as an employee (active or retired) and as a dependent under any type of plan offered by Boeing, and no person will be considered a dependent of more than 1 employee. Eligible dependents do not include other Boeing employees covered under any Company-sponsored plan providing medical, vision care, prescription drug, dental, or similar services. However, if your spouse is a part-time Boeing employee, retired, on approved leave of absence or layoff, or an employee of a subsidiary company, your spouse and eligible dependent children are considered eligible dependents if other Boeing coverage is waived. If you and your spouse both are Boeing employees and have dependent children, you both may elect medical and dental coverage for eligible children under 1 parent’s plans. As an alternative, parents may elect medical coverage for eligible children under 1 parent’s plan and dental coverage under the other parent’s plan. In either case, all eligible children must be enrolled in the same medical plan and the same dental plan (except as required by a QMCSO). The same provisions apply to a same-gender domestic partner and his or her children.
Incapacitated Children
A disabled child age 25 or older may continue to be eligible (or enrolled if you are a newly eligible employee) if he or she is incapable of self-support due to any mental or physical condition that began before age 25. The child must be unmarried and dependent on you for principal support. Coverage may continue under the medical and dental plans for the duration of the incapacity as long as you continue to be enrolled in the plans and the child continues to meet these eligibility requirements.
Special applications for coverage are required for disabled dependent children age 25 or older.

•	You or your spouse or dependent child changes place of residence or work, affecting access to care within the current plan.
*	You are transferred to a different division, affecting eligibility for benefits under Company-sponsored health care plans.
You also may change an election to comply with a qualified medical child support order (QMCSO) to provide or cancel coverage for a child resulting from a divorce, annulment, or change in legal custody.

Your benefit may be adjusted for other income benefits and rehabilitative employment. There is no minimum or maximum benefit payment under this plan.
Your benefits under this plan will be determined using the weekly salary reflected in the records of the Boeing Service Center for Health and Insurance Plans at the time your disability first begins (called your predisability earnings). If you arc a part-time employee regularly scheduled to work more than 19 hours and less than 40 hours per week, your benefits under this plan will be determined using the average weekly salary that you actually earned for the 6 weeks immediately preceding your date of disability.
If you are actively at work and your weekly salary either increases or decreases, your short-term disability benefit amount will change automatically on the first day of the month after or coinciding with the date the Boeing Service Center is notified of the change in your salary. If you are not actively at work on the day the coverage change would become effective, the effective date for your new coverage amount will be delayed until the first day of the month after or coinciding with the day you return to work for 1 full day. Any retroactive change in your weekly salary will not retroactively change your disability coverage amount under this plan. If your period of disability has started, a change in your weekly salary will not change your benefit amount.
Eligibility for Benefit Payments
To be eligible for short-term disability benefit payments, you must be totally disabled; that is, you must be unable to perform the materia] duties of your regular occupation or other appropriate work the Company makes available and be earning 80% or less of your predisability earnings. You must be under the continuous care of a legally qualified physician throughout your period of total disability. In addition, the service representative may require you to be examined by a physician of its choice as often as is reasonably necessary to verify your continuous total disability.
All determinations of total disability are made by the service representative within the terms of its contract with the Company.
Benefit Payment Period
Benefits begin after a waiting period of 7 consecutive days and continue while you are totally disabled, through the 26th week of disability. Benefits stop when you no longer are disabled, at the end of your maximum benefit period, or when you die.
Separate Periods of Disability
A period of disability ends and benefit payments under this plan stop when you no longer are disabled or you return to work for 1 full day. If you incur a second period of disability, the cause of the second disability and the length of your recovery time between the disability periods will determine whether the second disability is treated as a temporary recovery (that is, a continuation of the first disability claim) or as a separate disability claim.
Your recovery will be considered a temporary recovery if, during the benefit payment period, you cease to be disabled for a total of 60 days or less.
The following provisions apply to periods of temporary recovery:
*	Only 1 benefit waiting period applies.
•	Your weekly salary used to determine your initial short-term disability benefit does not change.
•	No short-term disability benefits are paid for the period of temporary recovery.
A-8
Your second period of disability will be considered a separate disability claim if yot have returned to work 1 for 1 full day and	2
3
•	It is due to a different cause than the first disability period, or	4
5
•	It is due to the same cause or causes but your recovery is longer than 60 days, or	6
7
•	The first period of disability began before you were covered under this plan,	8
9
You must submit a claim for benefits and meet the waiting period requirements before benefits will be 10 paid.	11
12
Other Income Benefits	13
14
Certain other income benefits that you may be entided to receive will reduce your weekly benefit from the	15
Short-Term Disability Plan, There is no minimum benefit payment under this plan. You must apply for	16

Rehabilitative Employment
To encourage yoi* to return to gainful employment before you fully recover from your total disability, the plan allows you to receive pay for certain work without a reduction in your plan benefits. During the period you are receiving short-term disability benefit payments, you may earn up to a maximum of 100% of your ptedisability earnings through a combination of your short-term disability benefits plus earning from approved rehabilitative employment.
The service representative must approve the rehabilitation program. If the sum of rehabilitative earnings, other income benefits, and short-term disability benefits exceeds your predisability earnings, the excess will be considered other income benefits and will reduce your weekly benefit under this plan.
Exclusions
The Short-Term Disability Plan does not cover any disability directly or indirectly caused by
•	Intentionally self-inflicted injury (while sane or insane).
•	Committing or attempting to commit an assault, battery, or felony.
•	War or any act of war (declared or not declared). The plan does, however, pay for disabilities caused by an act of war while you are traveling on business for the Company.
•	Insurrection, rebellion, or taking part in a riot or civil commotion.
•	Military duty other than temporary active duty of less than 31 days.
You are not considered to be disabled, and no benefits are paid for, any day you are confined in a penal or correctional institution for conviction of a crime or other public offense.
Definitions
Actively at work means you are attending to your normal duties at your assigned place of employment. On a holiday, vacation day, weekend day, or other regularly scheduled day off, actively at work means you are not ill, injured, or otherwise disabled or confined to a hospital or similar institution and are performing the normal activities of a person of your gender and age.
Physician means a legally qualified, licensed physician, with a course of treatment that is consistent with the diagnosis of the disabling condition and according to guidelines established by medical, research, and rehabilitation organizations.
A-10
Predisability earnings for a full-time employee means the amount of salary or wages (including shift, 1 lead, and foreign and domestic pay differentials) you were receiving from the Con; pany on the day before	2
a period of disability started, calculated on a weekly basis. For a part-time employee, predisability earnings	3
are based on the average weekly salary you received from the Company during t ie 6 weeks immediately	4
preceding your date of disability.	5
6
Totally disabled means all of the following conditions apply to you:	7
8
•	You are disabled as a result of accidental injury or illness (including a pregnai:.cy-related condition). 9
10
•	As a result, you are taming 80% or less of indexed predisability earnings (as iefmed above).	11
12
• Your accidental injury or illness prevents you from performing the materk . duties of your regular 13 occupation or other appropriate work the Company makes available.	14
15
Weekly salary means your salary, including shift, lead, and foreign and domestic pay differentials,	16
but excluding bonuses, overtime pay, cost-of-living allowances, incentive compensation, or other	17
compensation you receive from the Company or a participating sub idiary. For part-rime	18
employees, benefits are determined using the average weekly salary you actually earned for	19
the 6 weeks immediately preceding the disability date. If you have been emp oyed by the Company	20
for fewer than 6 weeks, the plan first figures your pay as if you were full t me; your weekly salary	21
is that amount multiplied by a percentage equal to your scheduled weekly hours divided	22
by 40.	23
24 25
LIFE INSURANCE PLAN	26
27
The life insurance benefit equals 2-1/4 rimes your base annual salary, to a maximum of $500,000. Your 28 coverage amount is rounded to the next highest $1,000 if it is not already an even $1,000.	29
30
Your life insurance benefit is determined by the annual salary reflected in the recoids of the Boeing Service 31 Center for Health and Insurance Plans.	32
33
If you are actively at work and your annual salary either increases or decreases, your life insurance	34
benefit will change automatically on the first day of the month after or o inciding with the date	35
the Boeing Service Center is notified of the change in your salary. If you are not actively at	36
work on the day the coverage change would become effective, the effect ve date for your new	37
coverage amount will be delayed until the first day of the month after or coirciding with the day you	38
return to work for one full day. Any retroactive change in your annual salaiy will not retroactively	39
change your life insurance coverage amount under this plan. If your pe iod of permanent and	40
total disability has started, a change in your annual salary will not change your benefit	41
amount.	42
43
The total amount is payable in the event of your death from any cause at ,iny time or place while	44
covered. Payment is made in a lump sum or installments to the designated beneficiary. You may change	45
beneficiaries at any time by contacting the Boeing Service Center.	46
47
If you become permanently and totally disabled before age 60 and while cov?red under the plan, the	48
Company will continue to pay the premium for your coverage as long as you remain disabled.	49
50
If you become permanently and totally disabled between the ages of 60 and 65 and while covered under	51
the plan, the Company will continue to pay the premium for your coverage until the earlier of	52
53
•	Age 65, or	54
55
•	Your recovery.	56

Provider Choice
Network Providers
Network providers are physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers who have contracts with the plans service representative to provide efficient, cost-effective health care. Although you may receive care from any licensed provider covered under the plan, the plan offers certain advantages if a network provider is used.
A-16
The contracts with network providers include direct billing and payment systems This means you do not 1 need to submit a claim farm when a network provider is used.	2
3
Nonnetwork Provider*	4
5
Covered services obtained from nonnetwork physicians, hospitals, and other covered health care providers 6 in a license category eligible to participate in the network (for example, M.D.') are paid according to 7 whether network providers are available in that location.	8
9
Provider* in a Category Not Eligible to Participate in the Network	10
11
Certain types of providers may or may not be network providers depending on their location. The plan	12
may not have network contracts with providers in a specific category in a pai Jcular location (such as	13
podiatrists or chiropractors in certain locations).	14
15
Medical Review Program	16
17
The medical review program lets you and your physician know whether certain ty res of nonemergency care	18
will be covered under the plan before the care is provided and the expense is inc irred.	19
20
The plan pays regular benefits for certain types of nonemergency care only if thi- medical review program 21 is contacted before care is received. Benefits may be limited or denied if th 'se requirements are not 22 followed.	23
24
Medical review program requirements do not apply if primary coverage is piovided through another 25 employers group medical plan.	26

______________________________________________________________________________________________________42 43
Although contacting the program is not required before emergency or preg aancy-related admissions,	44
you or your physician should contact the program soon after admission to b: assured whether the rest	45
of the confinement is covered. Hospital preadmission review for childbirth is not required for a mother 46 and newborn for the first 48 hours following a normal delivery or 96 h urs following a cesarean 47 section.	48
49
Ail mental health and substance abuse treatment must be authorized by th< behavioral health service 50 representative. Emergency hospital admissions must be reported and authorized within 48 hours of the 51 admission. Nonemergency admissions and outpatient services must be authorized in advance. If you or 52 your provider does not obtain authorization, the plan will not cover any chirges for mental health or 53 substance abuse treatment. If authorization is obtained after treatment is provided (except the first 48	54
hours of an emergency admission), covered services will be paid at the nonner ''ork level of benefits, even 55 if you use a network provider.	56

PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM SUMMARY The prescription drug program described here is available to active and retired employees and dependents enrolled in the Traditional Medical Plan. This program offers 2 coverage options for prescription drugs and medicines; •	Retail pharmacy card program — you can use the pharmacy card to facilitate reimbursement when you obtain covered prescriptions from a participating retail pharmacy. •	Mail service program - called Medco By Mail. A formulary applies to all retail pharmacy and mail order purchases. (A formulary is a list of drugs determined to be effective in both cost and treatment and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A nonformulary drug also may be effective for treatment, but is not as cost-effective as formulary or generic drugs. A group of practicing physicians and pharmacists routinely reviews drugs to include in the formulary. If clinical data show several drugs are equally effective, the most cost-effective drug usually ts chosen. The formulary may change from time to rime.) There are 3 categories of prescription drug purchases: •	Generic - drugs that are chemically and therapeutically equivalent to their brand-name counterpans but usually cost less. •	Brand-name formulary - brand-name drugs selected for the formulary based on cost and effectiveness. •	Brand-name nonformulary - brand-name drugs not selected for the formulary. The program includes utilization management services (see Pharmacy Management on page A-35) to help ensure cost-effective, clinically appropriate treatment.

PREFERRED DENTAL PLAN SUMMARY
The Preferred Dental Plan described here is available to active employees and their dependents. This plan helps you and your covered dependents pay for minor and major dental work, including routine examinations, crowns, and orthodontia.
You and your covered dependents may receive dental care from any licensed dentist or other licensed professional who is approved by the plan. However, your out-of-pocket costs generally will be lower if you use a network dentist. If you use a nonnetwork dentist, your out-of-pocket costs generally will be higher. If you live outside of the network service area, the plan generally will cover dental care at the network benefit level.

Annual Deductible	24
25

The following services and supplies are excluded from 28 the annual deductible:	29
30
• Class I services and supplies received from network providers.	31
32
• Class IV services and supplies received from network or nonnetwork providers,	33
34
This means that the plan begins to pay its coinsurance percentage immediately tor these dental services.	35
The coinsurance percentage you pay for these services (if applicable) does not co.int toward your annual	36
deductible.	37
38
The plan has an individual annual deductible and a family annual deductible. If yr a and 3 or more of your 39 dependents are covered under the plan, the family annual deductible limits the tot il annual deductible you 40 are required to pay in anv benefit year.	41
42
The annual deductibles are shown in the Preferred Dental Plan Schedule of Benefits above.	43
44
Coinsurance Percentages	45

Benefit Maximums
For Classes I, II, and III, an annual maximum applies to each covered person. The annual maximum amount is shown in the Preferred Dental Plan Schedule of Benefits above. You are responsible for paying any charges over the annual maximum benefit.
For Class IV, a lifetime maximum benefit applies to each covered person. The lifetime maximum benefit amount is shown in the Preferred Dental Plan Schedule of Benefits.
Recognized Fees
This plan pays benefits based on the recognized fees. A recognized fee is the provider’s charge for a covered service, up to the plan’s maximum allowance. The amount of the recognized fee depends on whether you see a network or nonnetwork provider.
Under this plan, recognized fees are determined as follows:
•	For a network dentist, recognized fees are network-allowed charges.
•	For a member dentist who is a nonnetwork dentist, recognized fees are the fees that the dentist filed with the service representative for specific dental services and supplies. The service representative approves these fees and agrees to pay the plans nonnetwork benefit based on them.
•	For a nonmember dentist, recognized fees are the lesser of either
The amount charged by the dentist, or
The maximum allowable fee that the service representative approved for member dentists in the state where services are performed.
When alternative procedures are available, the plan covers the least expensive procedure. However, if your dentist submits satisfactory evidence to the service representative that a more expensive procedure is the only one professionally adequate for you, the plan will cover the more expensive procedure according to the appropriate benefit payment level.
Three Classes of Providers
The Preferred Dental Plan covers the charges of any licensed dental provider. The level of coverage is highest for network providers.
•	Network providers are members of Delta Dental and participate in the Delta Dental preferred provider network in your state.
•	Nonnetwork member providers are members of Deka Dental, but do not participate in the preferred provider network.
•	Nonmember providers are not members of Delta Dental.

The Scheduled Dental Plan described here is available to active employees and their dependents. This plan helps you and your covered dependents pay for minor and major dental work, including routine examinations, crowns, and orthodontia.
The Scheduled Dental Plan reimburses you and your covered dependents for necessary dental care received from any licensed dentist based on a schedule of maximum covered charges. Your out-of-pocket cost will vary depending on the type of treatment you receive and, in many cases, on your dentist’s charges. This plan is available in all areas of the country.
Annual Deductible
Generally, the annual deductible is the amount you must pay out of your own pocket each benefit year before the plan begins to pay benefits. The deductible applies to most covered services and supplies. The following services and supplies are excluded from the annual deductible:
•	Examinations, including specialist examinations and emergency oral exams.
•	Fissure sealants.
•	Fluoride treatments.
■	Prophylaxis (teeth cleaning), including periodontal cleanings.
• X-rays.
This means that the plan begins to pay immediately for these basic dental services. Certain limits apply; sec the Scheduled Dental Plan Schedule of Covered Services in this document.
This plan has an individual annual deductible and a family annual deductible. If you and 3 or more of your dependents are covered under the plan, the family annual deductible limits the total annual deductible you will be required to pay in any benefit year.
The annual deductibles are shown in the following Scheduled Dental Plan Schedule of Benefits.
Maximum Covered Charges
The plan pays the maximum covered charges listed in the Scheduled Dental Plan Schedule of Covered Services in this document for necessary dental services and supplies. If 2 or more covered services are received at the same time, the plan pays up to the scheduled benefit for each service, unless the schedule has a maximum for a particular combination of services.
In addition, certain other dental treatments may be covered even though they are not listed in the schedule; details are available from the service representative. (See Predetermination of Benefits in this document.)

COORDINATION OF BENEFITS
If you or your dependent has medical, dental, or other health coverage in addition to being covered under these medical and dental plans, the following rules govern coordination of benefits with the other coverage. Other coverage includes, whether insured or uninsured, another employer’s group benefit plan, other arrangement of individuals in a group, Medicare (to the extent allowed by law), individual insurance or health coverage, and insurance that pays without consideration of fault.
The service representative has the right to obtain and release any information or recover any payment it considers necessary to administer these provisions.
Order of Payment
The primary plan pays its benefits first and pays its benefits without regard to benefits that may be payable under other plans. When another plan is the primary plan for health care coverage, the secondary plan pays
A-54
the difference between the benefits paid by the primary plan and what would h;.ve been paid had the 1 secondary plan been primary.	2
3
•	A plan is considered primary if	4
5
It has no order of benefit determination rules.	6
7
It has benefit determination rules that differ from coordination of b< aefit rules under state 8 regulations or, if not insured, that differ from these rules.	9
10
All plans that cover an individual use the same coordination of benefit rules, and under those 11 rules, the plan is primary.	12
13
■	If the aforementioned rules do not determine which group plan is considered primary, this plan applies 14
t	he following coordination of benefit rules:	15
16
A plan that covers a person as an employee, retiree, member, or subscribe r pays before a plan that 17 covers the person as a dependent.	18
19
A	plan that covers a person as an active employee or dependent of an ac ive employee is primary.	20
The plan that covers a person as a retired, laid-off, or other inactive employee or as a dependent	21
o	f a retired, laid-off, or other inactive employee is secondary.	22
23
If a dependent child is covered under both parents’ group plans, the child’s primary coverage is 24 provided through the plan of the parent whose birthday comes first i . the calendar year, with	25
secondary coverage provided through the plan of the parent whose bii thday comes later in the	26
calendar year.	27
28
If a dependent child’s parents are divorced or separated and a court drcree establishes financial 29 responsibility for the health care coverage of the child, the plan of the patent with such financial	30
responsibility is the primary plan of coverage. If the divorce decree is silent on the issue of	31
coverage, the following guidelines are used:	32
33
•	The plan of the parent with custody pays benefits first.	34
35
•	The plan of the spouse of the parent with custody pays second.	36
37
•	The plan of the parent without custody pays third.	38
39
• The plan of the spouse of the parent without custody pays fourth	40
41
If none of the aforementioned rules establishes which group plan hould pay first, then the 42 plan that has covered the person for the longest period is considered the primary plan of 43 coverage.	44
45
Continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985	46
(COBRA), as amended, always is secondary to other coverage, except as required by law.	47
48
If an employee or dependent is confined to a hospital when first Incoming covered under this	49
plan, this plan is secondary to any plan already covering rhe etnp ayee or dependent for the	50
eligible expenses related to that hospital admission. If the employee «t dependent does not have 51 other coverage for hospital and related expenses, this plan is primary.	52
53
Benefits under a Company-sponsored medical or dental plan are not coordinated with benefits 54 paid under any other group plan offered by the Company. You can receive benefits from only 55 1 Company-sponsored medical or dental plan. However, when dental services performed by 56

a licensed dentist also are covered under the medical plan, the dental plan pays its benefits first and the medical plan is secondary.
Federal rules govern coordination of benefits with Medicare. In most cases, Medicare is secondary to a plan that covers a person as an active employee or dependent of an active employee. Medicare is primary in most other circumstances.
Medical Plans
The primary plan pays benefits without regard to any other plan. When the Company-sponsored plan is secondary, it adjusts benefits so that the total payable under both plans for expenses covered under the Company-sponsored plan is not more than would be payable under the Company-sponsored plan. Neither plan pays more than it would without coordination of benefits.
Plan means any plan providing medical, dental, vision care, hearing aid benefits, or treatment under individual insurance, group insurance, or any other coverage for individuals in a group, whether on an insured or uninsured basis.
Treatment of end-stage renal disease is covered by the Company-sponsored plan for the first 30 months following Medicare entitlement due to end-stage renal disease, and Medicare provides secondary coverage. After this 30-month period, Medicare provides primary coverage and the Company-sponsored plan provides secondary coverage.
Coordination of benefit provisions of Company-sponsored coordinated care plans and HMO plans vary by plan.
Dental Plans
Benefits payable under the Company-sponsored dental plans take into account any coverage (including orthodontic coverage) you or your eligible dependents have under other plans.
Plan means any plan providing medical, dental, vision care, hearing aid benefits, or treatment under group insurance or any other coverage for individuals in a group, whether on an insured or uninsured basis. However, plan excludes any medical plan sponsored by the Company. This means the dental plans pay first when dental expenses performed by a dentist also are covered by any medical plan sponsored by the Company.
The dental plans pay regular benefits in full or a reduced amount which, when added to benefits payable by another plan, equals 100% of allowable expenses.
WHEN AN INJURY OR ILLNESS IS CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANOTHER
In some situations, you or a covered dependent may be eligible to receive, as a result of an accident or illness, health care or disability benefits from an automobile insurance policy, homeowner’s insurance policy or other type of insurance policy, or from a responsible third party. In these cases, this plan will pay benefits if the covered person agrees to cooperate with the service representative in administering the plan’s subrogation rights.
If a person covered by this plan is injured by another party who is legally liable for the medical or dental bills or disability income, he or she may request this plan to pay its regular benefit on his or her behalf. In exchange the covered person agrees to:
■	Complete a claim and submit all bills related to the injury or illness to the responsible party or insurer.
•	Complete and submit all of the necessary information requested by the service representative.
A-56
•	Reimburse the plan if he or she recovers payment from the responsible party o ■ any ocher source. 1 2
• Cooperate with the service representatives efforts to recover from the third party any amounts 3 this plan pays in benefits related to the injury or illness, including any lawsi: t brought against the 4 responsible party or insurer.	5
6
This provision applies whenever you or a covered dependent is entitled to or receives' enefits under this plan	7
and is also entitled to or receives compensation or any other funds from another pc tty in connection with	8
that same disability or medical condition, whether by insurance, litigation, sectlerr ent, or otherwise. The	9
plan is entitled to such funds to the extent of plan benefits paid to or on behalf of :he individual, whether	10
or not the individual has been "made whole,” and without regard to any common fimd doctrine. This plan	11
may recover such funds by constructive trust, equitable lien, right of subrogation, reimbursement, or any	12

Uniformed Services Leave of Absence
If you take a leave of absence for service in the U.S. uniformed services (including the military, National Guard, and the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service), you are covered under the Package until the end of the month in which your leave began. If you remain on an approved leave of absence, coverage under the Package continues until the end of the third foil calendar month of the leave as if you were an active employee on an approved nonmedical leave of absence.
If uniformed service extends beyond 3 months, you will be enrolled for COBRA coverage automatically as of the beginning of the fourth full calendar month of your leave. You may continue COBRA coverage for an additional 21 months while your uniformed services leave continues, in accordance with your rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).
During a temporary period after September 11, 2001, military leave of absence can be extended for a total of 60 months, based on military orders. Your life insurance, medical, and dental coverage continue during this period. The cost of coverage during this 60-month period is the same as for active employees.
Your COBRA continuation period runs concurrendy with coverage during USERRA leave.
If you return to active employment promptly after uniformed service, according to USERRA, the Package is reinstated on the date you return to the active payroll.
Changes in Leave Types
If your type of leave changes from a medical leave of absence to a nonmedical leave of absence (or vice versa), your periods of leave will be considered separate leaves of absence. However, if the type of your nonmedical leave of absence changes (for example, from family leave to personal leave), your maximum period of coverage in your new leave category will be reduced by the number of days or months for which you already received an extension of your active coverage.
Successive Periods of Leaves of Absence
Two medical leaves of absence separated by less than 30 days of continuous work are considered 1 leave of absence unless the second leave is due to entirely unrelated conditions.

Changes in Status
You will not be able to make dependent enrollment changes until the next annual enrollment period unless you experience one of the status changes described in this section. Any change in enrollment must be consistent with the status change. To be consistent, the event must cause you or your family member to gain or lose eligibility for Company-sponsored health care coverage or health care coverage sponsored by your eligible dependent’s employer, and the election change must be on account of and correspond with your or your family member’s gain or loss of eligibility. Status changes include the following:
*	You acquire a new, eligible dependent through marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption.
*	You lose a dependent through divorce, legal separation, or annulment of your marriage.
•	Your covered dependent dies.
•	Your covered dependent starts or stops working.
■	Your covered dependent has any other change in employment status that affects eligibility for coverage such as changing from full time to part time (or pan time to full time), salaried to hourly (or hourly to salaried), strike or lockout, or beginning or returning from a leave of absence.
•	You change from retired employment status to active employment status and become eligible for another health care plan.
■	You or your covered dependent experiences a significant increase in the cost of employer-sponsored health care coverage or the employer-sponsored health care coverage ends, including expiration of COBRA coverage.
•	The Company adds a new benefit option or significantly improves an existing benefit option.
*	You or your covered dependent experiences a significant curtailment or cessation of employer-sponsored health care coverage.
•	You or your covered dependent becomes eligible or ineligible for Medicare or Medicaid.
•	Your dependent child becomes eligible for, or no longer is eligible for, health care coverage due to age limits, principal support status, or a similar eligibility requirement.
■	Your covered dependent makes an enrollment change in his or her employer-sponsored health care coverage, either because of a qualified change in status or an annual enrollment.
•	You or your covered dependent changes place of residence or work, affecting access to care within the current plan.
You also may change an election to comply with a qualified medical child support order (QMCSO) to provide or cancel coverage for a child resulting from a divorce, annulment, or change in legal custody.
If you are eligible to add new dependents, you must request the dependent enrollment change within 60 days after the qualified event. You can enroll a new dependent within 120 days following your marriage or your dependent child’s birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. Enrollment may be requested by calling the Boeing Service Center. To request enrollment for a new dependent more than 60 days but within 120 days after marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, you must call the Boeing Service Center and speak with a customer service representative. You must provide the Boeing Service Center with any required supporting documentation within 31 days of the date the dependent enrollment change is requested or the coverage change request will be denied.
