BENEFITS
1 . Health and Accident Insurance
$2,053,678
(Attachment #4)
It is agreed that district employees will share equally the responsibility for increases in health insurance costs. However, for the 2004-2005 year only, due to the 0.49 % WPU increase landed by the Legislature, the following methodology will be used. The 0.49% (or $900,000) will be deducted from the employee’s 50% responsibility.
For, example, the insurance cost increase for 2004-2005 is projected to be $4.2 million. Under agreed upon terms, the $4.2 million cost increase would be divided evenly - $2.1 million to the District and $2.1 to the employees. For this agreement only, the 0.49% increase ($900,000) would be subtracted from the employee $2.1 millton obligation, reducing their net obligation to $ 1.2 million ($2.1 m - $0.9 million). The district would assume the remaining cost increase of $3.0 million ($4.2 m - 1.2 m).

Proposal
JEA proposes changes fn DP 304 Neg. Teacher Transfers and Reduction in Force policy.
This proposal would split the policy into two separate policies—Teacher Transfer Policy and a separate Reduction in Certificated Staff policy*
Rationale
JEA feels that the separation of these policies would darify and separate the Issues* Transfers are either voluntary or involuntary. Reduction in Staff procedures would allow teachers to look at a separate policy to understand what happens in the schools when there are changes in the staffing formulas.

JEA proposes that newly hired educators be required to attend four days of training In addition to New Teacher Orientation day. These educators would be paid a stipend of $400 and would begin with the 2005-06 contract year.
Rationale
The three or more days that beginning educators are required to be out of their classrooms when the training could be completed prior to school starting might eliminate some concerns that the educators are out of the classroom too often for these types of training.
