Dear Mr. Espinosa:
I am writing to indicate how the Company will apply the language in Article 10, Holidays, Sections 2 and 3 of the Agreement between Local 919 and The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company LLC. These Sections say, "To be eligible for holiday pay an employee must work on the last scheduled day before and the first scheduled day after the holiday."
If an employee is excused from work on either or both of these two days for good cause, and performs work during the week in which the holiday occurs (unless the employee is on vacation), such employee will still be eligible for holiday pay.
Sincerely,
ll
