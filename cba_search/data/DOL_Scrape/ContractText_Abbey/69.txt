Employees shall be considered seniority employees and placed on the plant seniority list on the first day of work following completion of their probationary period, and their plant seniority will date back to their date of hire.

2.	The plant is divided into departments. Currently the departments are:
Plant Services
Receiving
Filling
Sterilizing
Vegetable Operations
Meat Operations
Blending
Labeling
Blending Services
Distribution
Maintenance Utilities Prego/Pace Training
3.	The principle of seniority among qualified personnel within the shift will be followed in filling openings to balance the crewing between shifts.
4.	If an operation is relocated from a department, the employees performing the work shall have the option of moving with the operation or being assigned to available work in the department.
C.	Seniority Lists
A seniority list showing employees' plant seniority will be maintained. The Company will supply the Union with such a list semi-annually and a department seniority list on a quarterly basis.
The Company will notify the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union monthly of additions to and termination's from the bargaining unit.
0. Employee Transfer
1.	In transfers or promotions, consideration will be given to seniority, ability, aptitude, and other qualifications to perform the job. The senior qualified bidder will be awarded the job. Permanent job openings will be posted three (3) working days on the main bulletin board. Employees on vacation, or on approved leave of absence, who filed with the Human Resource Department before going on the leave of absence or vacation, a request for consideration on the job opening will be considered for the duration of such leave of absence or vacation, as having bid on the job, provided that they are able to commence the job within two (2) weeks of being awarded the job. Job posting will include job title, rate of pay, hours of work, department, number of people required, name of supervisor, and the approximate date the opening is to be filled. Information concerning job duties will be available in the Human Resources Department. The name of the successful bidder will be posted. The successful bidder shall be assigned to the job within two (2) weeks. If an employee refuses a job after their previous job has been posted, they will either go to available work and will not be allowed to bid on any job opening for a period of three (3) months, or they can accept the job and then exercise their bidding rights.
2.	Effective January 1, 1996, an eligible employee will be entitled to three (3) successful bids in a rolling twelve (12) month period. If an employee's job is eliminated by the Company and the employee has used his/her three (3) bids, the employee will be allowed one (1) additional bid.
3.	Openings which will not exceed ninety (90) days will be considered temporary and will not be posted. Openings in the Distribution Department during September and October will be considered temporary and will not be posted except openings in previously bid jobs. Openings as a result of an employee being on personal leave of absence or medical leave of absence which do not exceed sixty (60) days will not be posted. Openings as a result of military leaves of absence which do not exceed six (6) months will not be posted. Employees filling temporary openings will not use their plant seniority to displace other employees when their temporary job ceases to exist. Insofar as
practical, the principle of seniority among qualified personnel within the shift will be followed in filling temporary openings.
4.	Mechanics, Machinists, and Electricians will be reviewed for upgrading purposes according to the following schedule:
C - B 1 year
B - A 1 year
A- AA 1 year
In addition, all employees in their classification will be informed of their progress at the midpoint of the upgrading period.
E.	Reductions in Force
1.	In the event it becomes necessary to make a reduction in force within a department, probationary employees in the department will be the first to be transferred. If a further reduction in force is necessary, it will be done among the remaining employees in the department based on their plant seniority date except in cases where efficient production would be impeded.
Employees with the greater plant seniority who are not subject to layoff and are displaced from their job classifications shall retain rights to be recalled to that job classification and shift from which they were displaced for twelve (12) months. Employees displaced from their department may exercise their seniority to return to their department to available openings if qualified to perform available jobs before less senior employees are allowed to exercise job recall rights.
2.	Temporary transfers due to the temporary curtailment of an operation or a part of an operation may be made without regard to seniority provided it does not exceed three (3) continuous working days.
3.	Employees transferred to a salaried position shall retain seniority for a period of six (6) months. Upon returning to hourly status they will go to work available. An employee will be allowed to return to hourly status only once.
4.	In the event it becomes necessary to make a plant-wide layoff the following procedure will be followed:
a.	All probationary employees within the plant shall be laid off before employees with seniority. It is understood probationary employees need not be laid off in the order of their length of service with the Company but may be chosen at the Company's discretion. This shall not be construed to mean that the Company shall be required to lay off any employees having special technical or mechanical skill.
b.	If conditions require a further layoff, employees with seniority shall be laid off in reverse order of their plant seniority in accordance with the following procedure:
1	.) Determine number of jobs to be eliminated.
2	.) Names and jobs held by employees with the least plant seniority subject to layoff will be listed.
3	.) Employees with the greater plant seniority who are not subject to layoff, but whose jobs are being eliminated, will be assigned openings resulting from the layoff of employees at the bottom of the plant seniority list by the principle of seniority among qualified employees.
4	.) Employees with the greater plant seniority, who are not subject to layoff, who are not qualified to perform available job openings at the bottom of the plant-wide seniority list may displace the least seniority employee in jobs they are qualified to perform. No employee shall be laid off who is capable of performing the duties of a job held by another employee with less plant seniority.
c.	The Company will forward to the Union as soon as possible a list of employees affected by a reduction in force. The list will include the employee's former classification and shift.
F.	Employees will be recalled from layoff strictly on the basis of their plant seniority provided they are qualified to satisfactorily perform the duties of the jobs to be filled. If an employee is not qualified to perform the available job, such employee will be continued on layoff.
G.	It is agreed that all employees recalled or rehired from layoff will be extended job retention rights for one (1) year to the bid or assigned job held prior to the original reduction in force. Jobs to be filled through retention rights do not have to be posted.
H.	An employee shall cease to have seniority and his/her employment with the Company shall be considered terminated for all purposes when:
1.	He/she voluntarily leaves the Company's employ.
2.	He/she is discharged for just cause.
3.	Having been laid off for lack of work, he/she fails to report within a period of forty-eight hours following a telephone call to the employee or ninety-six hours following mailing of registered notice to the last known address as shown on the Company's records, unless failure to do so is due to circumstances beyond his/her control.
4.	He/she fails to report for work at the termination of a leave of absence or furlough, unless such failure is due to circumstances beyond his/her control.
5.	He/she works for another company or another job while on leave of absence.

Company Contributions: For each $1.00 saved, up to the first 5% of pay, the Company will make a matching contribution of $ .50. At the sole discretion of the Company the $ .50 per $1.00 saved Company match may be increased based on the attainment of goals set by the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors.

RETIREMENT AND PENSION PLAN Effective December 19,2001
ESP
Pension benefits prior to December 10, 1984, are based on eligible earnings and continuous service up to age 65. All employees at work on and after December 10, 1984, receive pension benefits based upon eligible earnings and continuous service based upon the following provisions:
Eligibility: All regular, full-time employees become covered under the Plan on their first day of work.
Retirement Age*. Normal retirement age is 65. All' employees may, in accordance with applicable law, continue in employment beyond his/her normal retirement age. An employee with vested rights may elect to retire between age 55 and 65, but on a reduced amount of pension.
Cost: The Company pays for the entire cost of the Retirement and Pension Plan.
*The complete details of the Pension Plan are contained in Campbell's Soup's Retirement and Pension Plan for Employees Covered By Collective Bargaining Agreement and Paris Plant Schedule.
Effective January 1, 2002, as part of the Equity, Savings & Planning (ESP) program the Campbell Soup Retirement and Pension Plan is modified, as follows: Each employee will have an individual notional account and each year the notional account will be credited with an annual allocation of earnings, based on the employee's age at the end of the prior year, and guaranteed interest based on the 30-Year Treasury Bill rate for the prior November, or such equivalent rate as designated by the Internal Revenue Service.
In no event will an employee hired prior to January 1, 2002 who separates from the Company before January 1, 2017 receive a benefit less than he or she would have received under the pension plan formula in affect prior to the implementation of the ESP changes.
Employees who separate from the Company with 5 years of service or more will, at age 65, receive a supplement from the pension plan equal to $3.00 per month times years of service. In addition, employees who retire from the Company between ages 55 - 65 with at least 10 years of service will receive a pension supplement of $13.00 per	month times years of	service, payable until	they	reach
age 65. The use of this	supplement is at the	complete discretion of	the
employee. Employees who	were at least age 55	with at least 10 years	of
continuous service as of	January 1, 2002 will	not receive the $13.00	supplement
if they elect to receive company paid retiree medical when they retire.
PENSION DISABILITY SUPPLEMENT:
A Pension Disability Supplement shall be provided to any vested active employee who is totally disabled and on an approved occupational or non-occupational medical leave. It shall not apply to individuals who terminated employment prior to December 11, 1978.
The Pension Disability Supplement provides pension credit for totally disabled employees whose employment is terminated and whose pension benefits are vested. The pension credit will be based upon the employee's base pay immediately preceding the disability and calculated each year using the same pension formula as for active covered employees. The Pension Disability Supplement will cease the earlier date:	(1) when the employee reaches age 65, (2) when the total
disability ceases to exist, (3) when the employee begins to receive retirement benefits under the plan, or (4) when Long Term Disability benefits cease.
Total disability means that the covered employee is unable to perform the duties of any available or existing position in the Company because of bodily injury or illness which is expected to result in death or to be of long, continued and indefinite duration.
RETIREE MEDICAL PROGRAM
The Equity, Savings & Planning (ESP) program has replaced the retiree medical program. For employees who are not age 55 with at least 10 years of continuous service on January 1, 2002 the current retiree medical plan (in place prior to January 1, 2002) will not be offered. The Company will make various healthcare
options available to such employees where the employee will pay the full cost of the plan, if elected.
Employees age 55 with 10 years of continuous service as of January 1, 2002 who retire after January 1, 2002 may choose the current Retiree Medical Plan (in place prior to January 1, 2002) at the Company's expense to maintain their medical insurance or receive a cash supplement from the pension plan based on their years of service with the Company.
Please refer to the ESP Informational Kit for eligibility requirements to receive either retiree medical or the cash supplement.
STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
Eligible employees on January 1, 2002 will receive 100 Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) and will be paid the appreciation on those shares if they are continuously employed by Campbell through January 1, 2005.
LIFE INSURANCE
The Group Life Insurance Plan is composed of Basic Life Insurance and Additional Life Insurance. The full cost of the Basic Life Insurance is paid by the Company.
Effective 4/30/96 Additional Life will be discontinued with the exception of employees who are age 50 and over. Those employees previously enrolled, will continue to have the opportunity to participate in the Additional Life Insurance Program. The cost of the Additional Life Insurance is paid by the employee.
Eligibility is stated in Article Seven, Section A, Paragraph 2.
The amount of your Life Insurance is determined by your classification in the Schedule of Insurance.
Schedule of Insurance:

*Basic annual earnings shall mean your basic hourly rate of pay times 2080.
If you receive a wage adjustment which is sufficient to cause an increase or decrease in the amount of your insurance, the amount of your insurance will be changed on the date your wage adjustment becomes effective.
Employees are covered for the Basic Life Insurance on the day they become eligible.
You may name any person you wish as your beneficiary to receive the insurance payment in the event of your death. You may change your beneficiary at anytime by contacting the Human Resources Department and by completing the proper forms.
Basic Group Life Insurance is continued by the Company for an employee on an approved medical leave of absence. An employee on personal leave of absence, or laid off with seniority status may continue his/her coverage for both Basic and Additional Life Insurance by paying the required premium in advance.
On retirement, Additional Life Insurance is terminated. For employees who retire under the Company Pension Plan on or after December 8, 1975, the Basic Life Insurance paid by the Company shall be the greater of $1,500, or in the first year 80% of the Basic Life Insurance in effect immediately before retirement; in the second year 60%; in the third year 40%; and in the fourth year 20%. At the end of the fourth year, the amount of Basic Life Insurance shall be $1,500* which shall remain in force during the retired employee's life.
If you continue in employment beyond age 65 and subsequently retire, the following indicates the percentage of Company paid Basic Life Insurance that will be in effect at retirement based upon your age at actual retirement.
Amount of Company Paid Basic Life Insurance
Retirement Age
65
66
67
68
69
70
Percent or Amount of Retiree Life' 80% 60% 40% 20% $1,500 $1,500
For Example: If an employee at age 66 had $12,000 of Basic Life Insurance and the employee retired at age 67, the amount of Company paid Life Insurance would be $4,800 ($12,000 x 40%{.4} . If the employee worked until age 69 and then retired, at retirement Company paid Life Insurance in the amount of $1,500, would continue in force indefinitely at the Company's expense.
Upon retirement under the Pension Plan, an employee can convert any portion of the difference between the full amount of his/her life insurance and the retirement amount without a physical examination, provided written application for such conversion is made to the Insurance Company within thirty-one (31) days following his retirement date. The employee will pay the full cost of the insurance that is converted. The amount of life insurance that may be converted is limited to the amount the Basic Life Insurance is reduced each year.
Upon termination of employment, an employee has the right of converting his/her Life Insurance without a physical examination to an individual Life Insurance Policy in any one of the forms currently issued by the Insurance Carrier, except Term Life Insurance. Written application for such conversion must be made to the Carrier within thirty-one {31) days after termination. The employee will pay the full cost of insurance that is converted.
GROUP UNIVERSAL LIFE
Effective 5/1/96 Group Universal Life Insurance will be available to all regular full-time employees. Eligibility is stated in Article Seven, Section A, Paragraph 1.
Group Universal Life provides coverage for the employee, spouse and children. Employee's can enroll for as much as 3 X's their annual base salary and enroll their spouse for as much as 2 X's the employee's annual base salary.
Children, eligible dependents, from age 14 days to 6 mos. of age can be enrolled for $1,000 each. Children over six months of age can be enrolled for $10,000 each. The cost for children is $1.00 per month, a flat rate.
This program has a Cash Accumulation option and an Additional Death Benefit option.
MEDICAL PLAN
The Company and Union have agreed on a new plan design. The Company and Union agree to investigate an alternative third party administrator to administer medical for this new design during the first 90 days of this collective bargaining agreement. The current I1MO Blue design will remain in effect until the investigation is complete and both parties have agreed.
Employee Eligibility: Benefit coverage will be effective on the first day of work following the completion of the probationary period (First 180 consecutive days of active employment in a twelve-month period).
Employee Contributions: From implementation of this contract until December 31, 2002 the employee contributions will be:
Single - $ 5.00 per month Family - $40.00 per month.
In future years of this contract, these rates will be re-established on January 1st of each year in order to hold employee contributions as a fixed % of the overall cost of the medical costs. The fixed % will be established once the new plan design has been implemented and the rates for this plan are established, based on the 1st year contribution levels.
Should the implementation of the new plan not be finalized within the 90 day period, the current HMO Blue coverage will be extended, but employee contributions will be increased as follows:
90 days after ratification -
1/1/03 -	12/31/03	-
1/1/04	-	12/31/04	-
1/1/05	-	07/29/05	-
Single $20.00/mo.,Family $50.00/mo.
Single $25.00/mo.,Family $60.00/mo.
Single $35.00/mo.,Family $75.00/mo.
Single $40.00/mo.,Family $85.00/mo.
The premiums for coverage will be deducted from the employee's wages.
HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION (Texas Residents) PREFERRED PROVIDERS ORGANIZATION (Oklahoma Residents) PROGRAMS
Co-pay for doctor visits are $10.00 and co-pay for specialist visits are $10.00.
If an employee's spouse is employed and has access to group medical insurance, he/she will be required to carry that coverage and will not be covered by Campbell Soups medical plan. This will apply to all employees hired on or after March 23, 1998.
Should additional HMO1s be implemented, an employee may choose to change from the low-cost HMO to the higher-cost HMO one time without penalty. However, further changes to a higher-cost HMO will require the employee to contribute the cost difference between the chosen HMO and the lowest-cost HMO.
SUMMARY OF BENEFITS

Coverage for such students will continue during vacation periods but not beyond six (6) months from the date of last attendance at school.
The term "children" means:
1.	Your natural children for whom you are legally responsible; and,

When you and/or your eligible dependents have completed the benefits schedule with EAP and you are enrolled in the HMO you should contact Merit Behavior Corporation (1-800-729-2422) for additional benefits. If you and/or eligible dependents are enrolled in the PPO and you have completed the benefits schedule with EAP you will have the choice of using either and in-network or out-ofnetwork provider.

Effective December 12, 1983, Accident and Sickness Insurance will be provided for each regular full-time employee. Eligibility is stated in Article Seven, Section A, Paragraph 2. The plan will cover disabilities due to non-occupational bodily injuries, sickness, or disease which arise on and after becoming eligible for the A & S Benefit. Benefits become payable with the eighth consecutive day of disability provided the disabled employee has been treated by a physician on or before the day upon which the benefits would begin. Otherwise, benefits begin on the first day on which the disabled employee is treated by a physician. Benefits are payable until the disabled employee is able to perform the duties of his/her occupation but not for more than twenty-six (26) weeks during any one period of disability.
Effective December 12, 1983, for employees who are hospitalized, benefits shall be paid commencing with the first full calendar day of hospital confinement. If the benefits commence within the normal waiting period, such benefits shall continue in accordance with the plan while disabled without an additional waiting period in the event the employee is discharged from the hospital after the first full calendar day of hospital confinement.
The Accident and Sickness benefit only applies to active employees, therefore if your are on layoff or leave of absence, or otherwise not actively at work, these benefits will not apply until you return to regular full time employment.

Effective December 5, 1994, the following schedule of maximum weekly Accident and Sickness benefits shall apply:
Job Group 1-5 6-8 9-11 12 +

The cost is borne entirely by the Company. Upon termination of active employment or retirement the insurance plan shall terminate except with respect to a disability which occurred prior to termination of active employment or retirement.
LONG-TERM DISABILITY INSURANCE
Effective January 1, 1984, a Long-Term Disability Insurance plan will be made available to each regular, full-time hourly employee. Eligibility is stated in
Article Seven, Section A, Paragraph 1. Long-Term Disability benefits will not be payable for any disability beginning within the first twelve (12) months of employment if the disability is due to a sickness, disease, or injury for which the employee was under a physician's care or receiving treatment within three (3) months prior to the date of employment. After twelve (12) months of employment, if the employee is at work thereafter, benefits may be payable for conditions in existence on the date of employment.
If an otherwise eligible employee is not at work on the effective date of his/her coverage because of injury, sickness or disease, such employee will be insured on the first day of work after performing his/her regular, full-time duties for twenty-one (21) consecutive days. However, all employees who are on Medical Leave, or Workers' Compensation on January 1, 1984 will be covered by Long-Term Disability Insurance.
What is Long Term Disability Insurance?
Your benefits are determined from your average weekly earnings from the Company. Average Weekly Earnings will be computed as of March 1 each year to determine the amount of your coverage. The coverage will be based upon your Average Weekly Earnings annualized for the previous calendar year. Your Average Weekly Earnings will be projected to average monthly earnings. Effective March 23, 1998 the maximum considered is $4000.
What are my benefits?
The Long-Term Disability benefits shall be equal to 50% of an eligible employee's average weekly earnings (Average Weekly Earnings projected to a monthly basis). Effective March 23, 1998 the maximum benefit is $2000 per month which would bo *reduced by the amounts of payments received from sources (a) to (e) below:

B.	**Primary Social Security (individual benefit only, excluding
dependent benefits),
C.	Temporary weekly Workers' Compensation benefits,
D.	Weekly disability benefits provided under any state plan or company-sponsored private plan,
E.	Dependent Social Security benefits would also be used as an offset to the extent that one-haIf of his/her average weekly earnings plus dependent Social Security benefits exceed 75% of his/her average weekly earnings. Any general increases in Federal Social Security benefits after the employee becomes entitled to benefits under this plan will have no effect on the employee's basic Long-Term Disability amount.
If an employee continues in employment beyond age 65, his/her coverage will remain in force, but will be administered as follows:
If a covered disability occurs prior to age 60, benefits will be payable until he/she recovers or attains age 65. If a covered disability occurs on or after age 60, benefits will be payable until he/she recovers, or for a maximum of five (5) years, but in no event will benefits be payable after attainment of age 70.
Insurance protection does not continue for employees on personal leave, ***or layoff with seniority unless the employee pays the full cost of the Long-Term Disability Insurance. However, their coverage will immediately be reinstated upon return to active, full-time employment.
In the event of a dispute between a private physician and a physician retained by the insurance carrier, a selection of an impartial physician (examiner) is to be made jointly by the physician retained by the insurance
carrier and the private physician. The impartial physician will make a final determination as to the medical facts relating to the employee’s mental and/or physical condition for determination by the insurance carrier of liability under the group Long-Term Disability policy.
In the event an employee has been receiving Long-Term Disability benefits when it became necessary to make such a determination, benefit payments will continue until the impartial physician has made his/her determination.
If the impartial physician's examination, as determined by the carrier, establishes the carrier's liability, benefit payments will be retroactive to the date that the employee became eligible for Long-Term Disability benefits.
*	Average weekly earnings will be computed as of March 1 each year to determine the amount of the benefit. The benefit will be based upon the average weekly earnings annualized for the previous calendar year.
*	* If his/her disability entitles him/her to Social Security benefits, he/she must apply for such benefits. If Social Security benefits are denied, he/she must apply a second time. If he/she fails to apply for Social Security his/her Long-Term Disability benefits will nevertheless be reduced as outline in B and E.
***An employee on a personal leave of absence continues to be covered through the end of the calendar month in which he/she goes on leave.
RETIREE MEDICAL PROGRAM
The Equity, Savings & Planning (ESP) program has replaced the retiree medical program. For employees who are not age 55 with at least 10 years of continuous service on January 1, 2002 the current retiree medical plan will not be offered. The Company will make various healthcare options available to such employees where the employee will pay the full cost of the plan, if elected.
Employees age 55 with 10 years of continuous service as of January 1, 2002 who retire after January 1, 2002 may choose the current Retiree Medical Plan at the Company's expense to maintain their medical insurance or receive a cash supplement from the pension plan based on their years of service with the Company.
Please refer to the ESP Informational Kit for eligibility requirements to receive either retiree medical or the cash supplement.
DENTAL ARRANGEMENT
Eligibility is stated in Article Seven, Section A, Paragraph 1.
Benefits are payable for any covered dental expense incurred on or after January 1, 1983.
Effective January 1, 1991, the maximum dental benefit for each eligible employee and eligible dependent is $1,000 during any calendar year and a $10,000 lifetime benefit. The Plan will not cover expenses due to orthodontic treatment, periodontal treatment (except listed periodontal procedures), an occupational accident, or services performed in a government hospital.
The Company will pay the full cost of the Plan for an employee and eligible dependents while the employee is working or on an approved medical leave. Employees on personal leaves of absence or layoff with seniority may continue the coverage by paying the required full monthly contribution in advance.
All dental expenses for accidental injury to natural teeth for employees and eligible dependents will come under the HMO/PPO rather than the Dental Plan.
ADVANCE TREATMENT REVIEW — If a course of treatment will exceed $200.00 the treatment plan must be submitted for review before the work starts. The employee and the dentist or physician will be advised of the estimated benefits payable under the Dental Plan, subject to eligibility, maximums, and limitations and exclusions. In order to review the treatment plan, a description of each service and charge should be submitted along with supporting aids such as preoperative X-rays if surgery is involved.
Effective as soon as practical, but no later than January 1, 2003 one additional Dental Plan will be available to employees. Information regarding this plan is available in the Human Resources Department.
VISION CARE PLAN
Eligibility is stated in Article Seven, Section A, Paragraph 1.
Effective December 9, 1991, a Company administered Vision Care Plan was made available to eligible employees and their eligible dependents of the plan.
Effective January 1, 1997 the Company will reimburse 100% up to a maximum of $125 per calendar year per covered individual for vision care services connected with an examination and purchase of eyeglasses or contact lenses.
The Company will pay the full cost of the plan
COORDINATION OF BENEFITS
The purpose of our Employee Benefit Program, which provides broad extensive coverage for various types of medical care and treatment, is to help employees pay their medical bills.
It is not intended that benefits exceed the medical expenses incurred. For this reason, if an employee is covered under another "plan" and the total benefits would exceed the actual medical expenses incurred, the medical benefits provided under our program will be reduced so that the total benefits received do not exceed the actual medical expenses incurred.
For this purpose, the word "plan" means any plan providing benefits or services for or by reason of medical care or treatment, which benefits or services are provided by (1) group, blanket or franchise insurance coverage, (2) Blue Cross, Blue Shield, group practice or other prepayment coverage, (3) any coverage under labor-management trusteed plans, Union welfare plans, employer organization plans, or employee benefit organization plans, (4) any coverage under governmental programs, and any coverage required or provided by any statute, and (5) in the case of a child, any coverage sponsored by, or provided through, a school or other educational institution. When the Company is the secondary insurance coverage, any eligible charges not paid at 100% by the primary carrier will be subject to applicable deductibles and co-payments under the Company plan (secondary carrier).
SUBROGATION
It is not intended for our Plan to cover medical expenses for treatment of injuries sustained in an accident that are rightfully the responsibility of a
third party. For that reason our Plan has a subrogation clause. This means our Plan will make prompt payments of its benefits even though a third party may be liable, but the right is reserved to have such payment refunded if the liability is later assumed by the third party.
CONSOLIDATED OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1985 (COBRA)
Effective January 1, 1988, as a result of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), employees who no longer work for the Company (except for those discharged for gross misconduct) or employees who lose group health plan benefits due to a reduction in hours, will be able to continue coverage under the group health plan for a period not to exceed 18 months. Dependents who lose coverage as a result of the divorce , legal separation, or death of the employee, or the employee becoming eligible for Medicare, or exceeding the age limit under the health plan, will be able to continue coverage under the group health plan for a period not to exceed 36 months.
The former employee or dependent must pay the total premium plus two percent administrative fee as provided for under the law. Coverage will be terminated when the former employee or dependent fails to pay the required amount due. The Company will cease to provide group health coverage when the former employee or dependent becomes covered under another group plan or becomes eligible for Medicare.
Employees will be notified of the opportunity to continue group health plan coverage upon termination of employment. Dependents will be notified of their rights to continued coverage in the event of death of the employee or the employee becoming eligible for Medicare. Dependents must contact the Human Resources office to continue coverage, in the event of the divorce or legal separation of the employee or the dependent becoming ineligible because of the age limit.
In the event the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 is changed by Federal Law, the Company reserves the right to change or terminate continuation of coverage in accordance with the law.
