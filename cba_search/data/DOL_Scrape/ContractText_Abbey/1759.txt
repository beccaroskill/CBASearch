February 28,2008
It is the purpose and intent that this PipeLine Labor Manual shall include the current up-to-date Agreements which have been negotiated by the Pipe Line Contractors Association with the four Unions recognized as having jurisdiction on mainline cross country pipe lines. The Unions are the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry of the United States and Canada, the International Union of Operating Engineers, and the Laborers International Union of North America.
Also included are all Policy Committee decisions issued by the National Pipe Line Industry Joint Policy Committee.
The Agreements are binding on all those contractor members of the Pipe Line Contractors Association who execute them and on such other contractors who, though not members of the Association, have accepted and signed the Agreements.
As revisions are made in the provisions of the Agreements or in the wage rates for each Union, new pages will be printed and distributed so that your Pipe Line Labor Manual may be kept up-to-date.

If the Union is unable to fill the dispatch request, the Employer may obtain rig welders from any source in accordance with Article V(G)(4) of the Agreement.
(B)	As of July 1,2007, the Parties agree to treat rig rental rates as a (mandatory subject of bargaining within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act, with all of the rights and obligations that attach to such a subject of bargaining.

Annual increases to the deemed substantiated rate permitted by the IRS pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2002-41 shall not be the basis for reopening the NPLA for negotiating rig rental rates.
