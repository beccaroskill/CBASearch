Agreement
ARTICLE ONE RECOGNITION
SECTION 1 -
(a)	BARGAINING UNIT, The Company hereby recognizes the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, and its Local No. 287 as the exclusive representatives of all of the Company's employees at its plants located in the City of Muncie and Delaware County, Indiana, including employees in the Experimental Engineering Occupational Unit, hereinafter referred to as “EEOU” (except as this Subsection (a) is enlarged by Subsection (b) of this Section) except those employees mentioned in Section 2 of this Article, for the purpose of collective bargaining with respect to rates of pay, wages, hours and other conditions of employment.
(b)	REMOVAL OR ACQUISITION OF PLANTS.

I
or offered employment in the new location or place according to their seniority and placed in the same status in regard to pay, wages, hours, and other working conditions as before said removal occurred, and such new plant operated by Borg-Warner Automotive Diversified Transmission Products Corporation, Muncie Plant shall be covered by all the terms and conditions hereof. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any plant acquired by Borg-Wamer Automotive Diversified Transmission Products Corporation, Muncie Plant which has a collective bargaining agreement with another union but the Union shall not be precluded from petitioning the National Labor Relations Board for the right to represent the employees in such plant. Also, the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any plant at which the National Labor Relations Board certifies another union to be the collective bargaining representative of the employees.
(c)	RELOCATION ALLOWANCE. If an employee is offered work and accepts it pursuant to Subsection (b) of this Section, then in that event the Company and Union agree to negotiate the amount of a relocation allowance.
(See Letter of Understanding re: Plant Closure. Page 146)
SECTION 2 - EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES This Agreement shall not apply to or include any direct representatives of the Company, superintendents, foremen, assistant foremen, supervisors in charge of any class of work, plant protection employees, office employees, confidential clerks and time study men, and such persons will not be accepted for membership by Local No. 287.
2
SECTION 3	- UNION SECURITY
(a)	Any employee who is a member of the Union at the time this Section becomes effective shall continue membership in the Union for the duration of this Agreement to the extent of paying an initiation fee, membership dues uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership in the Union, as a condition of continued employment,
(b)	Any employee who is not a member of the Union at the lime this Section becomes effective shall become a member of the Union within thirty (30) days after the effective date of this Section or within thirty (30) days after the date of employment, whichever is later, and, as a condition of continued employment, shall remain a member of the Union for the duration of this Agreement to the extent of paying an initiation fee and the membership dues uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership in the Union. All employees of the bargaining unit who are working outside the bargaining unit and who return to the bargaining unit shall be required, as a condition of continued employment, to be members of the Union on and after the 31st day following the date they return to the bargaining unit.
(c)	The Union Security provisions contained in the Section of this Article shall be deemed to be of no force and effect while precluded by law; provided, however, that in the event said provisions become lawful through legislative or judicial process they shall be deemed immediately thereupon to be in effect, without the necessity of any further action by either party.
3
SECTION 4-	AUTHORIZATION TO CHECK OFF UNION DUES AND V-CAP
Upon written authorization by an employee on a form provided by the Company, the Company will deduct from wages due said employee each month the regular initiation and/or reinstatement fee and his monthly Union dues. Such deductions will be made when so authorized during the life of this Agreement or until such written authorization is revoked by said employee in writing on a form provided by the Company. Such deductions will be made from the paycheck due the employee on the second pay day of each month, provided, however, that written authorization by the employee or revocation thereof must be in the hands of the Company at least two (2) weeks prior to the close of the payroll period in which they are to become effective.
The Company shall notify the Union in writing of all revocations within five (5) days of the receipt of same.
Any monies deducted by the Company from wages of employees in accordance with this Agreement shall be paid to the Financial Secretary of Local No. 287 not later than the end of the month in which such deductions are made.
No deductions will be made from the wages of an employee for Union dues if the amount due such employee for a payroll period in which deductions are scheduled is less than the total of all deductions from the wages of such employee required or authorized, and in such event the deductions will be made from a later payroll. No such deductions will be made from accident or disability benefits.
Authorization to check off union dues and V-Cap Agreement:
The Company agrees to deduct from the pay of each employee voluntary contributions to UAW V-Cap,
4
provided that each such employee executed or has executed the following “Authorization for Assignment and Check-off of Contributions to UAW V-Cap” form. Deductions shall be made, pursuant to the forms received by the Company, from the employee’s first union dues period in the first month following receipt of the check-off authorization card and shall continue until the check-off authorization is revoked in writing. The Company agrees to remit said deductions promptly to UAW V- CAP, care of the Internationa] Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW). The Company further agrees to furnish UAW V-Cap with the names and addresses of those employees for whom deductions have been made. The Company further agrees to furnish UAW V-Cap each month and year-to-date reports of each employee’s deductions. The information shall be furnished along with each remittance.
SECTION 5	- AGENCY SHOP
(a)	Membership in the Union is not compulsory. Employees have the right to join, not join, maintain or drop their membership in the Union, as they see fit. Neither party shall exert any pressure on or discriminate against an employee as regards such matters.
(b)	Membership in the Union is separate, apart and distinct from the assumption by one of his equal obligations to the extent that he receives equal benefits. The Union is required under this Agreement to represent al) of the employees in the bargaining unit fairly and equally without regard as to whether or not an employee is a member of the Union. The terms of this Agreement have been made for all employees in the bargaining unit and not only for members in
5
the Union, and this Agreement has been executed after a secret ballot has been taken showing that the Union is the choice of a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit and the Union has been certified by the National Labor Relations Board. Accordingly, it is fair that each employee in the bargaining unit pay his own way and assume his fair share of the obligation along with the grant of equal benefit contained in this Agreement.
(c)	In accordance with the policy set forth under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Section, all employees shall, as a condition of continued employment, pay to the Union, the employees’ exclusive collective bargaining representative, an amount of money equal to that paid by other employees in the bargaining unit who are members of the Union, which shall be limited to an amount of money equal to the Union’s regular and usual initiation and/or reinstatement fees and its regular and usual dues. For existing employees, such payments shall commence thirty-one (31) days following the date of this Agreement and for new employees the payments shall start thirty-one (31) days following the date of employment. For all employees of the bargaining unit who are now outside the bargaining unit and who return to the bargaining unit the payment shall start thirty-one (31) days following the date they return to the bargaining unit.
(d)	Any employee who voluntarily desires the payment referred to in subparagraph © checked off shall sign a written authorization on a form provided by the Company, and the Company will deduct from wages due said employee each month the amount required to be paid under subparagraph ©. Such deductions will be made
6
when so authorized during the life of this Agreement or until such written authorization is revoked by said employee in writing on a form provided by the Company. Such deductions will be made from the paycheck due the employee on the second pay day of each month, provided, however, that written authorization by the employee or revocation thereof must be in the hands of the Company at least two (2) weeks prior to the close of the payroll period in which they are to become effective.
(e)	The Company shall notify the Union in writing of all revocations within five (5) days of the receipt of same.
(1) Any monies deducted by the Company from wages of employees in accordance with this Section shall be paid to the Financial Secretary of Local No. 287 not later than the end of the month in which such deductions are made.
(g)	No deductions will be made from the wages of an employee for Union dues if the amount due such employee for a payroll period in which deductions are scheduled is less than the total of all deductions from the wages of such employee authorized, and in such event the deductions will be made from a later payroll. No such deductions will be made from accident or disability benefits.

ARTICLE FOUR DISCIPLINARY ACTION
SECTION 1
It is the right of the Company to discipline and discharge employees for just cause. An employee may be temporarily suspended for a period not to exceed one (1) regular work day. In the event such a suspension occurs before the beginning of a Saturday, Sunday or holiday work assignment of the employee involved, such work assignment shall be canceled and a disciplinary meeting held on his next regular work day. Any employee who has been suspended may request the presence of his steward or committeemen to discuss the case with him in an office designated by the Company before he is required to leave the plant. Upon his request it is the obligation of the Company to notify the employee’s steward or committeemen of the request and the place where the meeting is to be held. In the absence of a steward or committeemen a reasonable effort will be made to contact any Union representative.
The Company will notify the employee’s steward and two committeemen from the zone (the skilled trades committeeman and the chairman of the negotiating committee if the employee is a skilled tradesman, or
18
the EEOU committeeman and the chairman of the negotiating committee if the employee is from the EEOU) at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the time and place of any disciplinary hearing, who may represent the employee involved in reviewing the employee’s case before the Disciplinary Board, except that such advance notice shall not be required where a prior suspension is involved. However, in case of a prior suspension, the appropriate Union representatives will be notified of the disciplinary hearing as soon as possible during their regular shift.
Any disciplinary hearing involving a prior suspension will be considered as a meeting called by the Company and the above designated Union representatives shall be compensated for rhe time spent in attending such meetings. It is recognized that ail members of the Committee may attend the disciplinary hearings, but that no such hearing will be held in abeyance due to the absence of any or all of the committeemen or the steward.
SECTION 2
If an employee is suspended, disciplined or discharged, the employee or the Union may submit a grievance beginning with Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure as soon as possible but not later than ten (10) work days after the date of the disciplinary action.
SECTION 3
If it should be decided under the Grievance Procedure that the employee (including probationaries) was not discharged or suspended for just cause, the Company shall reinstate the aggrieved employee with full compensation at the regular rate of pay, overtime premium excluded, for all time lost. Employees on disciplinary layoff will be covered by insurance paid by the Company for the first thirty (30) days of the layoff only and both the Union and the employee will be
19
advised of this coverage either in the disciplinary meeting or within the thirty-(3O) day period.
A grievance written under this section to protest the discharge or termination of a probationary employee shall be submitted directly to step #3 of the grievance procedure by the negotiating committee and shall be deemed settled with the final disposition by the Company in step #3.
SECTION 4
In imposing any discipline on a current charge, management will not take into account any prior infractions which occurred more than three (3) years previously, except for Written Verbal Warnings (Phase A) which stay within the department and are taken into account for a maximum one (1) year. Nor will the Company impose discipline on an employee for falsification of employment application after a period of two (2) years from the date of hire.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
In the application of Article Four, Section I, Disciplinary Action, the Company will consider an absence due to bona fide personal illness of an employee to determine just cause for discipline if their total absenteeism exceeds 5% in a rolling twelve (12) month period.
Total absenteeism excludes those contractually permissible absences (i.e.. holidays, FMLA, vacation, bereavement, jury duty, military and leaves of absence granted under Article Six).
In those instances where it is deemed necessary to establish whether an illness is to be considered, the Company may request that the employee document such illness in such a way as to establish whether the employee was (I) sick, and (2) unable to work for the period of time
20
involved. In accordance with this Letter of Understanding, the Company will determine if an employee’s absence should be documented. Should any such statement be found unacceptable to management, the employee will be so notified if at all possible within 5 work days.
The “bona fide personal illness” language is not intended to be used to discharge an employee who does not have chronic absenteeism. The company has not used, nor does if intend to use, this language to discharge an employee who does in fact have a “bona fide personal illness”. If an employee reaches the termination phase of discipline for absenteeism and claims that the triggering incident is due to a bona fide personal illness, the company will have the documentation reviewed by the company doctor. Disputes between the employee’s personal physician and the company doctor will be decided by a 3rd party physician selected by the physicians in question.
Written records of verbal warnings will not leave the Initiating department.

26
such option is received on or before the Wednesday preceding.
(2)	If the employee chooses to remain laid off rather than be transferred, he shall be returned to his occupation with accumulated seniority as soon as his seniority enables him to return, provided that any such employee after having remained laid off for a period of ten (10) work days may request to be recalled, and on such request he will be placed in accordance with his seniority status within three (3) work days after such request is made.

If the employee returns to work without exercising his option for an occupational layoff as described above, he shall be precluded from exercising such option until the Wednesday of the second week after returning to work or until he is affected by a decrease in the working force. Should the employee choose to remain laid off rather than be recalled he shall be returned to his occupation with accumulated seniority as soon as his seniority entitles him to return, provided that any such employee after having remained laid off for an additional period of ten (10) work days may request to be recalled, and on such request he will be placed in accordance with his seniority status within three (3) work days after such request is made. The only exception to the above provision shall be in those cases where the seniority list has been exhausted and there are employees remaining on “occupational layoff’ in which case all such employees will be notified to return to work as needed starting with the employee having the least seniority, and upon such notice the “occupational layoff’ shall be canceled.
Employees laid off or transferred due to a reduction in the working force shall return to their occupational units and to their occupation within their occupational units and shall be placed in their regular department within three (3) work days after their seniority entitles them to return. No new employees will be hired as long as seniority employees are laid off.

Income Plan dated July 16, 1974, and effective September I, 1974. such replacement will be made in accordance with the seniority provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Therefore, it is understood that when replacements are required under the above-described circumstances, “floaters” or “employees on the move” will not be utilized for such purpose as has been the agreed-to practice in the past.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Laid off probationary employees will be evaluated on the basis of their work performance. Those having poor performance records will not be recalled. Those having good records will be recalled as needs indicate.
Laid off probationary employees who will not be recalled will be notified by the Company within thirty (30) days after Layoff that they will not be recalled.
29
Additional notice will be given the Chairman of the Negotiating Committee.
When a probationary employee is scheduled for layoff, having been affected by a reduction of the work force, and this reduction is the only reason for the layoff, the youngest probationary employee working in the plant will be laid off first, using the most recent hire date as the basis for the decision.
In an increase in the work force, laid-off probationary employees would be returned to work in reverse order.
It is not the intent of this language to change the current method of handling probationary employees in effecting change of assignments, layoffs or termination which result from performance evaluations.
Temporary layoffs of less than 5 days will not break consecutive service. In those cases when temporary layoffs are expected to exceed 5 days, the probationary employee should be sent to the employment office for reassignment.
Seniority employees in ail occupations will be allowed to bid for openings on other groups within their occupations by seniority. Openings are defined as 1) retirement of employees; 2) increase; 3) new equipment that increases manpower; 4) employee promotes out, and 5) termination. Prior notification is needed. Wherever possible, such openings will be posted in the department.
SECTION 5	- TEMPORARY LAYOFFS
{.) PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES. When due to a shortage of material or breakdown of equipment or imbalance of production between directly related assembly groups it becomes necessary to operate a group temporarily at a reduced schedule or to shut down the entire group, necessitating a temporary layoff, the supervisor will first lay off the probationary employees in the group.
30
Second, if this does not complete the reduction in the group the supervisor shall determine how many employees in the occupation affected must be removed from the group temporarily. He shall retain on the group the employees having the greatest seniority in the occupation affected. He may then lay off or transfer temporarily to open jobs or to groups that are not manned to full production capacity on their current shift employees in the occupation affected, such transfers first being offered to the employees having the most seniority in the occupation affected not retained on the group. If there is a recurrence of this situation affecting the same group the supervisor will again lay off probationary employees.
If this does not reduce the group sufficiently the supervisor shall first determine how many employees in the occupation affected must be removed from the group temporarily. Second, he shall determine how many employees in the occupation affected may be transferred to open jobs or to groups that are not manned to full production capacity on their current shift. Third, if there are not enough open jobs, the first employees to be laid off shall be those who have the least time lost under this Section (the junior employee first in the event such lost time is equal). Fourth, the employee transferred shall be the junior employees remaining at work. However, if, under the provisions of Article Five, Section 5(d), they decline the transfer, it may be offered to those scheduled to be laid off.
(b)	NONl’ROlXJCllON EMPLOYEES
Nonproduction employees affected by production temporary layoffs as described in the foregoing two paragraphs will be temporarily laid off or transferred as follows:
31
The supervisor will first lay off the probationary employees in the department. Second, if this does not complete the reduction of the employees the supervisor shall determine how many employees in the occupation affected in the department must be removed temporarily. He may then (ay off or transfer temporarily to open jobs or to jobs that are not manned to full capacity on their current shift employees affected in that occupation in the department, such transfer first being offered to the employees having the most seniority in the occupation affected not retained in the department. If there is a recurrence of this situation affecting nonproduction employees the supervisor will again lay off probationary employees in the department. If this does not reduce the department sufficiently the supervisor shall first determine how many employees in the occupation affected must be removed from the department temporarily. Second, he shall determine how many employees in tht occupation affected may be transferred to open jobs or to jobs that are not manned to full capacity on their current shift. Third, if there are not enough open jobs the first employees to be laid off shall be those who have the least lost lime under this Section in the occupation in the department (the junior employee in the event such lost time is equal). Fourth, the employees transferred shall be the junior employees remaining at work. However, if they decline the transfer it may be offered to those scheduled to be laid off.
(c)	INTENT. The intent of this section is to keep in balance among seniority employees the time lost by temporary layoff. Therefore, in a temporary layoff situation, if there are not enough open jobs, the first employees to be laid off are those who have the least lost time under this Section (the junior employee first in the event such lost time is equal). In turn, when employees are
32
placed on open jobs, the employees having the most seniority in the occupations affected will remain on the group or in the case of nonproduction in their occupation regardless of the lost lime hours of such employees.
(d)	MISCELLANEOUS. No seniority employee shall be laid off more than forty (40) hours during a calendar year under this Section. Hours for which an employee receives a Short Week Benefit in accordance with the SUB Plan shall not be counted as laid-off hours under this Section. Employees transferred under this section shall not be regarded as having been “laid off* nor shall employees who decline to be transferred under this Section be regarded as “laid-off*.
An employee, affected by a temporary layoff, who has exceeded the 40 hour limitation under Article 5, Section 5D will be placed on any available job. The criteria for “open jobs” as covered in 5 (D) does not apply in such cases. In such cases, an employee may refuse the assignment, but would not be eligible for SUB.
Further, in the application of (a) and (b) the following procedures apply:
I.	If the assignment is in the occupation (in or out of department)
a.	Assignment is mandatory
b.	Employee is paid what he earns on that job
c.	The hours are not charged to the group (if a production group)
2.	If the assignment is in occupational unit, but out of occupation (in or out of department)
33
a.	Employee may refuse assignment
b.	Employee does not receive SUB
c.	If employee accepts, he is paid what he earns on job
d.	The hours are not charged to the group (if a production group).
3.	If the assignment is out of occupational unit (in or out of department) a. Employee may refuse
b.	Employee will receive SUB
c.	If employee accepts assignment, he will be paid what he earns on job
d.	The hours will not be charged to group (if a production group).
This provision shall not be interpreted to cover layoffs made under reduction in production schedules or if employee is being displaced by a senior employee in a group where the above-stated condition does not exist.
An open job under these provisions is to be based on the following criteria;
1.	A job not filled due to absenteeism
2.	A job that would have been filled at the beginning of the shift had personnel been available
3.	A line not manned to capacity as per schedule at start of the work week
4.	A job that is required due to an emergency of a critical nature
5.	Company training is al so to be considered an open job for these purposes.
The following additional provision apply:
I.	No specific reduction in nonproduction departments is to take place due to application of Article 5, Section 5.
34
2.	MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING REARRANGEMENT OF EQUIPMENTARTICLE 5, SECTION 6 - TEMPORARY LAYOFFS.
(e) PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES. When due to a shortage of material or breakdown of equipment, or imbalance of production between directly related assembly groups, or the rearrangement of equipment for the purpose of replacing certain machines requiring repair, overhaul, or to be phased out as obsolete equipment with new or similar and/or like equipment it becomes necessary to operate a group temporarily at a reduced schedule or to shut down the entire group, necessitating a temporary layoff, the supervisor will.....’’(See Section 5 (a) for complete lan-
guage)
It is understood that the agreed-to amendment to the provisions of Article 5, Section 5 (Temporary Layoffs), of the Labor agreement as stated above is subject to the following terms and conditions;
1.	A temporary layoff due to the rearrangement of the equipment as defined by the amendment of the provisions of Article 5, Section 5, of the Labor Agreement shall be limited to one (1) work day (i.e. three (3) work shifts),
2.	If due to the work involved in rearranging the equipment or as the result of unexpected problems encountered with the completion of such work, the one (1) day of three (3) work shift limitation referred to in Item #1 above may be extended by mutual agreement between the parties (i.e, department supervisor for the Company and the two (2) committeemen of the zone involved for the
35
Union) to include up to a maximum of three (3) work days or a total of nine (9) work shifts to provide for the completion of the work required.
It is further understood that the purpose of this Agreement is to utilize the temporary layoff provisions of Article 5, Section 5, of the Labor Agreement for those situations involving the rearrangement of equipment required for the implementation of a maintenance and/or equipment replacement program instead of the reduction of the working force provisions of Article 5, Section 3, of the Labor Agreement in an effort to avoid the excessive movement of employees under the seniority provisions of (he Labor Agreement for situations of short duration.
3.	If members are required to stay on Une due to rearrangement of equipment, pay is at hourly rate.
4,	Normal temporary layoff may extend three (3) days. This time may be extended beyond that by agreement with zone committeemen.
5.	If initial placement in temporary layoff on a given day is within unit, employee must return if required. If outside unit, may refuse and stay where assigned.
F. MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING TEMPORARY LAYOFF CONDITIONS -STEWARDS.

36
employee, (it will be steward’s option to work or go home) the procedures outlined below will be followed:
1.	If the seniority employee affected by the temporary layoff is placed on another job or other work, the steward will displace the seniority employee having the least seniority in the steward’s occupation, occupational unit, etc., in accordance with the principles of seniority,
2.	If the seniority employee affected by the temporary layoff is not placed on another job or other work, the steward will displace the seniority employee having the least lost time in the steward’s occupation, occupational unit, etc,, in accordance with the principles of seniority.
SECTION 6 CHANGE OR PROMOTION TO OTHER OCCUPATIONS
(a)	PROCEDURE. Any seniority employee who desires to be changed from his current occupation to another occupation shall prepare an application in duplicate for transfer on a form furnished by the Company, stating the occupation to which he desires to be transferred, giving the reason for the request and any other pertinent information. He shall give them to his supervisor for signature and then retain a copy. The supervisor shall file the original application with the Employment Office. The employee’s capabilities will be appraised by the Employment Department, and the employee’s name will be placed on a promotion list under the requested occupation to which he is found promotable, showing the date on which the application is submitted. Definition of not capable: (1) More than:
37
5% total absenteeism in (1) year work time or, (2) One (1) suspension in last six (6) months work time: (3) Points#1 and #2 are in addition to past practice. The list will be maintained in the Employment Office available for inspection by Union representatives. Total absenteeism excludes those contractually permissible absences (i.e.. holidays, FMLA, vacation, bereavement, jury duty, military and leaves of absence granted under Article Six).
If the applicant’s name is not placed on the promotion list for the occupation which he has requested promotion, the Employment Department will contact the employee to review the employee’s capabilities and reasons why the applicant’s name should not be placed on the list.
Promotions to an occupation will be made when new job openings or permanent vacancies occur in that occupation which are created by death, permanent disability, promotion to another occupation, retirement, termination of seniority, or any other reason. Employees whose names appear on the promotion list under the occupation in which the vacancies exist will be promoted.
AU openings will be posted and the promotees will be decided per seniority from the names on file plus new names listed from the posting. If the names of two (2) or more employees are listed for promotion to an occupation, then the employee having the greatest seniority will be selected for the placement and the names of employees not placed at that time will remain on the promotion list.
It is understood that no employee will be eligible to promote until he has seniority, unless no sen-
38
k
iority employees have applications on file, then probationers shall be considered based on working time all other factors being equal.
Promotees will gain the occupation after serving ninety (90) days.
It is further understood that all promotion applications on file will be destroyed each year effective January 1. No later than the prior December I, the company will notify employees by bulletin board notice that this will take place and advise all who are still interested in promotion to resubmit an application for promotion.
(b)	FAILURE TO QUALIFY. Employees promoted to another occupation who fail to qualify in the new occupation at any time during the period required to gain that occupation due to inefficient or unsatisfactory performance based on documented evidence with regard to productive results (quantity and quality) of their work effort on the basis of evaluation after ten (10), thirty (30), and sixty (60) work days or at any time within that period and just prior to the completion of the time required to gain the occupation or by their own admission or by written agreement between the supervisor, the Employment office, and the steward or zone committeemen, will be returned without loss of seniority to the occupation from which the transfer was made. Employees would return to his occupation to an open job or replace the youngest person working in the occupation plants-wide, seniority permitting.
Employees whose names are on the promotion list and who are offered a promotion to the occupation for which they have applied and who
39
refuse such offer will have their names removed from the promotion list, and such employees may not apply for promotion within three (3) months after the date of refusal to accept the assignment.
Employees whose names are on the promotion list and who are offered a promotion to the occupation for which they have applied and who accept such offer and fail to make an honest effort to qualify will have their names removed from the promotion list, and such employees may not apply for any promotion within six (6) months after the date of returning to their original occupation by reason of failure to make an honest effort to qualify.
Employees whose names are not placed on the promotion list at their request for promotion may apply for promotion to another occupation at once, or they may reapply for promotion to the same occupation three (3) months or more after being notified by the Employment Department that their names have not been placed on the promotion list.
The Company will provide a form whereby an employee is required to note acceptance, rejection, or giving up of a promotion. If the employee having the greatest seniority is absent from the plant on the day the promotion is to be assigned, the Union will be notified and the Company will hold the promotion open for 48 hours before offering the job to the next most senior employee. Should an employee be interested in a promotion which they feel is likely to happen during a scheduled absence from the facility they may make their intentions clear to the Employment Office prior to their absence. The Company may temporarily fill the job.
The appropriate Union representatives will be
40
notified prior to any intended action as set forth under this Section.
c) DISPUTES. Any disputes arising hereunder shall be subject to the Grievance Procedure, and shall be submitted to the Company tn Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure. It has been agreed between the Company and the Union that an employee who is reduced from an occupation to which he has promoted, as the result of a reduction in force, may promote to still another occupation. Should the first promotion open up while the employee is on the second promotion, the employee must at that time decide which promotion to continue. There are no penalties involved in this sequence. However, should an employee voluntarily give up a promotion or fail to qualify, he will be subject to the penalties designated in Article 5, Section 6. It is agreed between the parties, that in the application of Article 5, Section 6 of the Company-Un ion Contract (change or promotion to other occupations), paragraph (a), promotion will be accepted to an occupation when new job openings or permanent vacancies occur in that occupation, even though employees with that occupation may be on layoff.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
In the application of the promotion provisions of Article Five, Section 6, of the Labor Agreement, it is agreed that in those situations in which an open job, for which a requisition has been submitted, has been filled on a daily basis for five (5) days, the employee eligible for promotion to such job will either be promoted at that point in time (i.e. beginning with the sixth work day) or promoted as soon as he becomes available and in
41
such cases will be credited for time toward the promotion after the fifth (5th) day.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
In the application of Article Five, Section 6, promotions to vacancies made available due to sickness or injury in occupations with forty (40) or less employees will not be permitted without mutual agreement between the parties.
SECTION 7	- TRANSFER OF EMPLOYEES NOT SUITED TO OCCUPATION
When it is determined that an employee, due to inefficient or unsatisfactory performance based on documented evidence with regard to productive results (quantity and quality) of their work effort on the basis of evaluations after ten (10), thirty (30) and sixty (60) work days, or at any time, based on documented evidence with regard to production results (quantity and quality), etc., or when it is agreed between the supervisor, the Employment Department and Union committeemen of the zone involved that the employee is not suited for a job assignment on which he is working, he shall be transferred by die Company to another job assignment within the occupation in question if possible for which he is better qualified, provided the employee has seniority. If such employee is working on a job assignment in an occupation other than his occupational unit and it is found that he is not suited for that job assignment, then when his seniority permits he will be returned to either his occupational unit or occupation.
It is understood that once an employee is considered as not suited for a given job assignment, occupation, occupational unit or job classification, the employee's status with regard to that job assignment, occupation, occupational unit or job classification may not be hanged unless it can be shown that the cause of the
42
transfer no longer exists (i.e., technology change, process change, methods change, etc.). The employee will be given the opportunity to re-qualify upon request.
The appropriate Union representatives will be notified prior to any intended action as set forth under this Section. In no instance will an employee be reassigned due to a lack of work effort.
(See Article 5, Section 10; ten training periods)
SECTION 8	- TEMPORARY TRANSFERS
In the event it becomes necessary to transfer an employee from group to group and department to department in his occupation or from one occupation to another for the convenience of management, the employee with the least seniority on a given production group or in a given department will be transferred if capable of performing the work.
If the employee with the least seniority on a given production group or in a given department is not capable of performing the work, then the employee having the least seniority on the current shift on a given production group or in a given department capable of performing the work will be transferred. The above procedure will also be utilized in transferring a non-product ion employee or a skilled trades employee within his occupation from one non-production department to another for the convenience of management.
Any transfers made under this section are to be approved by a manager of manufacturing, and all employees so transferred shall be relumed to their regular job within their occupation.
The stewards of the zones in which the temporary transfer is made will be notified of such move and will be given a copy of the temporary transfer form by the end of their current shift.
In the event the transfer exceeds fifteen (15) days, the
43
employee will be returned to his regular job upon his request.
A temporary transfer on an overtime day will not exceed a total of one (1) hour of actual work. It is understood, however, that the one (1) hour of actual work, limitation applicable with regard to temporary transfers as described above on an overtime day, does not apply to those situations where an employee, who works in more than one (1) occupation as a matter of routine during the regular work week, is scheduled and works overtime on the same basis.
It is understood that situations involving temporary transfers during an overtime period shall not exceed one (1) hour of actual work time excluding any and all incidental time, such as travel time to and from the area of assignment. The basic criteria for determining the amount of work to be performed should be based on a determination of how much actual work would be performed if another employee was called in to perform the work under Article Nine, Section 9. If the duration of the work assignment for an employee called in would amount to one (1) hour or Jess of actual work then utilization of the temporary transfer procedure would be proper. On any overtime work assignment involving a temporaty transfer, any work performed by a bargaining unit employee at the request of another bargaining unit employee will not create a liability.
Any employee transferred under this section shall be paid the rate of the occupation he leaves or the rate of the production group or non-production occupation to which he is transferred, whichever is higher. It is agreed, however, that the temporary transfer will not exceed three (3) days without joint approval between the Company and the Negotiating Committee in those instances where a non-production employee is temporarily transferred to production or a production
44
employee is temporarily transferred to non-production.
It is agreed between the parties that the temporary transfer will not be used as a method of filling permanent openings overa period of time, but is limited to those instances that are temporary in nature, i.e., absences, emergencies, or special circumstances.
Failure to make every reasonable attempt to notify the stewards will result in automatic liability for all hours worked by the person transferred, paid to lowest person on the overtime list in the occupation and department to which the transfer was made.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING There have been several incidents where the Company has known in advance that certain individuals would be coming to the facility for a plant tour. Under those situations, the Company has used, many times, the temporary transfer language toclean up the facility and has failed to work overtime in the labor classification. The intent of this memo is to ensure you that when the Company knows of these tours in advance, the general labor should be scheduled to work the appropriate overtime first, then if the Company needs additional cleaning, the temporary language can be used,
SECTION 9	- PROMOTION TO UNAPPREN-TICEABLE SKILLED TRADES
(a)	Promotions to any of the unapprenticeable skilled trades will be made on qualifications based on prior work experience and training in that trade. When qualifications are relatively equal, promotions will be based on seniority. When any employee is promoted from any occupation to the unapprenticeable skilled occupations, including experimental test technicians (and toolmaker (experimental), he shall acquire
45
and exercise seniority after working in the unap-prenticeable skilled occupation for a period of six (6) months, and his seniority shall start from the date he was originally transferred into the unap-prenticeable skilled occupation. Whenever qualified applicants are not available and timing is not an issue, every effort will be made to train the most senior applicant.
(b)	Employees promoted to any unapprenticeable skilled classification shall be paid the minimum rate for the classification at the time of transfer to the new occupation.
(c)	In the event it becomes necessary to reduce the seniority employees in skilled occupations, the employees affected will be given the opportunity to work in the production or non-production occupations provided no seniority employees are laid off in the production or non-production occupations. These employees shall be permitted to gain and accumulate seniority in the production or non-production occupations during the time period such employees remain on layoff from their respective skilled trades. Upon recall to their respective skilled trades occupations the employee must make a decision with regard to which seniority he wished to retain.
(d)	Promotions will not be honored into the apprenticeable skilled occupations except through the apprenticeship program.
(e)	Whenever the skilled occupations are required to increase their forces because of changeover, plant rearrangement, or necessary work of a temporary nature and of short duration in connection with new or improved products, the Company may transfer employees from other occupations into the skilled occupations. These employees are to be called “changeover employees” during the period in which they work in the skilled occupation, but shall retain and accumulate seniority in their original occupation.
(f)	The Company agrees that when changeover
46
employees are needed, any skilled trades employee laid off will be given the first opportunity for the opening in that trade. Changeover employees from the regular bargaining unit will be selected on the basis of qualifications.
A changeover employee may only be bumped by other changeovers working in the same occupation.
If a skilled trades employee is laid off after a bargaining unit employee is working as a changeover, the skilled trades employee will be given the opportunity to replace the bargaining unit employee.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING CHANGEOVER EMPLOYEES— UNAPPRENTICE ABLE /APPRENTICEABLE SKILLED TRADES OCCUPATIONS.
No changeover employees will be assigned to the unapprenticeable/apprenticeable skilled trades occupations until the employees having the occupations are offered six (6) days’ work during normal work week.
The Company agrees that the Union will have input as regards to qualifications based on prior work experience and training. This input will be received prior to an employee receiving seniority.
SECTION 10 - SHIFT PREFERENCE
1.	APPLICATION FOR SHIFT PREFERENCE
(a)	Any seniority employee who desires to exercise his shift preference will fill in three (3) copies of the form available in the office of his supervisor, giving his name, clock card number, seniority date, and the shift he prefers. One copy will be given to the employee, the second copy will be sent to the employment office for permanent record and the third copy kept in the department for
47
arrangement and record of the shift preference. When the arrangements are completed, the Employment Department,will notify the employee’s supervisor who will then advise him when the shift change will take place. If such request is received on or before Wednesday, the transfer to make the shift change effective will be made on the weekend following.
(b)	A written request for shift preference may be withdrawn by the employee at any time up to the close of his regular work shift on Wednesday.
(c)	If a reduction or an increase in the working force as it affects certain departments interferes with making shift preferences effective on a particular weekend, those shift preference requests will be automatically canceled, but the requests not affected by the change in the working force will be made effective. Employees whose shift preference request is canceled as described above, may make a new request for change in shift preference if they so desire.
(d)	Seniority employees shall not be entitled to exercise shift preference more than once every ninety (90) days under the terms of this provision.
(e)	If due to a reduction in working force, or for any reason, an employee is deprived of his shift preference, the employee may again exercise shift preference regardless of the number of days that have elapsed since the employee expressed his previous preference of which he has been deprived.
(f)	If an employee, who would be affected by the exercise of shift preference by an older employee in the department, is being moved
48
h
out of the department in a reduction or an increase, then the next youngest employee in that occupation in the department will be displaced by the employee initiating the shift preference.
2.	EXERCISE OF SHIFT PREFERENCE.
(a)	Any production employee having seniority shall be entitled to preference of shifts over any employee with lesser seniority or probationary employees within his occupation and within his occupational unit. His preference shall be exercised in the following manner.
First, he shall have preference of shifts within this production group, or failing to obtain his preference there;
Second, he shall have preference of shifts within his production department, or failing to obtain his preference there;
Third, he shall have preference over employees of lesser seniority and may displace the employee having the least seniority working within his occupation plant wide and within his occupational unit (See subsection 1(d) of this Article and Section).
(b)	Any non-production employee having seniority shall be entitled to preference of shifts over any employee with lesser seniority or probationary employees within his occupation. His preference shall be exercised in the following manner;
First, he shall have preference of shift within his department, or failing to obtain his preference there;
49
I
3.
Second, he shall then have preference of shifts within the plant,
(c)	Preference of shifts can be exercised by the employee working out of his occupational unh only over other employees working out of their occupational unit with lesser seniority and over probationary employees working within the same occupation. For purposes of shift preference employees on an upgrade shall be considered as employees working out of their occupational unit. (See subsection 1 (d) of this Article and Section.)
(d)	Probationary skilled trades employees are not subject to being bumped during their first thirty (30) work days,
A changeover employee may only be bumped by other changeovers working in the same occupation.
TRANSFERS WITHIN THE OCCUPATIONAL UNIT.
In a reduction in force employees transferred out of their occupation into their occupational unit shall have shift preference in the same manner as employees working within their occupation.
WORKOUTSIDE REGULAR DEPARTMENT.
An employee exercising his shift preference working out of his regular department due to a reduction in force shall not void his right to return to his regular department in an increase in force, unless he has signed a form agreed to by the Company and the Union in which he voids his regular department.
50
5.	RIGHT TO REMAIN IN DEPARTMENT OR GROUP.
After a shift preference is initiated by an employee the transfers or moves to make this preference effective shall be made in such a manner that each employee affected will have had the right to remain in his department or his group so far as his seniority permits. If, in order to retain his regular departmentor group, it is necessary for the affected employee to exercise a shift preference, he shall be charged with such shift preference as set out in this Section. A move to replace any employee who exercises a shift preference shall not be considered as an exercise or shift preference by such transferred employee nor shall the affected employee be charged with a preference.
6.	TIME WHEN SHIFT PREFERENCE MOVES MADE.
All moves described above shall be made on the weekend immediately following the Wednesday when the initial shift preference is instigated. The current practice of deferring moves shall be followed when one or more holidays occur at the end of the week in which the shift preference is instigated.
7.	SHIFT PREFERENCE CAN BE EXERCISED ONLY WITHIN OCCUPATION.
Shift preference in every case shall be exercised within the employee’s occupation or within the occupation in which the employee is working while out of his occupation or occupational unit.
8.	EXAMPLES:
(a)	When the shift preference can be made effective within the group by a simple
51
exchange, the employee displaced replaces the employee initiating the shift preference, and only the employee initiating die prefer* ence is charged with having changed his shift preference. If in this instance, the employee displaced desires to change his shift, remaining on the group or in the department, he will be charged with having changed his shift preference. The employee who is displaced by him will be placed on the job left vacant by the employee initiating the shift preference and will not be charged with a shift preference. The employee initiating the shift preference will be placed on the job of the employee being displaced, and the employee being placed will be placed on the job left vacant by the initiating employee. The displaced employee will not be charged with a shift preference.
(b)	If a displaced employee is required to leave the department in order to be maintained on the shift of his preference, the Employment Department will assign him to the department in which tire employee having the least seniority on that shift is working. The employee so displaced will take the job left vacant in the other department by the employee who originated the shift preference. Neither of these displaced employees will be charged with having changed his shift preference.
(c)	If the employee having the least seniority in the occupation in the department on the shift who is to be displaced prefers to remain in that department rather than take the place of the employee initiating the shift preference,
52
he may exercise shift preference to the extent his seniority permits within the department. In any case, the employee who is displaced in that department will lake the place of the employee initiating the shift preference.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
In the application of Article Five, Section 10, an employee placed under Article Five Section 7, would have the same rights in exercising shift preference that he would have if he had been placed under the application of seniority provisions.
9.	TEMPORARY SHIFT CHANGE
(a)	Temporary change of shifts may be permitted when necessary without necessitating a shift preference change. It is understood that no employee will be moved from his designated shift preference under this subsection without his agreement and that such a temporary shift change will be limited to a period not to exceed ten (10) work days, providing there is agreement between the supervisor and the steward. It is understood, however, that such determination will be made based on the facts of the case.
(b)	Temporary shift changes as described above in subsection 9 (a) may be extended beyond the ten (10) work day limitation without necessitating a shift preference change with agreement between the supervisor, steward, and the committeemen of the zone involved.
(c)	Temporary shift changes as described above in subsection 9 (a) may also be permitted without necessitating a shift preference
S3
I
change at the request of the employee requiring such a temporary change due to emergency situations, personal problems, etc. providing the supervisor and the steward agree to such a change.
10.	SHIFT PREFERENCE—TRAINING PERIODS

11.	SHIFT PREFERENCE—FILE MAINTENANCE
The Company shall maintain a file of the shift preference of each employee. To the extent possible the file shall be kept current and shall be available for examination by Local 287 Union representatives during normal office hours. The file which denotes the shift preference of each employee was established immediately after the execution of the effective bargaining agreement dated March 8, 1971. This file has been updated continually thereafter by the Company as changes in shift preference have been submitted.
Refer to Article 5, Section 3, paragraph 3 concerning shift preference during a reduction.
SECTION 11	- TRANSFERS THROUGH EMPLOYMENT OFFICE

55
I
Chairman or President of the Bargaining Committee. The union official will then contact the employee who voluntarily quit within 24 hours of when the Union was notified of the quit. The purpose of this memo is to ensure the Union that when an employee quits and wishes to change his mind within the 24 hour period, the Company will be required to review the voluntary quit and determine whether or not it should be accepted or rescinded).

It is agreed that the Company has the full right to use the owner operator concept as a basis for bidding on new work and of implementing the concept if successful in obtaining the new work.
SECTION 2	• PRODUCTION GROUPS
(A)	A production group will consist of a logical grouping of machines and operations associated with the production of specific parts, families of pans or operations. It is not the intention of the Company to combine segments of more than one department into a single group. The Company agrees to consider recommendations by the Union relative to group formation where it is indicated that such will lead to a more efficient operation. Seniority in the Owner Operator Occupations will be exercised by group, department, then occupation.
(B)	It is agreed between the Company and the Union that when production lines are moved
72
from one group to another group or one department to another department, employees working in their occupation who normally work on jobs which are moved to another group or department shall have the right to take the other group or department as their home group or department. The Company will be willing to consider situations that may arise other than production lines. Such employees will be moved to the new group or department and shall have five (5) work days to decide whether to stay or to return. Those employees who choose to stay will automatically have the new group or department and new occupation, if applicable, as their regular group or department and occupation. Whether employees, having chosen a new group or department, may remain in that department, will be determined by the seniority provisions of the contract. It is intended that the above procedure be consistent with past practice, allowing employees affected by the moves to exercise options available to them but at the same time not jeopardizing the rights of other seniority employees.
(C)	During the 1980 negotiations the Company and Union agreed to the extension of the group seniority concept as currently practiced to those areas of the plant which have not practiced such concept. This also includes areas where the owner operator occupation exists.
(D)	The Company and the Union agree to commit to a policy that prohibits the reassignment of employees within a group solely on a supervisor’s desires to infor
73
mally discipline or to retaliate for nonwork related issues. However, it is clear to the Union that the Company must rely on its supervisor’s to manage the efficiency of the group through the proper assignment of manpower in a productive manner.
(E)	It is agreed between the Company and the Union, that employees working in their occupation within a group on the affected shift will be offered by seniority for openings within the group prior to the posting of the opening. There will be no domino effect allowed within the group. That is, the first opening, which is defined as: 1) retirement of an employee; 2) increase; 3) new equipment that increases manpower; 4) employee promotes out; 5) termination; will be the only opening filled in this manner. In those instances when the Company believes the outcome of the above procedure would have an adverse effect on the efficient operation of the group,.the parties will meet to discuss the issues in a good faith effort to resolve such issues to provide the efficient operation of the group.
The above paragraph will also pertain to the Non-Production Occupations.
Letter of Understanding
During the 2000-2001 negotiations the Union made it clear that it did not agree that the Company could unilaterally combine groups. They point out Article One Recognition grants them the rights to bargain collectively
74
on rates of pay, wages, and other conditions of employment. In addition, they point out a history of negotiating and discussions over group creation and modification.
The Company without abridging its rights clearly outlined in Article Eight “A” and Article Thirteen agree during the life of the 2000-2001 agreement not to reduce groups without discussions with the Union, and the Company will not reduce any department by more than one group without mutual agreement.
In addition, in areas where new work is established the parties will set-up the groups and group seniority concept as practiced in the current Owner Operator occupations.
It should be understood that it is not intended by the Company that any statement contained within this Letter of Understanding limits, restricts, or infringes on any of the rights normally exercised by the Company through the years with regard to the combination and/or splitting of production groups for reasons of efficiency as a prerogative of management.
SECTION 3	- SPECIAL WORK
1.	Operators selected by the Company to do preliminary production work, or to work on samples, or experimental products, or try out new machines, or do special setup work will receive their current rate or the rate of the special assignment whichever is higher.

75

4.	An operator so selected may remain on the job rather than be returned to his original job by mutual agreement in writing signed by the employee, the steward, and the supervisor. Employees who do not choose the new group or department may, if needed, be assigned temporarily to the new group or department until the group or department is operating efficiently and then will be returned to their original group or department. Whether employees, having chosen a new group or department, may remain in that department, will be determined by the seniority provisions of the contract.
SECTION 4	- ALLOWANCES

If an employee’s birthday falls on another contractual holiday, the employee may take his/her birthday on another work day during the two-week period of his birthday.
SECTION 4	- EQUALIZATION OF OVERTIME Overtime shall be equalized among seniority employees working within an occupation on the following basis:
83
(a) Production employees, by occupation within the department. If the skills required are not supplied by the normal procedure used in each department, then fifty (50) percent of the employees scheduled may be regular members of the group, regardless of their position on the overtime list. Steward of the zone must be notified before using the 50% rule. The overtime record of an employee offered work as a result of the provisions of Article Nine, Section 4 (a) will be so marked as to serve as an aid in avoiding continued offers of such overtime work to the same employees.
Letter of Understanding
In the 2000/2001 negotiations the parties discussed and agreed that there are four distinct steps required when applying the 50% rule. They are:
a.	The overtime list will be run according to the uniform procedure;
b.	The Steward of the zone must be notified before using the 50% rule;
c.	If the requisite skills are not supplied by this list; the supervisor may replace up to 50% of those scheduled with regular members of the group regardless of their position on the list;
d.	Overtime record of an employee offered work would be marked immediately.
If all four steps are not adhered to, a liability could be created to those bypassed
(b> Nonproduction employees, by occupation within the department except in the case of the EEOU which shall be by occupation within the unit,
(c) Skilled Trades Overtime - The skilled trades
84
procedure agreed to by the Skilled Trades Stewards and Management currently in use will continue per established practice.
No probationary employee will be permitted to work overtime in any of these occupations until all available seniority employees in the occupation have been given the opportunity to work such overtime in accordance with the sequence listed on page 107. Skilled Trades overtime offering to include probationary employees and shall be done according to a procedure agreed to by the Skilled Trades Stewards and Management.
The Company will keep a record of each employee’s overtime working in the occupation and will review each employee’s overtime record with the steward as often as may be required to insure proper equalization. If an employee who is asked to work overtime hours declines, his overtime equalization record will be charged with the number of hours for which he would have been paid rather than the hours he would have worked. A uniform procedure will be estab* lished between the stewards and the supervisors and will be followed in the equalization of overtime work opportunity.
Memorandum of Agreement
During the 2000/2001 negotiations the parties discussed the need to streamline the overtime offering procedures. An experimental procedure was agreed to in principle which would include bargaining unit employees whose duties would include working at the request of the Company to administer the overtime equalization procedures (Article Nine-Section 4) and assist in manpower moves (Article Five-Section 10). Either party could withdraw from this agreement with 60 days
85
notice and the work performed would revert back to management employees. Special qualifications would be required by those filling these positions and if their work was not accurate or otherwise unsatisfactory they could be removed and placed back in their previous department, occupation, and group based on seniority.
Master overtime records will be marked immediately to avoid error and/or confusion.
New employees on acquiring seniority will be credited on their overtime record at the time of acquiring seniority with the maximum hours of overtime worked in the occupation at that time, and from that point on they will share overtime in the occupation with others working in that occupation. This maximum is to be computed for the week such employees are eligible to share overtime in that occupation.
Seniority employees transferred to an occupation or cleared of disabilities will be credited with the average overtime worked in the occupation in that department at the time of transfer or disability clearance and will share overtime within the occupation from that point forward.
It is understood that the provisions above do not apply to stewards and committeemen. It is agreed that stewards shall be offered work on their current shift during any periods of work beyond a scheduled forty (40) hours in their respective zones excluding regularly required trick maintenance.
Committeemen will be offered overtime work for the purpose of providing Union representation on the basis of one committeemen for each fifty (50) bargaining unit employees scheduled for and accepting overtime assignments on their current shift, excluding regularly required trick maintenance and unscheduled or emergency overtime assignments, with such overtime being equalized among the committee members
86
in a manner acceptable to the committee as submitted by the committee in writing to the Manager. Human Resource,
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
COMMITTEEMEN OVERTIME - ARTICLE NINE, SECTION 4 It is understood that the number of committeemen, exclusive of the EEOU committeeman, eligible to work overtime on their current shift under the terms of Article Nine, Section 4, Equalization of Overtime, of the Collective Bargaining Agreement effective March 7, 1977, shall be as follows:
Number of Bargaining	Number of
UnitEmployees Working	Committeemen Eligible
Overtime on 7:30 a.m.	to Work Overtine on
Work Shift	730 a.m. Work Shift
1*50	1
51-100	2
101-150	3
151-200	4
201-250	5
251-300	6
301-350	7
351-400	8
The EEOU committeeman will be offered overtime and be eligible to work overtime as in the past. Time off the job for stewards during periods of overtime will be limited to that required to investigate and adjust grievances arising during the overtime period in question.
Committeemen and stewards will be credited with the average overtime worked in their occupation in their department at the time their term expires.
In the EEOU the overtime spread in each occupation shall not exceed twenty-eight (28) hours; however, this twenty-eight (28) hour limitation tnay be reasonably extended by agreement between the committee-
87
man and the supervisor and shall be extended in the case of out-of-town work assignments subject to the obligation of the Company to equalize overtime as provided herein upon completion of that assignment. Work performed on a holiday which falls on Monday through Friday will be considered as overtime work to be equalized. If the offer of overtime fails to provide enough employees in the skilled occupations, then the remaining assignments in those occupations will be made on that basis of seniority within the occupation and department as contemplated in Article Nine, Section Three. If more employees are required in occupations other than the skilled occupations, an effective alternative will be agreed upon between the parties.
It is agreed that overtime work in production occupations will be offered in the following manner
(a) Seniority employees within the occupation in the department - single shift
(b> Seniority employees within the. occupation outside the department - single shift (The requirement of item “b” has been met if the employee outside the department has been offered an opportunity to work a single in his assigned department).
(c)	Seniority employees within the occupation in the department - double shift
(d)	Probationary employees within the occupation in the department - single shift
(e)	Seniority employees within the occupation outside the department - double shift
Employees will be offered the overtime opportunity, singles and doubles, whether the employee accepts or refuses the offer.
Whenever all seniority employees in the non-production, skilled trades and EEOU occupations in the

8S
department affected have been offered overtime opportunity and still more employees are needed, the supervisor, coordinator and the steward will work together and the overtime opportunity will be offered to seniority employees with that occupation in other departments. If sufficient employees with the occupation cannot be obtained from other departments, employees in the occupation tn the department affected will be offered double shifts unless it is decided that such overtime is to be canceled.
Any employee who refuses an offer of overtime for Saturday does not have to be offered overtime for Sunday. (SEE LETTER BELOW)
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING During 3.5 step grievance meetings in AugusVSeptember 2000 the Company and the Union had exhaustive discussions regarding the Saturday/Sunday language contained in Article 9, Section 4, This language was changed in 1998 negotiations due to the Company’s concerns that employees were “premium-picking” Sunday (double time) overtime. The intent of the parties was to address this concern, however, in practice this language has created equalization inequities. The company continues to need protection against such “premium-picking” and the union needs to have protection against a future spread in overtime hours similar to that which exists today. In the spirit of the above, the parties agree to the following:
The Saturday/Sunday language will be suspended indefinitely. If the amount of double time worked in any department becomes excessive as a result of employee refusals/cancellations of Saturday then the Saturday/Sunday language will be reinstated for that department. The Company and the Union will review the department data each week and
89
Human Resources will determine if the language needs to be suspended or reinstated. The intent of this review is to determine if this data reveals that employee refusals/canceliations of Saturday have created an increase in Sunday overtime in a given department The data to be reviewed will include the number of employees needed for Saturday/Sunday, number of employees solicited, number of refusals/canceliations and actual number of employees who worked. This data will be compared with past history to ensure that it is valid. For example, if historically a department has needed 44 employees on Saturday, and they suddenly start asking for 140 employees on Saturday, this would be an invalid number barring recent changes in business conditions.
Both parties recognize the staffing of the 3:30 shift on Saturday has been difficult and that the acceptance rate of overtime on this shift will not be a factor in reinstating the Saturday/Sunday language.
The above mentioned weekly review wilt be a three-part evaluation:
1.	Is the double time being worked in the department excessive? If no, then the language remains suspended. If yes, then:
2.	Is the excessive number of hours due to employee refusals / cancellations of Saturdays? If no, then the language remains suspended. If yes, then the language is reinstated for that department.
3.	It is understood that following each weekly review Human Resources will determine whether the language is to be reinstated or continue to be suspended.
90
The intent of this language is to protect a shift in hours worked to the higher premium rate of pay, and to protect equalization of overtime.
The overtime record of an employee offered work both in the department and out of the department as a result of the provisions of Article Nine, Section 4a will be so marked as to serve as an aid in avoiding continued offers of such overtime work to the same employees.
“In “and “out” of department overtime will be offered to the employee with die lowest hours first regardless of shift.
Liabilities will occur on an hour for hour basis when the Company knowingly goes outside the agreed to uniform procedure on the offering of overtime outlined above.
Employees in the skilled occupations may be offered work up to two (2) hours beyond their regular overtime assignment If it is anticipated that the work would take more than two (2) additional hours, then such work is to be offered in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph. However, this two- (2) hour limitation may be reasonably extended by agreement between the steward or another recognized Union representative and the supervisor. (See Article Five, Section 9 re: scheduling of overtime in skilled trades occupations during time of change-over employment.)
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
In the application of Article Nine, Section 4, Equalization of Overtime, in the Company Union Agreement, if an employee is offered overtime work by telephone or messenger he must be contacted personally to make the offer effective. If the employee is not contacted personally at that time, it shall be considered that he was unavailable for that offer of overtime work.
91
The Union agrees in those instances where die Company is having problems on overtime days of getting desired productivity and quality in certain troubled areas, that during the normal work week, the groups in question are manned predominately by probationary employees; the Union in good faith bargaining will meet with the Company for the purpose of resolving the problems; which could mean probationary employees would be considered as being included under the coverage in group scheduling as set out in Article Nine, Section 4(a).
The intent of all contractual provisions contained within Article Nine Section 4 is to ensure proper equalization and to attain an acceptable overtime spread.
SECTION 5 - MAINTENANCE OF WORK WEEK
A.	PRODUCTION. In the event it becomes necessary to reduce production, the work week shall be maintained in the following manner:
(1)	In order to maintain forty (40) hours per week, all probationary employees will be laid off first.

(3)	(a) In the event the management determines that it is necessary to work any department, line or production group in excess of a
92
scheduled forty (40) hours per week to cover the production schedule, sufficient employees shall have been employed on each shift to man the line to full capacity. A line or group will also be considered as having been manned to full capacity when all available employees having the occupation or occupations involved have work assignments within their occupations.

The scheduling of overtime under this subsection may be allowed only for a shortage of material in the line, machine breakdown, tool trouble, absenteeism, time lost due to instruction, or power interruptions causing such loss of production,
(c) Whenever overtime is scheduled or permitted by the provisions of this subsection the steward and the committeemen of the zone involved will be notified as soon as possible but in any event prior to the commencement of such overtime work. If any overtime scheduled and worked under this subsection is excessive and thus in violation of the terms of this subsection, then the employee or employees who are reduced out of the occupation or occupations affected will be compensated for the actual hours such employee or employees lost as the result of the improper overtime work assign
93
ment and their overtime records will be marked accordingly.
When overtime is necessary because of production difficulties caused by model or method changes or reasons of an unusual nature, then the manager of manufacturing and the committeemen and the steward of the zone in question may discuss the matter for the purpose of determining if the overtime should be worked. If no agreement is reached, then the subject will be discussed between the negotiating committee and the manager of manufacturing and the Manager Human Resources in an effort to resolve the differences between the parties regarding the subject matter in question. It is understood that no overtime may be worked under subsection (3)© without the mutual agreement of the parties.
B.	NONPRODUCTION. In the event it becomes necessary to reduce non-production, the work week shall be maintained in the following manner.
(1)	In order to maintain forty (40) hours per week, all probationary employees will be laid off first.
(2)	If the above does not sufficiently reduce the working force to maintain forty (40) hours per week for all employees, then sufficient seniority employees will be laid off to maintain forty (40) hours per week except that maintenance and tool-room employees will not be laid off unless the reduction is tn their occupation.
(3)(a) In the event the management determines that it is necessary to work any non-produc
94
tion department or non-production occupation in excess of a scheduled forty (40) hours per week to cover the production schedule as specified under the provisions of subsection A of this section or for any other reason, sufficient employees shall have been employed on each shift to man the non-production job or non-production jobs in question on a three-(3) shift basis. A non-production job or non-production jobs will also be considered as having been manned to full capacity when all available employees having the occupation or occupations involved have work assignments within their occupations.
(b) Daily or weekly overtime may be scheduled when non-production jobs or non-production occupations are not manned to capacity as specified under the terms of Article Nine, Section 5B (1) or to (primarily) support production as provided by the terms of Article Nine, Section 5A (3) (a), (b) or (c) of this section in accordance with the following guidelines:
I.	To make up for a loss of work time resulting from absenteeism or instruction time.
2.	To primarily support production. Primarily support production means the provision of sufficient work to comprise a full work day.
3.	Overtime under this subsection must be scheduled daily or weekly and will not be continued beyond a two*(2) week period.
Whenever overtime is scheduled or permitted by the provisions of this subsection the steward and the committeemen of the zone involved will be notified as soon as possible but in any event prior to the commencement of such overtime work. If
95
any overtime scheduled and worked under this subsection is excessive and thus in violation of the terms of this subsection, then the employee or employees who are reduced out of the occupation or occupations affected will be compensated for the actual hours such employee or employees lost as the result of the improper overtime work assignment and their overtime records will be marked accordingly
(c) When overtime is necessary for non-production jobs or non-production occupations because of production difficulties caused by model or method changes or reasons of an unusual nature, then the manager of manufacturing and the committeemen and steward of the zone in question may discuss the matter for the purpose of determining if the overtime should be worked. If no agreement is reached, then the subject will be discussed between the negotiating committee and the manager of manufacturing and the Manager, Human Resources in an effort to resolve the differences between the parties regarding the subject matter in question. It is understood that no overtime may be worked without the mutual agreement of the parties.
LETTER OF INTENT
In the 1980 Contract Negotiations, the Company expressed fears that in those instances where emergency demands require overtime, the Union might use this situation to better the Union’s position on other problems. This letter is to assure the Company that the Union hasn’t any such intentions and that each request from the Company to work overtime due to the emergency customer demand will be appraised on its own merits, and no other Union-Company disagreement will be considered by the Union.

SECTION 6-TIME FOR TAKING VACATIONS
The vacation year shall be from April 1 to March 31 of the succeeding year. If an employee decides to take a vacation, arrangements shall be made between supervisor, steward and employee. This should be
104
done sufficiently in advance to enable proper arrangements for operation of group or department. Vacation time off should thus be scheduled and posted on a chart in the office of the supervisor so that both supervisors and employees may know the vacation dates that have been scheduled.
All bargaining unit employees will be allowed to take vacations upon request for one (1) hour increments, daily, or weekly up to the full accumulated vacation. Approval of supervisor must take place. Supervisors cannot give vacation to cover absenteeism or tardiness after the fact.
Vacation request form-MD10l5/5-84 should be filled out, with copies to the supervisor, the steward, and the employee, in order to avoid future misunderstandings.
During the recent negotiations the Company expressed concern with regard to those situations where an excessive number of employees of certain occupations or departments schedule their vacations for the same given time period. It is understood that this problem is normally confined to those weeks when vacations are scheduled in conjunction with holiday periods and to certain limited occupations, particularly those involving the skilled trades.
It is agreed between the parties that the provisions of Article Ten, Section 6, of the Labor Agreement as such apply to the scheduling of vacations sufficiently in advance to enable proper arrangements for the operation of the group or department will mean under normal conditions to be at least two (2) weeks' prior notice. The exception would be a documented emergency situation. It is understood that in those instances where such prior notice is not necessary for the proper operation of the group or department such notice will not be required.
It is further agreed that in those instances where the number of employees requesting vacation time for a given time period is excessive percentage-wise for
105
certain occupations or departments and therefore would have an adverse effect on the efficient operation of the plants, the parties will meet to discuss the issues involved in a good faith effort to resolve such issues to provide for the proper operation of the plant facilities.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ACCUMULATED VACATION. It is agreed between the Company and the Union that an employee who has three (3) years of seniority (this is not retroactive), may, if he so desires, elect to defer any vacation time for which he is eligible under the provisions of Article Ten, Section 1, of the Labor Agreement in a given year, up to a maximum of fifty-two and one-half (52V5) work days total to permit him to take an extended period of earned time off in line with what he has accumulated. The minimum amount of accrued vacation which must be taken at one time is five (5) days.
Effective 9/7/89, an employee will be permitted to accumulate vacation time over the period of his seniority. No accumulated vacation time will be reduced from the employees total eligible time unless used by the employee. In any given year, an employee could use up to a maximum of 52 l/2days of accumulated vacation plus his current vacation time for a total not to exceed 67 ’A days in a vacation year.
Employees eligible for accumulative vacation under the 1986 contract would still be eligible to use those days through the duration of this Agreement.
It is understood that the length of an employee’s extended vacation or earned time off the job will be based on an evaluation of such employee’s attendance card for the previous two (2) years.
106
Although no special action of notification is required by an employee who wishes to take an extended vacation or earned time off the job, it is also understood that in the application of this provision if the number of employees involved in such an extended vacation leave is such that adverse conditions on plant operations would result or if the number involved would result in the undue dilution of certain skills then the Company reserves the right to schedule such extended vacation leaves accordingly. It is further agreed that the right to accumulate vacation time is limited to time off the job and the vacation bonus stipulated by the provisions of Article Ten, Section 1, including the payment of such bonus in accordance with the provisions of Article Ten, Section 2, will continue to be made on an annual basis to qualified employees as specified by the Labor Agreement.

It is understood between the parties that no other provisions of Article Ten (Vacation Plan) are to
107
be changed in any manner as the result of this agreement.
It is further agreed between the parties that if as the result of this agreement, the number of employees requesting a vacation for any given week or weeks is excessive percentage-wise for certain occupations or departments and therefore would have an adverse effect on the efficient operation of the plants, the parties will discuss the issues involved in a good faith effort to resolve such issues to provide for the proper operations of the plant facilities,

SCHEDULE II
MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING
1,	OUTSOURCING OF NON-SKILLED WORK
The Company and Union agree to investigate all (except incidental or emergency) work consid' ered for outsourcing before a contract would be let, to consider the potential effect of any out' sourcing decision and to make every reasonable effort to keep the work in-house. Generally speaking, the parts that would be considered for potential outsourcing would be those parts that could be purchased from a vendor but which have been made at Borg-Warner Automotive, Diversified Transmission Products Corporation, Muncie Plant.
The Company agrees to notify the Union on the form and by the procedure currently in effect before any “non-skilled” work is out-sourced. Notification should take place as soon as feasible prior to anticipated outsourcing. There shall be a penalty of $1000 paid by the Company per incident when Company representatives fail to notify the Union when current work is to be contracted out. The liability shall be paid to those employees affected.
Any work that is out-sourced may be reviewed by the Bargaining Committee and the feasibility of bringing the work in-house discussed, based on the normal criteria on which outsourcing judgments are made,. The Company's decision to out-source non-skilled work will normally be based primarily on cost, quality and timing. In those instances where outsourcing occurs the Company and Union will work together to develop work practices, or if cost effective, recommend the purchase of equipment or machinery to enable such work to be done in-house.
130
In those cases of incidental or emergency work, which occur normally as a result of machine, tooling, or stock problems, etc, and which preclude notification prior to the outsourcing, notification will be made to the Union as soon as feasible on the next work day.
The failure of the Company to actively seek the involvement of the Union is a violation of the intent of this agreement. It should be reported immediately to the parties so that steps may be taken to ensure compliance with this memo.
2.	UTILITY CLASSIFICATION OCCUPATIONAL UNITS: Effective March 12, 1998, seniority in the utility classification in the owner operator occupation will be based on seniority without regard to areas of expertise (reference Article 5, Section 10).

open job in his occupation within the department.
SKILLED TRADES WORK CLASSIFICATION QUESTION:
It is the intent of the Company that there should be no conflict of interest between the skilled trades classification and the work performed by the utility employee.
Employees who leave the utility classification for any reason will be returned to their regular job, seniority permitting.
3.	MANNING OF NONPRODUCTION WORK ASSIGNMENTS
It is understood between the Company and the Union that non- production work assignments will be manned on the same basis or in accordance with the practice followed for many years for the manning of production groups. Therefore, in those instances where there is sufficient work to support the assignment of an employee working in a non-production occupational unit but the amount of work time involved for any given or specific non-production occupation does not constitute an entire work shift, the job will be manned with an employee who is working in the non-production occupation that requires the most work time during the regular forty- (40) hour work week.
4.	NON-PRODUCTION B -INSPECTION/PRODUCTION TOOL GAGE, & LAYOUT
A revised training program has been established that consists of a three-(3) month training period in gage calibration and a three-(3) month period in plant layout. The total training period will be six (6) months.
133
I
During the six-(6) month training period, there will be no shift preference for the trainees in the program.
The employee during the training program will be permitted to equalize overtime only among those employees of a like status within the occupation.
To qualify for the Non-Production B occupation, certain minimum math and blueprint requirements are needed. Qualifications will be established by a written test provided by the Metrology manager that will cover the basic math courses numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. Also a basic blueprint reading capability test will be administered. The trainee must be deemed qualified by the Metrology manager. The possibility of adding some classroom training to supplement our current training program will be reviewed.

1.	The Company will send Owner Operators to assembly plants or wherever necessary to resolve
135

problems of a nature that can be determined in advance that require bargaining unit work or when requested by quality control personnel, supervisors, engineers or anyone else with the required and appropriate knowledge to resolve problems with our products at our customer’s facilities.
2.	It is further understood that the return of large numbers of any unit may under certain conditions be assigned to the regular assembly lines for tear-down, repair, checking, or whatever work is required. The work of tear-down and repair (T&R) is normally limited to smaller numbers of units which can easily be handled within the limitation of the T&R department. However, this does not preclude the assignment of T&R personnel to work with specific assembly lines or other employees on large number of returns where such assignment is feasible and necessary. As in the past, there are instances where repair areas may be set up apart from the assembly lines and apart from T&R. Typically, these repair lines are a function of their home assembly line.
D.	Work stations, hand tools, specialty tools, general equipment (such as presses, test stands, and leak tests) will be provided. Analysts must be capable of using and caring for this equipment.

The Company will furnish gloves on all jobs where necessary and not prohibited by insurance or safety regulations. On operations where gloves are requested, such operations shall be reviewed by the plant committeemen, supervisor, and Safety Director and it shall be determined at the review if gloves are necessary for such operation.
In addition to the above, the Company agrees to hold a meeting at least once every three months for the purpose of reviewing with the Union matters as they relate directly to the safety and health of the employees in the plant. The Union may invite the appropriate International representative to this meeting. The Company representatives in attendance will be the Safety Director, the Manager, Human Resources or his designee, the Manager of Manufacturing or his designee, and other members of management who may be involved. The Union shall notify
137
the Company two weeks in advance of a request for such a meeting.
Upon the settlement of a firm date, a plant inspection tour will be conducted by two Union and two Company representatives and the Safety Director. This plant inspection tour will be conducted at least one (1) week prior to the quarterly safety review meeting.
If the Company and Union representatives are unable to resolve a safely issue during the above-mentioned meeting, it will be referred to the Vice President Human Resources, and the International Representative, Safety, who will jointly determine the Unai disposition of the issue. However, if the issue is not resolved, it may be submitted by the Union to a qualified impartial third party mutually selected by the parties.
During the 1998 negotiations, the Company indicated its full commitment to its responsibilities to furnish emergency medical care to its employees. At a minimum, the Company will comply with the requirements established by OSHA.
2.	PLANT CLOSURE
During the 1982 negotiations the Union expressed concern with regard to timely notification in the event of plant closure.
The Company agrees that in keeping with its overall policy of employee communications, that the Union will be notified as soon as possible with regard to a decision to close the plant.
Furthermore, the Company pledges to work with the Union leadership to the extent practical in the
138
provision of job counseling, outplacement services, etc., in the event of a plant closure.
3.	JOINT CIVIL RIGHTS COMMITTEE
It is agreed between the parties that a Civil Rights Committee will be established which will consist of three representatives from the Union and three representatives from the Company.
This committee will meet as required but not less than twice each year to discuss equal opportunity and discrimination problems and tensions in the plant and develop ways and means of promoting use of the grievance procedure as the exclusive method for resolving disputes.
It is understood that the time spent by the Union members of the Joint Civil Rights Committee in the investigation of complaints and/or the attendance of regularly scheduled meetings will not be compensated by the Company,
The Union agrees that both the Union and the Company will enforce the language and intent of this letter and that all incidents pertaining to the Joint Civil Rights Committee shall be brought to the attention and direction of the Joint Civil Rights Committee so that the Committee may fulfill their duties as spelled out in this Letter of Understanding #3.
4.	JOINT CIVIL RIGHTS COMMITTEE
During the 1986 negotiations, the Company and Union discussed the importance of correct setups and the proper role of the supervisor and operator in assuring that this happens. The parties have agreed as follows:
1.	An experienced operator who is paid the owner operator rate is expected to make his
139
1
assigned setup properly, without help, and within reasonable time. Such setup operator would be expected to communicate any problem he might have with his supervisor so that such problems can be addressed. The supervisor, too, is expected to share with the operator additional pertinent information he might have regarding the setup. The operator is expected to know what additional services such as red line room are required to finalize the setup.
2.	An owner operator making a setup on an unfamiliar cycle should work closely with the supervisor in completing such work and the supervisor will sign off on the setup.
The supervisor is responsible for providing guidance and instruction to operators in such cases, but it is expected that the operator should perform properly and responsibly in accordance with setup instruction, prints, etc., as well as through communication with the supervisor. It is not expected that the supervisor should “redo” the setup, that is check every dimension, etc., but he should be assured that the setup has been properly completed, either through confirmation with the operator, an outside source such as the “red line room” or his own appraisal.
It is expected that the operator will utilize normal workmanship habits and will not rely on the supervisor to find his mistakes. On the other hand, the supervisor is to be aware of the experience of the individual and the technical assistance he might require.
Both the operator and the supervisor share a joint responsibility in producing correct setups.
140
5.	PERSONAL PASSES
It is understood that the Company’s policy pertaining to the issuance of passes for personal reasons is as follows:
Although the Company reserves the right to question the nature of a pass, in practice the Company will not request the reason for a personal pass unless the employee's record is questionable.
If an employee with an unsatisfactory work and/or attendance record requests a personal pass and refuses to give the supervisor the reason for such a pass, the supervisor should give the employee a pass to leave work but should indicate on both the pass and the employee’s attendance card that the work time covered by the pass is unexcused. The supervisor should also inform the employee that he may be subject to disciplinary action.
When employees states it is too hot or too cold to work, they will be given personal passes with the notation: “Employee states too hot/cold to work”. The situation will be treated as a personal pass situation.
If the employee leaves the plant without a pass, the employee is subject to disciplinary action for leaving work without permission and for unexcused absence unless he furnishes a legitimate excuse acceptable to management for having left work.
6.	SPEEDS AND FEEDS
It is understood between the parties that the Company does not intend to invoke mass speedups, by increasing speeds, feeds or process times. The Company agrees that in those
141
instances where the Company (reduces or increases) speeds and feeds, or process times, the Company will notify the employees and
J their steward.
All disputes are subject to the grievance procedure.
7.	SUPERVISOR RESPONSE TIME
As has been pointed out, the amount of supervisor response time has in total not been a problem. However, the Company recognizes that tn certain areas there may be exceptions. Therefore, the Company again agrees to analyze on a regular routing basis the reports of supervisor response time and io make adjustments in accordance with good management practices wherever response times seem excessive and unnecessary.
8.	ADJUSTMENTS TO PAY RECORDS
During the 1980 Negotiations, the Union expressed dissatisfaction with the delays experienced in correcting errors in the pay system-
It is the intent of the Company that alt errors will be corrected and adjustments will be made as soon as possible in order to cause minimal inconvenience for the employee involved. Under normal circumstances the time involved should not exceed 30 days. The Company will endeavor to make every effort to adjust pay prior to 30 days.
■	9. PAST PRACTICE
Although the provisions of Article Twelve, I	Section 13, of the Collective Bargaining
I	Agreement apply only to the skilled trades occu-
I pations, the Company will continue its past prac-L tice of utilizing outside labor employees where r feasible and the Company has the necessary equipment and machinery to perform such work.
142
10.	UNION REPRESENTATIVE TRAINED IN METHODS OF PRODUCTION MEASUREMENT
The Company agrees that during the duration of this Collective Bargaining Agreement, one Union representative trained in methods of production measurement will be maintained. Such representative will be assigned to a production or non-production occupation and may be utilized as set forth in Article 3, Section 2, Step 3.
11.	USE OF CAMERAS IN PLANT
The Company will not use surveillance cameras, phone taps, etc to check the work activities of Borg Warner, DTPC, Muncie Plant employees. Any alleged violations will be subject to Article Three.
12.	DELAYS
The Company uses standardized engineering data which recognizes that there are normal delay factors which will be considered when establishing production goals.
13.	ERRORS
In the course of writing the current contract, certain deletions were made of material which appeared to be outdated. It is agreed between the parties that where the situation would appear to exist which had been covered by such language and is not now covered by the new language inadvertently, the language of the 1995 Collective Bargaining Agreement will serve as a guide to the parties.
14.	DEFECTIVE VENDOR MATERIAL
In those instances when vendors supply faulty material to DTPC Muncie Plant, it will be solely the vendors responsibility to determine how to resolve such issues by whatever means they
143
deem appropriate including but not limited to the following:
a.	Sort, repair or rework to be performed by DTPC employees with costs charged back to vendor,
b.	Defective material to be returned to the vendor or shipped to a designated location for the vendor to sort, repair or rework
c.	Sort, repair or rework to be performed by the vendor supplied manpower in the Muncie Plant
In those instances when vendor supplied manpower is performing sort, repair or rework within the facility, the Company will endeavor to separate the vendor supplied manpower from DTPC bargaining unit employees whenever possible.
However, when vendor material has been assembled by DTPC bargaining unit employees (ie. sub-assemblies or complete assemblies), bargaining unit employees will do all sorting, repair and rework within the facility. The disposition of other vendor parts which are found to be defective after having been machined will be discussed by the Company and the Union in order to arrive at the appropriate business decision.
15.	K46 OVERNIGHT TRAVEL
The following rules will apply to all bargaining unit employees while such employees are engaged in extended and overnight travel at the request of the Company:
Food-$50.00 per day
Laundry and dry cleaning-At reasonable cost
144
Telephone-At reasonable cost

All of the above expenditures are to be validated by receipt. Phone calls to home should be made from the motel, which automatically validates by receipt. Unless the circumstances absolutely dictate otherwise phone calls to Diversified Transmission Products Corporation, Muncie Plant should be collect. Phone calls involving parts for trucks, other directly related Diversified Transmission Products Corporation, Muncie Plant business and other emergency situations should be made from the mote! if at all possible, but if made otherwise, must be validated.
Incidental expenses involving Diversified Transmission Products Corporation, Muncie Plant business must be validated by receipt. Personal incidentals are to be paid by the individual rather than by Borg-Warner Automotive Diversified Transmission Products Corporation, Muncie Plant.
SKILLED TRADES MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING
1.	SKILLED TRADES-REPLACEMENT OF ABSENTEE ON 11:30 SHIFT
It is agreed between the parties that the following procedures will be used to replace an absentee in the skilled trades on the 11:30 shift.
A.	If the Company knows of the absence during the 7:30 to 3:30 shift time, the youngest employee on days in that department may be transferred to the 11:30 shift. This becomes his shift for that period of time and there is no question of overtime involved.
145
I
B.	If the Company does not know of the absence until after the 7:30 to 3:30 shift time, day shift employees, beginning with the youngest, may be transferred to that shift, and will have the option of working their regular shift the following day if they so choose, thereby earning the overtime premium.
C.	The Company may cover the absence by the use of overtime as in the past by requesting 3;30 shift personnel to work over or by calling an employee from the overtime list.
Should the absence extend for more than one day, the vacancy may be filled in accordance with the seniority provisions of the contract by transferring the youngest employee from the day shift or from the 3:30 shift to the 11:30 shift.
2.	TOOL WORK AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTS FOR WORK
The Company understands its contractual obligations under the provisions of Article Twelve, Section 10 (Tool Work) and Article Twelve, Section 13, (Independent Contracts for Work) of the Labor Agreement and fully intends to abide by and comply with such provisions.
The Company further agrees to keep rhe Union informed by notification of the appropriate skilled trades or EEOU Union representatives and the Chairman of the Negotiating Committee of those instances where major tooling or experimental production programs are put out to outside tool shops and of those occasions when independent contractors are utilized within the plants themselves in an effort to maintain harmo
146
nious relationships and avoid undue conflict among the bargaining unit members of the skilled trades and between the Company and the Union.
It shall be the intent of the Company to give full attention to the factors involved with both the use of outside tool shops and independent contractors as such relate to and affect the bargaining unit skilled trades occupations and employees and be able to justify its position should an issue arise.
3.	industrial truck repair duties
It is agreed between the Company and Ute Union that all work with regard to repairing, maintaining and servicing industrial trucks <i.e. lift trucks, Kalamazoo, etc.) will be assigned to the industrial truck repair occupation. This agreement, however, restricts in no manner the long-established practice of subcontracting certain portions of this work to outside concerns. The intent and purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding is to relieve machine repairmen, industrial pipe-fitters and industrial electricians from this type of work assignment in order to utilize their skills and expertise in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
It is agreed that to implement the industrial truck repair occupation which is now a function and which is part of the machine repair occupation, the five (5) employees currently assigned to the industrial truck repair work will be given the option, at the time of the effective date of the 1977 Collective Bargaining Agreement, of remaining on such work assignment. Therefore, it is agreed that in the event the industrial truck repair work assignment is reduced, the employ-
147
ees having the machine repair occupation who choose to exercise the above-noted option will be reduced to other work within the machine repair occupation, seniority permitting.
It is understood that in the event the industrial truck repair work assignment is increased or if it is necessary to fill a bona fide job opening involving industrial truck repair work after the effective date of the 1977 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Company will select competent mechanics, providing that none of the previously mentioned five (5) employees who have exercised the above-described option have been reduced from such work except as the result of normal attrition, to fill such job openings created by an increase in the industrial truck repair work load and/or bona fide job openings involving industrial truck repair work. It is further understood that in the event there is a reduction in the industrial truck repair work after competent mechanics have been selected and placed on such industrial truck repair work as previously described, such employees (mechanics) will be reduced from the industrial truck repair work prior to the reduction of the employees having the machine repair occupation who exercised the option noted in this Memorandum of Understanding of remaining on the industrial truck repair work assignment.
It is finally agreed that once the employees having the machine repair occupation who exercised the option to remain on the industrial truck repair work assignment are no longer a consideration with regard to the industrial truck repair work due to attrition, the industrial truck repair occupation will consist of the competent mechanics selected by the Company who will exercise sen
148
iority in that occupation on the basis of the date that such employees (i.e, competent mechanics) were assigned to the industrial truck repair work itself.
The employees having the machine repair occupation who choose to remain assigned as previously described to industrial truck repair work will continue to be paid the wage rate for the machine repair occupation. When job openings are filled by competent mechanics selected by the Company the wage rates effective for such mechanics will be the same as the wage rates and wage schedule for the machine repair occupation.
It is not intended by the terms of this Agreement that the skills and experience of any other skilled trades occupation will not be utilized when required. In addition, it is understood that certain skilled trades employees will be used for instruction purposes.

8.	SKILLED TRADES CRAFTT
A, CONCEPT:
During the 2000-2001 negotiations the parties considered the important role of the skilled trades in the Company's quality, productivity, and long term competitive position. The manner in which the basic core skilled trades are utilized substantially affects the day-to-day success of our manufacturing and assembly activities. The following guidelines are to be used by the parties in the utilization of basic skilled trades consistent with national guidelines established by the International Union.
In order for the Company to improve its competitive position the parties agree to a process to facilitate a more efficient use of the basic core skilled trades at the plant floor level.
In order to improve the manner in which we use
160
the varied skills and talents of our basic skilled trades workforce, the parties agree to the following;
1.	Develop a process, which upgrades basic skills and capabilities and maximizes the contribution of each skilled trade’s employee.
2.	Restructure the manner in which the skilled trades are utilized in the manufacturing and assembly operations, as well as other area where skilled trades are assigned.
3.	Examine the Apprenticeship Program and implement changes that ensure basic core skilled trades program graduates are better able to support future technology and operating requirements.
The CRAFTT concept embodies a number of important priorities with respect to the upgrading of skills of basic core skilled trades employees; and efficiently utilizing those skills in the plant CAPABILITY in basic core skilled trades.
RESOURCE commitment by the Company ALIGNMENT of basic core skilled trades in trade groupings
FLEXIBILITY with respect to the performance of skilled trades tasks
TEAMWORK among trade groupings and production activities
TRAINING to support the continual development of the CRAFTT concept.
The general intent of this agreement is to;
-	expand the skills of current and newly hired trades persons and apprentices
-	provide increased flexibility to the company on job assignments to trades persons for
161
tasks that can be performed safely and competently-
-	recognize general lines of demarcation in accordance with UAW guidelines.
-	commitment to provide required training of existing trades employees and to review the apprentice training programs to ensure that future apprentices.wil) be trained appropriately.
Under the CRAFTT concept, basic core skilled trades would work to foster teamwork, efficiencies, provide greater flexibility, upgrade basic skilled trades capabilities and enhance overall operational effectiveness, ft is envisioned the role of skilled trades employees would grow as new technology and operating practices are put into place. Basic core skilled trades would be an important part of activities that focus on improved equipment uptime, project work, and preventative maintenance programs.
Introduction of the CRAFTT concept requires management leadership, support, and commitment at all levels of the Company,
B.	Work Assignments
It is the policy of the Company to assign work between skilled trades employees in conformity with the following guidelines:
1.	In making work assignments management intends to respect the basic differences between the trades and recognize the importance of its trades employees in the overall success of the plants future.
2.	The Company cannot be put to a disadvantage by multiple hair-splitting
162
refinements and cumbersome and unreal distinctions.
3.	The efficient operation of the plant demands' the full utilization of the talents of each trade.
With these guidelines in mind the following factors wilt be considered in making job assignments: Central Skills— tasks which require the unique and central skills of one particular trade are assigned to that trade unless such tasks are incidental to the principal tasks being performed by other trades employees as discussed below..
Overlapping Capabilities—to determine whether a particular skilled assignment falls within the scope of two or more trades and thus assignable to any of those trades, several criteria will be considered, no one of which by itself is controlling:
Level of skill involved
Types of apprenticeship training Nature of the material being worked on Task to be performed
Right to Access— is a comparatively minor task that is complementary to a principal job. In determining whether a task is covered under right to access to the trades person performing the principal task, the following points will be considered:
Safety
Capability
Time involved in relation to the principal work assignment (a minor task or a series of minor tasks performed sporadically over the duration of the principal work assignment are minor even though the cumulative time may be fairly large.)
163
Minor, Right to access tasks are not limited to those arising in the course of theprincipal work assignments but may occur at the beginning or end of the job.
Emergencies- in the event of unforeseen incidents, fires, accidents and the like, assignments may be made without regards to trade, although trade lines are not to be disregarded where the time within which the repairs are to be made and the availability of the appropriate trades employees permit their observance.
These practices with respect to skilled trades work assignments will not result in the reduction of trades employees in the plant.
C. 'Draining
It is agreed that appropriate training to upgrade and enhance skilled trades’ capabilities would be required. The Company will commit the necessary resources to train skilled trades and related supervisory staff to ensure successful implementation and ongoing viability of the CRAFTT concept The parties agree that all employees in the skilled trades may participate in classroom and on-the-floor-training assignments intended to upgrade skilled trades capability, flexibility, and expertise. Assessments of basic core skilled trades capability will be conducted to confirm the amount and type of training to upgrade basic skills, which should be done.
This agreement allows each trades employee to successfully complete training that will allow them to perform minor, right to access work, and overlapping work at a higher level, and acquire additional skills that result in an increase in their wage rate as specified below. This training will be divided into three levels, with an increasing amount of skill and versatility required at each level.
164
Successful completion of each level will result in a wage increase of $.50/hour. The key elements of this training program will include the following:
1.	Opportunity for ail current and future skilled trades employees to participate in training for new and additional skills on a voluntary basis,
2.	Recognition of advanced skills with corresponding wage increases of up to $1.50/hour above the maximum occupational wage rate,
3.	Establishment of a joint Company/Union committee to work with an independent outside source regarding the design of training curriculums and training certification requirements.
4.	Procedure for skilled trades employees participating in the program who already possess advanced skills to “test out*’ of required courses and thereby advance more rapidly in the program.
5.	Training books and materials will be provided by the company.
6.	Commitment of the parties to convene the joint committee within 90 days of ratification.
The parties agree that the joint committee will determine the specific curriculum at each level, however, the following will serve as a minimum guide for each level:
Level 1 ($.50/hour increase) -
Successfill completion of a minimum of 148 hours of training in courses determined by the parties.
Level 2 ($.50/hour increase) -
Successful completion of a minimum 160 hours of training.
165
Level 3 ($.50/hour increase) -
Successful completion of a minimum of 116 hours of training.
Participation in the training program is voluntary. However, employees will still be assigned tasks in accordance with the previous Work Assignment language. The Training/Pay for Skill simply allows employees to attain even greater skill and be compensated for such skill. As employees progress through the levels it is expected that their overlapping capabilities will increase, and they will be qualified to perform tasks that are minor, right to access, or overlapping capabilities work at an even higher level. It is not the intent of the parties to allow an employee to opt out of training and thereby be excluded from performing right to access work based on their overlapping capabili* ties.
This training is intended to maximize the overlapping capabilities of the respective trades. However, this does not prohibit the above committee from establishing training curriculum that enhances existing skills within a specific trade.
9.	HEAT TREAT FIXTURE MAINTE-N ANCE/M1LLWR1G HTS.
It is agreed between the parties that the current heat treat fixture maintenance occupation is a one man occupation and that the Company does not plan to enlarge that occupation.
It is therefore agreed between the parties that work assignments beyond the one man schedule will be assigned to the millwright occupation, For example, if 2 or more persons are required on the 7:30 shift or if employees were regularly required on the 3:30 or 11:30 shift, the additional people would be millwrights.
166
Miscellaneous overtime during the week would stili be offered first to the present heat treat fixture maintenance employee and then to the millwrights. Overtime on Saturday, Sunday and holidays will be offered first to the heat treat fixture maintenance employee. Should he not accept or should additional hours beyond 8 be required on any such day, the work wilt be offered to the millwright occupation,
It is the intent of this language to supplement the present heat treat fixture maintenance work with assignments to the millwright occupation. At such rime as the present heat treat fixture maintenance employee terminates his employment through retirement, etc., the entire work schedule will become millwright work.
10,	“A” RATE FOR SKILLED TRADES.
“A" rate is recognized as the highest rate of pay that is paid to any skilled trades occupation (except lead person). There are established criteria by which all tradesmen are to be evaluated and such criteria will be published and made available to all members. It is the function of management to make evaluations and make rate increases on an equal and consistent manner.
Upon obtaining “A” rate there will be no reductions. If there is need to address an employee’s work performance, attendance, etc,, it will be dealt with in the proper manner as per the labor agreement.
11.	LEAD-PERSON
Skilled trades and EEOU unit, any skilled trades or EEOU employee who has attained seniority and the maximum rate of the classification, may be elected by and from the work unit to which he/she is assigned to serve temporarily as a lead
167
person to act as leader of the work unit and to give routing instructions and directions and properly distribute the work among the employees in such work unit, by assignment of the supervisor. Assignment as a lead-person cannot be made effective or remain effective unless approved by the immediate supervisor and the manager of manufacturing or his designated representative.
In the event that no one is elected, the supervisor may appoint an individual to act as a lead-person for a period of no longer than fourteen (14) calendar days.
If the work unit does not agree to elect an individual to serve as a lead-person, there will be no lead-person until such time as the unit does elect an individual to act in that capacity.
It is agreed to by the Company and the Union that as of the signing of this contract, rhe number of lead-person will be reduced to zero (removing all prior and present lead-person) and the new procedure will be followed (elected by the unit) in selecting those who will serve as lead-person.
It is to be understood that lead-person will continue to perform actual work in their classification and there will be no change in their seniority status. Lead-person will be given a temporary classification as such and will be paid an hourly rate of thirty-five (35ft) cents per hour more than the maximum rate of their classification.
It is understood and agreed by the parties that lead-person are working members of the work unit and are required to perform work in their occupation. They are not responsible for disciplinary action, job performance evaluation or any other duties commonly recognized as management responsibility.

5.	OUTSOURCING
During the recent contract discussions the Union expressed grave concern with regard to the
169
I I I
Company’s use of outside tool shops and/or independent contractors when seniority employees of the affected skilled trades occupation are on layoff. As part of the contract discussions and during a meeting held between certain members of Borg-Warner	Automotive, Diversified
Transmission Products Corporation Muncie plant management and skilled trades Union representatives along with the chairman of the negotiating committee of Local 287, UAW, the Company pledged that the appropriate procedures will immediately be established (an individual will be designated for each area of responsibility) to insure that the Union is kept fully informed prior to the subcontracting of such work with regard to all subcontracting activity under the terms of Article Twelve, Section 10, Tool Work, and Article Twelve, Section 13, Independent Contracts for Work, of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
The Company understands the Union’s concern with regard to the seriousness of the subcontracting issue and the impact that decisions on this subject can have on the job security of bargaining unit skilled trades personnel.
The Company further understands that it is the intent of this Letter of Understanding that both parties will evaluate all of the factors involving subcontracting situations in a reasonable manner with regard to equipment availability, skills requited, rime limits, customer commitments, operating costs, etc., in an effort to establish and maintain a harmonious relationship between the Company and the Union,
The Company pledges that every good faith effort will be made to work with the Union to
170
minimize conflicts involving this extremely important area of concern.
6.	REDUCTIONS
It is agreed between the parties that when skilled trades employees with seniority are reduced from their skilled occupations and offered assignments in the regular bargaining unit under the terms of Article Five, Section 9, of the Company/Union contract, the new employee wage scale, as stated in Article Eight of the Company/Union contract, will not be applicable.
The “new employee” provision of the new contract language applies only to those employees who are hired after January 1, 1983.
7.	OFFICE AREA FURNITURE
During the 1980 Negotiations the Union expressed concern regarding the movement and rearrangement of furniture, etc, in the office area.

It is agreed that welding is a required part of the millwright occupation. It is further agreed that the Company will continue to support a welding training program during the term of this Agreement.
12.	ON THE JOB TRAINING
During the 1982 negotiations, the Union expressed concern that skilled tradesmen were not being assigned to accompany engineers, factory consultants, or other Company representatives while they were in the plant and therefore were not aware of current information, changes, etc., that they need to know.
The Company believes that in those instances where it is clear that a skilled tradesman would benefit in training from such assignment, under normal situations, such assignments will be made if priorities permit and every effort will be made to utilize skilled trades working in departments that require the engineer, factory consultant or other company representative. If the department tradesmen are unavailable, then every effort will be made to utilize skilled trades from other areas.
Eventual determination must be made by the involved supervisor who is aware of other
172
requirements, etc., which might interfere in a given instance. It is however the intent of the Company to provide proper exposure to current technology as indicated.
13.	REVIEW OF OVERTIME
The Union expressed concern about the proper review of overtime in the skilled trades by the skilled trades steward. It is the intent of the Company to follow the language of
Article Nine, Section 4, as follows:
In the application of Article Nine, Section 4, as it applies to the offer of overtime in the skilled trades, it is the responsibility of the skilled trades supervision to review the overtime list with the skilled trades steward and to notify him of scheduled overtime. In addition, every effort will be made to keep the Union aware of any miscellaneous overtime. As noted in Article Nine, Section 4, the purpose of such review and coordination is to ensure proper equalization of overtime opportunity within the skilled trades.
14.	TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION
During the 1986 negotiations, the Union expressed concern that certain skilled tradesmen were not receiving available technical instruction within their occupational areas.
The purpose of this letter is to express the intent of the Company to provide, wherever feasible, available training in relation to potential job assignments and responsibilities. While on the one hand consideration must be given to time away from the job. the Company is equally concerned that skilled tradesmen be adequately and properly trained as well as updated on the current manufacturing equipment. Every effort
173
I
will be made to provide equality of opportunity in obtaining such schooling. The current proce-
1	dure of selection by the Training Committee
will continue.
15.	TRAINING TO MAINTAIN MACHINERY
It was pointed out by the Union that in some cases, once having passed the warranty period, vendors complete their work without passing along to the appropriate skilled tradesmen the . necessary information to continue to maintain the machines.
The Company wishes to state again its intent that skilled tradesmen be properly trained to maintain the machinery, whether through direct instruction from individual vendor or from appropriate schooling.
16.	UTILITY/SK1LLED TRADES RESPONSIBILITIES
During the 1986 negotiations, the Union expressed concern about the relationship between the job responsibilities of the utility classification and the responsibilities of the skilled trades.
It is the intent of the Company that there should be no conflict of interest between the skilled trades classifications and the work performed by the utility employee,
The duties of the utility employee are clearly spelled out in Memorandum of Understanding #2 I	(Utility Classification).
I	The Company expects to comply with the intent
|	of this language at all times.
I 17. CHANGEOVER EMPLOYEES
| The purpose of (his letter is to emphasize the I appropriate language of Article Five, Section 9,
174
regarding the purpose and use of “changeover" employees in the skilled trades. This language states that the Company may transfer employees from other occupations into the skilled trades under the following circumstances:
I,	Changeover
2.	Plant rearrangement
3.	Necessary work of a temporary nature and of short duration in connection with new or improved products.
Il has been agreed that such changeover assignments may not exceed 90 days. Any extension of the assignment beyond that period must be agreed to by the parties.
It is the intent of the Company that changeover employees will be brought into the skilled trades involved only when such conditions are listed above exist.
18.	OPEN JOB - Employees shall be allowed to bid on open specialty jobs (i.e., board repair, lasers, documentation, vibration analysis, etc.). Open jobs will be posted five (5) days prior to placement on bulletin boards. The most senior qualified employee will be selected, as determined by Management.
19.	OCCUPATION EROSION
During 2000-2001 contract negotiations, the parties established the CRAFTT agreement regarding skilled trades’ employees. While this agreement clearly gives the company additional flexibility, it is not the intent of the company to erode the basic trades occupations. The company recognizes the union’s concern that trades employees are able to maintain their status as a
175
journeyman in their respective trade. However, both parties recognize that as employees move through the Training/Pay for Skill portion of the CRAFTT Agreement they win develop increasing skills and have a higher degree of overlapping capability.
As the company has stated, the main intent is to allow trades employees to follow assignments through to their completion without the continual handing off of tasks from one trade to another. It is not the intent of the company to mis-assign trades employees, rather the company wants to better capture the overlapping capabilities of trade’s employees.
There also may be projects where it is beneficial to both parties to “augment” a project crew. This may be done by mutual agreement.
To ensure that the above occurs, the company agrees to review the work assignments of trades employees with the union. A committee to be chaired by the Human Resources Manager and consist of no more than three union representatives and three company representatives will do this. This committee will meet twice a year to review the previous six months work assignments and determine if the CRAFTT agreement has been administered.
20.	Skilled Trades Security Issues
During discussions for the 24)00-2001 negotiations the parties discussed a variety of issues regarding skilled trades work assignments. One of the issues both parties recognize is the need to hire additioal skilled trades employees. The Company will agree to commit to hire 25 skilled trade employees as soon as possible following ratification of this agreement.
176
These 25 will be a combination of apprentices and journeyman. This commitment is based on the current business conditions. Any change in such conditions could result in an increase or decrease in the above number. Another concern expressed by the union was to ensure that the language changes agreed to would not result in further attrition. Based on the above commiment, and the language contained in the CRAFTT agreement, the company commits to not reduce the number of skilled trades employees as a result of this agreement. Specifically the union expressed this concern regarding the toolmaker occupation. The company further commits that it will not attrition the toolmaker occupation below current levels, given that business conditions remain at least as they are currently.
