5.	Officials of the FOP shall be given an additional 45 minutes to address each academy class subsequent to training week 12. The exact date and time shall be scheduled between the FOP and Academy staff. Flexibility shall be allowed for rotations.
Article 8 Contract Grievance Procedure
Section A. Definition of Grievance. A grievance is defined as a dispute or disagreement as to the interpretation or application of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that the grievance and arbitration procedures set forth below shall be the exclusive forum for the hearing of any grievance and the exclusive remedy for any grievance as defined above, provided, however, that this provision shall not preclude an individual or the FOP from bringing the terms and provisions of the contract to the attention of any tribunal properly considering a matter to which the contract may relate.
Section B. Initiation of a Grievance.
1.	Except in exigent circumstances or where a grievance relating to compensation is based on a claimed computational or factual error, an employee must notify the president of the FOP that he or she has a grievance within thirty days (30) after he or she knew or should have known of the existence of the dispute or grievance.
2.	At the option of the FOP, a grievance may be presented informally by an FOP Steward or other suitable official to the district or unit commander for resolution. If the grievance is not resolved at that stage, it may be processed as provided below.
Section C. First Step of the Grievance Procedure. A grievance shall be presented in writing to the chief of police within twenty (20) calendar days after the president of the FOP receives notice of the alleged contractual violation, or with reasonable diligence should have received notice of the violation, provided that if the grievance is presented to the unit commander as provided above, an additional ten (10) days shall be added to the time provided. The FOP shall forward a copy of the grievance to the employee's immediate supervisor and district or unit commander. The grievance shall be set forth with reasonable clarity. The chief, or his designee, and representatives of the bargaining unit shall meet and discuss the grievance within twenty (20) calendar days after it is presented to the chief of police. The chief of police shall respond, in writing, to the grievance within twenty (20) calendar days after the meeting.
Section D. Second Step of Grievance Procedure. The FOP may appeal the decision of the chief of police by presenting a written appeal to the chief administrative officer for Montgomery County (hereinafter CAO) within fourteen (14) calendar days of the chief of police's decision. The CAO, or his/her designee, and representatives of the bargaining unit shall meet to discuss the grievance within twenty (20) calendar days after presentation of the appeal to the CAO. The CAO shall respond, in writing, to the grievance within twenty (20) calendar days of the meeting.
Section E. Arbitration.
1.	Upon receipt of the response from the CAO or upon expiration of the twenty day period referred to in subparagraph D above, either party may refer the grievance to arbitration by providing written notice to the other party within sixty (60) days after receipt of the response of the CAO by the FOP or within sixty (60) days after expiration of the twenty-day period referred to above. The arbitrator shall be chosen from a panel composed of persons agreed to by the parties.
2.	The arbitrators shall be selected to hear succeeding grievances in rotation in the order their names appear. If the arbitrator slated to hear a grievance cannot hold the hearing within a
Page 7
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July i, 2004 - June 30, 2007
reasonable time, the next arbitrator shall be selected. Upon mutual agreement, the parties may meet in a pre-hearing conference on a case-by-case basis.
Section F. Arbitration Procedure. Unless the arbitrator believes and determines that the fding of briefs is necessary to a fair and timely consideration of the grievance, neither party shall have the right to file a brief. Either party may request the arbitrator to determine whether the above standard has been met and to authorize the filing of briefs. The arbitrator must submit a written opinion regarding the grievance within sixty (60) days after the hearing.

Page 9
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July i, 2004 - June 30, 2007
employer will accommodate the unit member in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act [ADA], A claim that the accommodation does not satisfy the requirements of the ADA shall not be grievable.
Section E. Temporary Incapacitation. To the extent it is not violative of the ADA or other law, the following shall apply to unit members.
1.	Fitness Categories. For the purpose of competently dealing with the personnel needs of the department, there are herein established three categories of fitness. The critical criteria for determination of the categories is the ability of an officer to perform the full scope of duties and responsibilities of a sworn police officer. The categories established are: full duty, restricted duty and disability.
a.	Full Duty Officer is able to fully perform all duties and meet all responsibilities required of a sworn officer.
b.	Restricted Duty Officer is not able to fully perform all duties or meet all responsibilities required of a sworn officer. Further, the reason for the incapacitation is determined to be of a temporary nature. An officer in this fitness category must have moderate levels of physical fitness and mental health as determined by a medical authority. Within the fitness category of restricted duty, an officer will be in either a limited or light duty status.
2.	Duty! Conditions. The following conditions apply to all officers on restricted duty, (either limited or light duty categories):
a.	The officer must submit a physician's certification of condition and/or be examined by an Employee Medical Examiner as required by his/her respective bureau chief.
b.	If the officer is performing in the limited or light duty assignment at an acceptable level of competency, he/she is eligible to receive a regular service increment.
3.	Limited Duty!.
a.	An officer will be placed in a limited duty status when the officer can perform most of the duties assigned; however, a specific, temporary medical limitation exists regarding the type or degree of duties the officer is physically capable of performing. The medical limitations must be well controlled and present no unreasonable risk to the individual, other employees or the public during performance of duty.
b.	An officer in a limited duty status may be assigned, on a temporary basis, to a position which has assigned duties and responsibilities consistent with his/her medical restrictions. Upon return to full duty, the officer will normally return to his regular assignment.
4.	Light Duty!.
a.	Officers will be placed in a light duty status when temporarily incapacitated such that they cannot perform all of the duties of their assignment without presenting an unreasonable risk to the health or safety of themselves, other employees or the public. Light duty includes, but is not limited to, pregnancy.
b.	An officer in a light duty status will be assigned to a duty position. The duty assignment will be determined in accordance with the needs of the department and be compatible with the restrictions caused by the injury or illness. The department will maintain the Restricted Duty/Disability Unit as one area available for assignment.
c.	An officer on light duty is subject to the following conditions:
(1)	Officer is relieved of all law enforcement responsibility. (Being relieved of law enforcement responsibility means an officer is not required to take police action, but
Page 10
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July i, 2004 - June 30, 2007
in his judgment he may take action. This decision must be made by the officer on a case-by-case basis after considering the risk of further injury to the officer, the potential injury to the victim of the crime and/or bystanders, and the nature of the event.)
(2)	In stress and psychological cases and in unusual or extenuating circumstances the Employer will determine what, if any, further personnel action is necessary. Various factors, such as the officer's ability to handle a weapon, operate an unmarked police vehicle, make an arrest, deal with the public, etc., will be considered before a determination is made as to what restrictions should apply to the officer.
(3)	If it is determined that the officer's police powers are to be suspended, the commanding officer or his designee will complete MCP 553 (Suspension of Police Powers) and MCP 552 (Memo of Notification).
(4)	In all cases, the officer will be notified in writing as to what restrictions apply.
(5)	Officers will not operate a marked police vehicle. In accordance with Article 35, Section G.(13), a PPV participant will relinquish the car for the period of light duty. The officer may operate administrative vehicles in a non-emergency capacity, i.e,5 administrative duties.
(6)	A line officer in a light duty status will be temporarily reassigned to an appropriate position within the department. A staff officer may continue to perform in his/her regular assignment depending upon the nature of the injury.
5.	Temporary No-Duty.
a.	Officers will be in a temporary no-duty status when they are unable to perform the duties and responsibilities of the assignment without representing an unreasonable risk to themselves, other employees or the public. An officer on sick leave or disability leave will be in this status and his/her return to another status must occur consistent with Article 23, §A.3 of this agreement. Sick leave approved in advance for such incidents as medical appointments, family illness, etc., will be an exception to the policy in that the officer will not be in a no-duty status. In other extenuating circumstances, such as leaving work due to a sudden illness or a minor injury, the officer's immediate supervisor may grant permission for the officer to operate a PPV for a reasonable period of time in order to return to his principal place of residence.
b.	The following conditions apply initially to an officer in a no-duty status:
(1)	The officer will not wear the police uniform.
(2)	The officer will not operate a police vehicle.
c.	An officer using more than five (5) consecutive days of sick leave shall submit to his/her supervisor a certificate from a physician or other recognized medical practitioner. The certificate shall confirm the illness and officer's inability to report to work or to perform part or all of the duties and responsibilities of his position and the dates of treatment.
d.	After evaluating various factors such as the officer's ability to handle a weapon, operate a police vehicle, make an arrest, deal with the public, etc., a determination will be made as to what restrictions will apply to the officer.
e.	In all cases, the officer will be notified as to what restrictions apply in his/her case.
f.	When the officer remains in this status for more than three (3) days if the cause was job-related or more than fifteen days (15) if the cause was not job-related, the following condition will apply in addition to those (TJ 5.b. 1 and 2) above:
The service increment will be delayed if the period of no-duty exceeds 50% of the rating
Page 11
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July 1, 2004 - June 30, 2007
period in accordance with Article 28. In such cases, reassignment of increment dates is not always necessary. The officer must be notified in writing by the department head and be given the reason for the delay prior to the effective date of the action. The necessary paper work should be completed and sent to the Police Personnel Section via the chain of command by the fifth of the month (preceding the increment date) to ensure timely processing.
6.	In accordance with Article 28, a service increment shall not be delayed or denied because of a service-connected injury or illness, provided the officer received a satisfactory or acceptable evaluation in the preceding rating period.
Section F. Reopener. This article shall reopen should the number of officers who are affected under § D exceeds 1.5% of the bargaining unit complement.
Article 12	Seniority
Section A. Definition. Except as provided in this section below, seniority of a bargaining unit employee is calculated based on the total service time as a police officer or police officer candidate (from the date of commencement of academy class in Montgomery County, except where breaks in service of any duration occur or where an employee has been on authorized leave without pay for a period exceeding two pay periods (excluding leave for a purpose specified in Article 59, Section B.2., parental leave, military leave, leave pending resolution of a dispute over a disability leave determination, the employee is suspended without pay, political leave and any other leave where seniority is protected by statute or by this agreement). A police officer who has been on authorized leave without pay for a period exceeding two pay periods subject to the above exclusions, will not receive seniority credit for that entire period of time. A police officer who leaves County service and is subsequently rehired shall receive credit for purposes of calculating seniority for any years of service prior to the break, regardless of the length of the break. This change in calculating seniority shall be applied prospectively only. When a lateral entry class starts after a regular academy class but graduates before the regular academy class, the date of commencement for the lateral entry class will, for seniority purposes, be the same as the date of commencement for the regular academy class. For the purposes of a tiebreaker between a lateral entry officer and regular academy officer, priority shall be given to the lateral entry officer. Further, whenever seniority is used to determine rights under this agreement between two or more sergeants, date of promotion to the rank of sergeant shall determine seniority. No unit member shall lose any benefit previously attained by virtue of seniority on account of calculation under this article.
Section B. Seniority List. The official seniority list shall be prepared by the County and indicate names, classification, dates of employment and service times as of the date of distribution. FMLA and political leave used shall count toward seniority.
Section C. Dates of Employment. Dates of employment for bargaining unit employees include the service time from full time employment as a police officer or police officer candidate (from the date of commencement of the academy class.) Except as indicated in §A, in the event of a tie regarding service time under these provisions, the following criteria, in order of priority, shall serve as tiebreakers in determining seniority: (1) academy class standing when two or more employees attended the same academy or lateral class session; (2) actual date of hire by the Montgomery County Government; and (3) months of prior qualifying (Article 36) law enforcement experience for a lateral entry. Retirement time purchased on a "buy back’’ basis because of military service or service with other agencies in or outside Montgomery County shall not be counted.
Section D. Probationary Period. Newly hired employees remain on their initial probationary period a full 12 months (excluding extensions) from the date they receive sworn status. Generally, this will coincide with a change in status from police officer candidate to Police Officer I.

Article 13	Designation of Smoking Areas
Section A. Absent objection from another person who is present, unit members may smoke in buildings (such as sheds, garages, outbuildings, and the like) where no heating, air conditioning or ventilation systems are installed which would cause others to breathe secondhand smoke. Smoking will also be permitted in all other places except where prohibited by existing law or where special hazards such as explosives, gasoline, highly flammable materials, and the like are present. Enforcement of this provision shall be consistent with public law and employees in violation shall be subject only to civil penalties as prescribed by law. [See Side Letter.]
Section B. This Article will be reopened for negotiations in the event Bill 42-93 is invalidated in whole or in part. Failing agreement within sixty (60) days, the dispute will be resolved pursuant to the impasse procedures (excluding dates) of Chapter 33, §33-81(b) of the Montgomery County Code.

c.	Supervisors placing an employee on stand-by will advise the employee of the reason for the stand-by, the location to which s/he will respond, and the approximate duration of the stand-by. Further, when the stand-by is lifted, the supervisor will re-contact the employee and so advise the employee.
d.	For purposes of placing employees on stand-by for testifying in court, the court liaison officer will act as the supervisor with the consent of the employee's unit/district commander or designee.

Section K.	Permanent Beat Team Work Hours [See Side Letter.]
1.	Procedure for Assignment to Permanent Midnight Shift
a.	Assignment to a midnight shift will be accomplished through volunteers based on seniority as defined in Article 12. All bargaining unit members will be eligible for voluntary placement onto the midnight shift. MPOs shall bid with other MPOs as a class. Sergeants will bid with other sergeants as a class.
Page 19
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July i, 2004 - June 30, 2007
b.	In the event the number of officers volunteering for assignment to the midnight shift is insufficient, involuntary assignments will be made based on inverse seniority beginning with the least senior non-probationary PO1 in the district.
c.	The duration of the midnight shift assignment will be a minimum of six months. Once an officer on the midnight shift meets the minimum time requirement, that officer may transfer off of the shift either at the end of the initial six months or at the end of the fiscal year quarter (i.e., every three months). Requests for transfer off of the midnight shift must occur two weeks prior to the end of any fiscal year quarter and will be honored at the end of the fiscal year quarter that follows the fiscal year quarter in which the request was made.
d.	Assignments onto the midnight shift will only be made on a fiscal year quarterly basis (i.e. every three months) and simultaneously with any departure from the midnight shift. Officers who are assigned to the midnight shift will be given notice of the assignment at the beginning of the fiscal quarter proceeding the quarter of their assignment. However, notice for voluntary transfer onto or off the midnight shift may be waived upon mutual agreement of the officer and the unit commander.
e.	When an officer is permanently transferred off of the midnight shift the effective date of the transfer will be recorded in the officer's unit operating file. An officer who has received a departure date from midnights will not be involuntarily transferred back to the midnight shift if there are officers in the district who have either no departure date or an earlier departure date.
f.	An officer being initially assigned to a district or transferred into the district from another assignment will not be eligible for voluntary or involuntary transfer onto the midnight shift until the next fiscal quarter has passed, except when a vacancy exist, a unit member volunteers for assignment, and there is no waiting list of eligible volunteers.
g.	Any reassignment on or off the midnight shift will occur the first full pay period following the date on which the fiscal year quarter begins unless a vacancy exists.
h.	Bargaining unit employees may be voluntarily or involuntarily transferred due to unforeseen changes in the personnel complement of a shift (e.g.s extended illness or injury) consistent with the provisions of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Such changes shall be consistent with the seniority principles espoused within this section. For purposes of this subsection, the clause "consistent with the seniority principles espoused within this section" means that when an employee is transferred due to unforeseen changes in the personnel complement of a shift, the determination of which employee is transferred shall be governed by seniority principles. This means that assignments to permanent midnight shifts under subsection h. will be made in accordance with the provisions of subsections a., b. and e. of §K. 1,and that the provisions of subsections c., d., and f. do not apply to assignments/transfers made under subsection h. Additionally, consistent with seniority principles, when a vacancy on the permanent midnight shift exists, a bargaining unit employee from outside the district who volunteers may be assigned to the vacancy when there is no waiting list of eligible volunteers within the district.
i.	Work schedules may be changed with three-week notice for the purpose of attendance at training including non-state training except in the case of firearms qualification training as provided under current practice and Article 15 § C.l.C.
2.	Special Skills
a.	The Department needs two certified breathalyzer operators assigned to the midnight shift
Page 20
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July 1,2004 - June 30, 2007
in each district. The two operators will initially be selected from the volunteer list. If there are no breathalyzer operator volunteers from within the district, the department will search countywide for a breathalyzer operator volunteer. If a volunteer from another district is found, that officer will be permanently assigned to the district. The vacant position that is created from the resulting transfer will be filled by the transfer, from the district, of an officer on the basis of inverse seniority. In the event that no volunteers come forward, the operator(s) will be selected by inverse seniority from the station personnel list. The Department will use its best efforts to assign an officer from the midnight shift to the next breathalyzer training school from which vacancies exist. Once this officer is trained and certified, the officer involuntarily transferred to the midnight shift will be transferred back to his/her shift at the end of the fiscal year quarter following the quarter in which the training occurred.
b.	For other specialized skill requirements (i.e., FTO, shift ID, radar operator) the Department will train officers currently on the midnight shift to fill those skill requirements.
c.	No record, except to determine shift assignment eligibility, will be maintained nor will any adverse action result from an employee exercising his or her rights under this section.
3.	Workday/workweek.
a.	The regular workweek for participating unit members shall be a four-day, forty-hour workweek.
b.	If, in order to implement this program, the department must rescind previously approved leave, the department will pay non-reimbursed reservation costs incurred by an employee as the result of the leave rescission.
4.	Miscellaneous
a.	Leave denials will be forwarded each month to police headquarters and then to the FOP on a monthly basis.
b.	There shall be no manipulation of schedules to avoid court overtime for employees assigned to the permanent beat schedule, unless mutually agreed upon by the officer and supervisor.
c.	Any work performed with less than 10 hours off, under the permanent beat schedule, is to be compensated at the overtime rate.
d.	Except as provided herein, all unit members shall be treated in a manner which is not arbitrary or capricious.
e.	The practice of consecutive days off shall continue.
Section L.	Work Rule - Trainer/Trainee Relationships [See Side Letters Ref. Other Work Rules.]
1.	The relationship between the academy instructor/FTO and the trainee will be a teacher/student relationship. Instructors/FTOs shall not engage in an intimate/sexual relationship with a trainee. An instructor/FTO may choose to be reassigned instead of avoiding an intimate/sexual relationship with a trainee. In that event, the following rules must apply:
a.	The instructor/FTO must immediately disclose to his/her supervisor that a conflict may exist as a result of the intimate/sexual relationship prohibition.
b.	In the case of an academy instructor, the instructor shall be temporarily reassigned to another unit for the duration that the trainee's class is in session.
c.	In the case of an FTO, the trainee shall be reassigned to another shift or district. The FTO will not be reassigned nor will he or she be precluded from training or evaluating
Page 21
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July i, 2004 - June 30, 2007
other trainees.
d.	Managers and supervisors must maintain the disclosure in confidence.
2.	No disciplinary action or retaliation must occur as a result of the disclosure.
3.	An instructor/FTO may, in lieu of disclosure, request that he/she be reassigned for personal reasons. An instructor who makes this type of request, shall not be entitled to reassignment upon the completion of the trainee's training. An FTO who makes this type of request will be transferred instead of the trainee and will not be eligible for reassignment onto the shift he or she was transferred from.
4.	If an instructor/FTO who is involved in an intimate/sexual relationship with a trainee does not disclose the potential conflict of interest or request reassignment, the more senior officer will be transferred involuntarily. Such transfer is subject to review under Article 8 Contract Grievance Procedure of this Agreement. Violation of this rule will not result in discipline.
Section M.	Scheduled Overtime for Events.
1.	Each district shall maintain a list of scheduled events such as school functions, sports events and similar events, for which overtime is available. A list separate from the overtime callback list shall be posted to allow unit members to sign up for overtime. Except for events listed in §M.2, selections will be made from the list on the basis of seniority. Unit members scheduled to work regular hours on the date and time of an event shall remain on the list and not be passed over except for the hours they are working. The list shall be exhausted before a volunteer is given a second opportunity to work an overtime event.
2.	Exceptions to the selection rotation are:
a.	The event requires specific skills, knowledge or abilities peculiar to certain officers on or off the list;
b.	The event requires the deployment of four or more officers for bona fide training; or
c.	It is impractical to use the list because the event is spontaneous and unscheduled. In this case every reasonable attempt shall be made to be fair and avoid favoritism or priority to one or more officers. Once this event extends beyond an initial 48 hours, the overtime callback list referred to in section N of this article shall be used to staff the event, until such time as a bona fide event list can be circulated to members as described in §M. 1 above, and staffing made by seniority from that list.
Section N.	Overtime Callback Lists
1.	There shall be two lists which are used by department designee(s) to fill unit staffing shortages on an overtime basis. Employees who are the rank of MPO and below will be placed on one list. Sergeants will be placed on a second list. A "group page" call back list will be maintained in units with employees who have specialized skills, training, or expertise (i.e., K9, ERT, CRU) to facilitate an immediate response to a call back request. Group paging refers to an electronic message sent out simultaneously to a designated group. For the purposes of "paging", the designated groups will be equitably rotated in lieu of seniority. If a page does not result in a response from a sufficient number of officer(s) from the designated group, the next group may be paged until a sufficient number of officer(s) respond.
2.	A sign-up list shall be circulated within a unit at the beginning of every fiscal year quarter (January, April, July, October) so that interested eligible employees may voluntarily sign up so that they can be contacted regarding overtime callback work. Volunteers will then be placed on the list that is appropriate fortheir rank.
3.	Employees on each list shall be rotated and ranked by seniority as defined by Article 12
Page 22
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July 1, 2004 - June 30, 2007
Seniority.
Page 23
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July 1, 2004 - June 30, 2007
4.	The entire list will be exhausted before any individual is requested to work a second time, unless the nature of the assignment requires specific skills, knowledge or abilities peculiar to certain officers on or off the list.
5.	An employee who, on four occasions within a quarter declines an offer to work overtime, shall not be eligible to sign up for overtime callback eligibility for the remainder of the quarter.
6.	Participants on the list shall be used as needed by the department designee.
7.	Other callback lists will be utilized only after the unit level callback list has been exhausted.
8.	The establishment of a callback list shall not preclude the use of on-duty officers who may be required to work beyond the normal shift as occasions arise.
9.	Employees who are assigned to a district during a quarter shall be immediately eligible to be placed on the overtime callback list.
Section O.	Temporarily Assigned Employee ’s Eligibility to Work Overtime
1.	When an employee voluntarily accepts a temporary assignment of indefinite duration, in a unit comprised of officers who are not eligible to participate in the employee's permanently assigned unit's overtime callback program, the employee shall be removed from his/her permanently assigned unit's overtime callback lists once the assignment has exceeded thirty (30) days.
2.	When an employee voluntarily accepts a temporary assignment of a known duration that is in excess of thirty (30) days, in a unit comprised of officers who are not eligible to participate in the employee's permanently assigned unit's overtime callback program, the employee shall be removed from his/her permanently assigned unit's overtime callback lists on the effective date of the transfer.
The employee is eligible to be called for overtime work during the period between the date the employee is advised of the transfer and the effective date of the transfer, so long as the overtime work occurs before the transfer date.
3.	Any employee who voluntarily accepts a less than thirty-day temporary assignment shall remain on his/her permanently assigned unit's overtime callback lists during the period of reassignment.
4.	All temporary assignments shall be considered to be of indefinite duration unless the notice of reassignment specifies otherwise.
5.	Upon completion of the temporary assignment, the employee shall be returned to the permanently assigned unit's overtime callback lists and his/her seniority shall be determinative of his/her order in the rotation.
6.	An employee who has been involuntarily and temporarily reassigned shall be immediately eligible to be placed on the new assignment's overtime callback lists for the duration of the reassignment, regardless of the length of the reassignment. If the employee is involuntarily transferred from an assignment with an overtime callback list to an assignment without an overtime callback list, the employee shall be placed on the overtime callback list of a unit similar to the one from which reassigned.
Section P. Assignments to Temporary Units and Temporary Assignments. Unit members assigned to temporary units are eligible to remain in those units for the duration of the unit or may otherwise be transferred in accordance with Article 25 Transfers, of this agreement. Temporary assignments to established units shall not exceed 12 months in duration.
Page 24
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July i, 2004 - June 30, 2007
Section 0. Rights of Unit Members Transferred. If, due to administrative reorganization, position abolishment, lack of funding, change in work program/plan/design, technological change, or need for additional personnel at another work site, one or more employees need to be transferred, such transfers shall be made on the basis of inverse seniority within the unit. If, within two years, additional personnel are needed at the original assignment, previously transferred unit members shall be recalled on the basis of seniority within the unit.
Section R. Permanent Day and Evening Shift. Should the parties agree to extend the Pilot Permanent Day and Evening Shift, such a schedule shall be established pursuant to the procedures (MOU in Germantown District 6) agreed upon by the parties. [Sixth District Pilot Provisions Follow. See Side letters.]
1.	Assignment to District and Bidding for Hours
a.	To the extent possible, volunteers from the Germantown District will be used to staff the PO1, PO2, PO3, and MPO positions in the Sixth District. Selections will be made on the basis of seniority, and MPOs shall bid with other MPOs as a class. In the event that the number of volunteers from the Germantown District is less than the number of vacancies to be fdled, the Department will seek volunteers from the other districts. Identification of these volunteers may be done simultaneous with the solicitation of the Germantown District volunteers and the Department may maintain a standing list of countywide volunteers. Such volunteers shall be eligible for assignment on the basis of seniority and MPOs shall bid with other MPOS as a class. Before offering these volunteers a position, Germantown officers who are subject to an involuntary assignment into the Sixth District because of their inverse seniority, will first be offered an assignment in the Sixth District. If the involuntary transfer-eligible Germantown officer declines the assignment in the Sixth District, then the volunteer will be transferred to the Sixth District and the involuntary transfer-eligible Germantown officer will be assigned to the district where the volunteer transferred from, however, in the case of multiple vacancies, Germantown officers who are subject to an involuntary transfer out of the district shall identify their preference from amongst the districts that the volunteers are drawn from. Assignments to preferred districts shall be done on the basis of seniority.
b.	The involuntary transfer-eligible Germantown officer will remain in the district that the volunteer transferred from until the volunteer officer leaves the Sixth District or the pilot program ends, whichever is first. While the involuntary transfer-eligible Germantown officer is in the district that the volunteer officer transferred from, the Germantown officer may not request a transfer to the Germantown District, but s/he may request a transfer to any other district. If the pilot program is extended and the volunteer is still assigned to the Sixth District, the involuntary transfer-eligible Germantown officer shall be considered as permanently assigned to the district that the volunteer transferred from, and from that point on, s/he may request reassignment back to the Germantown district. Such requests for reassignment shall be given priority consideration over any other requests that the Department may have for reassignment to the Germantown District.
c.	The Unit Commander shall assign Sergeants to the Sixth District on the basis of bona fide operational needs. When two or more sergeants are deemed equally qualified to meet the bona fide operational needs, selection shall be made on the basis of seniority.
d.	To the extent possible, the assignment of day and evening shift hours will be accomplished based upon employees' stated preferences. Employee preferences for shift assignment shall be made on the basis of seniority and position availability. POls, PO2s, PO3s and MPOs will be eligible for voluntary shift assignment. MPO's shall bid with other MPO's as a class.
e.	Upon the implementation of this program or in instances when two or more vacancies
Page 25
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July i, 2004 - June 30, 2007
exist at the sergeant's level, sergeants shall bid with other sergeants as a class. When bidding with other sergeants, a sergeant's seniority shall be based upon his/her date of rank.
f.	In the event the number of officers volunteering is insufficient to meet the deployment needs of specific shifts, involuntary assignments onto non-rotating day and evening shifts will be made based on inverse seniority and shall be selected from the Germantown and Sixth District.
g.	For POls, PO2s, PO3s, and MPOs, the duration of a non-rotating day or evening shift assignment will be a minimum of 3 months. Once an officer on a non-rotating shift meets the minimum time requirement, that officer may transfer off of the shift. Such requests for transfer off of a non-rotating shift must occur four weeks prior to the end of any quarter and will be honored at the beginning of the next quarter. Voluntary transferees who request a transfer off a permanent shift, shall be placed in a vacant position. If no vacancy exists, the request will not be honored until a vacancy occurs.
h.	Except as provided i n " l .k or another provision of the collective bargaining agreement, assignments onto a non-rotating shift will only be made on a quarter basis, i.e. every three months, and simultaneous with any departure from a non-rotating shift. Any assignment on or off a non-rotating day or evening shift will occur at the beginning of the first full pay period following the date on which the quarter begins, unless a vacancy exists as described in Tf 1 .k, or as otherwise provided in the collective bargaining agreement. Officers who are assigned to a non-rotating day or evening shift will be given notice of the assignment three weeks before their assignment begins. An affected officer may agree to waive this notice requirement.
i.	When an officer who was involuntarily assigned to a permanent day or evening shift, is permanently transferred off of a non-rotating shift, the duration of the assignment and the effective date of the transfer will be recorded in the officer's unit operating file. The officer will retain his/her place in the involuntary assignment eligibility rotation, but s/he will be credited for fifty percent of the involuntary assignment served under this program. An officer will not be involuntarily transferred back to any non-rotating shift if there are other officers in the Germantown or Sixth District who have either no departure date from an involuntary shift assignment or an earlier departure date from an involuntary shift assignment. However, an officer who has earned six credited months of involuntary assignment time shall not be selected for another involuntary assignment until all other officers have earned at least six months of involuntary assignment time. The intent of this section is to ensure that all officers have had the same opportunity to be selected for an involuntary assignment before an officer is subjected to such consideration an additional time.
j.	If, at a time other than the beginning of a quarter, an officer is initially assigned to the Sixth District or is transferred into the Sixth District from another assignment, s/he will be assigned to a non-rotating shift that has a vacancy.
k.	Notwithstanding 1 .h, bargaining unit employees may be voluntarily or involuntarily transferred due to unforeseen changes in the personnel complement of a non-rotating day or evening shift (e.g., extended illness or injury, or employee reassignment) consistent with the provisions of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Such changes shall be made consistent with the seniority principles espoused within this section.
2.	Special Skills
a.	So long as the Sixth District shares a radio channel with the Germantown district, involuntary assignments onto a non-rotating day and evening shift will not be made based upon an officer's intoximeter skill. When the department learns that a separate
Page 26
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July 1, 2004 - June 30, 2007
radio channel will be assigned to the Sixth District, it will use its best efforts to assign Sixth District officers to the next available intoximeter training.
b.	For other specialized skill requirements, i.e. FTO, shift ID, radar operator, the Department will train officers currently on a non-rotating day and evening shift to fill those skill requirements.
c.	No record will be maintained nor will any adverse action result from an employee exercising his or her rights under this Section.
3.	Workday/Workweek
a.	The regular workweek for participating unit members shall be a four-day, forty-hour workweek.
b.	If, in order to implement this program, the department must rescind previously approved leave, the department will pay non-reimbursed reservation costs incurred by an employee as the result of the leave rescission
4.	Miscellaneous
a.	Leave denials will be forwarded each month to police headquarters and then to the FOP on a monthly basis.
b.	There shall be no manipulation of schedules to avoid court overtime for employees, unless mutually agreed upon by the officer and supervisor.
c.	Any work performed with less than 10 hours off, under the non-rotating day and evening shift schedule, is to be compensated at the overtime rate.
d.	Except as provided herein, all unit members shall be treated in a manner which is not arbitrary or capricious.
e.	The practice of consecutive days off shall continue.
f.	In the event a sergeant has a dispute regarding the application of this agreement, the sergeant may appeal the matter via the grievance procedure described in Article 8 Contract Grievance Procedure, of the collective bargaining agreement between the County and the FOP. [This subsection predates the 7/1/02 effective date of the contract.]
Section S. Wearing of Bullet Proof Vests. An Officer shall wear the vest during ad hoc, high-risk assignments, but shall not be required to wear them while waiting to be activated for such actual assignment. For the purposes of this section only, high risk involves other than normal risk or calls for service, and includes but is not limited to civil disturbances, raids, and hostage situations. New vests issued during the term of this agreement shall provide Level II protection.
Section T. Permanent Day and Evening Shifts. Patrol, first responders (excluding traffic and SAT officers) shall be assigned to either a permanent day or evening shift. Upon successful conclusion of the Field Training Program, Probationary POls will be assigned to a shift based upon bona fide operational, training and developmental needs, as reasonably determined by the Employer. When there is a waiting list of volunteers for shift hours and a probationary P01 is pending placement on a shift, the probationary P01 may be assigned the shift hours before a volunteer.
1.	Procedure for Day/Evening Intra-Station Transfers.
a.	Transfer requests will be given priority according to seniority, as defined by Article 12, Seniority!, subject to the following conditions:
i.	there is a vacancy on a shift (with the desired hours) that the Department is seeking to fill;
Page 27
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July i, 2004 - June 30, 2007
ii.	it does not result in a staffing overage or shortage, as reasonably determined by the Employer; and
iii.	it does not result in the involuntary transfer of another officer.
b.	Transfer off the midnight shift shall follow the procedures outlined in Article 15, Section K of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The transferred midnight officer will be assigned to day or evening shift hours based upon his/her shift hours of preference whenever a vacancy exists on any shift with the preferred shift hours. If there is no vacancy on any shifts with preferred shift hours and if there are officers junior to the midnight officer already assigned to the preferred shift hours, the most junior officer may be involuntarily transferred to accommodate the midnight officer's preference. If there are no officers junior to the midnight officer, the midnight officer will be assigned to shift hours based upon bona fide operational need.
c.	When an officer who was involuntarily transferred to a permanent day or evening shift is permanently transferred off of a shift, the effective date of the transfer will be recorded in the officer's unit operating file. An officer will not be involuntarily transferred an additional time to any permanent day or evening shift if there are other officers in the district who have either no departure date from an involuntary shift assignment or an earlier departure date from an involuntary shift assignment. For purposes of this section, an involuntary transfer is defined as an aggregate of six months served involuntarily. Effectively, every officer must serve a total of six months of involuntary transfer time before being subject to another involuntary transfer to a day or evening shift. The intent of this section is to ensure that all officers have had the same opportunity to be selected for an involuntary assignment before an officer is subjected to such consideration an additional time.
d.	If, pursuant to the inverse seniority rotation, a midnight officer is subject to involuntary assignment to a permanent day or evening shift and the resulting vacancy would result in an additional transfer of another officer, the midnight officer will be bypassed for the selection. The bypassed midnight officer will remain at the top of the rotation and shall remain eligible for the next involuntary transfer assignment that arises.
A midnight officer may be involuntarily transferred to a permanent day or evening shift if the vacancy created on the midnight shift goes unfilled, or it is backfilled by another officer's voluntary transfer to the midnight shift. When the midnight officer's involuntary transfer ends, both officers (the midnight officer and the officer voluntarily backfilling) will return to their original shift hours (day, evening, or midnight) unless: a vacancy exists on the midnight shift enabling the backfill officer to remain on midnights (subject to the provisions of l.a. above), or the involuntarily transferred midnight officer does not choose to return to the midnight shift.
Except, however, if an officer who is less senior to the officer who backfills the midnight vacancy is voluntarily transferred to the midnight shift simultaneous with or after the officer who originally backfilled the vacancy, the junior, later-transferred officer will return to his/her original assignment when the midnight officer returns from the permanent day or evening shift unless there exists an additional midnight vacancy for the junior/later-transferred officer.
e.	Notice of all schedule changes will be in compliance with Section C of this Article.
2.	Transfers to a District.
a.	Officers who wish to transfer to a district should submit a District Transfer Request Form directly to the Field Services Bureau Administration.
b.	Once the transfer request has been submitted, the officer is subject to being transferred to
Page 28
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July 1, 2004 - June 30, 2007
the requested district with three weeks notice.
c.	It is the responsibility of the officer who is requesting the transfer to rescind the transfer prior to the date when s/he is given three weeks notice of the effective date of the transfer.
d.	The individual transfer request will be given priority according to the date the transfer request was received in the Field Services Bureau. The transfer request will be filed with all other transfer requests by the location of the requested district(s). A copy of the District Transfer Request Form will be forwarded to the requesting officer and his/her district commander.
e.	If an officer is initially assigned to a district or is transferred into a district from another assignment, he/she will be assigned to a permanent shift. An officer who was initially assigned or was transferred into a district will be eligible to request a transfer to another shift assignment.
3.	Special Skills.
a.	The Department will seek intoximeter operator volunteers for assignment onto each of the shifts with priority given to the evening and midnight shifts. If there are no intoximeter operator volunteers from within the district, the Department will search countywide for an intoximeter operator volunteer for the available shift hours. If a volunteer from another district is found and based upon bona fide operational need as reasonably determined by the Employer, a shortage is not created within the officer's originating district, that officer will be permanently assigned to the district that is in need of an intoximeter operator. In the event that no volunteers that meet the above criteria from other districts come forward, the operator(s) will be selected by inverse seniority from the station personnel list. The Department will use its best efforts to assign an officer from the shift on which an intoximeter operator was involuntarily transferred onto, to the next intoximeter training school for which vacancies exist. Once this officer is trained and certified, the officer who was involuntarily transferred will be transferred back to his/her shift.
b.	For other specialized skill requirements, i.e. FTO, shift ID, laser/radar operator, the Department will train officers currently on the shift to fill those skill requirements.
c.	Except for tracking purposes, no record will be maintained nor will any adverse action result from an employee exercising his or her rights under this Section.
4.	Workday/'Workweek. The regular workweek for participating unit members shall be a four day, forty hour workweek.
5.	Miscellaneous.
a.	Leave denials will be forwarded each month to police headquarters and then to the FOP on a monthly basis.
b.	There shall be no manipulation of schedules to avoid court overtime for employees, unless mutually agreed upon by the officer and supervisor.
c.	Any regular work performed with less than 10 hours off, under the permanent day and evening shift schedule, is to be compensated at the overtime rate.
d.	Except as provided herein, all unit members shall be treated in a manner which is not arbitrary or capricious.
e.	The practice of consecutive days off shall continue except when transitioning to and from weekend coverage. Weekends off shall rotate among shifts so as to be equitably distributed.

The County shall provide a supplement to the standard Worker's Compensation benefit so that the gross pay of employees is equal to eighty-five percent (85%) of his/her regular gross pay.

Gross pay shall not be modified for purposes of calculating final or final average earnings for retirement purposes. This section shall not adversely affect any other calculation or benefit.

Section C. Subrogation.

In the event that the employee's private provider concludes that the employee is cleared for use of respiratory protection equipment, contrary to the EME's determination, the EME will arrange for an independent medical evaluation at the Employer's expense, to determine the employee's medical fitness to use respiratory protection equipment.
9.	Bargaining unit employees who have not been medically cleared and therefore are unable to utilize Department issued respiratory protection equipment will be reasonably accommodated.

1.	Officers will not take the vehicle out of the County except on official business or with the authorization of their district commander. The chief of police or his/her designee may grant continuing authorization to officers attending undergraduate or graduate programs in the Metropolitan area; however, other types of authorization will be on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the chief of police or his/her designee.

Assignments made under this provision shall be made pursuant to Article 12 Seniority.
12.	Officers permanently transferred from an assignment requiring the use of a marked vehicle to an assignment requiring the use of an unmarked car, or vice-versa, or who otherwise become ineligible for the program, will turn the vehicle into the department's fleet coordinator for reassignment.

16.	Officers will not allow off-duty use of their PPV by officers who are not eligible for the program.
17.	No unauthorized personnel are permitted to operate the PPV except in an emergency.

FOP organizational emblems may be
Page 63
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July 1, 2004 - June 30, 2007
attached to the PPV. Unauthorized or nonconforming items will be removed from the vehicle.
Section H.	PPV Operating Procedures
1.	While using the vehicle off-duty, officers will monitor the police radio on the frequency for the district in which the vehicle is being operated. Officers need not advise the dispatcher when going in or out of service; however, the officer will advise the dispatcher when responding to a call.

5.	All officers will use seat belts when operating or riding in County motor vehicles, except when an officer's duties necessitate frequent exiting from the vehicle (i.e., checking stores within the same shopping complex). Officers will ensure that all passengers in the cruiser have buckled their seat belts prior to the vehicle being moved and continue to use the seat belt at all times while they are passengers in the moving vehicle. Only those safety seats approved by the Department of Transportation will be used to restrain infants and toddlers. Safety seats will be used consistent with State law and will be removed from the passenger from the passenger compartment when not in use.
6.	Minor incidents, to include disabled vehicles, stranded motorists, and citizens in need of assistance, encountered while operating a PPV off-duty, will be handled and cleared by the off-duty officer. In situations which dictate the writing of a report by the off-duty officer, the report will be completed as soon as possible. Completed off-duty initiated reports may be placed in any district station report tray which is convenient to the officer. All off-duty reports will bear the initials OD' in front of the officer's ID number in the appropriate space.
7.	Animals will not be transported in the PPV except in unusual circumstances.
8.	Traffic collisions encountered by officers off-duty in a PPV will be handled in accordance with departmental policy, except for the following types of collisions: fatal accidents, serious personal injury collisions when the victim is transported; hit and run collisions when evidence or witnesses exist; and collisions involving government-owned vehicles. These collisions will be handled by on-duty units. The procedure for submitting the collision report is the same as that for the event in § H.6. Additionally, the officer generating the report will be responsible for completing the log-mile references.
9.	Officers using a citizen's band radio while on-duty or while acting in an official capacity will use the department's FCC call sign - KBTW 9046 - identifying themselves as the Montgomery County Police and including their off-duty ID number (e.g,, KBTW 9046, Montgomery County Police Unit, O.D.302). Officers will monitor Channel 9 and respond to emergency calls for assistance occurring in their assigned patrol area. Channel 9 will be used solely for emergency communications or for communications necessary to render assistance to a motorist. All radio transmissions will be made in a professional manner and in accordance with Section 95 of the FCC rules and regulations. The officer's primary
Page 64
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July i, 2004 - June 30, 2007
responsibility is to the police communications system and attention to or operation of CB equipment or mobile telephones must not interfere with this primary responsibility.
Section I.	Overtime Compensation
1.	Consistent with Article 15 Hours and Working Conditions §A.l.a, overtime compensation will be granted (within budget limitations) for that period of time in excess of two (2) hours to participating officers who must work on an incident while in their off-duty PPV status. Response to an incident while in an off-duty PPV status does not constitute an official callback as defined in this Agreement.
2.	When responding to calls off-duty involving a felony or serious misdemeanor, it may be necessary for the officer to handle the call in order to best preserve and maintain the chain of custody of evidence. Authorization for an off-duty officer to remain on the scene and/or handle the call will be granted by the on-duty shift supervisor.
3.	When submitting an overtime request on MCP #44, the officer will strike the words "call back’’ on line #2 and insert the name of the supervisor who authorized the overtime. The words "off-duty PPV response’’ will be written next to the supervisor's name on the same line.

If an officer not participating in the PPV program or an officer who is a PPV program participant, but is temporarily without the use of the PPV, uses his/her private vehicle for such travel, the officer shall be reimbursed and insured for such travel at the rate specified in Article 23 § A.6 "Local Travel" of this Agreement.
Section O. Replacement of Vehicles.
1.	Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this section, when an officer becomes eligible for the PPV program, the officer will be issued a vehicle consistent with current practice. [See Side Letter.]

a. SID b. SWAT c. SAT d. Forensic Services e. School Safety f. Personnel-Recruiters g. Canine
h. Other units where the car is uniquely equipped for use in that assignment
Vehicles assigned to officers transferred to the unit with similar vehicles will be retained by the officers.

Page 67
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July i, 2004 - June 30, 2007

Section P. Training
1.	Within 7 calendar days of the receipt of a new vehicle officers must schedule driver training with the Training Division.
2.	If the training is not successfully completed, within 90 days of issuance, the officer will return the vehicle to the Department's Fleet Manager until the training is completed.
Section 0. Single Officer Fleet Vehicle Program (See Side Letter)
1.	For the duration of this Agreement, the County will use its best efforts to make single officer fleet vehicles available to all officers who are not eligible for the PPV program because they do not reside within Montgomery County. Such vehicles must be appropriate (marked or unmarked) for the officer's duty assignment.
2.	The County will use its best efforts during the term of this agreement to allocate cars among the districts so as to make it possible for the most senior officers to be assigned single officer fleet vehicles and to make vehicles available to eligible officers (subject to Council imposed budget limitations and service needs). If any officers within the same unit are required to share a vehicle, they shall be selected pursuant to the seniority provisions of the agreement, in inverse order. The sharing of vehicles may be on account of any bona fide reason (including insufficient unassigned vehicles in the Department's fleet to provide a PPV to all eligible officers). [The Department desires to be able to make assignments based upon operational necessity. Example-if the junior-most officers work the same shift, then the sharing of vehicles is not a viable option. Therefore, a junior officer other than the second most junior officer would need to be designated as having to share a vehicle with the most junior officer.]
3.	An officer not eligible for the PPV program assigned a single officer fleet vehicle may use the vehicle in the same manner as a PPV may be used, so long as such use (except as otherwise provided in this Agreement), is confined within the borders of Montgomery County. Single officer fleet vehicles will be parked in Montgomery County at the location of the officer's duty assignment, a district station or 24-hour police facility, a 24-hour fire station (except Hyattstown), a secure federal facility if allowed by the facility, or other secure facility mutually agreed upon by the parties.
4.	Certain unit members are currently assigned fleet vehicles for single officer use in connection with specific duty assignments. The Department will continue to assign fleet vehicles for single officer use regarding these specific duty assignments in accordance with that pre-existing practice.

The formula for providing the special within-grade advancement for eligible bargaining unit members will be based on one additional 3.5 percent step for each year of qualifying experience, up to a maximum of 5 years of qualifying experience (5 steps).
The calculation for the special within grade salary advancement for a current eligible bargaining unit member will be based on the employee's length of eligible prior police/law
Page 69
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July i, 2004 - June 30, 2007
enforcement experience, his/her actual employment date with the Montgomery County Department of Police, and the effective date of this agreement.

Increment steps to recognize prior qualifying experience will only be awarded in 3.5 percent increments. Partial years of qualifying service will be rounded up or down for purposes of compensation (service) credit.
The number of annual increment step adjustments received since April 11, 1994 by an eligible bargaining unit employee, will be deducted from the total number of special step adjustments the employee would have received had this program been in effect at the time of his/her appointment.
All salary adjustments are effective April 11,1999. There will be no retroactive pay or benefit for any period of time or experience prior to the designated program effective date.
This program does not provide for the lateral transfer of rank, rights, or seniority.
3.	Responsibility for program administration. The Police Personnel Division will be responsible for the administration of the lateral entry program.
The Police Personnel Division will identify all current bargaining unit members that have been employed since April 11, 1994, in order to determine eligibility for a special salary adjustment based on qualifying prior police/law enforcement experience.
The Police Personnel Division will be responsible for computing and submitting all required documentation for the initiation of the special salary adjustment for all eligible bargaining unit members.
The Police Personnel Division will provide the FOP and all current eligible bargaining unit members with a copy of the compensation tracking form (Form 85A- See Attached) utilized for the compensation calculation.

Section C. Furlough.
1.	When applicable. A furlough is a permanent relief from duty and loss of pay for hours of services which would otherwise be performed by members of the bargaining unit and which is required by the chief administrative officer due to lack of funds or work. Lost furlough pay must not be made up by the same or other employees in overtime hours or compensatory time. All reductions in salary and furlough leaves must take place within the "furlough period'’ designated by the chief administrative officer, ordinarily the period between the effective date of the chief administrative officer's determination to relieve members of the bargaining unit from duties due to lack of funds or work and the end of the fiscal year in which that determination is made. It is agreed that the County's determination to require the bargaining unit to make up for services lost by virtue of a furlough by reducing the bargaining unit members' opportunity to be absent on authorized leave of any other kind (other than compensatory leave) during the furlough period establishes a violation of this Agreement for which all affected unit members will be compensated by a restoration of salary denied pursuant to §C.2 hereof.
2.	Reduction in Total County Salary. Whenever the County determines to furlough employees for one or more eight hour days during a fiscal year the base salary as provided in the Collective Bargaining Agreement then in effect shall be reduced for all bargaining unit members by an amount equal to eight hours pay for each such furlough day. The amount of each reduction shall be spread evenly over the pay periods remaining in the fiscal year during which the furlough day(s) occur(s). The reduction or reductions shall cease and the appropriate level of base salary shall be restored at the end of the fiscal year in which the furlough day(s) occurred.
3.	Compensatory Leave and Furlough Days. The County shall grant each unit member whose salary it reduces pursuant to 2, eight (8) hours of compensatory time for each eight (8) hour furlough day the County decrees. The department may schedule the use of furlough time for the mutual convenience of the department and the member, or may direct a member to use furlough compensatory time on a day or days selected by the department, provided, in either event, that the use does not conflict with that or any other unit member's right to take annual or other leaves pursuant to this Agreement, established practices, or applicable law. In other respects, Compensatory Leave and Annual Leave shall be treated as provided in Articles 18 and 21 of this Agreement.
4.	Effect On Other Benefits and Payments. The County agrees that no reduction in salary provided for herein shall reduce the amount of the pension payable upon retirement of any unit member. It is further agreed that the provisions governing payment for unused compensatory time upon retirement or separation shall apply to the compensatory time granted pursuant to this Article and that the reduction in salary agreed upon in this Article shall not reduce any other payments or benefits, including but not limited to service increments, awards,
Page 77
Collective Bargaining Agreement -July 1, 2004 - June 30, 2007
salary upon promotion or demotion, or any other pay amounts based on the employee's base salary which would have been due the officer by law or under an applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement.
5.	Effect on Secondary Employment. During a furlough period and in accordance with existing regulations, if there is no question regarding conflict of interest, the personnel director shall act upon a request for approval of outside employment with a duration of six (6) weeks or less within seven (7) days after the member submits his/her application to the personnel director.
6.	When Furlough May be Implemented. The salary reduction provided for herein shall be restored and all compensatory leave balances shall be appropriately adjusted if an appropriate third party determines that the County did not relieve the members of the bargaining unit from duty or did not do so due to lack of funds or work.
7.	Notice of Furlough. Written notice shall be given to FOP Lodge 35, by Certified Mail, thirty (30) days prior to instituting a furlough provision.
8.	Administration. All furlough provisions shall be administered equitably within the unit and, to the extent not inconsistent with this Article and otherwise applicable to members of the bargaining unit, the provisions of §§ 2.0 - 3.8 of Administrative Procedure 4-31, dated December 4, 1991, are incorporated herein by reference.

1.	Section 33-35. Definitions. A definition of "picked-up contributions” is added, references to picked-up contributions are added to the definitions of "accumulated contributions” and "member contributions”, and the definition of "regular earnings” is amended by adding a paragraph which states that the maximum compensation which can be used as regular earnings for the determination of benefits is limited by §401(a)( 17) of the Internal Revenue Code, and beginning on July 1, 1996, the limitation is $150,000.

Whenever a Group F disability retiree's earnings capacity is changed, the amount of non-service connected disability retirement pension may be further modified by the chief administrative officer. The amount of the revised pension must not exceed the original disability retirement pension plus cost-of-living increases or an amount which, when added to the amount eamable by the member, equals 20% above the maximum earnings of the occupational classification from which disabled. For the purpose of this subsection, “disability pension” is the amount of pension payable without the election of a pension payment option.
The parties further agree that these provisions shall remain a part of the contract.
