1ARTICLE I RECOGNITION
1.1	Scope of Recognition
A.	Recognition
The College hereby recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining representative of the Unit employees with respect to rates of pay, wage, hours of employment and other terms and conditions of employment covered by this Agreement, for employees in occupations covered by the certification issued by the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board at No. PERA-R-1264-W.
This recognition applies only to those employees within occupations (or similar occupations) in which employees were permanently employed when the eligibility list for the certification election in Case No. PERA-R-1264-W was prepared and approved.
However, the College agrees that regular part-time employees, that is employees who are hired indefinitely on a part-time basis, shall be covered by this recognition clause.
B.	Excluded Persons
Seasonal, irregular, temporary replacements and temporary full-time employees are excluded from this Article, as are other occupations which are dissimilar from those set forth in A above.
C.	The College shall not employ persons defined in Para. B of this Article in a manner to subvert the contract standards and/or requirements.
The College shall have the right to use temporary employees for any of the following purposes or circumstances:
1.	For a period of three months or less. The College will not re-cycle different temporary employees in the same job position, in order to avoid this limitation.
2.	For special projects, which is work of a non-routine nature, the College will notify the Union of the job. Temporary employees may be used for a period of up to six months which may be extended for up to an additional six months with the consent of the Union.
3.	To replace a full-time or regular part-time employee who is on a leave of absence for the duration of the leave of absence. Regular part-time employees system-wide shall have a five day opportunity to bid on positions which are temporarily vacant as a result of a leave of absence of a regular full-time or part-time employee, prior to filling the vacancy with a temporary employee. Temporary postings will follow policy of Article XI Seniority, 11.2 Permanent Vacancies.
At the time the College employs a temporary employee, the College will give the Campus Steward a copy of the Request for Temporary Staff form relating to the temporary employee. This also includes persons who are provided through a temporary employment agency; provided, that the Union’s agreement to allow the College to contract with temporary employment agencies, as set forth herein, does not constitute a waiver of the subcontracting of any other bargaining unit work. The Request for Temporary Staff form shall include the name of the person, the hours of work, the reasons for the temporary employment, the nature of any special project, the department and the employee replaced (if applicable).
The College and the Union shall have a labor-management meeting on not less than a quarterly basis to review issues relating to the College’s use of temporary employees.
If a temporary employee works more than 1,000 hours in a calendar year, the position will be reclassified as a regular part-time position and it will be posted system-wide. This provision shall not apply to a temporary employee who is replacing a full-time or regular part-time employee on a leave of absence or to temporary employees who are working on a special project.
D.	The Union retains the right to grieve violations of the provisions of this Agreement relating to the Phone-In Center, temporary employees, and temporary employment agencies.
4
E.	The parties agree they will provide each other with non-confidential information which relates to the administration of this agreement.
1.2	Grant and Student Development Funded Positions
A.	In the event the College receives money from a granting agency in a grantor-grantee relationship and if such grant requires personnel procedures or payments differing from those contained in this Agreement, then provisions in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding the grant requirements shall apply.
B.	An employee who fills a grant-funded position (with fringe benefits) or student development funded position (with fringe benefits) shall be covered by all of the seniority provisions of Article 11; but shall not be entitled to utilize the provisions of Sections 11.3 and 11.4.

Informal Resolution - The College and the Union agree that a number of potential grievances may be avoided if the employee and his/her supervisor are able to discuss and resolve problems orally. This discussion may include, at the option of the employee, the employee's steward.
5
In the event these discussions do not result in a satisfactory solution, or the parties are unable to discuss the matter within five (5) working days of the time the grievant knew or should have known or been aware of the existence of the situation, a formal grievance may be initiated using the procedures listed below.
Level One - All grievances must be initiated within fifteen (15) working days from the time the grievant reasonably should have known or been aware of the existence of the situation giving rise to the alleged grievance, or within five (5) working days from the date of an attempted informal resolution.

The employer and the Union shall develop a list of seven (7) impartial arbitrators mutually agreeable to both parties. The parties shall then select an available arbitrator from this list of arbitrators within five (5) working days after the notice of appeal to arbitration.
The decision of the impartial arbitrator shall be final and binding in accordance with the terms of Section 903 of Act 195 of 1970.
The arbitrator is hereby authorized only to clarify and interpret the express terms, provisions, or clauses of this Agreement, and the arbitrator, shall not have the authority to enlarge, alter, modify, delete or change the express terms, provisions or clauses of this Agreement.
In a discipline case, the arbitrator shall have the authority to sustain the discipline, or if she/he finds that the discipline was not proper, she/he shall have the authority to order reinstatement and compensation for time lost in whole or in part, or to find that the penalty imposed upon the employee was too severe and award a less severe penalty.
3.4	Miscellaneous Provisions
A.	It is agreed that any grievance must be presented under the provisions of this article promptly and within the prescribed time limitations.

In the event the College does not hold meetings or provide responses within the time limitations provided, the grievance shall be automatically advanced to the next step as though such meetings and/or responses has been held.
6
B.	Conferences, meetings and hearings held pursuant to the grievance procedure shall be set by mutual agreement.

9.2	Removal
Written warnings and reprimands for minor disciplinary offenses, including but not limited to tardiness and absenteeism, shall be removed from the employee’s personnel folder after a period of one year, provided that there has not been any reoccurrence of the conduct, or similar conduct, which was the subject of the written warning or reprimand.

In the event any employee refuses to perform any such work under this section, she/he shall receive no pay for work not performed, unless the work is found to be unsafe. In the event the work is found to be unsafe either
10
through the grievance procedure or by an arbitrator, the employee shall receive pay for all time lost as a result of not performing such work.
No employee shall utilize this provision for the purpose of causing any concerted activity to refuse to perform work or withdrawal of services.
11ARTICLE XI SENIORITY
11.1	Accrual of Seniority
Each employee shall have collegewide, group and classification seniority. Seniority shall be based on the length of continuous service with the College, the length of continuous service within the group and the length of continuous service within the job classification respectively. Seniority shall be accumulated during absence due to illness, layoff, or leave of absence, as long as said seniority is not terminated in accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement.
11.2	Permanent Vacancies
A.	In the event there is a permanent new job or the employer needs additional employees in an existing job, such vacancies shall be posted on bulletin boards at locations accessible to all employees in the bargaining unit, and on the CCAC web-site, if available, for a period of ten (10) consecutive work days. The job bidding announcement shall provide at least the location of the job, a general description of the duties, minimum requirements, the rate of pay, and the shift (if required).
B.	Regular bargaining unit qualified employees bidding for such vacancy with the most collegewide seniority shall be given the first opportunity to be considered for such vacancy. The job will be awarded to the senior employee bidding, only if she/he meets the following criteria:
1.	Is at least relatively equal in qualifications and ability.
2.	Meets any special physical requirements of the job.
3.	Demonstrates a satisfactory attendance record.

C.	In the event the senior qualified employee bidding for such vacancy is already classified and working in the same classification as the vacancy, such employee's bid shall not be unreasonably denied. Any employee who successfully bids within his/her same classification shall not be permitted to bid for an additional job within his/her same classification for one (1) year.
D.	Any employee who successfully bids into a higher or equal paying position shall receive the appropriate rate of pay based on years of service and the employee's hire date for the new position. Any employee who was red-circled in his/her previous position and who successfully bids into an equal or higher paying classification, shall be entitled to keep his/her red-circled rate, if it is higher than the standard rate for his/her new job.
E.	The College shall have the right to request job-related assessment for all internal and external applicants in connection with filling a permanent vacancy. An internal applicant who refuses to be assessed may be denied the job for that reason.
11.3	Layoff or Reduction in Force

(For routine visits, vacation or personal leave time may be utilized and should be scheduled in advance with the supervisor.)
23
B.	Effective September 1, 1994 to August 31, 1995, regular full-time employees shall be eligible for eight (8) sick days on the first anniversary date of employment.
Regular full-time employees with more than one (1) year service shall accrue sick leave at the rate of 10/12 day per month.
Regular part-time employees shall accrue sick leave on a pro-rata basis, and shall be paid for sick days according to their regular scheduled hours per day.
C.	No more than four (4) sick leave occurrences of one (1), two (2) or three (3) days may be taken per year, from 9-1-94 through 8-31-95, unless the employee provides a physician's or other health practitioner's certification for the additional days. Certified absences will be excluded from the initial count of four (4) occurrences.
Failure to provide the required certification for each absence beyond four (4) uncertified sick leave occurrences shall result in a pay docking.
An absence beginning before a weekend and continuing after a weekend is considered one occurrence, i.e., an absence that begins on Friday and ends on the following Monday is one occurrence (two-day), and a medical excuse is not required (unless it is the fifth occurrence); or an absence that begins on Thursday and ends on the following Tuesday is one occurrence (four-day), and a physician's excuse is required.
D.	If it is anticipated that the absence will be for an extended period of time (more than eight (8) calendar days), an initial medical certification is required immediately following the eighth calendar day of absence and additional certification is required on a regular basis.
Medical certification should clearly state that the employee has been under physician's or health practitioner's care and include the dates of illness and medical appointments (dates on the excuse must agree with dates of absence), a verification of fitness to return to work, and the physician's or health practitioner's signature or authorized facsimile. Failure to provide the above certification shall result in a pay docking. The College may assist the employee in obtaining medical certification when necessary.
E.	If the College has reasonable basis to believe that an employee is abusing sick leave provisions, or unscheduled paid time off, the employee may be reviewed by the Attendance Control Committee.
F.	If an absence is due to an occupational (worker's compensation) injury or disease, the employee shall file a worker's compensation claim. No sick leave for any such absence shall be paid except as set forth below.
An employee may utilize sick leave days and receive payment from the College for the first five (5) days of an alleged occupational (worker's compensation) leave only if the absence does not exceed fourteen (14) consecutive calendar days.
An employee may request payment of earned personal, bonus or vacation days during the eligibility period.
An employee, whose claim for worker's compensation is rejected, may retroactively and prospectively utilize earned sick leave with appropriate medical certification.
G.	Effective September 1, 1995, employees may utilize banked sick leave days after five (5) unscheduled paid time off days and two (2) personal days are used. Use of more than one day from the sick leave bank per year shall require a written certification from a medical practitioner.
Effective September 1, 1996, Employees may utilize banked sick leave days after five (5) unscheduled paid time off days are used. Use of more than three (3) days from the sick leave bank per year shall require a written certification from a medical practitioner.
This recommendation is premised on the Agreement between the parties implementing a paid time off program effective September 1, 1995. Under this program, employees may utilize up to five unscheduled paid time off days per year. Additionally, use of any banked sick leave days will disqualify an employee from eligibility for bonus days or attendance pay.
24
The parties also agree that whole sick leave days may be used in lieu of short term disability payments.
H.	The College and the Union, in a mutual and cooperative effort to reduce unnecessary sick leave use, or unscheduled paid time off effective September 1, 1995, hereby creates Attendance Control Committees at each campus and at College Office.
1.	Each committee will consist of two (2) individuals, one (1) appointed by the College and one (1) by the Union. This committee will meet semi-annually during March and August. Additional meetings may be scheduled by either the College or the Union on an as needed basis.
2.	Any employee who has been absent on more than four separate occurrences, or whose absenteeism suggests a pattern of abuse, shall be referred to this committee for review.
3.	In the event the committee recommends remedial action for the employee, the employee shall be required to meet these remedial requirements.
4.	The College continues to retain all rights to discipline employees for just cause notwithstanding the actions of this committee. Discipline may be reviewed by the committee before action is taken.
17.2	Health Leave
Upon appropriate medical certification, an employee may be granted an unpaid leave of absence from work, if required, for reasons of health or rehabilitation. The request for such shall not be unreasonably denied by the College.
17.3	Childbearing and Childrearing Leaves
A.	Childbearing (Pregnancy Disability)
1.	Pregnant employees shall provide at least sixty (60) days prior notice of the anticipated date of the beginning of the pregnancy disability leave, unless all or part of such notice must be waived in the event the employee's physician certifies that said disability maternity leave must begin earlier for reasons of health. A physician's certification stating the beginning date of the pregnancy disability is also required prior to leave.
2.	When the pregnancy disability ceases, normally after six (6) week check-up and physician's release, the employee shall return to work within fifteen (15) days unless the employee has opted to utilize the Childrearing Leave provisions set forth in Section B below.
3.	Prior to the return of an employee from a pregnancy disability leave, the employee and the immediate supervisor shall discuss the employee's assignment and return date with the purpose of causing the least disruption.
B.	Childrearing Leave
1.	Childrearing leave shall commence within ninety (90) days of birth, unless another period is agreed upon by the College and the Union.

2.	Childrearing leave may extend for a limit of six (6) months, or such other period agreed upon by the College and the Union. If an employee does not return to employment after six (6) months or the agreed upon period, employment shall terminate.
3.	The employee may continue insurance benefits to the extent permitted under the applicable policies, for the period of the childrearing leave by making monthly advance payment of the premium cost of such
25
insurance. The College shall have no obligation to pay for insurance or other benefits for such employee during such leave, except as provided under the Family and Medical Leave Act.
4.	General Conditions:
a)	No salary payment shall be made for the period of the leave.
b)	Sick day bank shall remain during the childrearing leave.
c)	No sick leave (or paid time off effective September 1, 1995) shall accumulate during the time of the childrearing leave.
5.	If any situation develops whereby the pregnancy is terminated prior to a full-term birth, the time limits concerning the childrearing leave and earlier return to service may be waived on the recommendation of the attending physician and if requested, in consultation with a designated physician.
6.	It is understood the disability pregnancy leave and the childrearing leave may overlap. For the disability pregnancy portions, the regular disability provisions shall apply.
17.4	Bereavement Leave

If permitted by the College’s health insurance plan, an employee who is on a leave of absence for service to the Union may elect to continue health insurance coverage, at no cost to the College, by paying to the College the amount of the applicable premium in advance of the premium payment due date. The College may use a temporary employee during the period of time that an employee is on a leave of absence for service to the Union.
17.6	Jury Duty
An employee called for jury duty or subpoenaed to attend Court shall be granted leave with pay for such purposes. Evidence in the form of a subpoena or other written notification shall be presented to the employee's immediate supervisor as far in advance as is practicable.

29JOB CLASSIFICATION MANUAL
(Job Reclassification & Related Grievance Procedures)
A.	Revised or Newly Established Jobs
1.	Revised Jobs
College shall have the right to revise and update job descriptions as required. The College will review any revised job descriptions with the Union prior to implementation.
In the event the job duties of any presently existing jobs are significantly changed, either at the discretion of the College or through other means, the College shall review the job and provide the Union with the results. If the Union disagrees with the findings, it may file a grievance as set forth in the Grievance and Arbitration Procedures of this manual. In reviewing the revised job, only those factors affected by the changes shall be considered for evaluation and classification purposes.
2.	New Jobs
Any new jobs shall be described, evaluated and classified by the College as set forth in this manual.
3.	General
a)	Request for a Job Description Questionnaire from the Human Resources Department is made through the employee's supervisor. (An employee is free to consult with the Campus Union Steward at any time during this process).
b)	Questionnaire is completed and signed by the employee and routed to the following:
1)	Supervisor
2)	Division Dean
3)	Executive Dean
4)	Director of Business Affairs
Comments are encouraged from these administrators. Their signature is not an endorsement, but an agreement that the request should be reviewed.
c)	The Human Resources Department reviews the request and proceeds with a job audit. After the re-evaluation is completed, the analysis is returned to the above mentioned personnel, the employee, and the Union.
d)	If the employee disagrees with the evaluation, he/she should seek clarification with their immediate supervisor. In the event, the employee wishes to pursue his/her request further, he/she may consult with the campus steward and proceed with the grievance procedure beginning with the informal stage as follows:
B.	Scope of Grievance Procedure
If the employee and the Union believe an evaluation of a job should have resulted in a higher or lower
39
classification or should have resulted in a classification change, a resolution should be attempted at an informal stage. Within fifteen (15) days after notification of the job evaluation and classification, the employee should review the findings with the campus steward and notify the Human Resources Department designee that further clarification is needed.
A meeting will be scheduled with the employee, the campus steward and the College job classification designee. In the event these discussions do not result in a satisfactory solution, a formal grievance may be initiated using the procedures listed below.
1.	Level One
The grievance must be initiated within fifteen (15) days from the time of the meeting held at the informal stage. The alleged grievance shall be reduced to writing by the Union Campus Steward and be submitted to the College job classification designee. The Union job classification committee (not to exceed 5) shall meet with the College job classification designee within ten (10) days of the filing of the grievance and attempt to resolve the matter. A written answer must be given by the College within five (5) working days after such meeting.
2.	Level Two
If the parties are unable to resolve the job classification grievance satisfactorily, the Union, Business Agent and the College Personnel Director (or designee) shall meet and attempt to settle the grievance within five (5) working days of the receipt of the response from Level One.
3.	Level Three
If the parties are unable to resolve the grievance at Level Two, the Union may cause the job classification grievance to be placed before an arbitrator experienced in job classification matters and conversant with the job description and classification system of the parties for final and binding resolution. Normally, it is expected this arbitration will be informal and the arbitrator will have full access to persons responsible for and knowledgeable of the system.
4.	Settlement of the Grievance
In the event the parties settle a grievance, or the arbitrator issues a final and binding award, which requires an increase in the pay level, employees affected by the grievance shall be granted the increase in pay, in accordance with regular College procedures.
Additional personnel may be required to attend meeting at Level Two and Three upon mutual agreement or both the College and the Union.
