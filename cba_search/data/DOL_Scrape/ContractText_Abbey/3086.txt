8.1	Purpose
The County recognizes the need and affirms the right of the Union to designate Shop Stewards from among employees in the Unit. It is agreed that the Union in appointing such Shop Stewards does so with the purpose of promoting an effective relationship between supervisors and employees by helping to settle problems at the lowest level of supervision.
8.2	Role of Steward and Supervisor (Out-of-Unit)
The Shop Steward recognizes the fact that the out-of-unit supervisor is the representative in the department and, as such, is responsible to higher management for the quality of the work. As the out-of-unit supervisor is the representative for management, the Shop Steward is the representative for the Union. They must be willing to meet in good faith to settle grievances as they arise. The Shop Steward understands that the Stewardship function does not relieve them from conforming to all rules of conduct and standard of performance established by law, regulation, County or department policy or this MOU.
8.3	Selection of Stewards
8.3.1	The Union shall reserve the right to designate the method of selection of the Shop Stewards. The Union shall provide, in writing, a list of all Shop Stewards and Unit Officers to the Labor Relations Manager and the appropriate department head(s) in February of each year. Further, the Union shall notify the Labor Relations Manager and the appropriate department head(s) each time there is a change of either Stewards or Unit Officers.
8.3.2	The County agrees the number of Stewards for the Unit shall be one (1) per shift for each work location. If there are more than forty (40) Unit employees at one location, an additional Steward will be added for each forty (40) Unit employees.
8.3.3	If a Steward promotes, demotes, or otherwise leaves the work location, the Union shall have the right to appoint a replacement.
-3-
8.4	Duties and Responsibilities of Stewards
The following functions are understood to constitute the duties and responsibilities of Shop Stewards:
8.4.1	Upon request of the aggrieved employee, and when the grievance has been reduced to writing as specified in the grievance procedure, a Steward may investigate the grievance provided it is in the Steward’s area of responsibility, as assigned by the Union, and assist in its presentation. Stewards shall be allowed a reasonable time for this purpose during their work shift without loss of pay, subject to prior notification and approval by their out-of-unit supervisor. Grievances will be handled by one (1) Steward, but the Union may assign not more than two (2) Stewards to a group grievance.
8.4.2	After obtaining out-of-unit supervisory permission, Shop Stewards will be permitted to leave their normal work area during on-duty time in order to assist in presentation of a grievance. To obtain permission to investigate a grievance on on-duty time, the Steward shall advise the out-of-unit supervisor of the general nature of the grievance. The Shop Steward is permitted to discuss the problem with all employees immediately concerned and if appropriate, to attempt to achieve settlement with the appropriate management representative involved. Agencies, wards, clients, detainees, and outside interested parties will not be contacted by Stewards as part of the grievance process.
8.4.3	If, in the judgment of the out-of-unit supervisor because of the necessity of maintaining adequate level of service, permission cannot be granted immediately to the Shop Steward in order to present or investigate a grievance during on-duty time, such permission shall be granted by the out-of-unit supervisor no later than the next working day from the date the Shop Steward was denied permission.
8.4.4	Shop Stewards may utilize the County E-mail system pursuant to his/her duties and responsibilities as defined by this MOU.
8.5	Limitations on Time Off
Stewards shall not be permitted time away from their work assignments for the purpose of conducting general Union business, consistent with the Employee Relations Ordinance.

Should employees of this Unit be scheduled by management to work more than seven (7) consecutive work days, commencing on the eighth (8th) day, the employee will be compensated at two (2) times his/her base hourly rate for each hour worked until such time as two (2) consecutive days off are received. This payment shall only apply when the employee has been scheduled by management and ordered to work more than seven (7) consecutive work days, and does not apply when the work is as a result of the employee volunteering.
To clarify which employees are volunteers, each current employee shall be provided a form upon which to waive eighth (8th) day overtime eligibility.

Employees who return the form shall not be entitled to double-time pay for the eighth (8th) consecutive day worked nor days thereafter.

When on standby, the employee shall remain within the metropolitan Fresno area, shall inform the designated management or supervisory person of exactly where the employee may be reached at any time and shall be in a fit condition to report to work.
The rate of pay upon which the time and one-half payment shall be made shall be the employee’s base rate of pay, unless the overtime meets the definition of overtime under provisions of the FLSA; in the latter instance, overtime shall be calculated at the rate of one and one-half (I’/a) times the employee’s regular rate of pay, as defined by provisions of the FLSA. The fact that the County may initially calculate overtime based on the regular rate of pay for all overtime hours worked does not obviate the County’s future exclusive right to differentiate between overtime rates as set forth herein.

1.	The employee is unexpectedly ordered to return to work and does, in fact, return to work.

The fact that the County may initially calculate overtime based on the regular rate of pay for all overtime hours worked does not obviate the County’s future exclusive right to differentiate between overtime rates as set forth herein.
Employees called back, and who meet the criteria for use of private vehicles, shall be reimbursed for mileage driven to and from home when called back at the current reimbursement rate.

FREQUENCY OF EMPLOYEE EVALUATIONS
For information purposes and not to be construed as a part of the Agreement:
1.	Probationary Period
Ratings for an employee will occur at least once during the probationary period. However, it is anticipated that in the course of normal supervisor/employee relationships, the employee will be kept informed as to his or her job performance during the course of the probationary period. The required official rating shall occur just prior to the ending of the probationary period—usually approximately one month prior thereto. Since probationary periods are either of six months or one year duration, the required official rating will occur at approximately the 5th or 11th month of the probationary period. If an employee with an original six month probationary period has probation extended, another rating will be required immediately prior to the end of the extended period.
2.	Annual—Anniversary Date
Employees not in probationary status will be rated at least annually. For administrative control purposes, the annual rating is established in accord with the salary review anniversary date. Employee evaluations shall occur at approximately one month prior to the anniversary date. Once an employee has achieved the top step of the salary range, ratings will be at least annually at the established anniversary date which determined the top step salary advancement or appointment.
3.	Other
A department head may make employee performance evaluations more frequently than required herein as determined by:
a.	Department Pokey
For the entire department, or for specialized, or technical job classes.
b.	Employees whose overall job performance has been unsatisfactory or needs improvement
c.	Mitigating individual circumstances other than the above are appropriate for the occasion.

3500.	(a) It is the purpose of this chapter to promote full communication between public employers and their
employees by providing a reasonable method of resolving disputes regarding wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment between public employers and public employee organizations. It is also the purpose of this chapter to promote the improvement of personnel management and employer-employee relations widiin the various pubhc agencies in the State of California by providing a uniform basis for recognizing the right of pubEc employees to join organizations of their own choice and be represented by those organizations in their employment relationships with pubEc agencies. Nothing contained herein shaU be deemed to supersede the provisions of existing state law and the charters, ordinances, and rules of local pubEc agencies that estabEsh and regulate a merit or civil service system or which provide for other methods of administering employer-employee relations nor is it intended that this chapter be binding upon those pubEc agencies that provide procedures for the administration of employer-employee relations in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. This chapter is intended, instead, to strengthen merit, civil service and other methods of administering employer-employee relations through the estabEshment of uniform and orderly methods of communication between employees and the pubEc agencies by which they are employed.
(b) The Legislature finds and declares that the duties and responsibiEties of local agency employer representatives under this chapter are substantiaUy similar to the duties and responsibiEties required under existing collective bargaining enforcement procedures and therefore the costs incurred by the local agency employer representatives in performing those duties and responsibiEties under this chapter are not reimbursable as state-mandated costs.

As used in this chapter, "agency shop" means an arrangement that requires an employee, as a condition of continued employment, either to join the recognized employee organization, or to pay the organization a service fee in an amount not to exceed the standard initiation fee, periodic dues, and general assessments of the organization.
(b)	In addition to the procedure prescribed in subdivision (a), an agency shop arrangement between the pubhc agency and a recognized employee organization that has been recognized as the exclusive or majority bargaining agent shah be placed in effect, without a negotiated agreement, upon (1) a signed petition of 30 percent of the employees in the applicable bargaining unit requesting an agency shop agreement and an election to implement an agency fee arrangement, and (2) the approval of a majority of employees who cast ballots and vote in a secret ballot election in favor of the agency shop agreement.

3504.5.	(a) Except in cases of emergency as provided in this section, the governing body of a public agency, and
boards and commissions designated by law or by the governing body of a public agency, shall give reasonable written notice to each recognized employee organization affected of any ordinance, rule, resolution, or regulation directly relating to matters within the scope of representation proposed to be adopted by the governing body or the designated boards and commissions and shall give the recognized employee organization the opportunity to meet with the governing body or the boards and commissions.
(b)	In cases of emergency when the governing body or the designated boards and commissions determine that an ordinance, rule, resolution, or regulation must be adopted immediately without prior notice or meeting with a recognized employee organization, the governing body or the boards and commissions shall provide notice and opportunity to meet at the earliest practicable time following the adoption of the ordinance, rule, resolution, or regulation.

If agreement is reached by the representatives of the public agency and a recognized employee organization or recognized employee organizations, they shall jointly prepare a written memorandum of such understanding, which shall not be binding, and present it to the governing body or its statutory representative for determination.
3505.2.	If after a reasonable period of time, representatives of the public agency and the recognized employee organization fail to reach agreement, the public agency and the recognized employee organization or recognized employee organizations together may agree upon the appointment of a mediator mutually agreeable to the parties. Costs of mediation shall be divided one-half to the public agency and one-half to the recognized employee organization or recognized employee organizations.
3505.3.	Public agencies shall allow a reasonable number of public agency employee representatives of recognized employee organizations reasonable time off without loss of compensation or other benefits when formally meeting and conferring with representatives of the public agency on matters within the scope of representation.
3505.4.	If after meeting and conferring in good faith, an impasse has been reached between the public agency and the recognized employee organization, and impasse procedures, where applicable, have been exhausted, a public agency that is not required to proceed to interest arbitration may implement its last, best, and final offer, but shall not implement a memorandum of understanding. The unilateral implementation of a pubhc agency's last, best, and final offer shaU not deprive a recognized employee organization of the right each year to meet and confer on matters within the scope of representation, whether or not those matters are included in the unilateral implementation, prior to the adoption by the pubhc agency of its annual budget, or as otherwise required by law.
3506.	Pubhc agencies and employee organizations shaU not interfere with, intimidate, restrain, coerce or discriminate against pubhc employees because of their exercise of their rights under Section 3502.
3507.	A pubhc agency may adopt reasonable rules and regulations after consultation in good faith with representatives of an employee organization or organizations for the administration of employer-employee relations under this chapter (commencing with Section 3500). Such rules and regulations may include provisions for (a) verifying that an organization does in fact represent employees of the pubhc agency (b) verifying the official status of employee organization officers and representatives (c) recognition of employee organizations (d) exclusive recognition of employee organizations formaUy recognized pursuant to a vote of the employees of the agency or an appropriate unit thereof, subject to the right of an employee to represent himself as provided in Section 3502 (e) additional procedures for the resolution of disputes involving wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment (f) access of employee organization

officers and representatives to work locations (g) use of official bulletin boards and other means of communication by employee organizations (h) furnishing nonconfidential information pertaining to employment relations to employee organizations (i) such other matters as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter. Exclusive recognition of employee organizations formally recognized as majority representatives pursuant to a vote of the employees may be revoked by a majority7 vote of the employees only after a period of not less than 12 months following the date of such recognition. No public agency shall unreasonably withhold recognition of employee organizations.
3507.1.	(a) Unit determinations and representation elections shall be determined and processed in accordance with
rules adopted by a public agency in accordance with this chapter. In a representation election, a majority of the votes cast by the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit shall be required.
(b)	Notwithstanding subdivision (a) and rules adopted by a public agency pursuant to Section 3507, a bargaining unit in effect as of the effective date of this section shall continue in effect unless changed under the rules adopted by a public agency pursuant to Section 3507.
(c)	A public agency shall grant exclusive or majority recognition to an employee organization based on signed petition, authorization cards, or union membership cards showing that a majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit desire the representation, unless another labor organization has previously been lawfully recognized as exclusive or majority representative of all or part of the same unit. Exclusive or majority representation shall be determined by a neutral third party selected by the public agency and the employee organization who shall review the signed petition, authorization cards, or union membership cards to verify the exclusive or majority status of the employee organization. In the event the public agency and the employee organization cannot agree on a neutral third party, the Division of Conciliation of the Department of Industrial Relations shall be the neutral third party and shall verify the exclusive or majority status of the employee organization. In the event that the neutral third party determines, based on a signed petition, authorization cards, or union membership cards, that a second labor organization has the support of at least 30 percent of the employees in the unit in which recognition is sought, the neutral third party shall order an election to establish which labor organization, if any, has majority status.
3507.3. Professional employees shall not be denied the right to be represented separately from nonprofessional employees by a professional employee organization consisting of such professional employees. In the event of a dispute on the appropriateness of a unit of representation for professional employees, upon request of any of the parties, the dispute shall be submitted to the Division of Conciliation of the Department of Industrial Relations for mediation or for recommendation for resolving the dispute.

3507.5. In addition to those rules and regulations a pubhc agency may adopt pursuant to and in the same manner as in Section 3507, any such agency may adopt reasonable rules and regulations providing for designation of the management and confidential employees of the pubhc agency and restricting such employees from representing any employee organization, which represents other employees of the pubhc agency, on matters within the scope of representation. Except as specifically provided otherwise in this chapter, this section does not otherwise limit the right of employees to be members of and to hold office in an employee organization.
3508.	(a) The governing body of a pubhc agency may, in accordance with reasonable standards, designate
positions or classes of positions which have duties consisting primarily of the enforcement of state laws or local ordinances, and may by resolution or ordinance adopted after a pubhc hearing, limit or prohibit the right of employees in these positions or classes of positions to form, join, or participate in employee organizations where it is in the pubhc interest to do so. However, the governing body may not prohibit the right of its employees who are full-time "peace officers," as that term is defined in Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 830) of Title 3 of Part 2 of the Penal Code, to join or participate in employee organizations which are composed solely of those peace officers, which concern themselves solely and

(3)	It is the intent of this subdivision to overrule San Bernardino County Sheriffs Etc. Assn. v. Board of Supervisors (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 602, 611, to the extent that it holds that this section prohibits the County of San Bernardino from designating the classifications of Probation Corrections Officers and Supervising Probation Corrections Officers as peace officers. Those officers shall not be designated as peace officers for purposes of this section unless that action is approved by the county board of supervisors by ordinance or resolution.

This one-year limitation period shall apply only if the act, omission, or other misconduct occurred on or after January 1, 2002. In the event that the public agency determines that discipline may be taken, it shall complete its investigation and notify the police employee of its proposed disciplinary action within that year, except in any of the following circumstances:
(1)	If the act, omission, or other allegation of misconduct is also the subject of a criminal investigation or criminal prosecution, the time during which the criminal investigation or criminal prosecution is pending shall toll the one-year time period.
