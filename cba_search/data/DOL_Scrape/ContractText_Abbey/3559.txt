2.	If there are no or insufficient volunteers, the least senior Employee in the department shall be reassigned to work the full schedule that would include evenings (beyond 6:00 p.m.) and/or weekends.

If a vacancy exists within the Employee’s classification, same or lower FTE Range, and work area, the Supervisor shall honor the Employee’s request. If no such vacancy exists, the Employee shall be allowed to relinquish his/her lead duties with the agreement of the Supervisor.
Article 41, Section 4. Duties of Leads. Outlined below is a description of the role that a lead plays in directing the work of others. The lead role is intended to assist with day-to-day issues. The lead role is not intended to function independently of the Supeh/isor unless there has been prior discussion, consultation, delegation, or direction, etc., between the Supervisor and the lead. Leads, in consultation with the Supervisor, may write policies and procedures that do not impact the Collective Bargaining Agreement or terms and conditions of employment. Supervisors must “sign-off’ on any policy and/or procedure that has been developed by the lead. Leads may participate in management meetings unless terms and conditions of employment are being discussed.
For additional information regarding lead duties, refer to the 1998 document created by the Labor Management Committee on Leads.
This Article describes the limits of that role as well as clarifying two levels of lead positions. Manager's and Supervisors can decide whether or not to delegate any one of these responsibilities to a lead. The responsibilities of the lead may apply to the involvement a lead has with both Employees covered by the contracts between Group Health, Inc., and SEIU Healthcare.Minnesota and Local 12.
To qualify for Lead I pay at one dollar and forty cents ($1.40) per hour, an Employee must perform four (4) of the nine (9) tasks listed in boldface.
111
To qualify for Lead II pay at two dollars ($2.00) per hour, an Employee must perform seven (7) of the nine (9) tasks listed in boldface. In the definition of scheduling, it is understood that one (1) Employee departments where a back up person fills in part of the work schedule is not eligible for the higher pay level. For example: A one (1) Employee optical department with the optician working a four (4) day week and a float Employee works the fifth (5th) day.
If an Employee is temporarily assigned lead duties, he/she shall be compensated at Lead I pay.
Each March, the Supervisor shall review the lead tasks being performed by lead Employees to determine the appropriate placement of the Employee in Lead I or Lead II or the removal of lead pay. If the Supervisor determines that the Employee is not appropriately placed, the Employee shall be placed in the appropriate level or the lead pay shall be removed.
Prior to the Supervisor implementing a decrease in or the removal of lead pay received by the Employee, the Employee shall receive thirty (30) calendar days notice.

Dear Julie,
This letter is to confirm the parties understanding regarding work on Christmas Eve in the Central Lab. My understanding is that Central Lab’s current practice is Employees do not work past 6:00 or 6:30 p.m. on Christmas Eve. If the Employer were to schedule Employees differently on Christmas Eve with the result that Employees work past this time, prior to any implementation, the Employer will meet with the Union to discuss the application of Article 20, Section 1.
Sincerely,

Dear Julie,
This letter is to confirm the understanding that was reached during the negotiations for the 2002-2005 Collective Bargaining Agreement regarding eligibility requirements for Building Engineers for Educational Assistance.
The parties have agreed that employees in the Building Engineer I and Building Engineer II classification can access Educational Assistance without meeting the current requirement under Article 30, Section 1 of attending a course that is credited, e.g., an employee taking a welding class at a vocational school.
