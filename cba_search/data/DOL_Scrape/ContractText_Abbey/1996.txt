ARTICLE I
RECOGNITION OF UNION AND COVERAGE OF AGREEMENT
Section 1.	UNION RECOGNIZED AS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE OF EMPLOYEES.
The Associations and the individual Employers hereby recognize the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative of all employees of the individual Employers performing work over which the Union has territorial jurisdiction and scope of work. (See Article X.)
Section 2.	EMPLOYERS AND WORK COVERED.
(a)	ASSOCIATION AUTHORITY TO ENTER AGREEMENT. Each Association warrants that it has written authority from each of the member firms listed on Exhibits A. to enter into this Agreement for and on their behalf.
(b)	AGREEMENT BINDING ON MEMBER FIRMS. This Agreement shall be binding upon each and every firm listed on Exhibits A with the same force and effect as if said Agreement was executed by such member individually.
The Contractors submitted on Exhibits A at this time who have given Powers of Attorney to each signatory Association to represent them in negotiations, copies of which Powers of Attorney have been submitted to Local Union 38, shall be recognized as parties to this Agreement. In addition, each Association shall notify Local Union 38 of any contractor who, during the term of this Agreement grants power of attorney to the Association, copy of which power of attorney shall be submitted to Local Union 38, and Local Union 38 shall recognize such contractor on the appropriate Exhibit A on the following anniversary date of the Agreement (i.e., July 1st of each year).
(c)	EMPLOYERS BOUND BY AGREEMENT. Each employer listed on an Exhibit shall be and continue to remain, personally and individually, liable under this Agreement for and during the term hereof, irrespective of whether said member shall cease to be a member of the Association prior to the date set for the expiration of said contract. Wherever this Agreement refers to an Employer in the masculine it shall be deemed to also include the feminine.
(d)	CHANGES IN OWNERSHIP. This Agreement shall be binding upon each of the individual Employers party hereto, and upon their heirs, successors and assigns, including any successor partnership or corporation. The successor individual Employer, partnership or corporation shall agree to
-1-
continue in its employ those employees working for the original Employer and it shall be the legal obligation of the original Employer to include such a provision in his contract of sale to the successor Employer, partnership or corporation. In the event that this provision is violated, the Union shall invoke the arbitration clause and the arbitrator shall have the authority to assess damages for any loss of pay by employees against either the original Employer or the successor or both. Any new or additional partners or owners shall immediately sign this Agreement, but such signature shall not be necessary to their liability. Each Employer agrees to promptly notify the Union in writing by registered mail of any change in ownership, or change in partners, and persons who were partners or owners at the time this contract is executed shall remain individually responsible and liable for the observance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement until such notice is given and the new partners or owners become signatory hereto. No Employer shall hold an interest in, be affiliated with or operate in conjunction with any person, firm or corporation which is engaged in any work covered by the terms of this Agreement and is not a signatory to this Agreement with respect to work performed in the geographical area covered by this Agreement. The Employer shall give prompt notice in the event any partner or individual assumes any interest or performs any executive or supervisory functions in the firm of the Employer who also maintains an interest in, works for or contracts to have work performed by a firm engaged in plumbing, pipefitting or HVAC/Refrigeration work covered by this Agreement that is not a signatory to this Agreement. In the event, at the time of execution of this Agreement, the Employer maintains an interest in two firms, the Employer warrants that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, this Agreement shall be applicable to any firm, corporation or enterprise engaged in plumbing, pipefitting and HVAC/Refrigeration work with which he or his firm is affiliated, directly or indirectly. The Employer shall be liable for any breach of this Agreement by any other firm engaged in plumbing, pipefitting or HVAC/Refrigeration work, as above set forth.
Where a signatory to an Agreement is also an owner, partner, holds a financial interest in or occupies a managerial or supervisory position in any other firm engaged in any work covered by this Agreement, the execution of this Agreement shall be deemed to be applicable to any work covered by this Agreement performed by such other firm to the fullest extent permitted by law and the execution of this Agreement shall render the signatory personally liable for any violation of this Agreement by such other firm or enterprise.
(e)	PERMITS. Except in the event of extreme emergency requiring immediate corrective action, no signatory contractor shall commence work on any job requiring the issuance of a permit unless and until the permit has been obtained. The practice of commencing work on a job and subsequently
-2-
obtaining a permit shall be discontinued.
This provision has been inserted into the Agreement in order to assist policing observance of the terms of the contract by signatory employers and, therefore, in the event of any ascertained violation of this provision, the Arbitration Committee is authorized to assess damages for such a breach in an amount up to, but not in excess of, the wages paid or that should have been paid to all employees employed or required to be employed on such work prior to the obtaining of a permit.
In the event it is not possible to obtain a permit in observance of this Section, the Employer may commence the work and simultaneously send by certified mail a notice to the Union that such a job has been commenced together with the names of the employees employed on the job.
The provision of this sub-paragraph (e) shall not be applicable to Jobbing, Service and Repair work.
(f)	EMPLOYER QUALIFICATIONS.

-4-
Employer to refrain or to cease any disputed work pending resolution of any such dispute in accordance with the procedures contained in Article XII of the Agreement. In the event the Employer fails to cease or refrain from performing or having the disputed work performed on demand of the Union, the Union may apply for and shall be granted a temporary restraining order in any court of competent jurisdiction restraining the performance of such disputed work pending resolution of the dispute in accordance with this Agreement

(a)	PROHIBITION AGAINST SUBTERFUGE EVASION: FABRICATED PIPING. No Employer or employee shall evade the spirit of this Agreement by any subterfuge. In particular, no Employer shall evade the spirit of this Agreement by using piping fabricated outside the territory covered
-5-
by this Agreement under this Agreement.

Any contractor who performs fabricating work for any job to be installed within the territory covered by this Agreement shall fabricate within the territory covered by this Agreement and under the terms of this Agreement.

In the event other Hiring Halls are established, the Hiring Hall Committee shall notify applicants of Counties covered.
(b)	REPORTING FOR REGISTRATION. An applicant who desires to be dispatched to a job shall register by telephone or in person on the out-of-work list. In order to maintain his/her place on the list, he/she must re-register by telephone or in person noting the date opposite his or her name at least once each month.

(d)	LOSS OF PLACE ON OUT-OF-WORK LIST. So long as applicant reregisters each month, between 8:00 and 9:30 A.M.with the dispatcher and notes the date of re-registration, an applicant shall retain his/her place on the out of work list until he/she has had at least fifteen (15) working days, unless he/she quits or requests a layoff, or is discharged for cause. Except as provided in (b) no dispatcher or other person is authorized to register or re-register for applicant. Any person who quits or requests a layoff prior to the expiration of the fifteen (15) days for the purpose of circumventing
-11-
this provision shall be placed at the bottom of the list.

Any member who was on travel card and who has worked at least fifteen (15) days in another jurisdiction shall have his name removed from the list.
(e)	ALL DISPATCHING SHALL BE BY TELEPHONE. Applicant shall be at the telephone number he/she has designated in the membership files between 8:00 A.M. to 9:30 A.M. in order to receive dispatch calls.

If an applicant is dispatched from one (1) Hiring Hall, he/she shall have his/her name removed from all other out-of-work lists in the other Hiring Halls after he/ she has been employed for fifteen (15) days or more.
Section 15.	ORDER OF DISPATCH.
Upon the request of a contractor for employees, the Union shall endeavor to furnish the persons requested. In dispatching applicants from each list, the Union shall first refer to applicants with Group I seniority in the order in which their names appear on the list, and shall follow the same procedure successively with Group II. Provided, however, that:
(a)	KEY EMPLOYEES. Requests by contractors for applicants to act as supervisors, foremen, or general foremen shall be honored without regard to the requested employee's place on the out-of-work lists; provided requests for applicants to serve as key employees from Group II shall not be honored so long as there are applicants on the Group I list. For purposes of this Section, a welder shall not be considered a key employee except in those shops that perform welding exclusively.
(b)	EMPLOYEES REHIRED WITHIN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY
-12-
(120) DAYS. Requests by contractors for particular plumbers, steamfitters, pipe fitter/welders or HVAC/Refrigeration journeymen from Group I who have been laid off or terminated by the contractor within one hundred and twenty (120) working days prior to the request shall be honored without regard to the employee's place on the out-of-work list.
(c)	SPECIAL SKILLS. Bona fide requests by contractors for plumbers, steamfitters, pipefitter/welders or HVAC/Refrigeration, journeymen, medgas, backflow certified, etc. with special skills and abilities will be honored. Jobbing, service and repair shall be considered a special skill. The dispatcher shall dispatch persons possessing such skills and abilities in the order in which their names appear on the out-of-work list.
Where a contractor requests a welder with certification, such welder shall be dispatched to the contractor even though there may be uncertified welders higher on the list.
In determining whether an applicant possesses the particular skills and abilities called for by a contractor, the dispatcher shall consider the applicant's skills and abilities gained either through personal knowledge or the reports of contractors.
The Joint Hiring Committee is empowered to draft rules and regulations relating to requests by contractors for plumbers, steamfitters, pipe fitter/ welders and HVAC/Refrigeration journeymen with special skills and abilities, and to modify the provisions of this Section pursuant to issued rules and regulations by requiring additional other proof of the skills and abilities called for to define the type of special skills and abilities which will warrant a special request.
(d)	RIGHT TO HIRE BY NAME. Any Employer requesting employees shall have the option of requesting journeymen and apprentices by name provided:
(1)	The individual so requested by name is registered on the out-of-work list in Group I.
(2)	Neither the Employer nor any representative of the Employer has caused or induced any such employee to cease working for any other Employer and to register in the Hiring Hall in order that he/she could be employed pursuant to the provisions of this Section.
The privilege of calling for an employee by name from among eligible employees in Group I by craft classification may be obtained by hiring by name first and the next hire shall be an individual from the Hiring Hall on an unnamed basis.
(e)	No Employer shall be eligible to exercise the privilege of calling an
-13-
employee by name for the duration of the Agreement if, during the life of this Agreement the Employer has been found by the Arbitration Committee to have intentionally and deliberately; (a) violated any of the wages or benefit provisions of this Agreement; (b) hired any individual other than through the Union Hiring Hall; (c) solicited employees to work under scale.

(g)	GOVERNMENTAL REQUIREMENT. Whenever a contractor informs the Hiring Hall that he needs minority or female employees from defined zip codes in order to meet qualifications required for a specified governmental job, the dispatcher shall be authorized to send minority or female employees to such job without regard to his/her place on the out-of-work list.
(h)	LICENSES REQUIRED. No applicant shall be dispatched to a job unless he/she possesses whatever license may be required by applicable law to perform the work involved.

Section 17.	OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS; ONE EMPLOYEE IN PROVISION.
It is recognized that contractors whose principal place of business is outside the territory covered by this Agreement would be at a disadvantage if they were unable to bring with them at least a minimum crew familiar with the Employer's manner of operation (principal place of business may be challenged by the Union).

(b)	Where an outside Local Union 38 contractor works in Local 38's jurisdiction and brings in a non-Local 38 member, he shall pay the total
-15-
taxable wages of Local 38 as stipulated in this Agreement and transmit to the Local 38 Trust Funds the difference between the non-taxable fringes required by his home local and that of the Local 38 contract including overtime hours.
If the job is new construction, the difference shall be based on the new construction non-taxable fringes of Local Union 38 and that of his home local union; if the job is a market recovery, the difference shall be based on the market recovery non-taxable fringes of Local 38 and the non-taxable fringes of his home local union.
(c)	Where an outside Local 38 contractor employs a non-Local 38 member he shall, upon request, submit his payroll showing the wages paid to the non-Local 38 member within five (5) days after the payment of wages.

The regular starting time of the day shift shall be 8:00 A.M. except that where as to any locality or as to any plant of any Employer, existing traffic conditions render it desirable to start the day shift at an earlier hour, such starting time may by agreement between the Employer and the Union be made earlier, but in no event earlier than 6:30 A.M.
Such shift shall consist of seven (7) hours provided that the employee shall be permitted thirty (30) minutes for meals. Pay for a full shift period shall be a sum equivalent to seven (7) times the regular hourly rate with no premium.
(b)	SECOND SHIFT. The second shift shall consist of six and one-half (6-1/2) hours provided that the employee shall be permitted thirty (30) minutes for meals. Pay for a full second shift period shall be a sum equal to seven (7) times the regular hourly rate as set forth in Article V plus ten percent (10%). This percentage is to be calculated using the gross taxable wage prior to any 401(A) deductions.
(c)	THIRD SHIFT. The third shift shall consist of six (6) hours provided that the employee shall be permitted thirty (30) minutes for meals. Pay for a full third shift period shall be a sum equal to seven (7) times the regular hourly rate as set forth in Article V plus fifteen percent (15%). This percentage is to be calculated using the gross taxable wage prior to any 401(A) deductions.
(d)	IRREGULAR SHIFTS. The regularly established starting time of the day shift shall be recognized as the beginning of the twenty-four (24) hour work day period. When irregular or broken shifts are worked, overtime rates shall apply before the regular starting time and after the regular quitting time of the shift on which the employee is regularly employed.
(e)	TRANSFERRING SHIFTS. Employees transferred from one shift to another unless relieved from work at least a full shift as set forth herein,
-33-
the employee or employees shall be paid for all time lost from the time labor is withheld to the time that full payments have been effected by the Employer. The payment shall include payment of fringe benefit contributions required by the Agreement in addition to the amounts attributable to lost wages. The Union may require such additional payments to be made prior to the return to work by the affected employees.
This shall not foreclose the Union from utilization of the grievance machinery of the Agreement if, in addition to withholding labor, it also proceeds to arbitration under the grievance procedure or chooses, in addition, to proceed through the Labor Commissioner's Office.
Section 72.	RIGHT OF UNION TO STRIKE AND PICKET EMPLOYERS IN VIOLATION OF PROVISIONS HEREIN PERTAINING TO EXCLUSIVE HIRING.
The Union shall have the right in addition to any other remedies provided by this Agreement to strike and picket any Employer who has violated any of the provisions of Article II, relating to the requirement to hire exclusively through the Hiring Hall established by this Agreement.
Section 73.	CAUSE FOR DISCIPLINE.
No employee shall be discharged or otherwise disciplined without good cause. It shall not be cause for disciplinary action for an employee to refuse to cross a picket line sanctioned by the local Building and Construction Trades Council and/or the San Francisco Labor Council and Teamsters Joint Council #7. nor to refuse to work in violation of State or Municipal ordinances, codes or safety regulations.
Section 74.	JURISDICTIONAL DISPUTES.
In the event of any dispute between the Union and any other union or group as to the jurisdiction of the work performed by individual employees, the dispute shall be referred to and settled by the procedure established by the Building and Construction Trades Department of the American Federation of Labor and the Employer agrees not to enter into any agreement with any group or other labor organization that would preclude the submission of any such jurisdictional disputes in this manner. Any assignment of work covered by this Agreement to parties not affiliated with the AFL-CIO or Building Trades Department shall be in violation of this Agreement.
Section 75.	CONFLICTING CONTRACTS.
(a)	In the event any Employer enters into any agreement with any other labor organization to perform any of the work covered by the terms of this Agreement, this Agreement shall also be observed to the fullest extent permitted by law, and if it may not be enforced specifically, the Union shall nevertheless be entitled to damages for the failure to implement this Agreement.
-65-
(b)	No employee will sign any form or affidavit other than those required by Federal or State Law, unless the form, affidavit or document has been first approved in writing by the Union. Any form, affidavit or document signed without the proper written approval of the Union shall be a violation of this Agreement and subject to Arbitration..

(n)	If the Arbitration Committee requires the presence of an employee at a meeting during working hours, the employee shall be paid by his Employer for any time lost in attending. In the event the Employer is not the charged party, the Employer shall be reimbursed by the Union or the charged
-68-
Employer or individual as determined by the Arbitration Committee.
(o)	Hearings before the Arbitration Committee shall be informal and it shall not be necessary to keep a verbatim transcript of the proceedings.

(r)	No Union representative who is the representative filing a charge or who has participated in the investigation of a charge against an Employer or individual shall participate as a member of the Arbitration Committee hearing that charge. This shall not preclude other Union representatives of Local 38 from sitting on the Arbitration Committee. No Management representative who is the representative filing a charge or who has participated in the investigation of a charge shall participate as a member of the Arbitration Committee hearing that charge. This shall not preclude other Management representatives serving as and in place of said disqualified Management representative on the Arbitration Committee.
(s)	In the event there is a challenge on the grounds of bias, prejudice or conflict of interest against any member of the Arbitration Committee by any party to the dispute, the matter shall be ruled on by the remaining members of the Arbitration Committee.

This Agreement may be amended at any time by agreement between the parties hereto and any such amendment shall be binding upon any Employer who has executed an agreement agreeing to be bound to this Agreement and amendments hereto.
Section 79.	ADDITIONAL WORKING CONDITIONS.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, either of the parties to this Agreement shall have the right to reopen this Collective Bargaining Agreement on each anniversary date for the purpose of proposing changes in working conditions. Notice of a desire to change working conditions shall be given to the other party not later than sixty (60) days prior to the anniversary date and the proposed working conditions shall be submitted at that time. In the event that the parties are unable to reach agreement on the proposed changes in working conditions, the proposed working conditions shall be submitted to an impartial arbitrator whose decision shall be final and binding.

Section 80.	SAVINGS CLAUSE.
It is not the intent of either party hereto to violate any laws, rulings or regulations of any governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction of the subject matter of this Agreement, and the parties hereto agree that in the event any provisions of this Agreement are finally determined to be illegal or void as being in contravention of any such laws, rulings or regulations, the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and the parties shall immediately enter into negotiations for the purpose of correcting the illegal or void portions so as best to effectuate the intent of this Agreement. In the event the parties are unable to agree on such corrections, the matter may be referred to arbitration by either party in accordance with the provisions contained herein. Under no circumstances shall any alleged illegality excuse payment of wages or fringe benefits.
In the event any fringe benefit contribution is contended to be illegal or void, such contention shall not excuse making the required contribution, but such contribution shall accumulate in escrow pending determination of the legality and should it ultimately be determined to be illegal, the fringe benefit contribution and the monies accumulated in escrow shall be allocated to such lawful fringe benefit program as the Union may determine
and the parties shall endeavor to, so far as possible, correct the illegality to conform as closely as possible and legally permissible to the intent of the original fringe benefit contribution.
Section 81.	WAGE CONTROL PROVISIONS.
It is recognized that the Union has entered into this Agreement for five(5) calendar years on the assumption that no Governmental Agency will disapprove any of the increases or provisions of this Agreement.

In any such reopening, it shall be the objective of the parties to preserve the real wages and fringe benefits of this Agreement to the fullest extent permitted by law and to permit the Union to recapture any losses at the earliest date it is legally permissible to do so.
In the event of any dispute whether any Governmental regulation, order or statute does preclude payment of any wages or fringe benefits provided in this Agreement, the parties shall continue to pay any disputed amount into escrow until a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that it is unlawful or improper to do so.
Section 82.	WARRANTY.
Each of the parties hereto warrants and agrees that it will not, by the adoption or amendment of any provisions of its articles of incorporation, ownership or change in geographical location, constitution, by laws or by contract, or by any means whatsoever, take any action that will prevent or impede it in the full and complete performance of each and every term or condition hereof. The warranties and agreements contained in this paragraph are made by each of the signatories hereto on its own behalf and on behalf of each organization for which it is acting hereunder. The individuals signing this Agreement in their official capacity and the signatories hereto hereby guarantee and warrant their authority to act for and bind the respective parties or organizations whom their signatures purport to represent and the local union on whose behalf the said parties are signing the said Agreement.
This Agreement contains all of the covenants, stipulations and provisions agreed upon by the parties hereto and no agent or representative of either party has authority to make and none of the parties shall be bound by nor liable for any statement, representation, promise, inducement or agreement not set forth herein; that any provision in the working rules of the local union, with reference to the relations between the individual Employer and their
-73-
employees, in conflict with the terms of the Agreement, shall be deemed to be waived and any such rules or regulations which may hereafter be adopted by the local union shall have no application to work hereunder.
Section 83.	CANCELLATION OF AGREEMENT.
Not withstanding any other provision herein contained, the Union may, at its option, cancel this Agreement with respect to any Employer who fails to comply with a decision of the Arbitration Committee or Arbitrator within five (5) days of notification of such decision.
Section 84.	MAINTAINING DIFFERENTIAL ON REOPENING.
(a)	At all times for the duration of this Agreement, Local Union 38 shall maintain not less than ten percent (10%) differential in aggregate wages and fringe benefits, as defined below, above the highest total of aggregate wages and benefits negotiated by any of the following Bay Area United Association locals within their jurisdiction: U.A. Local Unions 159,342, 343, 393 and 467.
(b)	Sub-section A shall be suspended for four (4) years until June 30, 2011 when it will be reinstated in its entirety and calculated on January 1, 2011.(For example, if the calculations for January 1, 2011 show money due regarding Section 84, such monies will be paid effective July 1, 2011 over and above the negotiated $5.00 increase and after such increase if Local 38 is behind the 10% by any percentage such percentages are also due on July 1,2011.)
(c)	For the purpose of performing the calculations required under this section of the Agreement, "aggregate wages and fringe benefits" means the total amount payable to a journeyman as taxable wages, including but not limited to401A define contribution, vacation and holiday contributions, or their equivalent, and all contributions which the Employers are obligated to pay to all trust funds, excluding "Employer Trusts." The "Employer Trusts" are Contract Administration Trust and the Hiring Hall and Arbitration Trust.
Contributions to Employer trust funds for the other U.A. locals shall be excluded from the calculations required under this Section.
(c)	COMPUTATION OF THE DIFFERENTIAL.
(1)	TEN PERCENT (10%) ABOVE THE HIGHEST RULE. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, aggregate Local 38 wages and fringes shall not be less than the differential percentage of one hundred ten percent (110%) of the aggregate wages and fringes enjoyed by any of the U.A. local unions identified above enjoying the highest aggregate wages and fringes under any collective bargaining agreement.
(2)	CONTINUOUS ADJUSTMENT. If at any time during the
-74-
remaining term of this Agreement an increase in wages and/or fringes shall become effective for any other U.A. local unions listed above which would result in the members of Local 38 enjoying less than the aggregate amount required by the differential percentage, a differential increase shall be paid from the date such increase is agreed upon.
In the event that any U.A. local listed above has negotiated an increase in wages and/or fringe benefits that requires a differential increase for Local 38, and that local's increase is made retroactive to an earlier date, U.A. Local 38's differential increase shall not be retroactive. Instead, an amount equal to the amount that would have been due as a differential increase under this Section had such other local's increase actually commenced on the effective date of such increase, shall be amortized and paid over the remaining days in the contract year (July 1 to June 30) in which such increase occurs for the other U.A. local and shall continue to be paid during the term of the Agreement. This additional pro-rated amount shall be paid in addition to the amount of differential increase due as a prospective only increase. Example: If on October 1st another U.A. local negotiates an increase in their wages or fringe benefits that necessitates a differential increase of $1.00 per hour in U.A. Local 38 wages or fringe benefits to maintain the ten percent (10%) differential, and that other U.A. local's increase is made retroactive to July 1st of that same contract year, U.A. Local 38 is due a total differential increase of $1.33 per hour commencing October 1st and continuing during the term of the Agreement.
(3)	ALLOCATION. Differential monies are subject to allocation by the Union pursuant to Section 37 of this Agreement, but the Union may allocate between wages and fringes at any time that differential is first paid or thereafter increases. Differential monies shall not be allocated to the Employer trusts.
(4)	NO DECREASE IN PERCENTAGE DIFFERENTIAL. The differential percentage shall not be decreased during the term of this Agreement.
Section 85.	FAVORED NATION CLAUSE.
The Union shall have the right to negotiate conditions relative to the needs of the Employers in particular geographical areas covered by this Agreement. In the event the Union should negotiate terms or conditions more favorable to any individual contractor or contractor associations in a particular geographical area, said terms and conditions shall be made available to all signatory Employers working in such geographical area.
Section 86.	SPECIAL PROJECT AGREEMENT.
When a project to be constructed in the jurisdiction of Local Union 38 presents a unique problem of manning hours worked, or effective competition, the
-75-
individual Employer may, through his representative Association, petition the Business Manager or his designated representative for Special Project Agreement consideration. After presentation of special circumstances of the project, the Special Project Agreement may be written by the Business Manager or his designated representative provided that the parties agree and that Special Project Agreement be available to all individual Employers or through their representative Associations.
The favored nation provision shall not apply to the work performed under the Special Project Agreement.
Section 87.	LANDSCAPING/UTILITY
Any contractor signatory to this Agreement who performs landscaping and/or utility work may perform such work in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Landscape and/or Utility Agreement.
Section 88	UNITED ASSOCIATION STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE
The Parties to this Agreement agree to incorporate for reference purposes, The United Associations Standard of Excellence.
Section 89	WAIVER OF SAN FRANCISCO SICK LEAVE ORDINANCE
In accordance, with Section 12W9, of Proposition F of the City and County of San Francisco which provides that all or any portion of the applicable requirements of this chapter shall not apply to employees covered by a bona fide Collective Bargaining Agreement to the extent that such requirements are expressly waived in the Collective Bargaining Agreement in clear and unambiguous terms, the parties hereto agree that the employers shall not be required to pay sick leave and that no employer shall be required to pay compensation to any employee because he/she is absent from work due to illness.
Section 90	SMOKE FREE JOBSITE
A smoke free jobsite can be mutually agreed upon by the Local Union and the Employer.
Section 91	INTERNATIONAL TRAINING FUND
Parties agreed that effective 07/01/2008 the I.T.F hourly contribution shall increase from $.5 cents to $.10 cents per hour.
Section 92.	TERM OF AGREEMENT.
This Agreement shall become effective as of July 1,2007 and shall remain in full force and effect until June 30,2012, and thereafter from month to month unless either party gives written notice to modify or terminate this Agreement not less than sixty (60) days prior to June 30, 2012 or any subsequent month. Provided, however, that in the event a national emergency is declared by the President of the United States, either party may reopen for negotiations upon
-76-
•f
sixty (60) days written notice, but no such reopening may diminish any of the wages or benefits as provided for in this Agreement. No written notice to terminate or modify may be made by any Employer after a successor Agreement has been reached between the Union and any Association and the Employer has not, prior to the execution of such Agreement, notified the Union of its intent to terminate or modify the Agreement. The Employer shall be deemed bound by the Association Agreement so executed to the extent he has previously executed an Agreement to be bound by the terms of any successor Agreement.
