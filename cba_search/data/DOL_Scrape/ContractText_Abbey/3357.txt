ARTICLE I
MUTUAL RECOGNITION AND EFFECTS OF THE AGREEMENT
The Parkway Board of Education, whose authority is strictly defined and delineated by statute, may only function in the manner and to the extent that is authorized to do so by Missouri statutes.
The Board of Education, under law, has the final responsibility of evaluating, establishing and determining policies for the school district. The Superintendent is delegated the responsibility and authority to implement the established policies, and the professional teaching staff has the responsibility to carry out established policies and administrative regulations.
The Board-Administration-Parkway NEA Statement of Relationships is the basis of formal discussions held with Parkway NEA representatives "for the purpose of arriving at agreements on proposals concerning salary, welfare provisions, working conditions, curriculum and any other item of education concern."
The District and Parkway NEA believe that continuing a collaborative effort in the negotiations process is in the best interest of both parties. In addition both parties will continue to foster a collaborative relationship through the Employee Relations Council.
The initial discussion of issues of concern to Parkway NEA and the Board of Education shall occur at Communications Labs attended by representives of the Administration, the Association, and by the Board of Education.
A total package of articles agreed upon by Board and Parkway NEA representatives shall be recommended to the Board of Education and to the Parkway NEA. The material contained hereinafter records the agreements arrived at between the representatives of the Parkway Board of Education and the Parkway National Education Association following a series of meetings and discussions held between representatives of the Board and the Association. Any part accepted by the Board and adopted as policy or determined to be administrative regulations shall be printed in the Parkway Policy Manual. Procedures shall be implemented as stated. These agreements, upon acceptance by the Board and the Parkway NEA, shall be effective July 1, 1999 through June 30, 2002.
At least once during each year of this agreement, including the period prior to beginning discussions for a subsequent agreement, the Board and the Parkway NEA will conduct a one day Communications Lab to openly exchange information and present points of view regarding the issues each group feels should be introduced as topics of discussions and/or negotiation, and to seek mutual understand of the matters addressed.

ARTICLE VI
TRANSFERS
Section 1	- Philosophy
The District embraces the philosophy that teacher transfer is an effective vehicle to enhance the strength of the school system and professional growth of the teaching staff.
The transfer process should enable teachers to be employed in positions that allow the greatest utilization of their skills, strengths, and interests for the benefit of students, school, and district. The transfer process is designed to facilitate the movement of teachers in a positive and timely manner.
Preference in filling vacancies through the transfer process shall be given to current Parkway employees over new hires.
Vacancies shall be filled on the basis of the following selection criteria:
A.	Quality of teaching performance as determined by the District’s Performance Based Teacher Evaluation (PBTE) system.
B.	Years of continuous teacher experience in Parkway (including approved Leaves of Absence).
C.	Educational preparation as determined by placement on a channel of the salary schedule.
D.	Flexibility of possible teaching assignments as indicated by areas of certification.
E.	History of co-curricular and other District involvement in the past one to three years.
Section II	- Involuntary Transfers
Teachers who must be transferred to another building as a result of closed buildings, enrollment decline, curriculum reorganization, or other District reorganization decisions will be given first priority in filling vacancies for the following year.
Open positions for which teachers in the involuntary transfer process are qualified will not be filled by voluntary transfers or new hires until all teachers who are being involuntarily transferred are either recommended for a teacher assignment by a principal or assigned by the Area Superintendent responsible for Human Resources or the Director of Human Resources. Voluntary transfer requests will not be considered until all involuntary transferees have been satisfactorily placed in a position for which they are qualified.
Selection of teachers to be retained in each building will be made by the building principal in conjunction with the appropriate Area Superintendent and/or Instructional Coordinator. This selection will be made in accordance with the selection criteria as stated previously, weighted on the basis of the point system which follows. Whenever two or more teachers with

comparable positions are available to appropriately meet the stated needs of the building, the teacher with the lowest total number of points credited shall be transferred. In declaring overages, the principal will give preference to any teacher who volunteers to transfer. In such instance, the teacher volunteers will be considered involuntary transfers for the purpose of placement in other vacant District positions.
A.	TEACHING PERFORMANCE

Counselors - .31 per criterion
Librarians -	.45 per criterion

will meet with those involuntary transfers who have indicated interest in their schools. Teachers should not contact principals directly about available positions.
The Human Resources Department will be ultimately responsible for placing teachers into available vacancies. Every effort shall be made to place teachers subject to reassignments in those positions which most closely match their experience in subject or specialty area, grade level, educational background and desire to teach that position. In placing teachers, the Human Resources Department may consider the criteria and the ranking order of the teachers, based on total number of points accrued.
If an opening occurs before the start of school in a building in which there was an overage declared, teachers who were involuntarily transferred will be reassigned to the original building, if certified for that opening. A teacher may request to remain in the position to which he/she had been transferred by providing written notice to the Director of Human Resources.
Section III	- Voluntary Transfers
Throughout the school year,the school district will make known to the certified staff all vacancies, including vacancies in administrative positions. The announcement of vacancies will indicate certification requirements, subject areas, anticipated grade levels, deadline for applying and school location. These vacancies will be listed weekly in a Vacancy Bulletin. After the end of the school year, vacancies will be announced on the Human Resources Department’s special recorded telephone listing. The telephone number will be published for all staff and teachers, prior to the end of the school year. Openings will be listed as they become available. The date of posting shall be clearly indicated in the vacancy announcement.
Building principals or their designee(s) shall be required to post vacancies for five (5) working days beginning on the date indicated in the vacancy announcement. All such announcements shall be placed on bulletin board and such other prominent locations where employees have usual and continued access. Teachers shall not contact principals directly, but should contact the Human Resources Department for information concerning vacancies.
Teachers must apply, in writing, on the "Request For Transfer” form to the Human Resources Department for posted vacancies within five (5) working days of the vacancy announcement.
After the request for transfer has been submitted, the teacher shall:
A.	Be interviewed by the prospective principal and other appropriate personnel within five (5) working days, whenever possible.
B.	Have additional interviews or conferences as may be required.
C.	Be notified of the decision as soon as possible by the Director of Human Resources.
Principals must consider the selection criteria in Section I in making their selection. Principals should also consider the total years of service in Parkway within specific areas of certification

applicable to rhe position. Principals must be able to validate to the Area Superintendent responsible for Human Resources or the Director of Human Resources, the proper consideration and application of these criteria in regard to their recommendation of an individual who is currently not employed under a regular teacher’s contract in the District.
Any teacher granted a voluntary transfer for the current school year will not be eligible for another transfer until the following year.
The transfer process must be followed if a vacancy arising during the school year is to be filled permanently.
Parkway teachers interested in transferring to a position which may become available up to the beginning of the school year (the first day all teachers must report to work) must notify, in writing, the Human Resources Department. Such notice of interest in a vacancy which may occur (open transfer request) shall include the school(s), subject and/or grade level. Transfer requests shall be valid only for the positions(s) indicated by the teacher on the request form.
Teachers who are currently assigned to positions in more than one building, who wish to be assigned to a single building, will be considered as voluntary transfers and will be given, consideration as required by the transfer process.
Notwithstanding any provision outlined above, assignments may be changed by the Superintendent of Schools as required to serve the best interests of the total school system.
ARTICLE VII
REDUCTION-IN-FORCE
1. In the event a reduction in force is required due to financial limitations or lack of student enrollment, the district may reduce throughout the ranks of employees rather than just among teachers.After normal attrition and early retirement incentives, reductions in the teaching staff will be made on a district wide basis by area of certification. Within each area, the professional staff will be reduced in the following order:
a.	Part time probationary
b.	Full time probationary
c.	Tenured
2.	When reducing teaching positions, the quality of teaching performance, as determined by the Parkway Professional Teacher Plan, and district seniority will be utilized. For all applicable purposes, the seniority of tenured teachers who elect to take a part-time contract will be prorated on the basis of the ratio of part time to full time employment. The District may give special consideration to the retention of teachers for the purpose of meeting current compelling district needs such as retention of minority personnel and/or personnel holding specific certification or degree required for critical teaching assignments. The decision on this matter will be made exclusively by the Department of Human Resources.

3.	Teachers will be ranked by the number of criteria marked in the performance categories. Those with the highest number of marks in the first category', indicating performance below expectations will be reduced first.
If the number in the first-category is not sufficient to meet the reduction need, then the marks in the second category, indicating areas that need attention,are ranked in the same manner. Teachers marked only in categories reflecting performance at or above Parkway expectations will be ranked by seniority;. Teachers with the same starting dates will be ranked by random draw to establish single ranking positions. The starting date shall be determined by the first day of contracted teacher employment.
4.	Teachers on approved leaves of absence at the time a reduction in staff takes place will be considered in the decision process as if they were actively teaching at the time.
5.	Conditions of Reduction
a.	Teachers who have been affected by staff reduction, if they desire, shall have priority on the substitute list, according to seniority.
b.	Any tenured teacher who would have qualified for retirement during the reduction year shall be permitted to teach that year so as to acquire the last year of needed service. Teachers will lose this privilege if they are the last individual within their respective group to be reduced.
c.	Leaves of Absence may be granted by the Board, upon written request, when a reduction of staff is necessary in compliance with the Leave of Absence policies of the District.
d.	During said reduction, affected teachers shall receive insurance benefits at the District's expense for a period of three (3) months, and at the teacher's expense thereafter. Affected teachers may remain with the District’s group insurance, at their expense, as long as they are not eligible for membership in another plan, for a period of no longer than thirty-six (36) months from the date of the reduction.
e.	The fact that tenured teachers are affected by staff reduction shall not result in the loss of status or credit for previous years of service. Upon return to the District, they shall assume the step position on the salary schedule which they would have held in the year following the reduction.
f.	New teachers will not be employed by the District while there are tenured teachers of the District who are laid-off, unless there are not laid-off teachers with proper certification and qualifications to fill any vacancy which may arise.
6.	Teachers affected by a reduction-in-force will be subject to recall for a maximum period of three(3) years. Teachers will be recalled as vacancies occur in the reverse order from which they were laid-off.

7.	Recall Notice
The District will give written notice of recall from layoff by sending a registered or certified letter to said teacher at his/her last known address. It shall be the responsibility of each teacher to notify the District of any change in address. The teacher's address, as it appears on the District’s records, shall be conclusive when used in connection with layoffs, recalls, or other notices to the teacher. If a teacher fails to accept notice of recall within ten (10) calendar days from the date of sending the recall, unless an extension is granted in writing by the District, said teacher shall be considered to have voluntarily terminated his/her individual employment contract and any other employment relationship with the District.

ARTICLE IX
SCHOOL CALENDAR
The school calendar of the Parkway School District during the term of this agreement shall be no more that 191 teacher employment days, (including preschool workshops, school attendance days, paid legal holidays, teacher professional meetings, teacher/parent conferences, professional development and record days.) At the elementary and middle school, the calendar shall include a full records day scheduled at the end of the first two trimesters. At the high school the calendar will include a full records day scheduled at the end of the first semester and half records days at the six week grading periods that coincide with the K-8 trimester records days. The remaining portion of these two days will be used for curriculum/professional development activities as determined by the district. The Records Day for the third trimester/second semester will be determined no later than May 1 and will be based upon the availability of days allocated but not utilized for inclement weather. A Records Day is defined as a full workday of teacher initiated, inbuilding activities.
In cases where pupil attendance days are lost due to inclement weather or other factors and must be made up in order to meet minimum state requirements, (174 days and 1044 hours), utilization of professional development days , teacher/parent conferences, workshops, record days, and Spring Break days may be considered prior to adding additional days to the school calendar.
Each year a committee jointly selected by the President of Parkway NEA and the Superintendent will review proposed academic calendars prior to making recommendations to the Superintendent and Board of Education.

ACADEMIC FREEDOM
The Board of Education believes that the existence and progress of a democratic society and the fulfillment of the Parkway School District mission demand freedom of teaching and freedom of learning. The nature of American democracy requires that citizens be provided freedom to listen to various sides of an issue, sort out the facts, and arrive at independent conclusions.
The Board of Education expects staff members to include in the curriculum topics and teaching strategies, relative to the maturity and needs of students in accordance with district policy, that will produce an informed person who is able to deal intelligently and rationally with problems and issues with which he/she is or will be confronted as a member of society. The Board of Education expects staff members, in examining various sides of an issue, to promote objectivity and critical analysis.
Because learning is essential to the preservation of a free society, the Board also affirms the students’ freedom to learn by searching for knowledge and truth. Freedom to learn includes the right of the learner to study, discuss, debate, or hold divergent and/or dissenting views.

ARTICLE XXIV
PARENT OR STUDENT COMPLAINTS DIRECTED TOWARD EMPLOYEES
The Board of Education recognizes that situations may arise in which parents, citizens, taxpayers, students and residents have concerns or complaints about school personnel. Such concerns are best handled through direct communication with the staff member in question and/or the supervisor of the staff member. Staff members are to be notified of formal complaints filed against them by any party mentioned in this policy. The District and Parkway NEA believe the parents and students have the right to voice their dissatisfaction regarding any matter of concern. Staff members have the responsibility to attempt to resolve these concerns in an appropriate and effective manner. Teachers and administrators will cooperate to resolve student and/or parents complaints by focusing on finding a solution to the problem and by utilizing appropriate problem, solving techniques.
Concerns or complaints must first informally be directed to the employee involved. If the complainant is unable to resolve the issue with the employee directly, the complaint will be brought to the attention of the school principal or employee’s supervisor. The principal and/or employee's supervisor will arrange for a conference involving the employee and the complainant, within five (5) working days. No action of any sort shall be taken by the principal and/or employee's supervisor on the complaint prior to such a conference unless such action is required to protect the health and safety of the parties involved. The principal and/or supervisor may serve as a facilitator of any meeting between the parties involved. If the complainant is unable to resolve the problem with the employee directly and the supervisor has not been involved, the complainant should informally address the supervisor about the concern. The supervisor, after consulting the employed s) involved, shall attempt to respond and, if possible, resolve the concern or problem.
If the complainant is unable to informally resolve the concern or problem, the following process is to be utilized.
The complainant is to request, complete, and submit District Complaint Form #115. On the form, each complainant will be required to identify the employee(s); specifically state his/her concern regarding the employee(s); indicate with whom the complainant discussed the matter in order to resolve the concern or the problem; indicate time and dates when such discussion occurred; briefly state the results of any discussion; indicate remedies about how the employee or the District could resolve the problem or complaint; and if the complaint could be resolved, how the change would benefit the District, staff, schools, and other related audiences.

To assure prompt resolution, the complainant must file a complaint as soon as all other attempts at resolution have been complete or perceived to be concluded. The complainant must file the complaint with the Superintendents Office. The following procedure shall be used in processing the complaint:
1.	The employee(s) and the employee’s supervisor shall be advised immediately and receive a copy of any formal complaint filed with the Superintendent by parents, students, taxpayers, citizens, and residents.
2.	The Superintendent or his/her designee shall hold a conference with the complainant, the employee(s), the employee’s supervisor, and, if requested, the employee’s representative, prior to taking any action on the matter.
3.	The employee(s) and the employee’s supervisor shall be advised if the complaint, with its resolution, will be placed in the employee’s permanent file. The employee may add a response to the complaint form by contacting the Human Resource Office, and may attach other documents as the employee/s) may deem appropriate.
4.	Unsubstantiated, frivolous, malicious and/or vexatious charges shall not be placed in the employee’s permanent file. Any dispute regarding the placement or recording of complaints in the employee’s personnel file shall be processed through the grievance procedure. All such grievances shall be filed commencing at Level Three.
The Superintendent and /or his representative will outline a brief plan of action for the complainant upon receipt of the formal Complaint Form #115. Concerns and complaints against personnel require varying degrees of investigation, and therefore, the Superintendent and/or his representative shall indicate a tentative timeline for responding to and/or resolving the concern or problem.
The Superintendent should inform complainants that they may not address the Board at public meetings concerning personnel complaints. Complainants may register a written complaint with the Board of Education.

1.	If the employee begins the leave five (5) or more weeks prior to the end of the semester, and the period of leave is for more than three (3) weeks, then the District can require an employee seeking to return within the last three (3) weeks to wait until the next semester.
2.	If the employee begins the leave less than five (5) weeks before the end of the semester and the period of leave is greater than two (2) weeks, then the District can require an employee seeking to return within the last weeks to wait until the next semester.
3.	If the employee begins the leave three (3) or fewer weeks before the end of the semester, and the period of leave is greater than five (5) working days, the District may require the employee to wait until the next semester.
Medical, dental, life and vision insurance will continue for the duration of the leaves covered in the above paragraphs 1-3 (P.L. 103-3)

3.	Teachers accepting employment agree to accept the assignment of the Superintendent of Schools. Assignments may be changed during the school year in accordance with Board Policy GCI as required to serve the best interests of the school system.
4.	An employment period of up to 191 days (unless in compliance with state law, additional days are required to make up lost days due to inclement weather conditions per School Calendar Article) is covered by this schedule, including legal school holidays and approved professional meetings.
5.	Salary increments for assignments beyond normal curricular and co-curricular duties will be given as approved each year by the Board of Education. Teachers shall receive additional compensation if their contracted period of employment extends over a period longer than the regular period of employment as defined in Paragraph 4. Counselors, C.O.E. Coordinators, and Librarians working in excess of their regular contracted davs shall be paid on an extended duty contract at an hourly rate determined by 1/1528 of their previous year’s contract amount.
6.	Deductions for absences from teaching duties or approved professional meetings will be determined by dividing the teacher’s annual salary by the number of days covered by the teacher's contract and multiplying the quotient by the number of days absent. Exceptions are absences covered by the sick, bereavement, personal, and jury/witness and other paid leave policies or as approved on an individual basis by the Board of Education.
7.	If a teacher is released from his/her contract by the Board of Education prior to completing the terms of the contract, his/her total salary for that school year will be determined on the basis of the ratio of the number of days of service rendered in that school year to the total number of days covered by his/her contract.

Prior approval for credit on the salary schedule must be given by the Superintendent of Schools for graduate credit not acceptable toward an advanced degree in the subject matter area to which the teacher is assigned. Teachers who dually enroll in their senior year and receive some graduate credit prior to receiving their baccalaureate degrees, and teachers who complete work in excess of the requirements for their Master’s Degrees, shall have these graduate hours counted toward requirements for the next channel if the courses can be counted toward an advanced degree in the subject matter areas to which they are assigned.

Beginning September 1,2000, the requirement for placement on Channel IV of the salary schedule shall be met when a teacher holding a Master's Degree will have acquired a minimum of 15 graduate hours after receiving his/her Master’s Degree. The requirements for placement on Channel V of the salary schedule shall be met when a teacher holding a Master’s Degree will have acquired a minimum of 30 hours after receiving his/her Master's Degree. Such additional hours for placement on Channels IV and V must be directly related to the teaching assignment, professional contribution and /or effectiveness in the district.
Approved "Parkway Salary Credit Workshop’' courses offered by the Parkway School District will be accepted as partial fulfillment of requirements for placement on Channels 11, IV. and V of the salary schedule so long as such courses are directly related to the teaching assignment, professional contribution and/or effectiveness in the district. Exceptions may be approved by the Department of Human Resources. However, no more than six hours of credit for a channel change may be satisfied through the satisfactory completion of approved “Parkway Salary Credit Workshops.” Further, for placement on Channels IV and V, such salary credits must have been completed after receipt of a Master’s Degree.
11.	Placement on the salary schedule will be recognized by previous comparable experience and will be computed as follows:
A.	1) A maximum of fourteen years teacher experience will be granted for placement on the salary schedule.
2)	In determining placement, experience will be approved by the following policy:
a)	One step for each full year of full time teaching in the ten years

Parkway District will be considered for salary schedule credit on the basis of one-half year credit for each full year up to a maximum of four years credit, subject to the year limitations of subsection (a) above.
D.	No credit will be allowed for any of the following:
Practice teaching, substitute teaching, part time of less than half time, night or adult school, or non-school religious programs.
E.	A maximum of five years placement on the salary schedule may be considered in unusual circumstances when the Superintendent feels that the non-educational background of an otherwise properly certified applicant makes the applicant more qualified than an applicant with an education degree but no teaching or significant non-education experience.
Any experience considered under this section must have been in an area germane to the teaching certification/assignment and must have occurred immediately preceding the applicant’s employment in Parkway, except for any time needed to obtain certification, and the number of years of placement on the salary schedule must be recommended by the Superintendent to the Board of Education for its specific approval.
F.	Teaching experience with one or two employers during the course of one school year with no more than one school year quarter break in service will be considered as a full year of teaching experience.
G.	Changes in this paragraph granting credit for previous experience became effective for the 1988/89 school year and are not retroactive for employee hired full time or part time prior to the 1988/89 school year.
12.

ARTICLE XXXVII
SCHOOL INITIATED INSTRUCTIONAL CHANGE PROCESS
The District and the Association agree to collaborate in promoting meaningful change and improvement in the quality of instruction in order to create the best school environment for students.
Every effort will be made to develop and implement school initiated instructional changes within the parameters and provisions of the Agreement between the Board of Education and the Parkway NEA. As these prospective changes are proposed which the Association may feel do not comply with the Board of Education/Parkway NEA Agreement, or the implementation of which is reasonable believed to be impossible to realize in the context of the Agreement, the Parkway NEA President and the Area Superintendent responsible for the supervision of the school will meet and discuss the proposed school changes with the school staff and administration. If the concern cannot be resolved at this stage, then it may be brought to the Employee Relations Council.
Within a period of time appropriate to the nature of the implemented change, an evaluation will be performed including at a minimum the school administration and the teaching staff. The results of this evaluation will be presented to the Area Superintendent and the Parkway NEA President and will be communicated to the Board of Education. The communication tot the Board of Education may include a position statement by the Parkway NEA and the District administration.
49
1 Nothing in aforementioned agreement should be construed as a restriction upon the Association’s 2 rights under the Board/Parkway NEA Agreement to pursue the Grievance Procedure nor as a 3 waiver of rights of either the Parkway NEA nor the Board of Education the terms and conditions 4 of the agreement.
