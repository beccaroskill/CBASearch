APPENDIX (‘A”
Decisions of the Joint Industry Committee
The following decisions of the Joint Industry Committee were included as Appendix A to the Standard Agreement between NEU and the IUEC which expired on July 8,1987. The Company and the Union recognize these decisions as binding during the term of the present Agreement, except to the extent any of these decisions are in conflict with changes made to Article IV or Article IV(A) during negotiations for the present Agreement.
1.	Wiring of Car Stations
After due consideration of all the information that the Executive Board could gather, back as far as 1948, it was the decision of the Board that the Manufacturers be permitted to do the internal wiring in the car stations to a terminal block within the car station.
2.	Pre - Drilled Overhead Beams
Decision arrived at was that Otis would refrain from drilling holes on the bottom flange of the eye beam used to support the deflector sheave as soon as it was possible to stop the production line.
3.	Pre - Wiring of Controllers
On the protest registered over the pre-wiring of controllers, the employers agreed that the pre
105
wiring of cross connections on controllers would be discontinued and in the future, auxiliary panels would go out without any leads for any wiring on them.
The employers further agreed that there would be no objection to a local removing the wiring, and replacing it, until the situation is corrected.
4.	Multi - Wire Cable
The ruling of the Board was that the use of multi - wire cable has become prevalent throughout the Industry and they can find no objection to its use.
5,	Key Hole Slots
A review of past decisions and precedent established the fact that it had been previously agreed that key hole slots provided in car and/or landing doors are not a violation of Article IV of the Standard Agreement.
Also, it Is found that It had previously been agreed that holes provided in the factory for mounting of interlocks, safety edges, detectors and photocells, are not a violation of Article IV of the Standard Agreement.
When Door Closer arms, lazy arms, or relating arms are fastened to the doors by means of drilled and/or tapped holes on the door such drilling and tapping shall be done in the field by Elevator Constructors. In cases where doors are delivered to the job site, pre - drilled or tapped for such devices as referred to in this paragraph, doors will not be installed
106
until a satisfactory settlement between the employer and the Union is made.
6.	Escalators
It is agreed that the escalator truss or parts of truss maybe used as a shipping container lor escalator components, such as tracks, sprockets, etc. Such components shall be secured within the truss with only sufficient fastenings to provide safe transit and shall not be permanently aligned.
It shall not be a requirement that tracks be removed from the truss prior to final alignment.
Connections between the straight inclined track system and the upper and lower end curved track systems shall be made in the field by Elevator Constructors.
Upper and lower sprockets or carriages are to be installed in the field by Elevator Constructors. See Article IV, Par. 2, Item C for additional information.
7.	Extended Wiring On Controllers
Controllers are not to be shipped from the factory with extended wiring attached thereto.
In the case of escalator controllers, because of limited space available, extended wiring in the form of cables or separate wires may be connected at one end to the controller in the factory provided, however, that the other end of such extended wiring is not prepared for connections.
107
8	Plug - in Connections Door Protection
Prepared plug - in connections for door protection devices such as furnished on the photobeii protection device is not a violation of Article IV of the Standard Agreement.
9.	DMR Plug - in Connection
The plug connection presently being used on the DMR Regulating Unit will be discontinued. Factory installed wires leading out of the regulator shall have the loose ends unprepared for field connection by the Elevator Constructor,
It is agreed that the employer wiii use up present stock of regulators equipped with plugs. However, any regulators installed on new jobs after July 1, 1964, will be prepared as described in the above paragraph.
10.	Car Door Operators
Haughton Type ‘T’ and ‘TH’ and Westinghouse Type ‘E’ and other similar car door operators shall have the external wiring to the motor and the door or gate contact installed in the field by Elevator Constructors.

When wood flooring on elevator platforms, including stage lifts, organ consoles and orchestra elevators, is to be installed in the field the work shall be done by Elevator Constructors.
108
12.	Door Operators
(1)	The pattern for the Industry, for shipping door operators would be based on the practice in existence at the time of the Joint Industry Committee’s decision of December 12, 1963.
(2)	As a guide for present and future Joint industry Committees, it was determined that the following Exhibits would be used to settle any future dispute relative to the shipping of door operators and would be construed as examples of the practice in existence in December 9 - 12, 1963.
Exhibit 'A' (Haughton *T’ Operator as per photo dated 12/13/67)
Operators may be shipped as per this Exhibit except all external wiring, all greenfield, all greenfield connectors and the gate switch shall be removed.

14.	Holes Drilled In the Factory for the
Mounting of Sight Guards
shall not be considered a violation of Article IV of the Standard Agreement. The installation (and tapping if required), shall be done in the field by Elevator Constructors.
110
15.	Type M Hoistway Door Track Assembly (Haughton Elevator Company)
It was mutually agreed that the spirator would be removed and that the pre - drilling and tapping was covered by Decision #1 of the Joint Industry Committee dated December 12,1963,
16.	Pre - Fastening Booster or Blocking
Beams to Machine Beams (General Elevator Company of Baltimore)
The Joint industry Committee finds that General Elevator of Baltimore method of pre - fastening booster or blocking beams, as established and shown on Exhibit ‘A’ entitled “Standard Machine Beam Detail with Booster Beam" dated May 7, 1968 is not a violation of Article IV,
17.	Dover Leveling Switches
Dover Leveling Switches, as they are now constructed, are not a violation of the Standard Agreement.

It was agreed that the switch could be removed in the field and remounted.
20.	Otis Integral Hanger
That the primary function and responsibility of both the Union and the Industry is to assure a safe, reliable and workmanlike installation as regard door equipment. The employers agree that they cannot object to the dismantling of components if such becomes necessary to accomplish this.
(It continues:) There has been some question on interpretation of this ciause, therefore, it has been agreed that the application of this decision requires that the mechanic - in - charge use his discretion with regard to removal of the hanger bar to accomplish the stated objective. Management supervisors should not be critical or attempt to penalize the mechanic for using such discretion but if he questions the decision, it should be adjusted between the Construction Manager and the Local Business Representative.
At the 1954 meeting of the International Executive Board and the Manufacturers' Labor Committee, it was mutually agreed that:
The Executive Board believes that when Article IV, Paragraph 8, that states "NO restrictions shall be imposed as to methods, tools, or equipment used" was written in the Standard Agreement, neither party, at the time, had in mind lethal tools, therefore; we believe the members of the International Union have a
112
perfect right to refuse to use explosive powered tools.
21.	Cargo Masters 500 lbs. up to 1000 lbs.
All door assembly units must be removed before installation of car.
Pre - wiring of Cargo Master to be limited to door and ejector operation.
Ejector unit must be shipped separately.
The above conditions apply specifically to the Cargo Master with a capacity of 500 lbs. to 1000 lbs. as manufactured by Guilbert, Inc., and are not to be applied to the D/W provision of Article IV, Paragraph 3, Item 3, of the Standard Agreement.
22.	Procedure For One Man Pressure Relief Valve Test
At a meeting of the National Arbitration Committee held on February 8, 1984, at the Sheraton Bal Harbour, Bal Harbour, Florida, it was jointly agreed that pressure relief valve test work may be performed by one mechanic so long as the following procedure is followed:
Item 1. The elevator must be equipped with a quick release coupling to which a pressure gauge could be connected.
Item 2. The Elevator Constructor mechanic is to be supplied with a temporary run button (the cable is to be of a length which would permit the Elevator Constructor to position himself outside of the ma
113
chine room or the hoistway while performing the test).
Item 3. With the elevator at the top floor, doors closed, shut off the main line disconnect.
Item 4. Disconnect one wire, which places the elevator on inspection, add one jumper on the directional limit, one jumper on the final limit, and connect the temporary run button to the appropriate terminals.
Item 5. Connect the pressure gauge to the quick release coupling.
Item 6. Put in the main line disconnect and position yourseif outside of the machine room and/or hoistway and using the temporary run button, run the elevator up against the stop ring until you observe (hear) the bypass valve open.
Item 7. After checking the pressure gauge the mechanic is to open the bottom hoistway door and observe the cylinder and pipe for possible damage or leakage.

Dear (Company Representative):
In our recently concluded negotiations, it was agreed that all new employees hired after the effective date of the collective bargaining agreement would be classified as probationary apprentices. Accordingly, the agreement does not affect the probationary status of existing employees who would still be probationary helpers, having been hired within the six months preceding the effective date of our new agreement.
This is to confirm our understanding and agreement that any individual who is still a probationary helper as of the effective date of our new agreement, will upon the completion of his probationary period, receive 70% of Mechanic’s rate, plus fringe benefit and will remain at that rate until such time as he is qualified and meets the requirements as a fourth year apprentice.

The Company agrees to meet and discuss the effects of such mergers on a local by local basis. Such discussions shall include but are not limited to hiring, expense agreements and oper । ler r itory between the merged locals.
There shall be no change in any term or condition of employment under the Standard Agreement or any local expense agreement until such time as the parties reach a mutual agreement as to such changes.
It is further agreed that such discussions are to begin as expeditiously as possible following the conclusion of negotiations for a new Standard Agreement.
Very truly yours,
Company Representative
AGREED:

Re: Letter of Agreement
Dear Dana:
This memorandum details the agreement between the parties concerning potential conflicts between the Company's Alcohol and Drug Policy and those policies provided by customers as a precondition for securing contracts for the Company.
The Company wifi continue its practice of applying good faith efforts to apply its own policy. Should these efforts be unsuccessful and a customer insists on implementation of their own policy, the Company may institute such policies to the extent necessary to obtain the work.
Good faith efforts by the Company to avoid using the customer’s policy will include:
1.	Advising the customer that the Company has agreed with the IUEC to a comprehensive company wide policy that addresses the maintenance of a safe and healthy work environment for its employees, and that it does not wish to apply any additional or different regulations.
2.	If written confirmation of the company's position fails to change the customer's position, the Company will attempt to obtain customer ap
127
proval to as much of its policy as possible.
3.	If the customer insists on the complete substitution of its policy for the Company’s policy, the Company shall then seek volunteers to man said jobs.
4.	The Company will not discipline, discharge or lay off employees solely due to their refusal to volunteer. However, such employees may be laid off if there is not sufficient other work to which they may be assigned.
5.	The IUEC recognizes the importance of securing adequate volunteers and will cooperate in assisting in efforts to secure tnem.
This agreement shall remain if effect for one year unless extended in writing by the parties.
Company Representative
