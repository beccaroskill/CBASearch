Bargaining unit members who are elected or appointed to positions within the Association that enable the member to participate in activities that will promote and enhance the profession of nursing on a statewide or national level will be eligible to draw from a bank of one-hundred (100) hours on an annual basis. Such time will be prescheduled. One-hundred (100) hours will be available beginning with calendar year 2000.
3.06 Appointment to Position.
Any appointment to a position will entitle an employee to a written notice that will include the salary rate, starting date, shift, breakdown of differentials and a copy of the job descriptions. A copy of employees' handbook and contract, the latter supplied by the Association, shall be given. Employer will make available to new employees appropriate forms and information regarding membership in the Association.
Employee transfer requests will be acknowledged by the appropriate manager within two (2) weeks, unless he/she is unavailable due to absence.

3.07 Staffing.
Every effort will be made to provide appropriate personnel for each nursing care unit commensurate with the patient care requiremer Is, staff expertise, availability of support services and method of patient care delivery.
The admission system will support participation from the nursing service in coordinating patient requirements for nursing care with available resources.
Should persistent shortages or problems in providing appropriate patient care be identified, the Employer will take the necessary steps to resolve these problems.
Nursing management will consider staffing patterns in evalcating incidents that occur on patient care units.
In the event a registered nurse determines in his/her professional opinion that he/she has been given an assignment that does not allow for appropriate patient care, he/she shall notify the Supervisor or designee who will then come to the Unit to assess the staffing. Such assessment shall be documented with a copy given to the employee. After notification to the supervisor or designee the RN may file a Protest of Assignment (POA).
Staffing Levels/Nurse-to-Patient Ratios
Recognizing the importance of adequate staffing for the provision of quality patient care, the Employer and the Association recognize th at there should be an appropriate number of staff on each unit. Staffing levels shall be based, in part, on an assessment of the patients on the unit, the u fit’s average daily census/visits, and the competency of the personnel on the unit.
Staffing patterns and staffing distribution are designed to meet the nursing care needs of groups of patients within the framework of pertinent nstitutional factors and resources.
The parties agree that the determination of staffing needs is a constant, dynamic process influenced by a number of factors including: patient acuity, technology, unit and hospital census, standards of professional practices, resources, competency of staff, staff mix, productivity, vacancies (including leaves of absence, vacation, etc.), unplanned absences (including sick calls, emergencies, etc.), service specialty, nature of services, needs and acuity of both the Hospital and unit patient population, and applicable federal, state, local and JCAHO regulations.
The Association and the Employer have agreed to implement the following Staffing Levels/Nurse-To-Patient Ratios (the “Ratios") effective on ratification of the 2005-2009 contract.

Meetings
Recognizing the importance of communications in the monitoring, assessment and adjustment of staffing levels on an ongoing basis, the parties agree to the following:
1.	Each month the Hospital will provide NYSNA with relevant data regarding the staffing levels in each nursing unit.
2.	All nursing units will discuss staffing issues at least once per month at the regularly scheduled nursing unit staff meeting. Staff RNs v>ill be encouraged to participate and partner with Nurse Managers on issue resolution. Any unresolved issues may be brought by NYSNA for review at Care Center leadership meetings on an expeditious basis.
3.	At each monthly Care Center Leadership meeting one houi will be dedicated to address and resolve those outstanding staffing issues identified by
11
NYSNA in writing to the Care Center Clinical Director of Nursing at least one week when possible prior to the scheduled meeting. Staff RNs selected by the nurses on the unit and a NYSNA representative will participate in all discussions.
Data review at these meeting may include but not be limited to recent staff schedules, staffing levels, protests of assignments (POA), admission/discharge logs (Weiler), adjustment sheets (Moses), payroll sheets, sick calls, LOAs, voluntary and mandatory overtime, management assessment of POAs, ancillary assignment staffing sheets, census per shift, daily census and other data relevant to staffing.
4.	Any staffing issue not resolved at the Care Center meetings may be brought forward by the parties to the monthly Labor Management meeting for discussion and resolution.
5.	The Resolutions reached by the Employer and Association at any of the foregoing stages of this process may result, as an example, in the addition or adjustment of personnel resources.
6.	NYSNA General Representatives may attend any of the above meetings.
Mediation
Either party may request the assistance of a Federal mediator to help resolve issues. A NYSNA General Representative will attend meetings with the mediator.
Grievance
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event a grievance arises concerning compliance with the Ratios, the grievance may be adjusted in accordance with the following procedure. The Association may submit a grievance in writing to the Senior Vice President of Operations. If no resolution of the grievance is obtained within fourteen (14) calendar days of the grievance submission, the Association may submit the grievance to arbitration by sending a written demand to the Employer’s Vice President for Human Resources within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the conclusion of the fourteen (14) day resolution period.
The grievance shall be heard by the arbitrator with the first available date selected from the list of five (5) mutually agreed upon arbitrators listed in Exhibit B.
The arbitrator’s authority will be limited to determining whether the Employer has failed, without justification, to adhere to the Ratios. A decision will be rendered within thirty (30) calendar days from the close of the hearing.
Isolated incidents of understaffing or isolated failures to comply strictly with the Ratios will not be considered by the arbitrator as evidence of understaffing. The sole remedy the arbitrator is empowered to award is a directive to the Employer to adhere to the Ratios.
In the event the Employer intends to (a) change a nursing unit’s specialty or mix of patients (the “Affected Unit") or (b) open a new nursing unit (the "New Unit"),
12
the Employer will notify the Association in writing of such intention. Within ten (10) calendar days of the notification date, the Employer’s Chief Nurse, together with the Director of Nursing and Nurse Manager of the Affected Unit or New Unit, will meet Association representatives and staff nurse s of the Affected Unit or New Unit, to discuss the Ratio of the Affected Unit or the New Unit.
Following such discussion, the Employer's Chief Nurse; will determine and implement the nursing unit’s Ratio based on the factors sest forth in the second and third paragraphs following the heading "Staffing Le'-els/Nurse-To-Patient Ratios" in this section 3.07 (the "Factors”) and the Ratios for similar nursing units.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event the Association disagrees with the Chief Nurse’s decision, thu disagreement may be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the following procedure. The Association may submit a grievance in writing to the Sen or Vice President of Operations within ten (10) calendar days of the Chief Nuse's decision. If no resolution of the grievance is obtained within fourteen (14) calendar days of the grievance submission, the Association may submit the grievance to arbitration by sending a written demand for arbitration to the Employer’s Vice President for Human Resources within twenty-one (21) calendar days :jf the conclusion of the fourteen (14) day resolution period. The grievance s iall be heard by an arbitrator selected as set forth above. The issue to be determined by the arbitrator will be “Is the Employer's Ratio consistent with the Factors and Ratios for similar nursing units?" If the arbitrator finds the Ratio is not consistent with the Factors and the Ratios for similar nursing units, then the sole remedy the arbitrator is empowered to award is a directive to the Employer to reassess its Ratios.
The following provisions will be applicable to the Dispute resolution mechanisms described in this section 3.07.
a.	The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties.
b.	If the grievance is not submitted within the time period specified, it will be barred. The parties may extend the specified time period by mutual agreement in writing.
c.	The arbitrator shall not have any power to add tc, subtract from or otherwise amend this Agreement.
d.	The fees and expenses of the arbitrator will be shared equally by the parties.

13
4.03 Regular Part-Time Employee.
An employee who has completed the probationary period and regularly works at least thirty-seven and one-half (37-1/2) hours in a pay period is a regular part-time employee. This employee can be counted on by the Employer to fulfill, on an annual basis, a schedule established by the Employer and communicated to the employee. A regular part-time employee will be eligible for pro rata benefits and will accrue seniority, sick time, holiday, and vacation based on actual hours paid up to full-time.
4.04 Per Diem Employee.
An employee who is not employed on a regular basis, but who works on a day to day basis as needed by Employer is a per diem employee. Transfer to regular part-time or full-time status must be requested in writing and approved by the Director of Nursing. These employees shall be eligible only for the salary schedule and grievance procedure and shall not be eligible for any benefits. Per Diem employees will be given one and one half (11/2) hours' notice of cancellation of a scheduled shift or they will be paid for that shift.
Per diem employees will be paid for work performed on any of the eight (8) holidays designated in Section 7.01 at time and one half (1-1/2) the appropriate Schedule A-1.04 rate.
4.05 Per Visit Employee.
An employee who is employed on an as-needed basis to work per visit. These employees shall be eligible only for the salary schedule and grievance procedure.
4.06 Temporary Employee.

The said period may be extended by the Employer at its option up to an additional three (3) months or for the length of the leave of the employee being replaced, whichever is greater. These employees will be eligible for benefits and the grievance and arbitration procedures under this agreement after three (3) months of employment.
If, however, temporary employees are retained beyond six (6) months in continual employment, the accrual of vacation and sick leave will be from the first (1st) day of employment. Temporary employees will receive holiday pay in the same manner as regular employees.
Contributions to the New York State Nurses Association Pension Plan will not be made on behalf of employees unless and until they begin regular employment, in which case such contributions shall commence for the payroll period in which they are made regular.
4.07 Probationary Period.
A regular employee will be on probation until the employee has actually worked four (4) months following employment, excluding time lost for illness and other leaves. The Employer may extend this probationary period up to two (2) months upon notification to the employee and the Association of the reason for such extension. A regular part-time employee shall be on probation for six (6)
14
months. During the probationary period, the employe a will be subject to demotion, suspension, other discipline or discharge at Employer's sole discretion, without recourse to the grievance procedure, but will otherwise be covered by this agreement, except that an employee shall be entitled to grieve contract violations upon completion of the probationary period.

4.12	Seniority: Application.
Bargaining unit seniority shall apply in the computation and determination of eligibility for all benefits where length of service is a factor pursuant to this agreement.
Vacation time selection on each identified patient unit will be based on bargaining unit seniority where separate seniority lists will be maintained. Bargaining unit seniority will apply to position elimination, displacement, layoff and recall.
4.13	Seniority: Lists.
Employer will, on execution of this agreement, and every year thereafter, by October 1, post and furnish the Association with seniority lists and will correct such lists from time to time as may be necessary.

Employer and Association will permit alteration of the normal workday and workweek to permit other systems and scheduling of work time. Changes in the workday (5.01) or workweek (5.02) for the purpose of instituting an alternative work schedule shall be permitted at its inception after the mutual agreement of the Employer and the Association. Also see Addendum F.
5.04 Work Obligation: Employee.
An employee will work hours assigned and such additional reasonable hours as Employer may request. See Addendum D.
5.05 Work Schedules.

5.07 Position EliminationlEmployee DisplacementlLayoff.
A.	Notification
The Employer will officially notify the Association no Ie ss than forty-five (45) calendar days prior to any position elimination/disp acement/layoff. The notification date shall be the date that establishes the seniority list. A seniority list and applicable Available Position List(s) will be included with the notification.
The Employer will discuss the impact of layoffs and e'.mination of positions with the Association prior to the issuance of the forty-five (45) calendar days notice.
The purpose of the notification will be to achieve two (2) goals. First, to allow the parties time to meet and discuss alternatives to position elimination such as job sharing, voluntary LOA, separation incentive, and contractual adjustment. Secondly, if position elimination cannot be avoided, the parties will work towards achieving the least amount of workplace disruption as possible.
B.	Definitions:
1.	Position - a regularly scheduled job assignment designated by shift, schedule (flex/standard), unit and title performed by a full or part-time employee. In the event modifications to job assignments cause the Employer to change the unit's Clinical Division, these positions will be considered eliminated. However, prior to implementing the displacement procedure, employees, based on seniority, will have the option to voluntarily choose the newly modified positions.
2.	Comparable Position Vacancy - a vacancy with ihe same schedule (flex/standard) status (FT I PT), shift, title, clinical division and the reasonable expectation that a nurse can become proficient with one month of education.
3.	Available Position List - a list of positions available to a displaced employee.
There are three types of available position lists, A, B, C.
The Available Position List(s) will not include positions that have either been promised in writing to an employee through the transfer process or positions that have not yet been offered to employees through section 4.16 “Posting of Available Positions.”
For purposes of displacement, these positions will not be deemed as probationary unless the employee is a new associate serving a new associate probationary period.
A.	A list that includes Comparable Position Vacancies that equal or exceed the number of displaced employees must in addition include all vacant positions, throughout the Medical Center and Per Diem Converted position vacancies within the Clinical Division.
19
B.	A list without sufficient Comparable Position Vacancies will include, in addition to the vacancies on List A, all probationary employees and least senior employees in the clinical division or within the constituent unit.
The least senior employee list equals the number of displaced employees who have not chosen a position.
C.	The list of employees displaced from a constituent unit will include all vacant positions, probationary employees and per diem converted positions in the Medical Center.
4.	Per Diem Converted Position - is a position that is declared a vacancy when, during the immediately preceding 12 months it has been regularly occupied by per diem employees. In addition, there must be a reasonable expectation that in the near future a full or part time employee will not be returning from leave to occupy the position.
The creation of a new position will not increase the total number of scheduled hours on the unit, provided also the displaced nurse must accept the work schedule as was required of the per diem nurse.
5.	Displaced Employee - an employee whose position has been eliminated, or has been bumped. Displaced employees do not have to take a position, they can choose to be laid off.
6.	Qualified - an employee is qualified for a position if he/she meet the minimum requirements.
Employees may choose any position for which they are qualified, from the appropriate Available Position List.
The Director of Nursing will determine minimum requirements and such determinations will not be arbitrary or capricious.
7.	Clinical Division - See Addendum K
8.	Orientation - an educational program, designed to bring the individual to a point where he/she can independently provide appropriate quality care.
9.	Seniority - all seniority is bargaining unit seniority. All choices and decisions are made by displaced employees based on seniority.
C.	Procedure:
When employees occupy positions that are being eliminated the following procedure will be followed:
1.	The Employer will identify the Positions being eliminated.
2.	Each displaced employee will be given the appropriate Available Position List: A, B OR C.
3,	Displacement within a unit will be by seniority. If an abolished position is occupied by someone other than the least senior employee in the unit, then the displaced nurse(s) may assume the position of the least senior nurse In the unit.
4.	Employees displaced from a unit may choose from the available position list “A", derived from a clinical division. If an "A" list is unavailable,
20
choices are from a “B" list. Employees displaced rom a clinical division may choose from a constituent unit Available Position “B" list. Employees displaced from a constituent unit n ay choose from the Available Position List “C".
Available position lists are adjusted as each employee makes a decision. In no case within each step of the displacement process will a more senior employee be bumped while a less senior remains in position.
D.	Education / Orientation:
Employees who are displaced will have the opportunity for an orientation to their new position based on individual clinical competency. Each employee will have input into the development of his/her individual orientation plan. A copy will be given to the employee and the Association upon their request.
Employees on orientation will be assigned a precepto and receive didactic instruction, as determined by the mutually developed or entation plan.
Employees who do not successfully complete the orientation may have their orientation extended, may transfer with the concurrence of the Director of Nursing or may accept layoff in accordance with this section.
E.	Terminal Benefits and Recall:
Employees affected by layoff who can not be immediately placed in a position throughout Montefiore Medical Center will receive the terminal benefits in section 10.01 and be placed on recall.

Addendum A
Intent of 1980 -1983 Negotiations
This will serve to confirm the parties' intent regarding certain issues which were not incorporated in the body of the collective bargaining agreement between the parties dated January 15,1980 through January 15, 1983. The following reflects the intent of the parties:
Montefiore Hospital
Each Nursing Unit will be notified of its Table of Organization and any proposed change.
Comprehensive Health Care Center
An employee employed at the Comprehensive Health Care Center will have a one-half (1/2) hour meal period and the two fifteen (15) minute rest periods may be taken with this one-half (1/2) hour meal period to make it a one (1) hour meal period.
All Constituent Units
All constituent unit Chairpersons will be given a Salary Schedule Plan clearly showing all incumbent salaries breaking them down into base rates and appropriate differentials. Upon request, this same Salary Schedule Plan will be provided to each practitioner covered by this agreement.
Continuation of Experience Differential, Tuition Refund and Uniform Allowance Benefits
An employee who resigns from a position at the Montefiore Medical Center and accepts another position at one of the facilities listed above, shall be considered a new employee at that facility except the employee will be considered an incumbent employee for the purposes of application of the experience differential, tuition refund and uniform allowance, if applicable, and will be paid the incumbent rate based on their prior position.

60
Addendum B
CHANGE IN PERSONNEL POLICY CONTROL OF EXCESSIVE ABSENTEEISM AND LATENESS III -14
The Employer will amend its Personnel Policy, 111-14, to exclude situations in which Nurses are sent home by the Employees' Health Service physicians due to the fact that they have been exposed to an Infectious agent on the job which could potentially jeopardize the health of patients or fellow employees. As an example, in the case where an employee has been exposed to Varicella on the job and is sent home, the time off the job is not to be counted in evaluating whether an employee has developed a pattern of excessive absenteeism.
The Employees' Health Service Physicians will provide the necessary information to management to clearly identify the situation.
