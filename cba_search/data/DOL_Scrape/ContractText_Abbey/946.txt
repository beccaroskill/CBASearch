AGREEMENT
Agreement by and between the San Diego County Chapter, National Electrical Contractors Association and Local Union 569, LB.E.W.
It shall apply to all firms who sign a Letter of Assent to be bound by this Agreement.
As used hereinafter in this Agreement, the term ‘'Chapter" shall mean the San Diego County Chapter, National Electrical Contractors Association and the term "Union" shall mean Local Union 569, LB.E.W.
The term "Employer" shall also mean an individual firm who has been recognized by an Assent to this Agreement.
BASIC PRINCIPLES
The "Employer" and the "Union" have a common and sympathetic interest in the Electrical Industry; therefore, a working system and harmonious relations are necessary to improve the relationship between the "Employer" and "Union" and the Public. Progress in the industry demands a mutuality of confidence between the "Employer" and "Union". All will benefit by continuous peace and by the adjusting of any differences by rational, common sense methods. To these ends, this Agreement is made.

ARTICLE II EMPLOYER RIGHTS - UNION RIGHTS
Section 2.01. Contractor Qualifications, (a) Certain qualifications, knowledge, experience and financial responsibility are required of everyone desiring to be an Employer in the Electrical Industry. An Employer who contracts for electrical work is a person, firm or corporation, whose principal business is that of electrical contracting, having these qualifications and maintaining a permanent place of business and a suitable financial status to meet payroll requirements. To determine financial responsibility, each Employer requesting an Agreement must submit a financial statement prepared by a Certified Public Accountant. The Employer's place of business shall be manned during the regular working hours or have connected thereto a telephone answering service.

Such working member of the firm (Employer) shall have certain qualifications, knowledge, experience, and shall perform work only during the regular working hours under the terms of this Agreement.
Section 2.01 (c) Working Member of the Firm. Section 2.01 requires that a firm must have suitable financial status to meet payroll requirements. To insure the continued financial responsibility of the firm, if a firm should designate one of its members who does not have a substantial financial interest in the firm, a working member of the firm; the firm must include along with the written notice to the Union the personal guarantee of such member. Such guarantee shall cover all payroll requirements of the firm, including the payment of all wages and fringe benefits due.
Section 2.01 (d) License. Members of the Union, except those meeting the requirement of "Employer" as defined herein, shall not contract for any electrical work. Any member of the IBEW possessing a C-10 license while subject to employment under terms of this Agreement, shall maintain same on an inactive status.
Section 2.02. Management Rights. The Union understands the Employer is responsible to perform the work required by the owner. The Employer shall, therefore, have no restrictions except those specifically provided for in the collective bargaining agreement, in planning, directing and controlling the operation of all his work, in deciding the number and kind of employees to properly perform the work, in hiring and laying off employees, in transferring employees from job
6
to job within the Local Union’s geographical jurisdiction, in determining the need and number as well as the person who will act as Foreman, in requiring all employees to observe the Employer’s and/or owner’s rules and regulations not inconsistent with this Agreement, in requiring all employees to observe all safety regulations and in discharging employees for proper cause.
Section 2.03. (a) INSURANCE. For all employees covered by this Agreement, the Employer shall carry Workmen's Compensation Insurance with a company authorized to do business in this State, Social Security, and such other protective insurance as may be required by the laws of this State, and shall furnish satisfactory proof of such to the Union. He shall make payments to the California Unemployment Compensation Commission for all employees covered by the terms of this Agreement.
Section 2.04. SURETY. It is agreed that the Employer will post a surety bond or cash deposit in the amount of $10,000.00 as surety for the foregoing, either in the form of cash or in the form of a surety bond. If said sum be posted in cash, it shall be deposited in a Trust Account usable for the purposes outlined below. The bond shall provide that it may not be terminated without fifteen (15) days prior written notice to the Employer and the Local Union. The aforesaid cash or surety bond is specifically intended to assure payment forthwith, to the extent of said cash or bond pursuant to monetary awards by any or all of the following agencies:

(b)	The Labor-Management Committee and/or the Council on Industrial Relations, as the case may be, shall have full power to determine the amount of money due, if any, and shall direct payments of delinquent wages from the Bond directly to the affected employees and direct payments of delinquent fund contributions from the Bond directly to the Trustees of the affected funds or to their designated agents.
Section 2.05. The Employer agrees that, if it has not previously done so, it will recognize the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining agent for all employees performing electrical construction work within the jurisdiction of the Union on all present and future jobsites, if and when a majority of the Employer’s employees authorizes the Union to represent them in collective bargaining.
Section 2.06. (a) In order to protect and preserve, for the employees covered by this Agreement, all work heretofore performed by them, and in order to prevent any device or subterfuge to avoid the protection and preservation of such work, it is hereby agreed as follows: If and when the Employer shall perform any on-site construction work of the type covered by this Agreement, under its own name or under the name of another, as a corporation, company, partnership, or any other business entity including a joint-venture, wherein the Employer, through its officers, directors, partners or stockholders, exercises either directly or indirectly, management
7
control or majority ownership, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be applicable to all such work. All charges or violations of this Section shall be considered as a dispute and shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement covering the procedure for the handling of grievances and the final and binding resolution of disputes.
(b)	As a remedy for violations of this Section, the Labor-Management Committee, the Council on Industrial Relations for the Electrical Contracting Industry and/or an independent arbitrator, as the case may be, are empowered, in their discretion and at the request of the Union, to require an Employer to (1) pay to affected employees covered by this Agreement, including registered applicants for employment, the equivalent of wages lost by such employees as a result of the violations; and (2) pay into the affected joint trust funds established under this Agreement any delinquent contributions to such funds which have resulted from the violations. Provision for this remedy herein does not make such remedy the exclusive remedy available to the Union for violation of this Section nor does it make the same or other remedies unavilable to the Union for violations of other Sections or other Articles of this Agreement.
(c)	If, as a result of violations of this Section, it is necessary for the Union and/or the trustees of the joint trust funds to institute court action to enforce an award rendered in accordance with subsection (b) above, or to defend an action which seeks to vacate such award, the Employer shall pay any accountants’ and attorneys’ fees incurred by the Union and/or fund trustees, plus cost of the litigation, which have resulted from the bringing of such court action.

Local Union 569, IBEW shall indemnify and hold harmless the San Diego County Chapter, NECA, its Board of Directors, Committees, individual members and all their agents and employees from and against all claims, damages, losses and expenses, including but not limited to attorneys’ fees, arising out of or resulting from the presence of Section 2.06 in this Agreement or from the implementation of Section 2.06 in this Agreement, regardless of whether the claims, damages, losses and expenses are caused in part by a party indemnified hereunder. Such obligations shall not be construed to negate, or abridge, or otherwise reduce any other right or obligation of indemnity which would otherwise exist as to any party indemnified hereunder.
Section 2.07. An employer signatory to a collective bargaining agreement or to a letter of assent to an agreement with another IBEW Local Union, who signs an assent to this Agreement, may bring up to four bargaining unit employees employed in that Local Union’s jurisdiction into this Local’s jurisdiction and up to two bargaining unit employees per job from that Local’s jurisdiction to this Local’s jurisdiction for specialty or service and maintenance work.
