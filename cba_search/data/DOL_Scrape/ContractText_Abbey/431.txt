ARTICLE 31 WAGE PRACTICES
GENERAL
31.0	1 Part I shews the composition of the wage zones. Part II of Wage
Rates and Progressions in this Article shows the top basic weekly wage rate for each occupational classification, by wage zone, and the reference number of the applicable wage progression table. Part III shows tlie wage progression tables. Part IV shows the Pension bands for each occupational classification. Part V shows die monthly Pension benefit for each Pension band.
APPLICATION OF THE WAGE PROGRESSION TABLES
31.0	2 Each Wage Progression Table consists of columns of Intervals in
months and Rates of Pay for each applicable Wage Zone. The normal interval for increase consideration in months, is shown opposite tlie basic weekly wage to which it applies. Thus Jie normal increase treatment for any employee is determined by locating his basic weekly rate on the appropriate table.
31.0	3 When an employee’s rate on entry into an occupational
classification is between rates shown on die table, the employee normally will be increased to the next higher rate on the table in a period of time which is the same proportion to a full interval as the amount of increase is to a full progression step. 1 lowever, if it would be more favorable to the employee, he shall first receive a full step progression increase in a full interval and dien be adjusted to the next higher rate on the table in a proportionately shortened interval. In either event, die employee shall receive credit for any amount earned since his last progression increase under Section 31.11 of this Article.
31.0	4 Progression under each table ceases with attainment of the applicable top rate.
31.0	5 The effective date of a normal wage progression increase shall be the first day of the payroll week in which the specified interval ends.
If this date falls within a period of absence exceeding sever (?) calendar days, the dtite die employee’s return to duty shall be die effective date, but the date determined in the first sentence shall be used as the date from which the interval for die next increase will be measured.
31.0	6 The number of days by which any period of continuous absence exceeds thirty (30) days shall be added to the normal time interval specified for wage progression.
78
243_PLANT_V14	12/13/04	10:>KAM Page 79
31.07 Part-time employees will be given the same increase treatment as
full-time employees except that the amount of wage increase shall
be in proportion to the number of hours worked.
PAYMENT FOR EMPLOYEES
PERMANENTLY TRANSFERRED
PERMANENT TRANSFERS INVOLVING A CHANGE IN WAGE PROGRESSION TABLE WITHOUT CHANGE IN OCCUPATIONAL CLASSIFICATION
31.0	8 When an employee is permanently transferred, without chtinge in occupational classification, from one location to another location and the applicable wage progression table for the new location provides for a higher rate at any step in that table, die employee's rate of pay shall be raised as necessary to reflect any difference, at his assumed length of service in die occupational classification, between the wage progression tables applicable to the two locations.
31.0	9 When an employee is jiermanently transferred, without change in
occupational classification, from one location to another location
and the applicable wage progression table for tlie new location provides for a lower rate at any step in that table, unless required by the new top nite, the employee’s rate of pay shall not be lowered, but any further wage progression shall be calculated on the same basis as though his rate had been lowered to reflect any difference, at his assumed length of service in the occupational classification, between the wage progression tables applicable to the two locations.
TEMPORARY TRANSFERS INVOLVING A CHANGE IN WAGE PROGRESSION TABLE WITHOUT CHANGE IN OCCUPATIONAL CLASSIFICATION
31.10	When an employee is temporarily transferred for one or more full
days, without change in occupation classification, from one
location to another location the applicable wage progression table for the new location provides for a higher rate at any step in that table, the employee shall be paid his regular weekly rate plus, for each fiill day worked in such location, 1/5 of any difference, at his assumed length of service in the occupational classification, between the wage progression tables applicable to the two locations. In no event shall the amount of the increase in a payroll week exceed the full difference between the two wage progression tables.
79
243_PLANT_V14 12/13/04 10:frh,AM Page 80
ASSUMED LENGTH OF SERVICE
31.11	For the purposes of Sections 31.08,31.09 and 31.10 an employee s assumed length of service in the occupational classification shall be calculated by determining the length of time required for normal progression from the minimum rate of die occupational classification to his current rate (including time spent at his current rate if less than the top rate) on the wage progression table applicable to the location from which he is being transferred.
PERMANENT TRANSFERS INVOLVING A CHANGE IN OCCUPATIONAL CLASSIFICATION ONLY
31.12	When an employee is penn:mently transferred from one occupational classification to another occupational classification with no change in the wage progression table required due to a change in location and if the employee’s rate of pay is less than die top basic weekly rate for new occupational classification, the nonnal amount of, time interval to, the employee’s next scheduled wage increase shall be as specified for his rate of pay in the wage progression table for his new occupational classification. Such time interval shall be measured from the date of his transfer except that, if die employee was below the top rate for his old occupational classification, he shall be allowed credit for time since his last increase, taking into account the normal amount of the next scheduled increase in his old classification.
PERMANENT TRANSFERS INVOLVING BOTH A CHANGE IN LOCATION AND A CHANGE IN OCCUPATIONAL CLASSIFICATION
31.13	When an employee is permanendy transferred simultaneously between locations having different applicable wage progression tables and between occupational classifications, his new rate and progression treatment shall be determined by first applying the rules applicable to “Permanent Transfers Involving a Change in Wage Progression Table Without Change in Occupational Classification” and then applying to the new situation thus created die rules applicable to “Permanent Transfers Involving a Change in Occupational Classification Only."
31.14	When an employee is temporarily transferred simultaneously between locations having different applicable wage progression tables and between occupational classifications, his treatment shall be determined by first applying the rules applicable to “Temporary Transfers Involving a Change in Wage Progression Table Without Change in Occupational Classification" and then applying to the new situation thus created the rules applicable to “Wage Treatment for Promotions or Assignments."

Dear Mr. Littell:
Presently under the High Crime Award, any grievances arising out of the implementation of this Award are referred directly to die Area Director's level of the Union and the Assistant Vice President, Personnel Relations, level of the Company.
In the interest of screening out those grievances which can be settled expeditiously at the local level and at the same time keeping die number of grievances coming to our level at a minimum, I recommend that vre institute a first step grievance level. Using Local 1101 as tin example, this could be at die Division Steward level of the Union meeting with the District Plant Superintendent for the Company. Any grievances not resolved at this level could then be appealed in accordance with Article 7 of die High Crime Award. Note: See below
If you concur, would you so indicate by signing and returning one copy of this letter to me. This agreement could go into effect as of July 1,1968.

Dear Mr. Sanchez;
This will confirm our understanding regarding employees whose term of employment is less than two years but more than six months with tlie Company.
Provided the Stipulation of this date is ratified, these employees will be eligible on June 1,1969. for sickness disability benefits consisting of half pay for 52 weeks beginning with the eighth calendar day of sickness absence. These benefits will be provided under tlie Company’s "Plan for Employees’ Pensions, Disability Benefits and Death Benefits." Il is understood that the Company will undertake to obtain, through insurance with an insurance carrier, a policy to provide all such employees with supplementary payments of half pay for the first two weeks’ of absence due to illness covered by the Plan. In effect, payments for covered absence will be provided at the rate of full pay for two weeks and at the rate of half pay for 50 weeks. The premiums for this insurance of two weeks at half pay will be paid for by all of these employees through payroll allotment with no contributions by the Company.
Employees whose term of employment is less than six months will continue to be eligible for payments of two weeks' full pay and 11 weeks’ half pay beginning with the eighth calendar day of sickness absence. These payments are presently provided by an insurance policy which qualifies under the New' York Suite Disability Benefits Law. Payment for tlie employee s share of the cost of this insurance coverage is deducted from die employee's pay at the rate of one-half of one percent of weekly wages not to exceed tliirty cents per week.
Please indicate your concurrence with the foregoing on behalf of the Union by signing and dating the attached carbon copy of this letter.

Dear Mr. Sanchez:
In accordance with our recent discussions concerning transfers for switchmen who do not haw the necessary technical qualifications to perform the work in the Area to which they have requested transfer, the following is proposed as a new Letter of Agreement superseding our Letter of Agreement dated April 3. 1970.
Tlie Company agrees to cross train one out of four switchmen, as required, in order to qualify them technically for transfer to a particular Area. One list will be maintained for all qualified and unqualified switchmen. This list will be maintained and transfers administered in accordance with the normal rotational cycle as described in Article 36 of the collective bargaining agreement subject to the following conditions:
1.	Using one list, the senior switchmen will be selected in accordance with the normal Area rotational cycle.
2.	If the first four senior switchmen to be selected from the Area lists in accordance with the normal rotational cycle are unqualified, die first man in die cycle will be cross trained and transferred. The selection process will then proceed through the Areas in the normal rotational cycle, bypassing senior unqualified switchmen until 3 qualified switchmen are selected, This entails bypassing senior unqualified switchmen in Areas within the normal rotational cycle in order to select qualified switchmen. In selecting for die next cycle of four, the first unqualified switchman previously bypassed will be cross trained. The 3 qualified switchmen required to complete the cycle of four will be selected from the Area lists beginning with the Area following the end of die previous cycle of 4. In effect, the switchman to be cross trained will be the one with the earliest "bypass" date.
3.	Under no circumstances will qualified switchmen be bypassed by unqualified ones within the same "From" Area.
164
243_PLANT_V14
12/13/04 10:jlrS,AM Page 165
4.	If there are no senior qualified switchmen on the list to a particular Area, the Company will train one unqualified man even' time four are required based on existing vacancies. The remaining 3 vacancies will be filled at the discretion of the receiving Area by either hiring or accepting additional unqualified switchmen in accordance with the normal rotational cycle.
5.	The one out of four agreement will be carried over from month to month on a cumulative basis in groups of four. For example, if one switchman is required to be transferred each month to Suffolk because of existing vacancies, an unqualified man will be selected and transferred die first month. In each of the three succeeding months we will select the senior qualified switchman from the list in the normal rotational cycle.
6.	The [ruining will be done, after the transfer is made, at the discretion of management in die receiving Area.
7-	The Upstate territory is excluded from this Agreement.
8.	If a man selected for cross training is sent to switching school and fails to successfully complete the course, he shall be considered not qualified and will be returned to his original location immedi-ately without D.T.A. payments. A replacement will be selected from the same transfer list. The returned switchman shall not be eligible for further cross training for transfer purposes. He will be removed from the transfer list. However, if he submits a new request for transfer to an Area for which he is qualified, he will be placed on the next transfer list issued in October.
If you concur, please sign die attached copy of this letter and return to me. These arrangements will become effective one month after receipt of your signed letter.

Dear Mr. Ash:
September 14,1991
The Company recognizes that the Joint Contracting Committee Meetings held between June 1990 and March 1991 were meaningful, productive and consistent with the spirit of reducing the level of contracting. We therefore reaffirm our commitment to implement all agreements or understandings which resulted from those Joint Contracting Committee discussions.
In addition, the Company agrees to return all splicing work to bargaining unit employees by September 1.1992. The Company also agrees to conduct a trial within a Manhattan Central Office utilizing New York Telephone Company employees to perfonn the central office work associated with installing digital pair gain systems (e.g. SLC-96) and associated fiber optic multiplexers for loop systems. The details and associated evaluation of this trial to see if mid when this central office work can be returned to bargaining unit employees shall be an initial priority of the Joint Contracting Committee.
It is also the Company's desire to maintain tlie progress made during these meetings and therefore we agree to continue die Joint Contracting Committee. The ongoing purpose of the Committee shall be to analyze issues re-lated to contracting in all New York Telephone bargaining units brought to it by either tlie Union or the Company and to seek solutions to the issues or possible alternatives to contracting that are agreeable to both parties. When evaluating or resolving contracting issues brought before it, the Committee shall be guided when possible by the principle of "telephone work for telephone people" and shall consider the following criteria:
(i)	The duration of the work or project;
(ii)	Whedier bargaining unit members have die necessary skills or can be trained within a reasonable jieriod of time to do die work or project;
179
243_PLANT_V14	12/13/04 10:fr\AM Page 180

(iv)	Whether there was an emergency situation such as a hurricane or blizzard and bargaining unit members working overtime cannot complete the work within a reasonable time.
The Committee shall consist of four representatives from the Union and four representatives from the Company, who will be at the General Manager level, and shall have the authority’ to involve subject matter experts from tlie areas to be addressed.
The Committee sh;dl meet on regular basis or as otherwise agreed upon by the parties.

Dear Ms. Riordan:
This will express the Company’s intentions with respect to contracting out work. With the new employment security provisions in the collective b:trgaining agreement, the Company has every incentive to tailor its discretionary use of contracting to balance its obligation to provide jobs for employees with the costs of operation.
Beyond that, in the event that surpluses are caused by an ''external event," and Ijefore implementation of die last step of die Force Adjustment Plan, the Company will carefully weigh its opportunities to bring back contracted work to provide meaningful jobs for remaining surplus employees outside of the area and/or job title where the work is being done. In considering this option, the Company will evaluate the skill match of the available employees, the need and willingness of employees to relocate, the training and equipment required to do the work, the duration of the requirement, as well as die comparative economics of all options.
The above subjects will be discussed at the contracting subcommittee of die Common Committee.

Dear Ms. Riordan:
April 3.1994
NYNEX rind CWA have carefully reviewed the Company's process reengineering plan, the demographics of the current work force, and the likely impact of die FAP retirement incentive upon that work force. Tlie parties have concluded that due to the above factors, and barring external events described below, layoffs, forced transfers outside the transfer areas, and loss of compensation shall not occur during the term of this contract extension.
Specifically, die parties agree that there shall be no layoffs, forced transfers outside the transfer areas, or loss of compensation as a result of any Company initiated "process change", which includes process re-engineering initiatives, work place consolidations, office closings, contracting, shifting of bargaining unit work, network upgrades, and other business changes developed to accommodate new technology or to improve productivity, efficiency or methods of operation.
Ilie parties also agree that an "external event" that is viewed :is significant and that directly reduces the need for a large number of employees, shall not be considered "process change." An example of an external event might be a state or federal regulatory change that causes die Company to abandon a line of business, an interexchange carrier take back of billings and collections, or die loss of a major telecommunications network contract. An external event of this nature shall be covered by the additional step(s) of the E\P.

Dear Mr. Ash:
April J, 1994
The parties recognize that the combination of craft titles during the 1994 bargaining, together with the anticipated introduction of turf teams, may create difficulties in equalizing overtime opportunities within an overtime group, because of die different skills and qualifications that employees who formerly held different titles bring to the newly created jobs. The parties further recognize that training employees to provide them with skills in other disciplines that they do not now possess will maximize the Company’s ability to meet customer requirements for quality service while equalizing overtime. Such efforts may include formal training as well as infonnal on-the-job training.
When the Company provides formal training, it will, in a majority of cases, select the senior volunteer from the equalization of overtime unit who is qualified for such training, consistent with the needs of the business. Whenever die Company fails to select such senior volunteer, it will notify tlie Load Union at least one week in advance of the commencement of the.training and will provide die reason or reasons for such failure to select. The Training Advisory Board will review issues related to the selection process that are brought to it by either the Company or the Union.
With regard to on-the-job training, the Company may assign, on a voluntary basis, bargaining unit employees to train other employees without additional compensation.
Hie Company plans to initiate several pilot operations in connection with its introduction of turf teams, and hopes to complete the initial implementation of this concept within approximately two years. Prior to the initiation of any such pilot operations and prior to the initiation of any other turf teams during the initial implementation, local management will meet with representatives of the appropriate Local Union or Unions to discuss issues concerning the initial staffing of such turf teams.
190
243_PLANT_V14	12/13/04	10:4-\AM Page 191
In addition, during the 1994 discussions between the Company and the appropriate Local Unions pureuant to Section B of the Memorandum Agreement on Vacations, die parties will address the impact on vacation schedules of the combination of job titles along with the anticipated introduction of turf teams. ‘
After completion of the turf team pilot operations, and during tlie period of initial implementation, information regarding local experience with staffing, training, and vacation scheduling may be given to the Common Committee, which may evaluate such local experience for the puqjose of sharing successful solutions with management and the Union,

Dear Mr. Shelton:
August 5, 2000
The Company and the Union recognize the importance of maximizing the number of employees on the job. The parties further recognize that a variety of factors contribute to absence, and that no single approach can effectively address the parties concerns in this area.
In support of their mutual desire to promote good attendance, the Company and the Union will create a Joint Attendance Committee, to be co-chaired by a Manager at the Director level and an International Representative of the Union. The Committee will explore the factors that contribute to employee absence, and will mutually seek appropriate solutions. In this connection, the Committee will explore issues relating to employee health and other underlying reasons for absence, work environment, the absence control program, third medical opinions, and others.
The Committee will meet at times and places as mutually agreed, and will issue reports as it deems appropriate.

Dear Mr. Shelton:
This will confirm our agreement regarding the Company's commitment in connection with new contracting initiatives.
The Company agrees that through December 31, 2007, it will not contract out work that is not being contracted out on the effective date of this agreement
The parties further agree to continue a Contracting Initiatives Committee, which will be chaired by the Company's Regional Bargaining Agent and the Union's Area Director, each of whom may appoint up to two additional members. The purpose of the Committee is to give the parties the opportunity to conduct open and thorough discussions concerning the Company’s intention and rationale regarding the contracting out of bargaining unit work. The Committee will also discuss issues regarding the following exceptions to the restriction on new contracting initiatives: The restriction shall not preclude contracting out work to meet peak load requirements which cannot be covered with overtime or to deal with emergency situations (such as severe weather conditions).
In addition, commencing January 1. 2008, the Company will notify the Union at least six months in advance of any new contracting initiatives. The Contracting Initiatives Committee will then have the opportunity to discuss such new major initiatives. In these discussions, the goal of the parties will be to balance the needs of customers, the provision of excellent service, and the use of bargaining unit employees to perform bargaining unit work
