•	Employees whose current wage is not found on the newly negotiated wage scale and between the new entry rate and the new top rate will be moved to the next higher wage rate from their current pay rate, and they will be required to work in that step for the designated period of time.

■W

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING HEALTH & WELFARE CONTRIBUTIONS RECITALS
A.	King Soopers/City Market (the "Employer") and the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 (the "Union") are party to various collective bargaining agreements (the "CBAs").
B.	Pursuant to the CBAs, the Employer makes contributions on a monthly basis to the United Food and Commercial Workers Welfare Trust (the "Plan'’) on behalf of specified bargaining unit employees who work 80 or more hours in a four week month or 100 or more hours in a five week month.
C.	The contribution presently required to be made to the Plan by the CBAs is expressed as a monthly dollar amount that commences with hours worked after the employee completes their initial eligibility period (the ‘Monthly Rate").
D.	The undersigned parties desire to modify the contribution structure to convert the Monthly Rate to an equivalent hourly contribution rate commencing at date of hire (the "Hourly Rate") pursuant Io the methodology outlined below, with the express intent of maintaining the overall economic terms of the CBAs by requiring a monthly reconciliation to ensure the amount contributed each month pursuant to the new Hourly Rate structure equals the amount that would have been contributed under the Monthly Rate structure.
AGREEMENTS
The undersigned parties hereby agree as follows:
1.	Effective December 1, 2015 (November hours) the Monthly Rate shall be converted to an equivalent Hourly Rate commencing with an employee's first hour of employment pursuant to the methodology outlined below. The undersigned parties agree the Hourly Rate provided for herein shall supplant and replace the Monthly Rate specified in the CBAs, and the Employer shall have no additional obligation to contribute to the Plan beyond the Hourly Rate (subject to the monthly reconciliation provided for herein).
2.	The Monthly Rate shall be converted to an equivalent Hourly Rate as follows*
(a)	The Employer shall calculate the Hourly Rate. Each participating Employer at its
option may have the Plan’s Consultant calculate the Hourty Rate. The Hourly Rate shall be the amount projected by the Plan's consultant to provide an equivalent dollar amount of monthly contributions to the Plan as would have been made had the Monthly Rate and contribution rules remained in effect
(b)	The Employer shall calculate the Hourly Rate to be effective commencing with
hours worked November 2015. The Plan's consultant shall thereafter update his calculation of the projected Hourly Rate each January 1 and July 1 (or such other dates as determined as necessary and appropriate by the Plan’s Trustees) based on Plan experience for such employer, and such updated Hourly Rate shall become effective when approved by the Plan's Trustees.
(c)	To maintain (he overall economic terms of the CBAs, the undersigned parties
agree the Employer or Plan Administrator if assigned the task by an Employer shall reconcile contributions on a monthly basis to compare the amount actually contributed by the Employer pursuant to the Hourty Rate each month relative to the amount that the Employer would have contributed had the Monthly Rate remained in effect for such month. The Employer will determine by the last day of each month whether the amount contributed to the Plan in such month pursuant to the Hourty Rate structure was more or less than would have been paid pursuant to the Monthly Rate structure. To the extent the
17

amount of the Employer’s actual Hourly Rate contributions for a month exceed the amount the Employer would have contributed had the Monthly Rate remained in effect for such month, then the Employer shall be entitled to a credit in the amount of such excess against contributions due for the following month. EXAMPLE ONE: EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTES $50,000 TO THE PLAN ON APRIL 10 FOR MARCH HOURS. EMPLOYER OR PLAN ADMINISTRATOR RECONCILES AND IF THE EMPLOYER OR PLAN ADMINISTRATOR DETERMINES EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE PAID $48,000 HAD MONTHLY RATE STRUCTURE BEEN IN EFFECT FOR THE MONTH. EMPLOYER WILL BE ENTITLED TO $2,000 CREDIT TO BE TAKEN AGAINST CONTRIBUTION DUE IN MAY FOR APRIL HOURS. Conversely, to the extent the amount of the Employer's actual Hourly Rate contributions for a month are less than the amount the Employer would have contributed had the Monthly Rate remained in effect for such month, then the Employer shall pay the amount of such difference to the Plan as an additional contribution, with such amount due for the following month. EXAMPLE TWO: EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTES $50,000 TO THE PLAN ON APRIL 10 FOR MARCH HOURS. EMPLOYER OR PLAN ADMINISTRATOR RECONCILES AND IF THE EMPLOYER OR PLAN ADMINISTRATOR DETERMINES EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE PAID $54,000 HAD MONTHLY RATE STRUCTURE BEEN IN EFFECT FOR THE MONTH, EMPLOYER WILL CONTRIBUTE AN ADDITIONAL $4,000 WITH THE CONTRIBUTION DUE IN MAY FOR APRIL HOURS.
{d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all other terms of the CBAs with respect to the amount of the Employer and employee contributions payable to the Plan shall remain in effect.
3.	The Employer shall pay the Hourly Rate to the Plan on behalf of those employees covered by the CBAs (even rf such employees have not yet satisfied the eligibility requirements to qualify for initial Plan eligibility) beginning with the first hour worked with the Employer in such an eligible position. The hours for whidh the Employer shall be obligated to contribute the Hourly Rate to the Plan shall be the same hours that are credited under the CBAs for purposes of determining whether employees satisfy the 80-hour, or 100-hour, qualifiers for receiving the prior Monthly Rate contributions. However, employees shall not be required to work such 80 hours, or 100 hours, to qualify for the Hourly Rate contribution. The Employer shall continue to report credited hours to the Plan on a monthly basis, and the contribution amount shall continue to be payable each month by the deadline required under the CBAs.
4.	The Employer agrees that its contributions tendered pursuant to this Agreement are subject to audit by the Fund's auditor. The Employer further agrees to reimburse the Fund Administrator for any administrative expense it incurs in the processing of these contributions with the understanding that there shall be no reimbursement of the Fund auditor by the Employer for audits conducted pursuant to this provision.
