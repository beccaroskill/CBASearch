INTRODUCTION
This Agreement is made and entered into this 24th day of August, 2001. reached through collective bargaining by and between Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America, Inc., 100 N. Mitsubishi Motorway, Normal, Illinois (hereinafter referred to as the Company or MMMA), and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW, and its affiliated Local Union 2488 (hereinafter referred to as the Union). This Agreement shall be binding on both the Company and the Union and will be administered by each in the spirit of mutual trust and respect, and in a harmonious labor-management environment that promotes cooperation and working together as members of the same team.
1
ARTICLE I OBJECTIVES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Section 1.	Joint Objectives and Goals
The Company and the Union pledge to maintain a genuine and unreserved spirit of cooperation between all parties concerned in order to achieve and promote harmonious labor relations. The bedrock of cooperation is respect and dignity for each person. To attain the highest degree of cooperation from all parties there must be unqualified trust in each other. Indispensable to the achievement and retention of such trust is recognition, in words and in deeds, that each and every, individual is entitled to have his or her human rights and values respected by everyone. The parties pledge to work in harmony to produce the highest quality vehicles in the most efficient way so that they are price competitive and attractive to the consumer. It is the intention of the parties to be constantly conscious of their responsibilities and, in that context, to exercise good judgement, mutual respect and a spirit of cooperation with each other. Each party recognizes and accepts the fact that the success and security of each individual is dependent upon the success of the entire organization.
Section 2.	Company Responsibilities
The Company objectives are to commit its resources to maintain an environment which allows its employees to build the highest quality, most competitive priced vehicle available in the automobile industry and thereby to provide significant job security for its associates and prosperity and growth for the organization. The Company will provide a safe work place, equitable wages and benefits and will promote an environment based on the teamwork concept which establishes "Wa", or "harmony among people" in a non-adversaria) environment that promotes mutual trust and respect. The Company believes that two key factors of success lie in the establishment of closely-knitted and cooperative relations in a broad range between all associates and the Company and in the creation and maintenance of a Union-Management relationship that promotes the resolution of problems in a non-adversaria) manner.
2
Section 3.	Union Responsibilities
Considering the large investment MMMA is making in its new facility in Normal, Illinois and the creation of many new jobs and its commitment to provide significant job security for its associates, the Union commits its long term cooperation in the recognition and commitment to the principle of flexibility that the Company must have to maintain and improve quality and efficiency and to the implementation of work practices and flexible production systems similar to those used by Mitsubishi Motors Corporation (MMC) in Japan. This flexibility includes, among other things, a minimal number of job classifications, flexibility in job assignments and job transfers, associate training, harmony among the associates, the use of Kaizen and the Team concept. 7he Team Concept MMMA will use includes effective organization of the team members, the work to be performed by the team, common responsibility sharing, the participation in Quality/Productivity improvement programs, such as Quality Control Circles and Kaizen teams, the selection of the leader from the team, and the rotation of jobs within the team including the rotation of the team leader from among all associates who have gained experience by successfully performing all aspects of the team activity.
Section 4.	Associate Responsibilities
MMMA associates are the key to the viability and prosperity of the organization. Associates must be committed to accept their responsibility to promote a harmonious work environment by supporting the Team concept, other Team members, and establishing and attaining Team goals.
They must be willing to achieve the highest standard of quality and efficiency through constant improvement (Kaizen), participation in Quality Control activities. They must also respect the rights of others, promote the Company philosophy, abide by reasonable rules of conduct and attendance, maintain a safe work environment, and assist the Company in meeting its production goals and schedules.

ARTICLE VII
CONTRACT OUT WORK
It is the policy of the Company to utilize associates in the performance of manufacturing and maintenance work in the plant. The Company will, therefore, not utilize outside contractors for such work that is presently and historically performed by MMMA associates. Subject to the foregoing, both parties recognize that instances may arise during the term of this Agreement when the Company finds it necessary to utilize outside contractors for other work in the plant. In such instances, the Company will provide the Union reasonable notice and information prior to such utilization, and consider any comments or suggestions offered by the Union. Further, employees of an outside contractor will not be permitted to use Company owned or leased machines, tools and equipment for work in the plant to displace associates. However, MMMA equipment and machinery such as cranes and hoists may>be used by outside contractors to assist in the completion of contract work not presently and historically performed by MMMA associates.
As all problems concerning contract-out work are excluded from the Problem Resolution Procedure, any such problems will first be subject to a special meeting between the Bargaining Chairperson and file General Manager of Human Resources. Any problems not settled there will be referred to the UAW Regional Director and the MMMA Vice President of Human Resources for final resolution.
13
ARTICLE VIII EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
Section 1.	Equal Employment Opportunity
The Company and the Union will abide by all applicable Equal Employment Opportunity laws. Both parties agree that the provisions of this Agreement shall apply to all associates covered by this Agreement without discrimination, and in carrying out their respective obligations under this Agreement, neither will discriminate against any employee on account of race, color, national origin, ancestry, marital • status, age, sex, sexual orientation, religion,' physical or mental handicap' or unfavorable discharge from military service as per applicable law. The Company and the Union will not condone acts of sexual harassment, or any other form of illegal harassment, and will encourage an environment to prevent such acts.
Whenever a reference to male gender appears in this Agreement, it is understood that such language is non-restrictive and is intended to include females.
Section 2.	Exclusive Contractual Procedure
Any claim of violation of Section 1 above, including any claim of discrimination and/or unlawful harassment, should be taken up in accordance with Article XIII, Problem Resolution Procedure, which provides an exclusive procedure for resolution of all such claims.
The parties agree to investigate and resolve claims of discrimination and/or harassment as promptly and early in the procedure as reasonably possible.
Section 3.	Non-Discrimination Against Union Activities
The Company will not interfere with, restrain or coerce employees because of membership or lawful activity in the Union, nor will it, by discrimination in respect to hire, tenure or employment or any term of condition of employment, attempt to discourage membership in the Union.
14
ARTICLE IX JOB SECURITY
"Hie Company recognizes that job security'is essential to an associate’s well being and acknowledges that it has a responsibility, with the cooperation of the Union, to provide stable employment to its associates. The Union's commitments in the Union Responsibilities section of this Agreement are a significant step towards the realization of stable employment. Moreover, the Company recognizes its basic responsibility to provide stable and secure employment for its associates. ‘ Hence, the Company agrees that it will provide significant job security by not laying off associates unless compelled to do so by severe economic conditions that threaten the long term financial viability of the Company.
Even then, the Company will take affirmative measures before instituting any layoffs, including but not limited to such actions as: the reduction of salaries xtf its officers and management, other cost saving measures, assigning work previously contracted out to bargaining unit associates capable of performing this work, and the utilization of non-traditional work assignments that are mutually agreeable to both parties. Should layoffs ever be unavoidable, a jointly developed, mutually satisfactory program will be implemented that provides layoffs and recalls will be in accordance with seniority and provides the opportunity for voluntary layoffs.
In the final analysis, both parties agree that job security and the Company's ability to compete and prosper are inseparably linked one to the other.
15
ARTICLE X SENIORITY
Section 1.	Probationary Period
A new associate of the plant shall be a probationary associate until he has completed an evaluation period of ninety (90) calendar days of employment, beginning with the first day worked of the most recent date of hire. Upon successful completion of this period, an associate will acquire seniority retroactive to his most recent date of hire. During the probationary period, any periods of absence shall extend the probationary period for that amount of time. There shall be no seniority among probationary associates.
Section 2.	Seniority
A.	Definition
Seniority means an associate's unbroken service with the Company in years, months, and days since the associate's most recent date of hire. Seniority shall be established separately within the Production classification and the Maintenance classification.
B.	If two or more associates have the same seniority date, the associate with the lowest last four (4) digits of his social security number shall be deemed to have the greater seniority, and then, if that still does not break the tie, the lowest last five (5) digits will be used, and so on , until the tie is settled.
C.	If an associate is -transferred permanently from the Production classification to the Maintenance classification, he shall establish seniority as a member of the new classification as of the date of transfer. If the associate returns to a production classification, he will be restored to his original production classification seniority date,
D.	If an associate was transferred into a non-bargaining unit position prior to August 28,1989, and thereafter, returns to
16
a bargaining unit position, he shall have an amount of seniority equal to the period of time between his previous classification seniority date and August 27, 1993, and his seniority date will be reestablished accordingly.
If an associate is transferred into a non-bargaining unit position after August 28, 1989, and later returns to a bargaining unit position, he shall have an amount of seniority equal to his previous period of classification seniority, and his seniority date will be reestablished accordingly.
: In any case that an associate's original seniority was not restored upon returning to the bargaining unit, then the associate's original seniority date will still be used for the purpose of determining seniority-related benefit entitlements.
E.	An employee who moves from a non-bargaining unit position into a bargaining unit position will have seniority begin on his date of entry into the bargaining unit, except that his original date of hire into the Company will be used as his seniority date for the purpose of determining seniority-related benefit entitlements.
F.	Notwithstanding their position on the seniority list, the Plant Committee, including the Chairperson, all Committeepersons, and full time appointed UAW representatives who are involved in the administration of this Agreement shall be granted preferential seniority in the event of layoff or recall.
Section 3.	Loss of Seniority
A.	Seniority will be broken and lost and employment shall cease for the following reasons:
1.	Termination if not reversed through the Problem Resolution Procedure.
17
2,	Quit, retirement or death.
3.	Failure to report to work for three (3) consecutive working days without prior notice, unless unusual conditions or circumstances exist.
4.	Failure to return to work within three (3) consecutive working days after expiration of a leave of absence, unless otherwise excused.

ARTICLE XXI OVERTIME
Section 1.	Overtime Scheduling
A.	Daily Overtime
Associates can be required to work two (2) hours of overtime daily. As a general rule, daily overtime will be scheduled before the end of shift on the day before such time is to be worked. It is understood and agreed by the Union that certain instances, such as equipment breakdown, material shortages, process bottlenecks, and conditions beyond the control of the Company, may cause the Company to schedule daily overtime on the same day it is required.
B.	Saturday Overtime
Associates can also be required to work on Saturday. When overtime work is required on Saturday, the Company will endeavor to schedule such overtime on Thursday of the week overtime is required on Saturday. Failure to give such notice will not relieve an associate of the obligation to work overtime. Associates can only be required to work two (2) Saturdays in a row and cannot be required to work the third consecutive Saturday, if they indicate their desire not to be scheduled. However, associates. wiH not .be. rggujred_.tQ_ work morg Xhan eight (8) hours each shift on any mandatory,Saturday,
C.	Except as provided in this Section, Sunday overtime will be voluntary.
D.	Maintenance
In addition to other provisions in this Article, each maintenance associate may be required to work on two (2) additional Saturdays during each calendar year to assure
66
smooth production or to perform maintenance projects which cannot normally be performed during periods when normal production is scheduled. Further, maintenance associates may be required to work all daily overtime during the summer shutdown period, and on the Saturday and Sunday immediately preceding, following, or included in the summer shutdown period, except for July 4, when that particular holiday actually falls on a Saturday or Sunday; and the Saturday and Sunday immediately preceding, following, or included in the Christmas holiday period, except for December 24, December 25, December 31, and January 1, when those particular holidays actually fall on a Saturday or Sunday. It is understood that maintenance associates will not be required to work on any days which are designated as holidays under this Agreement.
E.	Emergencies
The Union recognizes that certain emergency conditions may arise that will require associates to work beyond the limits mentioned in this Article. The Company will endeavor not to require associates to work beyond those limits unless such an emergency condition exists. When these types of conditions exist, the Company will discuss the situation with the Chairperson and arrive at a mutually acceptable solution to correct the conditions that created and/or resulted from the emergency.
F.	Annual Automatic Exemptions
During periods when the Company is going to launch a new vehicle or introduce a new model, the above mentioned provisions restricting the right of the Company to require associates to work daily overtime or Saturdays or Sundays shall be suspended beginning two (2) weeks preceding build out and continuing for the week in which it launches and three (3) weeks thereafter. The period of suspension may be extended by mutual agreement.
67
G.	Critical Operations
Critical operations are those that are essential to meeting scheduled production needs, and, as a result, must operate, in whole or in part, seven (7) days a week. The Senior Vice President of Manufacturing may, from time to time, designate operations as critical, provided however, that fifteen (15) days prior to making such designation, it will inform the Union, which will indicate its objections, if any, to the designation. Any operations designated as critical, shall, for a period of up to ninety (90) days after it is so designated, be exempt from the provisions of this Article. After an operation has been initially designated as critical, it may thereafter be redesignated as such by mutual agreement.
H.	Mutually acceptable modifications to the provisions of this Section will be made for associates working on seven (7) day continuous operations.
I.	When the Company chooses to request volunteers for Saturday, Sunday or holiday work and when the number of associates required for that work exceeds the number of volunteers, the Company will, when practical, seek volunteers from the same group on the opposite shift.
Section 2.	Balancing Overtime
The intent of this provision is to afford associates in the same group and on the same shift the opportunity to share in available overtime work. It also provides the manner and method by which overtime balancing records will be maintained.
A.	Overtime work will be balanced over time among associates by group by shift.
B.	Initially, associates in each balancing group will be listed in seniority order on the overtime list. Thereafter, when overtime work is available, associates in each overtime balancing group will be canvassed beginning with the
68
associate with the lowest hours. If the number of associates needed to perform the overtime work is not obtained, the associates with the lowest hours who are capable and have the present ability to perform the available overtime work will be required to work. The associates who are required to perform the work and those lower on the overtime list will be charged for the overtime worked.
C.	A newly hired or a regular transferred associate will assume the average hours of the balancing group to which he is assigned.
D.	Associates temporarily transferred into a group will assume the average hours of the balancing group. However, the number of overtime hours which the associate had the opportunity to work while temporarily assigned to a group would also be charged to the associate upon return to his regular assignment. Temporary transfers are defined as assignments known to be ninety (90) days or less in duration.
E.	Overtime lists will be updated on a daily basis in each balancing group, and will be posted in a conspicuous place for the review of all associates in the group.
F.	The parties understand that these provisions are meant to achieve a balancing of overtime hours over time and no back pay under any circumstances.
G.	If, as a result of special circumstances, the spread of overtime hours within a balancing group necessarily exceeds thirty-six (36) hours between low and high, the Group Leader and District Committeeperson will determine a mutually acceptable method of balancing the overtime over time.
69
Charging
1.	The number of hours charged to an associate for overtime worked will be according to hours offered for daily or Saturday overtime (1 hour overtime = 1.5 hours charged) and according to hours of pay for Sunday or holiday overtime (1 hour overtime = 2 hours charged).
2.	When overtime hours are made available to an associate and he fails to work for any reason, or he declines an offer to work, the hours available to the associate shall be charged as if he had worked them.
3.	When an associate is not at work for any reason and he would have been eligible for overtime, he will be charged the hours that he normally would have been scheduled.
4.	If the entire balancing group is scheduled or offered the same overtime, it is not necessary to charge any overtime hours. However, the overtime balancing sheets will reflect all hours offered for purposes of temporary transfers.
5.	Once the associate with the least number of overtime hours in the balancing group accumulates 100 hours, the Group Leader will reduce the hours of each associate in the balancing group by 100 hours. This method reduces the low associate to zero hours and all other associates to their original hours minus 100.
6.	Overtime balancing sheets will remain on the shop floor for a period of one (1) year, and will be made available for the review of associates in the balancing group.
70
7, Separate overtime balancing sheets will be maintained for_____________daily overtime and
weekend/holiday overtime for associates in the maintenance group, excluding those maintenance associates working on 7-day operations.

PRODUCTION STANDARDS AND PERIODIC Meetings between union AND MANAGEMENT
A.	The Company and the Union firmly believe that there is the need and importance of a genuine and unreserved spirit of cooperation in order to achieve sound labor relations as described in the Joint Objectives and Goals.

B.	Toward this specific end, the Company and the Union will have periodic meetings at the Company level and Sectional level within the Bargaining Unit to exchange information and share a full understanding of the operations.
C.	The Company level meeting will be comprised of the President, Executive Vice President(s), Vice President(s), and other designated management personnel relating to the issues to be discussed, and the Union Chairperson and Bargaining Committeepersons, International Representative(s), and other designated personnel from within the Company related to the issues to be discussed.

If the matter is not peacefully resolved at that level, the matter may be discussed as one of the agenda items at a sectional level periodic meeting. If the matter is still not resolved, it may be referred to a special meeting between the General Manager of Human Resources and the Union Chairperson. Failing resolution of the matter, a special meeting will be scheduled between the UAW Regional Director, or his designee, and the Vice President of Human Resources, or his designee from within the Company, for final resolution of the matter.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING BARGAINING UNIT WORK
August 24, 2001
Mr. Nate Gooden
UAW Vice President
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, MJ 48214
Dear Mr. Gooden:
During the course of our negotiations, the parties discussed some possible abuses of the contractual provisions allowing nonbargaining unit employees and dispatchees from Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and/or DaimlerChrysler to perform bargaining unit work. As a result of the deep concern expressed by the Union, the Company reaffirmed that it will continue to monitor the situation and continue to instruct and train its supervisors as to the intent of the contractual provisions in an effort to further minimize any possible disputes in the future. Additionally, the Company assured the Union that it will monitor those groups where repetitive complaints occur and, if necessary, will schedule a meeting with the Department General Manager, a representative of Employee Relations, and the appropriate Bargaining Committeeperson.
However, if the Union alleges that non-bargaining unit employees of MMMA and/or dispatchees from Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and/or DaimlerChrysler are performing bargaining unit work that goes beyond that allowed under Article IV, the Union will bring the situation to the attention of the General Manager, or his designee, for a prompt investigation with the appropriate Bargaining Committeeperson, or his designee. If, after investigation, the General Manager, or his designee, agrees with the Bargaining Committeeperson, or his designee, that the bargaining unit work being performed is beyond that allowed under Article IV, then the
160
General Manager, or his designee, will assign a qualified associate to replace the non-bargaining unit employee or dispatchee without unnecessary delay.
The Company reaffirms the express policy of MMMA that the principle function of a group leader is to direct the activities of the associates under his supervision. Therefore, Group Leaders are not to perform bargaining unit work except as expressly provided for under Article IV. Accordingly, the Department General Manager will re-advise the Group Leaders of the express policy of the Company and the proper application of Article IV, and will instruct them as to the seriousness of any violation of this policy.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING COLA - CALCULATION AND NOTIFICATION
August 24, 2001
Mr, Nate Gooden
UAW Vice President
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Mt 48214
Dear Mr. Gooden:
This letter is to confirm certain agreements reached by MMMA and the International Union, UAW, regarding the calculation of the Cost-oMJving Allowance pursuant to Article XVIII of this Agreement.
The table in Article XVIII (c) has been constructed to provide that 1# adjustments In the Cost-of-Living Allowance shall become payable, sequentially, for each 0.3, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0,3, 0.2 change in the Average Index, and so forth, with that sequence being repeated thereafter in the table so as to produce an average adjustment over time of 10 for each 0,25 change in the Average Index.
In applying the provisions of Article XVIII of the Agreement, the Company shall prepare a notification letter to the Union setting forth the Consumer Price Index for each of the three months that form the basis for an adjustment, and the average of those three months, rounded to the nearest 0.1 index point using the Engineering Method of Rounding as described in the Attachment. This letter will be prepared and sent to the Union after publication of the appropriate Consumer Price Index for the third month used for each adjustment period in accordance with Article XVIII of the Agreement.
162
If the Union claims that the Company's calculations in any particular instance were not made in accordance with the terms of this letter of understanding, it may refer the matter to Arbitration.

ENGINEERING METHOD OF ROUNDING
The following rules of rounding shall apply to the determination of the Consumer Price Index:
1.	If the leftmost of the digits discarded is less than 5, the preceding digit is not affected. For example, when rounding to four digits. 130.646 becomes 130.6.
2.	If the leftmost of the digits discarded is greater than 5, or is 5 followed by digits not all of which are zero, the preceding digit is increased by one. For example, when rounding to four digits, 130.557 becomes 130.6.
3.	If the leftmost of the digits discarded is 5, followed by zeros, the preceding digit is increased by one if it is odd and remains unchanged if it is even. The number is thus rounded in such a manner that the last digit retained is even. For example, when rounding to four digits, 130.5500 becomes 130.6 and 130.6500 becomes 130.6.

August 24, 2001
Mr. Nate Gooden
UAW Vice President
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Ml 48214
Dear Mr. Gooden:
During the course of our negotiations, the parties discussed a variety of issues regarding the administration of workers’ compensation and disability. It was agreed that the following measures would be taken in order to address the concerns discussed:
1.	When an employee initially reports a work related incident to the on-site medical clinic, the Company will, at that time, seek authorization from the employee to release medical information to MMMA’s Workers’ Compensation section. This will assist the Workers’ Compensation section in obtaining medical records for compensability decisions.
2.	OSF Saint Joseph Medical Center will begin sending corresponding medical records immediately to MMMA when sending bills to MMMA’s Workers' Compensation section. This will assist the Workers’ Compensation section in obtaining medical records for compensability decisions. In addition, the Company will use its best effort to incorporate this standard with other hospitals in the area.
3.	To accelerate the start of disability payments and avoid administrative delays, the Company will instruct the disability carrier to have disability checks sent directly to the employee’s home.
170
4.	Historically, the Company's disability carrier administered disability claims by reviewing medical information after receipt of a physician’s certification of disability. • Payments were not issued until the carrier received all the medical documentation to support the definition of disability.
in the future, the disability carrier will issue payment of disability upon receipt of a physician’s statement that certifies disability under the plan. Medical documentation supporting the physician’s certification of disability will no longer be required to initiate or start disability payment.
5.	When an employee files a lost-time claim for workers’ compensation, the Workers' Compensation section will review the claim for compensability within seven (7) days of being notified of the claim by the employee. If the Workers’ Compensation section is unable to approve or deny the claim within this seven (7) day period, the Workers’ Compensation section will issue a deferred decision status.
This deferred decision status will allow the employee to apply for disability while Workers’ Compensation continues to review the claim for compensability. The employee will be required to sign a reimbursement agreement to allow reimbursement to the disability carrier in the event their workers' compensation claim is found to be compensable. The Company will allow the employee to file for sickness and accident on the same day the employee files the lost-time claim for workers' compensation.
6.	The Company will initiate payment of claims within seven (7) working days after receipt of a physician's certification of disability. Both the Company and Union realize there may be rare occasions when the carrier fails to meet this standard.

Neal Jr.

Dear Mr. Gooden:
During 2001 negotiations, the parties discussed the impact of the $1.52 COLA fold-in on associates at various steps in the New Hire Progression. The parties agreed that after the fold-in? such associates should remain in the same relative position to associates who had completed the progression period, since all associates, regardless of their position in progression, have been receiving the same $1.52 COLA adjustment.
Therefore, this will confirm our understanding that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the base rates shown in Article XVII, Section 2 will be raised by the amounts indicated below for associates in'the New Hire Progression as of August 24, 2001:
182
Step In Progression	Additional Increase . .	
-	Production Associates	1 Die Maintenance/' General Maintenance Associates
Less than six (6) months	$0.46	$0.23
At least six (6) but less than twelve (12) months	$0.38	$0.15
At least twelve (12) but less than eighteen (18) months	$0.30	$0.08
At least eighteen (18) but less than twenty-four (24) months	$0.23	$0.00
At least twenty-four (24) but less than thirty (30) months	$0.15	$0.00
At least thirty (30) but less than thirty-six (36) months	$0.08	$0.00
These increases will be made in the amounts and for the respective periods indicated only for those associates in Progression as of August 24, 2001. and only up to the point they complete each step of the Progression period. For example, a production associate currently in the first step of Progression will receive the additional $.46 increase until he completes six (6) months, the additional $.38 increase for the next six (6) months,
183
the additional $.30 increase for the next six (6) months, the additional $.23 increase for the next six (6) months, the additional $.15 increase for the next six (6) months, and then the additional $.08 increase for the final six (6) months.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN (QEPIP)
August 24, 2001
Mr. Nate Gooden
UAW Vice President
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Ml 48214
Dear Mr. Gooden:
During the 2001 negotiations, the Company agreed to continue the program designed to provide associates with monetary rewards for achieving continuous quality and efficiency improvements, namely the Quality and Efficiency Performance Improvement Plan (QEPIP).
Using realistic and objective standards such as the JO Power Quality Survey and other measurement indices appropriate to the MMMA situation, the program measures and compares MMMA's performance in quality and efficiency from 2001 Model Year to the 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 model years. The parties understand the 2005 model year comparison is only applicable to the JD Power Quality Survey results, and not the other measurement indices. The program is unique to the MMMA product line and production circumstances but is conceptually similar to a performance-based plan existing elsewhere in the U.S. automobile industry.
If measured improvements are achieved in quality and/or efficiency, eligible associates can receive QEPIP bonuses for the 2001. 2002. 2003, 2004 and 2005 model years payable in the first pay period of December 2001. June and December 2002, 2003 and 2004: and June 2005 respectively. However, it is understood that the minimum QEPIP bonus for the 2001 model
236
year will be $600.00, It is further understood the 2001 model year, program will measure and _ compare MMMAis performance in quality and/or efficiency to the 1998 model year using the 2000 program year table. To be eligible for December bonuses, an associate must have seniority as of December 1 of the year in which the bonus is paid and must have worked 1040 hours during the twelve (12) months preceding December 1 of the year in which the bonus is paid. To be eligible for June_bonuses, an associate must have seniority as of May 1 of the year in which the, bonus, is paid and must have worked J04Q hours during the twelve (12) months preceding May 1 of the year in which the bonus is paid.
Both parties recognize that for the Corporate Audit category, replaceme_nt/successor_and additional/new models will be handled as follows:
•	For replacement /successor models: allocate one-half of the, applicable per vehicle, amount to the reolacement/successor model and the other half to its predecessor. For example, that corresponds to $50 for each such model at the bottom of the Schedule and $100 for each at the top. Payments for quality improvements _ on _ jthe remaining carryover models would continue unchanged, e.g., $100 at the bottom and $200 at the top,
•	For additional/new models: distribute the total amounts associated with each payout percentage evenly among the higher number of models. For example, an additional/new model would reduce the current payout at the too from $200 for each of four vehicles to $160 for each, of five vehicles, .thereby leaving the. $800 maximum payout forlhis category unchanged.
If measure improvements are achieved in quality and/or efficiency under the QEPIP program, eligible associates can receive QEPIP bonuses up to a maximum of $2600 per calendar year.
237
The QEPIP program will be monitored and reviewed by a Joint Company and Union QEPIP Committee comprised of the local Union Bargaining Committee and appropriate representatives of the International Union and the Company. The QEPIP Joint Committee will be authorized to modify the program by mutual agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING REINSTATEMENT OF PROBLEM
August 24, 2001
Mr. Nate Gooden
UAW Vice President
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Ml 48214
Dear Mr. Gooden:
During the negotiations for the current Agreement, the parties agreed to the following:
1. The parties acknowledged the desirability of ensuring prompt, fair and final resolution of associate problems. The parties also recognized the maintenance of a stable, effective and dependable problem resolution procedure is necessary to implement the foregoing principle to which they both subscribe. Accordingly, the parties view any attempt to reinstate a problem properly disposed of as contrary to the purpose for which the Problem Resolution Procedure was established and violative of the fundamental principles of collective bargaining.	’ ■ '
However, in those instances where the International Union, UAW, by either its Executive Board, Public Review Board, or Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee has reviewed the disposition of a problem and found that such disposition was improperly affected by the Union or a Union Representative involved, the International Union may inform the Company’s Employee Relations Manager in writing that such problem is reinstated in the Problem Resolution Procedure at the step at which the original disposition of the problem occurred.
240
It is agreed, however, that the Company will not be liable for any claims for damages, including back pay claims, arising out of the problem that either (i) are already barred under the provisions of the agreement at the time of the reinstatement of the problem or (ii) that relate to the period between the time of the original disposition and the time of the reinstatement as provided herein. It is further agreed that the reinstatement of any such problem shall be conditioned upon the prior agreement of the Union and the associate or associates involved that none of them will thereafter pursue such claims for damages against the Company in the Problem Resolution Procedure, or in any court or before any Federal, State, or municipal agency. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a decision of the arbitrator on any problem shall continue to be final and binding on the Union and its members, the associate or associates involved and the Company and such problems shall not be subject to reinstatement.
This provision is not to be construed as modifying in any way either the rights or obligations of the parties under the terms of the Agreement, except as specifically limited herein, and does not affect sections thereof that cancel financial liability or limit the payment or retroactivity of any claim, including claims for back wages, or that provide for the final and binding nature of any decisions by the Arbitrator or other problem resolutions.
It is understood that this provision and parties obligations to reinstate problems as provided herein can be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days notice in writing to the other.
This understanding will not affect any case settled prior to August 27,1995.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING SAME-SEX DOMESTIC PARTNER-BENEFITS
AugUStl^ 2QQJ
Mr, Nate Gooden
UAW Vice President
8000_East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Ml 48214
Dear Mr, Gooden;
During the course, of these negotiations, the parties have agreed to offer same-sex domestic partner benefits in recognition that the Company employs, and, the UAW represents, people from, various and diverse backgrounds. The Company and the UAW value diversity and strive to ensureJhgt_their poiicies_and practices are jnciusiv^_an_d non-discriminatory.
Therefore, consistent with our belief that a diverse workforce is an important asset, and in line with the interest of being fair, equitable and fiscally responsible, the Company and the UAW have a gre_ed_to expand the eligibility requirements to eligible same-se)c domestic partners of eligible active employees for medical, prescription drug, dental, vision and hearing aid coverages effective April 1, 2002,
Eligibility Rules for Same Sex Domestic Partners
Effective April _L-2002, the Company will _offe_r_ medical, prescription drug, dental, vision and hearing aid coverages to eligible active employees who have a qualifying same-sex domestic partner relationship.
This _ understanding is an expansion of the Medical Insurance, Dental, Vision and Hearing- Aid Expense Programs, presently available under our _ Agreement for
245
active employees and their eligible dependents. In addition, all other provisions of the,Medical Insurance, Dental, Vision and Hearing Aid Expense Programs shall apply.
In the event an active employee dies while having an eligible domestic partner enrolled for coverage, the Company will continue, medical., prescription drug and hearing aid coverages (but not dental or vision expense coverages) for the enrolled and eligible domestic partner (and eligible children, if any) as if the domestic partner were a surviving spouse and the domestic partner relationship has existed for at least one year immediately prior to his/her death.
The parties agree that a same sex domestic partner is defined as a relationship between two people who meet ALL of the following criteria:
•	Are the same sex:
•	Have, shared, a continuous, committed relationship with
each otherfor no less than six (6) months, intend to do so jDd.efiDUely4_and-n.eitber_ has, aoy_ such., relationship witb any other person;
•	Are Jointly-responsible _foc each other's welfare and financial obligations;
•	Reside in the same household:
•	Arg not related by .blood. to. a degree.of kinship that would prevent marriage from being recognized under the laws of their state of residence:
•	Must reside in a state where marriage between persons of the, samesex _is not recognized as a valid marriage by the state, or, if residing in a _state_which_ recognizes same-sex unions, enter into such union as is recognized by the state:
•	Each, ig_ov§L age, ia>^£Legal_agev Legaily^competent to enter.a. contract; aad
•	Neither is married to a ttditi-pacty*
Employees will be required to submit a notarized affidavit attesting that their domestic partner relationship meets all of the above criteria, The effective date of coverage will be the date the affidavit is notarized, provided the employee is
246
otherwise eligible for health care coverage and notifies the Company within 31 days from the date the affidavit is notarized, or.if later, the first of the month following receipt of the affidavit by the Company,
The Company shall have the right of determining eligibility for the benefit, consistent with the provisions described above. The primary enrollee claiming initial or continuing eligibility of a domestic partner and/or deoendentts), if any. shalLfurnish any documentation that may be necessary to substantiate the claimed eligibility of the domestic partner and/or dependent(s).
The parties agree that in those instances where a legal jurisdiction (i.e., state) recognizes same sex marriages, or other forms of same-sex unions, a legaLmarriage. or other legal union, will be reguired. to establish or continue coverage for those employees who reside in such jurisdiction.
In these cases, coverage will be effective as of the date of the marriage, or other such state recognized union, provided the employee is otherwise eligible for health care coverage and notifies the Company within the time limitations currently in place for adding a dependent.
Children of an employee's domestic partner will be considered eligible if they meet the reguirements to be the employee's dependents under IRS code. In those cases, employees will not be taxed on the value of the child's coverage (see Tax Consequences below).
It continues to be the employees responsibility to remove dependents who are no longer eligible for coverage under the Comoany-provided health care plans, /.e., at the point in time when they are no longer eligible under the provisions of our negotiated agreements________and___this tetter of
understanding.
247
Continuation of Coverage
Same-sex domestic partners, when deleted from Company-provided coverage, do not qualify for COBRA coverage under the federal government’s regulations regarding COBRA continuation of coverage. In addition, certain alternative plans may not provide COBRA-like coverage. The Company will make arrangements for a COBRA-1 ike cash cay continuation of coverage with eligibility rules and payment arrangements as apply under COBRA for persons who no longer meet the eligibility rules as defined in this letter and under our bargaining agreement.
Tax Consequences
Because of IRS regulations, enrollment of a domestic partner is likely to result in tax consequences since the IRS and state laws do not presently recognize a same-sex partner as a legal spouse. The parties agree that in those instances when the non-employee partner does not qualify as a dependent of the employee under IRS code, the fair market value of the benefits provided for the partner will be imputed (taxable) income to the employee.
The Company will assume that when an employee enrolls a same-sex domestic partner for medical, prescription drug, dental, vision and hearing aid coverages, the domestic partner does not meet the IRS code requirements for dependent status, unless the employee provides acceptable proof to the Company to the contrary.
Confidentiality
As with all personnel files, health care elections are treated as strictly confidential information. Company and UAW Benefits Representatives will be instructed regarding the confidentiality of all benefit matters and to apply strict confidentiality regarding the issue of domestic partner eligibility.
248
Health Care Plan Options Accepting_Same-Sex Domestic Partners
It is the intent of the Company to make same sex domestic partner eligibility available under all health care plans offered by the Company to eligible_members. Some Health Plans may not make such coverage available to the Company and, therefore, the Company_will_not be able to make such coverages available to employees who are enrolled under these plans.
For example, some state laws may not allow insured plans to provide same-sex domestic partner benefits for health care. In these instances, employees eligible for PPO Plan coverage who elect domestic partner coverage may change their health care plan to the PPO Medical Plan (which is selfinsured and therefore not subject to such state laws) or to another available alternative plan that does accept domestic partner coverage, concurrent with the effective date of adding a qualifying domestic partner for coverage.
Next Steps
The Company will develop an employee communication describing our agreement on this benefit.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING VEHICLE PURCHASE PLAN
August 24, 2001
Mr. Nate Gooden
UAW Vice President
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Ml 48214
Dear Mr. Gooden:
During the course of negotiations, the parties discussed the Vehicle Purchase Plan that is made available to eligible associates of MMMA from Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, Inc. (MMSA) and DaimlerChrysler.
This letter sets forth the intent of the Company to continue the administration of these plans as long as these plans are made available from MMSA and DaimlerChrysler for eligible associates of MMMA. The terms, conditions and continuation of these plans is determined exclusively by MMSA and DaimlerChrysler. Currently, MMSA is offering a purchase plan based on dealer invoice, DaimlerChrysler recently announced to their dealers and MMMA that the CPI (Certain Designated Individuals) Plan has ended. DaimlerChrysler has indicated in writing to the Company that they are making other arrangements for providing MMMA the same type of program benefits that CD1 offered. Until a permanent replacement program can be offered to employees, DaimlerChrysler has indicated that they will provide our employees with the Friends Program,
It is understood and agreed that MMSA, DaimlerChrysler or MMMA may at any time modify, change or discontinue the Program and MMMA shall have no obligation to bargain concerning the decision to do so. The Union will be advised in advance of any such actions. Further, this Vehicle Purchase Plan
259
is not subject to the Problem Resolution Procedure. The Company agrees to periodically post bulletins informing the associates of the enhanced Vehicle Purchase Plan-
Very truly yours,
C. F. Neal. Jr.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING WAGE PARITY CONCEPT
August 24, 2001
Mr. Nate Gooden
UAW Vice President
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Ml 48214
Dear Mr. Gooden:
During the course of the 2001 negotiations, the parties discussed the method by which MMMA associates would continue to maintain wage parity with DaimlerChrysler workers.
In this regard^ it is understood that the appropriate AIF and general increases mentioned in Article XVII for the production associate and general maintenance/die maintenance associate classifications will be equivalent to the full amount of the increase received by the DaimlerChrysler major assembler and the DaimlerChrysler electrician respectively under the 2003 UAW-DaimlerChrysler Agreement. The MMMA increases will take effect as of the first pay period in March following the corresponding dates of such adjustments at DaimlerChrysler.
It is further understood that the COLA in effect at the time of the adjustment following any such AIF or general increase, or lump sum payments in lieu thereof, will be modified as necessary to offset any differences in incremental COLA payments occurring under the two agreements. For example, if the 2003 UAW-DaimlerChrvsIer Agreement calls for an initial across-the-board 3% lump sum payment, no September 2003 COLA, and diversions of $.03 per quarter starting in December, MMMA would pay the lump sum in March 2004 and reduce the COLA in effect in March 2004 by the amount of the September 2003 COLA adjustment plus
261
the $.06 associated with the December 2003 and March 2004 diversions.
Very truly yours,
C. F. Neal. Jr,
