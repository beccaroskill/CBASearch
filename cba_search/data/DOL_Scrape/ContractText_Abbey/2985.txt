All employees covered by this Agreement who are members of F.O.P. 89 or who elect to become members of F.O.P. 89 shall, pursuant to Section 2.02, remain members of F.O.P. 89 for the duration of this Agreement. Except as provided immediately below, all employees covered by this Agreement who elect not to become members of F.O.P. 89 shall be required, as a condition of continued employment, to pay a service fee in an amount not greater than the dues paid by
1
members of F.O.P. 89, which fees shall be remitted to F.O.P. 89. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any employee covered by this Agreement who was employed on or before July 1, 1974, and who has never elected to become a member of F.O.P. 89, shall not be subject to the dues deduction and service fee provisions of this Article.
Section 2.02	Checkoff.
Upon the presentation by F.O.P. 89 of a list of the individual employees covered by this Agreement for each of whom F.O.P. 89 certifies to have on file a written authorization for dues deduction or service fee deduction duly executed by the employee, F.O.P. 89 shall be entitled to have such employees' membership dues or service fees deducted from their paychecks on a biweekly basis and remitted to F.O.P. 89 on a biweekly basis. Such authorization shall be irrevocable and automatically renewed from year to year thereafter unless revoked by the employee pursuant to Section 13A-108(c) of the Labor Code.
In addition, at the written request of F.O.P. 89, made a reasonable time in advance, the County shall deduct special assessments from the paychecks of F.O.P. 89 members covered by this Agreement from whom F.O.P. 89 certifies it has on file duly executed written authorization permitting the deduction of such assessments.
F.O.P. 89 agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the County for any liability arising from the application of this Article.
Section 2.03	F.O.P. 89 Leave.

The County agrees to meet and consult with the F.O.P. for a reasonable period of time before implementing changes in health benefits provided to employees covered by this Agreement. The parties shall establish a committee for purposes of these discussions if either party deems it desirable.
E.	Two dental plans are available to employees, the cost of which is paid by the employee if the employee elects to enroll in either of the plans.

Section 4.04 Acting Pay.
When an employee below the rank of Captain is asked to assume, and does in fact assume the duties of a Sergeant (or higher rank) in an acting capacity for a period of ten (10) consecutive days or more (including scheduled days off, approved holidays, approved sick leave of two (2) days or less, and approved emergency annual leave, but excluding time for which an employee is otherwise on leave status), he/she shall receive, retroactive to the first (1st) day in the acting capacity, a rate of pay equal to the rate he/she would receive upon promotion to the acting rank, and he/she shall continue to be paid at that rate until relieved of the position by the person for
8
whom he/she is acting, or by a person of rank equal to that position, or by a superior authority, except he/she shall not receive acting pay after being on leave status for more than five (5) consecutive days, and provided further that no acting pay is authorized for any employee who is acting in the absence of another employee who is on extended approved leave for the purpose of F.O.P. 89 business.
Acting Pay Pending Promotions: All vacancies caused by permanent departure from the Department -- retirement, discharge or promotion -- will be filled within ninety (90) days of the vacancy or within ninety (90) days of the establishment of an eligibility list, whichever occurs later, or the first person on the eligibility list (or subsequent persons depending on the number of vacancies) will be paid as if he, she or they had been promoted from the ninety-first (91st) day on. If the eligibility list is not established until more than ninety (90) days after the vacancy, then all vacancies will be filled (or the appropriate person(s) on the eligibility list will be paid acting pay) upon the establishment of the eligibility list. The Department has the authority to eliminate the position during the ninety (90) day period; but if the position is restored, the first person on the promotional list (or subsequent persons depending on the number of vacancies) will be paid as if he, she or they had been promoted from the ninety-first (91st) day on. Upon the establishment of an eligibility list, the County will provide to the F.O.P. a list of the names of officers, in order of finish but without scores, on each final eligibility list.
The Department and F.O.P. 89 agree to continue the past practice governing the relationship between the disciplinary process and promotional process. An otherwise eligible candidate for promotion who is under investigation that could lead to serious disciplinary action (defined as discharge from employment suspension from employment without pay or benefits, or demotion in rank) shall have his or her promotion held in abeyance pending the final outcome of the investigation and the imposition of any serious disciplinary action. During that period, the next candidate on the eligibility list will be offered the acting position as a temporary position and will be entitled to acting pay under Section 4.04. If this candidate refuses the transfer to acting position, the Department will not be required to offer the acting position to the next candidate on the eligibility list and contractual obligations will be satisfied so long as another officer is given the acting position and acting pay. Once the final outcome of the investigation and disciplinary action is known and the first candidate is deemed qualified for promotion, he or she will be promoted retroactive to the date that he or she would otherwise have been entitled to the promotion had an investigation had not been commenced or continued.

Section 5.01 Sick Leave and Bereavement Leave.
Sick leave and bereavement leave policies shall be administered in accordance with the Personnel Law, except that the first three (3) days of bereavement leave taken upon the death of a parent, spouse or child will be administrative leave rather than sick leave.
Section 5.02 Annual Leave.
Except as provided otherwise in Section 5.02 or 5.03, herein, annual leave policies shall be administered in accordance with the Prince George's County Personnel Law.
A.	A maximum of three hundred sixty (360) hours of accumulated annual leave earned beginning with the first pay period in the 1997 leave year (i.e., January 5, 1997) may be carried over from one leave year to the next by an employee (i.e., new annual leave).
B.	An employee shall be allowed to carry over annual leave earned as of the last full pay period in leave year 1996 (i.e., old annual leave) even if such accumulated amount is in excess of the maximum allowed in Subsection A, above or in excess of the 130 day maximum formerly allowed in Section 5.02.
C.	Effective beginning with the 1997 leave year, new annual leave in excess of the three hundred sixty (360) hours limit at the end of a leave year will automatically convert to new sick leave.

Effective beginning with the 1997 leave year (i.e. January 5, 1997), the annual and sick leave balances accumulated by an employee shall, upon the employee's separation from employment be liquidated in the following manner:
1.	The employee may elect to retain all or any portion of the employee's sick and annual leave balances credited to the employee's leave record for the period of time equal to the employee's eligibility for reappointment as determined in accordance with Section 16-148 (a) (8);
2.	The employee may elect to apply all or any portion of the employee's sick and annual leave balances to employment elsewhere, provided another employer has agreed to accept accumulated sick or annual leave balances for credit on behalf of the employee.
3.	The employee may elect to receive cash payment for all or any portion of the employee's annual leave balance in an amount equal to the total number of unused annual leave hours multiplied by the employee's final base hourly rate of pay, subject to the following:
A.	Upon separation from employment, employees who participate in the pension plan may elect to receive a cash payment for the remainder of their annual leave hours that were accumulated as of the end of the 1996 leave year or for up to three hundred sixty (360) hours of accumulated annual leave, whichever is greater. Any remaining amount would be applied toward service credit in the pension plan as provided in Paragraph I. of Article 23 of this Agreement.
B.	Notwithstanding subparagraph 3.A., immediately above, upon separation from employment because of service-related disability, an employee with less than twenty (20) years of service will be permitted to receive payment for all annual leave (old and new).
4.	Upon separation from employment for non-disciplinary reasons (including but not limited to retirement, disability and death), eligible employees will receive cash payment for unused sick leave accumulated as of the end of the 1996 leave year at two and one-half percent (2.5%) for each year of service (through the date of separation) at the employee's base hourly rate of pay as of the date of separation but not to exceed the highest rate of pay for a police lieutenant in July, 2001-- that is, $36.6233 per hour. However, if a police officer with less than twenty (20) years of actual service terminates employment as a result of death or disability, he/she shall receive a fifth percent (50%) cash-out of unused accumulated sick leave as of the end of the 1996 leave year.
5.	For individuals who participate in the pension plan, sick leave earned beginning with the 1997 leave year (i.e., new sick leave) is not subject to cash payment upon separation, but is available to purchase service credit under the pension plan as provided in paragraph I. of Article 23 (Pension Plan) of this Agreement. However, officers whose employment terminates because of death are eligible for cash payment for all sick leave earned, including sick leave earned beginning with the 1997 leave year, at the rates set forth in paragraph 4., immediately above.

The Chief of Police has the right to set reasonable limits on such leaves.

Section 5.07 Disability Leave.
Disability leave policies shall be administered in accordance with the Personnel Law, provided, however, that, for good cause shown, the Personnel Officer may grant up to two (2) additional ninety (90) day periods of disability leave to an officer who has petitioned the Police Chief and has received the Chief's recommendation for additional leave.
Effective with the enactment of the new labor agreement for Fiscal Year 1990, the Department will designate someone from Management who will have responsibility for making a preliminary determination as to whether an injury qualifies for disability leave. The Department will make good faith efforts to make the determination within two (2) working days after all reports and necessary documentation are submitted for review.
When an employee is injured on the job and unable to work, the employee will be placed on disability leave. Where the illness or injury subsequently is determined to be non-service connected or of such a nature as not to require the employee to remain off of work, the employee will be returned to work but not back charged sick or annual leave for the period of time the employee was on disability leave.

Section 5.08 Additional Leave Provision.
When the County Executive closes the County offices for an entire day or any portion thereof, because of extreme inclement weather, other emergencies producing hazardous conditions, or for any other reason, essential employees covered by this Agreement will report to their established work sites and will be paid straight-time wages for hours worked on their regular work shifts. In addition, such employees who work their full regularly scheduled shift during the twenty-four (24) hour period beginning at 6:00 a.m. of the day of the full or partial closing shall be entitled to the number of hours of compensatory leave (up to ten (10) hours per employee per twenty-four (24) hour period depending on the employee's regular work schedule) equal to the number of hours of administrative leave granted to nonessential County employees. For purposes of this subsection, the County workday will be considered ended at 5:00 p.m.
If the employee is directed by the Employer to work any number of hours over and above the employee's regularly scheduled work shift during the aforementioned twenty-four (24) hour period, the employee shall not be entitled to any additional grant of compensatory leave by virtue of the full or partial closing. Rather, the appropriate premium rate, if any, shall apply to such hours.
Compensatory leave earned pursuant to this subsection shall be used in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations.
Section 5.09 Compensatory Leave.
Officers using compensatory leave may choose whether any such leave taken shall be from their available balance of FLSA compensatory leave or County compensatory leave; provided, however, that the County will require an officer whose FLSA compensatory leave balance exceeds two hundred forty (240) hours to use any FLSA compensatory leave in excess of two hundred forty (240) hours before using County compensatory leave.
The F.O.P. will be notified of all delayed openings and emergency closings and a teletype will be initiated.

Employees who retire on a disability pension may elect a reduced joint and survivor pension.
26
Section 23.02 Pop-back of Benefits.

Section 23.04 Supplemental Life Insurance Benefit.
The pension plan shall be amended to provide a supplemental life insurance benefit to a retiree until age sixty (60) in an amount equal to the difference between the face value of his/her County term life insurance at the date of retirement and the decreased insured value of his/her County term life insurance after date of retirement. When the retiree attains age sixty (60), the retiree's total life insurance benefit shall be reduced by fifteen percent (15%) of the original face value per year, to a residual of twenty-five percent (25%) by reducing the Supplemental Life Insurance Benefit by twenty percent (20%) on the first day of the calendar month coinciding with or next following the date of his/her attainment of age sixty (60). On each of the next four (4) anniversaries the Supplemental Life Insurance Benefit will be reduced by the same dollar amount.

27

The Plan document will then be printed in booklet form, and one thousand (1000) copies of the booklet will be made available to Plan participants through F.O.P. 89. The cost of printing this booklet will be borne by the Plan. New participants will be issued a copy of the Plan by F.O.P. 89.
Section 23.07 Representation On the Medical Advisory Board.
The President of F.O.P. 89, or his designated permanent alternate, will serve as a nonvoting member of the Medical Advisory Board in cases involving employees covered by this Agreement.

When an employee is sent to a County doctor for examination before a review of his/her disability status by the Medical Advisory Board (MAB), the employee shall be advised by letter of his/her right to submit other medical information to the MAB. The parties have agreed on a letter to be sent for such purposes. A copy of the County doctor's report will be sent to the employee.
Section 23.12	Joint Study Committee.
A Joint County/F.O.P. 89 Study Committee will be established for the purpose of studying the subject of eligibility for disability pension based on non-job related mental disability.
28
C.	Cost of Living Increase for Retirees.
1.	In January of each year, two-thirds (2/3) of the total investment returns (on a market value basis including realized and unrealized capital gains and losses, as well as interest and dividends) in excess of the interest assumption for the previous plan year will be transferred to a "post-retirement increase fund," with the exception that in January, 1990, the calculation will be from the previous two (2) plan years.
2.	On January 31 of each year, every retiree will receive a permanent increase in his or her retirement benefit as calculated in paragraph 3.
3.	The permanent increase will be determined by actuarially calculating the lifetime benefit that can be provided each eligible retiree from the post-retirement increase fund, determined pursuant to paragraph 1, provided:
(a)	Each eligible retiree will receive an identical dollar amount increase.
(b)	The maximum increase provided shall not exceed one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) per month.
(c)	The minimum increase provided shall be not less than thirty-five dollars ($35.00) per month.
(d)	Effective January 1, 2002, the maximum increase in Cost of Living for Retirees shall not exceed one hundred thirty dollars ($130.00) per month.
(e)	Effective January 1, 2003, the maximum increase in Cost of Living for Retirees shall not exceed one hundred thirty-five dollars ($135.00) per month.
4.	Any amount in the "post-retirement increase fund" described in paragraph (1) in excess of the amount necessary to fund the maximum permanent retirement increase described in paragraph 3(b) will be transferred (returned) to the general pension fund assets.
5.	The phrase "actuarially calculating the lifetime benefit" in subparagraph C.(3), above, means that the Plan's actuary will use the same procedures utilized in 1986 for calculating the COL benefit but will also include an assumption that the pool of assets that has been determined to be available for COL payments, if any, will earn interest at the same rate of return that is assumed for the Pension Fund itself. Also effective with the calculation done in January, 1988, any negative performance of the Pension Fund (the percentage by which actual returns fall short of the interest assumption) will be carried forward to successive calculations under this procedure until totally absorbed by future positive earnings.
6.	The County has agreed to extend this provision regarding cost of living increases to retirees to both current and future retirees with the express understanding and agreement of the parties that the County has not waived any rights it has with regard to whether matters affecting current retirees constitute mandatory subjects of bargaining.
29
D.	Education Incentive Pay Included in Base Compensation for Retirement Pension Benefit Purposes
Effective July 1, 1984, the definition of Compensation as set forth in Section One of the Police Pension Plan as revised and restated effective July 1, 1983, is amended to include Education Incentive Pay (EIP) for retirement pension benefit purposes only.

Effective September 1, 1985, employees participating in the Police Pension Plan may purchase up to two (2) years of prior service as a Prince George's County Police Cadet, in accordance with Plan requirements for the purchase and rate of purchase of prior military service.
F.	Heart Disease and Hypertension Presumption
Pension Plan B - Effective July 1, 1991
For purposes of determining eligibility for line-of-duty disability retirement benefits under Pension Plan B only, any condition or impairment of health caused by heart disease or hypertension resulting in total or partial disability shall be presumed to be a service connected disability and to have been suffered in the line of duty and as a result of his/her employment.
It is the intention of this Section that any Pension Plan B participant who suffers from a condition or impairment of health caused by heart disease or hypertension receive service connected disability benefits from Pension Plan B unless evidence is produced which shall demonstrate to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the employee's impairment of health or disability is not related to his/her employment.
Pension Plan A- Effective July 1, 1999
For purposes of determining eligibility for line-of-duty disability retirement benefits under Pension Plan A only, any condition or impairment of health caused by heart disease or hypertension resulting in total or partial disability shall be presumed to be a service connected disability and to have been suffered in the line of duty and as a result of his/her employment.
It is the intention of this Section that any Pension Plan A participant who suffers from a condition or impairment of health caused by heart disease or hypertension receive service connected disability benefits from Pension Plan A unless evidence is produced which shall demonstrate to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the employee's impairment of health or disability is not related to his/her employment.
G.	Hold Harmless Benefit Calculation
For any Plan member who retires after July 1, 1991, "average annual compensation" as that term is defined in the Pension Plan will be calculated as if the Plan member had received the seven percent (7%) cost of living increase set forth under Section 4.01 C. of the original Agreement and scheduled to become effective during the first full pay period beginning on or
30
after July 1, 1991. This salary shall also be applicable for calculating any leave payouts due upon retirement during this period of time.
For any Plan member who retires within twenty-four (24) months of FY95, "average annual compensation" as that term is defined in the Pension Plan will be calculated as if the Plan member had received the merit step increase to which he/she would otherwise have been entitled to receive during Fiscal Year 1994. This salary shall also be applicable for calculating any leave payouts due upon retirement during this period of time.
Any plan member who retires before the member has completed twenty-one (21) years of service and who otherwise would have been eligible to receive a merit increase during Fiscal Year 1996 but did not receive one because of Section 4.01(C) will be held harmless for the purpose of pension benefit calculation and thus be treated as if the member had received a Fiscal Year 1996 merit increase on schedule.
Any plan member who retires before the member has completed twenty-one (21) years of service and who otherwise would have been eligible to receive a merit increase during Fiscal Year 1997 but did not receive one because of Section 4.01C. will be held harmless for the purpose of pension benefit calculation and thus be treated as if the member had received a Fiscal Year 1997 merit increase on schedule.
H.	Pension Boards
One (1) F.O.P. 89 bargaining unit member will be added as a voting member of the Administrative Review Board and the Board of Trustees, with the understanding that the number of Board members (both Boards) will not otherwise increase during the duration of the contract (that is, through June 30, 1993). A third (3rd) F.O.P. 89 bargaining unit member will be added as a voting member of the Administrative Review Board and the Board of Trustees, with the understanding that the number of Board members (both Boards) will not otherwise increase during the duration of the contract (that is, through June 30, 1995).
I.	Annual Leave and Sick Leave Purchase of Pension Credit
Effective January 1, 1993, all participants will be permitted to purchase additional pension credit after twenty (20) years of service with annual and sick leave at "non-window" (40 annual/80 sick) rates as set forth in Section 4.1(A)(b)(ii) of the Pension Plan.
J.	Contingent Annuitant after Retirement
The Police Pension Plan will be amended to allow a retiree who marries after retirement to reduce his or her retirement benefit and name the new spouse as a contingent annuitant, provided there is no actuarial cost to the County and there is sufficient evidence of insurability.
K.	The County agrees to participate in a Joint Study Committee to propose an actuarially determined cost neutral Drop Plan to the Union. The County’s proposal is due to the Union by March 31, 2004.
L.	See also Attachment B of this Agreement.
31

ARTICLE 27	-- DURATION AND REOPENER

ATTACHMENT A - WAGE SCALE
UNIFORM WAGE SCALE
Effective July 2, 1989, the current modified "MIN-MAX" system in effect for all members of the bargaining unit will be replaced by the Uniform Wage Scale contained in this Attachment A and described below.
DESCRIPTION OF THE UNIFORM WAGE SCALE
For each rank of police officer in the bargaining unit, there is established a pay grade containing fifteen (15) pay rates (steps) ranging from Step 0 through Step 14: Police Officer - L01; Police Officer First Class - L02; Police Corporal - L03; Police Sergeant - L04; and, Police Lieutenant -L05. The percentage values of the intervals between steps are three and one-half percent (3.5%) from Step 0 through Step 11 and three percent (3%) for the three remaining intervals from Step 11 through Step 14.
An employee will be eligible to advance to the next step for his/her rank on his/her anniversary date at the rate of one (1) step per year up to and including Step 12, provided that he/she receives at least a satisfactory performance evaluation for the preceding year. After reaching Step 12, an officer will be eligible to advance to Steps 13 and 14 after three (3) years of service at each step (that is, after having completed fifteen (15) and eighteen (18) years of service, respectively), provided that his/her performance for the applicable period has been evaluated as satisfactory.
Employees covered by this Agreement and hired before July 1, 1987 will keep the anniversary dates that they held on July 1, 1987 for as long as they are continuously employed. Employees hired on or after July 1, 1987 will have as their anniversary dates the dates of their initial appointment and those anniversary dates will not be changed while those employees are continuously employed. Effective June 30, 1996, the County will adjust each officer's anniversary date to the earlier of the Officer's date of hire or current anniversary date.
Upon promotion to the rank of Police Officer First Class or Police Corporal, an employee's salary rate shall be increased to that of the corresponding pay step for the promotional grade (that is, an increase equivalent to two (2) three and one-half percent (3.5%) steps). Officers hired on or after July 1, 1995 will be eligible to take the Police Officer First Class (PFC) examination after they have completed three (3) years as a Prince George's County Police Officer (now eighteen (18) months) and will be eligible to take the Police Corporal exam after completing two (2) years of service as a Prince George's County Police Officer First Class (now sixteen (16) months).
Upon promotion to the rank of Sergeant or Lieutenant, an employee's salary rate shall be increased to that of the corresponding pay step for the promotional grade (that is, a ten percent (10%) increase).
34
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UNIFORM WAGE SCALE
Fiscal Year 1990:
Effective July 2, 1989, employees covered by this Agreement, after receiving the four percent (4%) cost of living adjustment, will be placed on the Uniform Wage Scale at the step for their rank which is immediately above their annual salary.
However, an officer whose salary, when adjusted for the four percent (4%) cost of living adjustment, exceeds the maximum salary payable at his/her rank will be red-circled at that salary, and will continue to be red-circled. Further, an officer who was hired at a rate of pay greater than the entry rate will be placed on the pay scale pursuant to the foregoing rules and will maintain the resultant step differential.
On their anniversary dates during FY90, all officers will receive a one step anniversary increase (either three and one-half percent (3.5%) or three percent (3%), depending on their July 2 placement on the Uniform Wage Scale) to the next step on the Uniform Wage Scale unless the officer is at Step 14.
Fiscal Year 1991:
On their anniversary dates during FY91, an officer below the step which would be warranted by his or her years of service will be placed at that Step. An officer who was hired at a rate of pay greater than the entry rate will be placed on the pay scale pursuant to this rule so as to maintain the resultant step differential.
MODIFICATION OF UNIFORM WAGE SCALE -- EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 1994
Effective July 1, 1994, the Uniform Wage Scale is modified as follows:
For each rank of police officer in the bargaining unit, there is established a pay grade containing fifteen (15) pay rates (steps) ranging from Step A through Step O.
Grade L01 is the pay grade for the rank of Police Officer. The percentage values of the intervals between the steps are three and one-half percent (3.5%) from Step A through Step L and three percent (3%) for the remaining three intervals from Step L through Step O. The entry rate for a Police Officer is Step A. A Police Officer (L01) will be eligible to advance to the next step for that rank on the officer's anniversary date at the rate of one step per year up to and including Step N (after 13 years), provided he or she receives at least a satisfactory performance evaluation for the preceding year. After reaching Step N, a Police Officer (L01) will be eligible to advance to Step O after 2 years of service at Step N, (that is, after having completed 15 years of service), provided that the officer's performance for the applicable period has been evaluated as satisfactory.
Grades L02 through L05 are the pay grades for Police Officer First Class (L02), Police Corporal (L03), Police Sergeant (L04) and Police Lieutenant (L05). The percentage values of the intervals between the steps are three and one-half percent (3.5%) from Step A through Step K and three percent (3%) for the remaining intervals from Step K through Step O. Officers in the ranks of
35
Police Officer First Class through Police Lieutenant will be eligible to advance to the next step for their rank on the officer's anniversary date at the rate of one step per year up to and including Step M (after 13 years) provided he or she receives at least a satisfactory performance evaluation for the preceding year. After reaching Step M, officers in the ranks of Police Officer First Class through Police Lieutenant will be eligible to advance to Step N after two (2) years of service (that is, after having completed fifteen (15) years of service) and to Step O after three (3) years of service at Step N (that is, after having completed eighteen (18) years of service).
Upon promotion to the rank of Police Officer First Class (L02) or Police Corporal (L03), an employee's salary rate shall be increased to the rate of pay at the step of the promotional grade that will provide an increase equivalent to two (2) three and one-half percent (3.5%) steps. Upon promotion to the rank of Sergeant (L04) or Lieutenant (L05), an employee's salary rate shall be increased to that of the corresponding pay step (for example, Step J to Step J) for the promotional grade (that is, a ten percent (10%) increase).
IMPLEMENTATION OF MODIFIED UNIFORM WAGE SCALE

Effective beginning on July 1, 1999, any police officer covered by this Agreement hired before July 1, 1996 who completes eighteen (18) years of actual and continuous service as defined in the Police Pension Plan but who is not at the step for his/her rank on the Uniform Wage Scale which reflects the completion of eighteen (18) years of service will be placed at that step on the date upon which the officer has completed eighteen (18) years of service, and the officer's anniversary date will be changed, if necessary, to reflect his/her date of hire.

ATTACHMENT B - PENSION PLANS
Prior to July 1, 1992, officers who participate in Pension Plan A (the Old Plan) will be afforded the opportunity to transfer to Pension Plan B (the New Plan) and commence participation in Plan B effective July 1, 1992. The election of any officer who so chooses Plan B is irrevocable. The two Plans are described as follows:
PLAN A
The benefits payable under Plan A are the benefits payable under the pension plan that was in effect prior to the enactment of this Agreement, except that:
For each additional year of service over twenty (20) years, the pension benefit shall be increased by two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) up to a maximum benefit of seventy- five percent (75%) (i.e., after thirty (30) years of service).
For a sixty-day window period following the effective date of this Agreement, officers who participate in Pension Plan A will be afforded the opportunity to transfer to Pension Plan B and commence participation in Plan B effective July 1, 1997, provided that (1) the election of any officer who chooses to transfer to Plan B is irrevocable and (2) the officers choosing to transfer from Plan A to Plan B shall pay the additional costs, if any, imposed on the Pension Plan by these transfers in the form of additional employee contributions to the retirement system over a period of up to five years. These additional costs, if any, will be calculated by the actuaries and disclosed to all officers in Plan A prior to the sixty-day window period.
Effective July 1, 1999, a one-time election will be provided to officers in Pension Plan A to select a variation providing an increase in normal retirement benefit from fifty percent (50%) to fifty-two percent (52%) and a decrease in service connected disability retirement benefits from seventy percent (70%) to sixty-four percent (64%).
Effective July 1, 2001, a one-time election will be provided to officers in Pension Plan A or the variation of Plan A. For officers still in Plan A, they may select a variation providing an increase in normal retirement after twenty (20) years of service from fifty percent (50%) or fifty-two percent (52%), while service-connected disability retirement under this Pension Plan A shall be decreased from seventy percent (70%) or sixty-four percent (64%). For officers already in the variation of Plan A, they may select another variation providing an increase in normal retirement after twenty (20) years of service from fifty-two percent (52%) to fifty-four percent (54%), while service-connected disability retirement under this variation of Plan A shall be decreased from sixty-four percent (64%) to sixty percent (60%).
PLAN B
The normal retirement benefit (i.e., twenty (20) years) is sixty percent (60%) of the high two (2) year average. For each additional year of service the pension benefit shall be increased by two and one-half percent (2.5%) up to a maximum of eighty-five percent (85%) (i.e., after thirty (30) years of service). The retirement benefits for non-line-of-duty disability shall continue to be fifty percent (50%). The retirement benefits for officers with less than twenty (20) years of service for line-of-duty disability is seventy percent (70%) for the first one year (first twelve (12)
43
monthly payments) of benefit payments, and then is reduced to fifty-five percent (55%) thereafter. Officers with twenty (20) or more years of service are not eligible for this disability benefit.
An officer who is permanently and totally disabled in the line of duty such that he/she is unable to perform the duties of any occupation will receive a ninety percent (90%) disability benefit regardless of years of service. The loss of both hands, or both arms, or both feet, or both legs, or both eyes, or any two thereof, in the line of duty, creates a rebuttable presumption that the officer is totally and permanently disabled within the meaning of this provision.
Officers who are hired after December 31, 1989 will participate in Plan B only with the further modification that line-of-duty disability benefits are fifty-five percent (55%) from the outset (i.e., no one year at seventy percent (70%)).
Subject to approval by the Internal Revenue Service, officers who are in Plan B and are disabled after twenty years of service will remain eligible for disability retirement, and, if they retire due to a service- connected disability after their retirement date, will receive their normal retirement benefit offset by the disability benefit, in addition to the nontaxable disability benefit. For example, an officer with twenty-two (22) years of service is eligible for a normal retirement of sixty-five percent (65%) (sixty percent (60%) for twenty (20) years, five percent (5%) for additional two (2) years); if disabled on the job, the officer would receive fifty-five percent (55%) tax free disability benefit and ten percent (10%) taxable pension benefit, instead of current sixty-five percent (65%) taxable pension.

ATTACHMENT C - PHYSICAL AGILITY TEST
PHYSICAL AGILITY TEST
A. Officers hired on or after July 1, 2001 must successfully pass the Physical Agility Test (PAT) as described below.
1.	In order to be eligible to take a promotional examination at any rank, an officer must have passed the PAT within the twelve- (12) month period prior to the promotional examination.
2.	In order to be eligible for a merit increase, an officer must have passed the PAT within the twelve- (12) month period prior to the officer’s anniversary date.
3.	Recruits in the Academy will have to pass the test while in the Academy to meet graduation requirements. Completion of the test while in the Academy will count for eligibility for their first merit increase. Other officers will normally be scheduled to take the test approximately three (3) to six (6) months prior to their anniversary date, but it is understood that these officers may actually take the test outside of this general time frame. The successful completion of the test will count so long as it is within twelve (12) months prior to their anniversary date.
4.	For officers who do not pass the test prior to their anniversary date, they will have up to a year from their anniversary date to cure the failure. If an officer does not pass the test prior to his or her anniversary date but then passes it after his or her anniversary date, the officer will receive the merit increase the officer should have received on his or her anniversary date, but the resultant pay increase will be prospective only. Furthermore, if an officer who did not successfully complete the test prior to his or her anniversary date subsequently cures the failure after his or her anniversary date, the successful completion of the test will cure the previous failure but will not also count as a successful completion of the test for his or her upcoming anniversary date. In these circumstances, the officer will have to wait a reasonable period of time, generally considered to be thirty (30) to forty-five (45) days, before taking the test again for credit towards his or her upcoming anniversary date.
5.	An officer has only one (1) year after his or her anniversary date to cure a test failure. After the one (1) year period has expired (i.e., after the officer passes his or her next anniversary date), the opportunity to cure the failure is lost, and the opportunity to restore the lost step increase is therefore also lost.
An example might help to illustrate some of the points covered above. Let’s assume an officer is hired on July 1, 2001. That officer will be provided with the opportunity to take the Physical Agility Test during Academy training. Once the officer successfully completes the test, the officer will then be eligible for a merit increase in July of 2002, provided that he or she meets all other requirements for a merit increase.
In years subsequent to graduation from the Academy, if an officer does not pass the Physical Agility Test, the officer will be provided with additional opportunities in the subsequent year to pass the test prior to his/her anniversary date. Assuming that the Officer’s anniversary date is
45
July 2002, the officer will not receive a merit step increase until he/she passes the Physical Agility Test in the subsequent year, that is, from July 2002 to July 2003 to pass the test. If the officer passes the test in February 2003, for example, he/she will receive the step increase that the officer did not receive in July 2002, but it will be prospective only and not retroactive to July 2002. Additionally, the officer will then have to wait a period of thirty (30) to forty-five (45) days, and then retake the test in order to be eligible for the anniversary increase he/she would otherwise be eligible to receive in July 2003.
