DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE PROGRAMS
(d)	The parties recognize the problems that drug and alcohol abuse have created within the construction industry and agree on implementing drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs, that will work toward maintaining a safe workplace, free of drugs and alcohol.
Drug Testing: The Employer and the Union are committed to a policy that promotes safety in the work nf;>ce, employee hcaiiii, and well being. In consideration of this policy the Union and the Employer agree that any employee found to be under the influence of, in possession of, engaged in the distribution of drugs or alcohol on the job site shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate discharge.
Within two (2) weeks of reporting to the job site, each new employee may be scheduled for a drug test. Employees using a prescription drug which may impair mental or motor function shall inform their supervisor in writing of such drug use.
Employees* involvement with drugs and alcohol can adversly affect job performance and employee morale. In the construction industry the consequences of drug or alcohol use or influence while on the job site can be disastrous. The Employer and Union, therefore, agree to the following policy to insure all employees of a safe and efficient job site free from the effect of drug and alcohol use or influence.
All job sites or work areas are subject to massive drug screening or random drug screening. Any employee who is involved in an on-the-job accident resulting in injury to a person or property, or whose observed behavior raises a reasonable suspicion of probable cause of illegal drug or alcohol use
8
impairment while on the job site, may be required as a condition of continued employment to submit to a test for alcohol and/or illegal drug use which impaired the employee’s ability to safely perform his/her duties on the job site. Such tests usually involve a sampling of the employee’s blood, urine, or breath. Any employee who is asked to submit to such a test will be required to sign a consent form. If an employee who is asked to submit to a test refuses to do so, or refuses to sign the necessary consent form, that employee will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge.
All testing will be done by a reliable, established laboratory. If this initial test screen result indicates positive findings, further testing of the same sample must be done to confirm the original findings before the laboratory can report positive findings. The confirmation test will be conducted by an independent, accredited National Institute of Drug Abuse or College of American Pathology Laboratory and utilize the more scientific Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry examination (GC/MS). The results of all tests will be kept confidential between the employee and the Employer.
The employee shall be paid his/her regular hourly wages and fringes for the time required for drug testing provided results are negative.
If the GC/MS test results are positive, the employee may be granted a leave of absence for the purpose of drug and alcohol rehabilitation. If the employee is eligible, such rehabilitation programs are covered under the Laborers’ International Union of North America AFL-CIO Health and Welfare Program providing the employee confines himself/herself to a twenty-four (24) hour licensed rehabilitation medical facility.
The employee shall be removed from the Employer’s job site. Upon presentation of certification of the employee’s successful completion of the drug/alcohol rehabilitation program, the employee may be restored to his/her original job with the Employer.
If the employee was reinstated he/she shall for the next succeeding twelve (12) month period, present to the company
9
representative monthly certification of negative drug/alcohol test results; failure to do so will result in denying the employee the right to maintain his/her availability to be sent to a job site or if working, to be removed from work.

All employee or Union initiated grievances must be reported to the Local Union office as soon as possible. Grievances must be filed in writing.

The Business Manager will report the grievance to the Employer within three (3) days after receipt. All Contractor initiated grievances must be reported to the Local Union office within fourteen (14) days after occurrence. Failure of the employee or the Contractor to meet the time limits set forth above shall cause the grievance to be deemed
28
waived and not subject to arbitration.
61.	In the event that differences arise during the term of this Agreement concerning its interpretation or application, a prompt effort shall be made to settle employee or Union initiated differences at the site of the dispute, first between the Contractor and the Local Union and its members involved in the dispute.

They shall meet within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice to consider and resolve the dispute.
63.	In the event that the parties named in Step 2 are unable to settle the dispute within the ten (10) days, either party may refer the matter to arbitration by written notice to the other party within ten (10) days thereafter, for final and binding decision by a single qualified arbitrator. The Union and Employer shall have five (5) days to agree upon an arbitrator to hear and determine the dispute, failing which it shall be submitted by either party, by written request to the American Arbitration Association for the submission of a list of names of seven (7) qualified arbitrators from which list the parties will select a sole, qualified arbitrator. After receipt of such a list the parties shall within five (5) days meet to select the arbitrator, and proceeding by lot alternately strike names from the list of arbitrators until one (1) name remains. The name of the person last remaining shall be deemed acceptable to both parties and shall serve as the arbitrator to hear and decide the dispute which has been certified to arbitration. Each party shall have the right to exercise once within the five (5) day period in the case of each dispute, to reject the list submitted, in which event an immediate request
29
will be made for another list of seven (7) arbitrators.
64.	The arbitrator selected in the manner above indicated shall not add to, subtract from or modify any of the terms of the Agreement. He shall not change existing wage rates established in this Agreement. His authority is limited to matters of dispute, differences, disagreement or controversy arising concerning the interpretation, construction or application of the terms of this Agreement. Any decision of an arbitrator involving an award for back pay shall be limited to the amount of wages that the employee involved should properly have earned in the employ of the Contractor, less any wage received for employment accepted in place of his former employment, and unemployment compensation benefits received. The arbitrator shall decide the grievance or dispute in writing and deliver a copy to each party within thirty (30) days from the close of the arbitration hearing. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and of any technical assistance required by the arbitrator and all costs of the hearing shall be divided equally between the parties.
