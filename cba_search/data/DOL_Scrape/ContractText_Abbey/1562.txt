If, because of lack of work at a bam, an Employee asks for a transfer, he will be transferred within forty-eight (48) hours after he makes such request, and he shall take his place on the bam list of the new bam in accordance with his master seniority. The request for transfer shall be made through the Shop Steward, in writing, and not later than 8:00 A.M. If the request is made after 8:00 A.M., that day is not to be counted. If the request is not granted, the Employee will report to the Union.

The Employer shall have the right to order standby time at 7:00 A.M., 7:30 A.M. or 8:00 A.M. If the Employer elects standby time, such standby time shall be from 7:00 A.M. to 8:00 A.M.; 7:30 A.M. to 8:30 A.M.; or 8:00 A.M. to 9:00 A.M.
Standby time will be paid only if the Employee does not work that day.

If an Employee is ordered to stand by at 7:00 A.M., 7:30 A.M. or 8:00 A.M. and is not assigned to work he receives one (1) hour straight time from the time he is ordered to stand by and those who were posted and shaped on time before 7:00 A.M. still receive time and a half to 7:00 A.M., as per Section 3.
SECTION 10.	SHOP STEWARD.
There shall be a Shop Steward in each bam of the Employer, designated in such manner as the Union decides, who shall be placed at the top of the Bam Seniority List and retain such position as long as he shall continue as Shop Steward. He shall attempt to adjust any complaint or grievance brought to his attention.
The Shop Steward shall be subject to such work assignments as are other Employees and shall perform such duties as are assigned to him in his regular turn. The Employer, however, shall arrange the work of the Shop Steward that he shall finish the day’s work at the bam to which he is regularly assigned. In the slack season, the Shop Steward shall be the last man laid off and the first man rehired in his bam. The Shop Steward shall not be discriminated against.
Assuming that the Shop Steward's type of equipment is used at his bam on any day, he shall leave at the last shape of the day. Thus, if there is only one shape, he will leave at that shape; if there are two shapes, he leaves at the second shape; if there are three shapes, he leaves at 8 A.M., but he may be the first man to leave at the last shape of the day. While he is at the bam, he shall be available for work. In the event of an early start (shape before 7:00 A.M.) the foregoing shall also apply.
(A)	The Shop Steward shall perform his traditional Shop Steward functions, including reviewing safety factors in a manner consistent with OSHA, but shall be limited to matters arising under this Agreement and shall not interfere with the Employees of any other Employer.
(B)	In the event four (4) to fourteen (14) trucks make deliveries from a bam on any day, the Steward shall not spend more than two (2) hours performing his functions under this Section on that day.

8
to perform his functions in a responsible manner and may be assigned incidental duties by the Employer.
(C)	For the performance of his functions in paragraphs (A) and (B), the Steward shall be furnished appropriate transportation (which shall be a vehicle not larger than a pick-up truck).

In the event such action is taken with the approval of the Union, the Employer shall have the right to have the matter in dispute submitted to and decided by the Joint Labor-Management Disputes Panel within twenty-four (24) hours, and if deadlocked, to the first available Arbitrator on the panel on an expedited basis and within 24 hours, if possible. If the Union does not cooperate in such expedited procedure, any action previously taken shall be revoked.
(F)	The Shop Steward and On-Site Steward shall receive One Dollar ($ 1.00) per hour, in addition to the wage provided in the Agreement.
(G)	The Employer will furnish to its Shop Steward a list of all its subcontractors two weeks before the subcontractors arrive on the job site.
(H)	Upon a determination by the Union that an Employer has substantially undermined the payment of wages, Welfare, Pension, Annuity or Job Training Fund contributions, Dues or Building Fund Check-off, and that it would be in the interests of the bargaining unit to appoint a Shop Steward from outside the bargaining unit, the Union may appoint such an individual as Shop Steward until it determines that substantial compliance with the conditions in the contract has been restored.

This amount will increase to Thirteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($13,500,000.00), effective July 1,1994 and to Fourteen Million Dollars ($14,000,000.00), effective July 1,1995.

This amount will increase to Thirteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($13,500,000.00), effective July 1, 1994 and to Fourteen Million Dollars ($14,000,000.00), effective July 1, 1995.
If the job is a multi-shift job, there shall be an OSS for each shift.

(4)	Where the job is a foundation for a building the OSS will be
employed only if, under the High Rise Agreement, an OSS is required and at the dollar amounts set forth therein. The OSS will then be employed and paid for by the Employer under this Agreement until the foundation for the building superstructure or, in the event of a multi-building project, the first foundation for the building superstructure is completed or when the General Contractor, Subcontractor or Construction Manager under the High-Rise Agreement performs any work with its forces on the job, whichever occurs sooner, at which time said General Contractor, Subcontractor or Construction Manager will solely be responsible to pay the OSS.
This provision is only applicable for building foundation work and is not applicable on Heavy Industrial job sites which work under the Heavy Construction and Excavating Contract and Asphalt Contract, (i.e. Power Plants, Sewage Plants, Water Pollution Plants, Railroad Grade Crossings, Atomic Power Plants, Subway jobs).
(5)	The OSS and any replacement OSS shall be appointed by the Union from the seniority list of the Employer. If the Union replaces the OSS, the Union agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the Employer for any arbitration awards or Court judgments for wages lost by a replaced OSS resulting from the Union's actions in
10

As a standard practice, the OSS shall not be used for the transportation of materials between j ob sites of the Employer. This does not preclude the movement of critical supplies.
On a multi-truck job the on-site steward shall not leave the site, except from time to time, the on-site steward may leave the site once a day within reason.
On a single truck job where there is an on-site steward employed, the on-site steward duties will be mutually defined at a pre-job conference.
Persons, including Shop Stewards and On-Site Stewards, are absolutely forbidden and without any actual or apparent authority to, in any manner, interfere or threaten to interfere with the operations of any person, including Employer signatories -or Employers that are non-signatories - to any collective bargaining agreement with this Local, without, prior thereto, receiving express approval for such conduct from the Chief Operating Officer of this Local.
(8)	An Employee who has been appointed as an OSS shall maintain his position on the seniority list of the Employer he was employed by at the time of his appointment for the duration of his appointment, provided he returns to his Employer within fifteen (15) working days of the termination of his employment.
