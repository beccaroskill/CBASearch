PREAMBLE
HPWO PARTNERSHIP
The International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers Union (IAM LL #873) and the John Deere Horicon Works recognize that change is a never-ending process. Even though change is inevitable it should be positive. By working together in a mutually supportive team focused partnership we can manufacture products and provide services that “Meet Customer Needs through Business Excellence”. The goal is to enable us to develop relationships, which are mutually beneficial in keeping us strong and ensuring our future growth and prosperity. We look to the future recognizing the challenges that lie ahead. To become a High Performance Workplace Organization (HPWO) requires a long-term commitment, by both partners, to continuous education and communication. This degree of workplace change will require that all members/employees, wall to wall, are supported both from the union and management.
Work Environment
The Parties expect and deserve a safe, clean and healthy work environment. Our workplace will be closely monitored for the presence of appropriate ergonomic design principles. Our facilities will be clean and well organized to keep our members/employees proud of their workplace and the ongoing role they have in maintaining it.
Interpersonal relationships at the John Deere Horicon Works will be built on trust and honesty. These relationships should be characterized by focusing on teamwork, common goals, continuous improvement, and respect for the unique aspects and differences individuals bring to the workplace. Employees will expect to be treated with respect and dignity and in return all employees will treat each other in the same manner. The Parties commit to work together in an encouraging, inspiring, and creative environment that is driven by the goal “Meeting Customer Needs through Business Excellence.”
Productivity and Continuous Improvement
Both Parties recognize the need to be best-in-class when measuring the cost of our products. Our profitability and longterm competitive advantage lies in the ability of our people to produce products both efficiently and effectively.
The need to continuously improve our processes and methods

PREAMBLE
is critical to maintaining our ongoing competitive advantage. As Partners, we need to support, develop and grow our people, because without them we do not have a long-term competitive edge. We need to encourage our people to use their intellect to contribute to the efforts that maintain our position of “Growing the Business”. Through this leadership we will grow our people and nurture their efforts to improve contributions to the business.
Decision-making
This collective bargaining agreement details how the Parties will deal with each other in many areas of management rights, union rights, and contractual obligations. In all other areas, the Parties will attempt to use consensus as the preferred mode of decision making. In the context of the John Deere Horicon Works business process, consensus will be defined as follows:
Consensus will have been achieved in a group or team setting when alternatives have been identified and the group decides it will choose and support one such alternative. In its purest sense consensus means that the group or team has reached a decision that will be supported by the actions of every member of such group or team. The decision need not be the primary choice of every team member, but demonstrated support of the alternative once consensus has been reached is key. In the event that a group is divided as to which decision they can support, the group must continue to work through the issue relying on data and facts as the basis for such consensus decision-making. In the event a portion of a group is unable to indicate support for a decision that the balance of the group supports, those person(s) must either withdraw their objection or offer alternatives and convince the group of the merits of this alternative position, in effect allowing the group to reach consensus on the alternate idea. Simply saying “no” is never an acceptable option.

PREAMBLE
Summary:
Change is inevitable. The Parties desire these changes to be positive. The last word on shaping this positive change is trust. Deeds, not words, establish trust. But words agreed on through a collective negotiation establish procedures for both parties to make our ensuing actions believable and trustworthy. As we head towards the 21st Century, the John Deere Horicon Works of Deere and Company and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, will continue to discuss ways to make the Horicon Works more competitive while ensuring stability and security for its members/employees. The goal is to continue our growth as a High Performance Work Organization and to trend towards world class in all areas. Leadership, teamwork, and the vision of a positive partnership will be necessary. Employ them, and nothing is impossible.

Section 11.	Distribution of Overtime
(Ref. Letters - pgs. 161, 187, 189 & 191) (Reference Overtime Manual)
A.	The Company may require any employee to work overtime. When overtime work is required in a department and is assigned to a particular job classification or overtime group then the overtime work shall be distributed among those in the job classification or overtime group as follows:
l.	The overtime shall be divided as equally as practical, however, the spread between the employee with the least amount of actual
ARTICLE V
19
overtime hours and the employee with the greatest amount of actual overtime hours will not exceed twenty-four (24) actual overtime hours as of the last workday in each calendar month.
2.	The running cumulative total of the overtime records will be accepted as correct unless an alleged entry for the day's hours is brought to the Company's attention within seven (7) working days of that entry. The overtime list will be posted on the department bulletin board and available on the appropriate labor reporting screen.
3.	The employee must be qualified to do the work required.
4.	The employee that is offered the overtime assignment and is excused from the assignment because of a personal compelling reason satisfactory to the Company will be "charged" as if he or she had worked.
5.	The employee who accepts the overtime assignment and fails to report will be "charged" as if he or she had worked.
6.	Hours worked on Sundays and holidays will be considered overtime hours for the purpose of this Section.
B.	When an employee enters another classification or overtime group he or she will be credited with the maximum hours worked by any employee in the particular classification or overtime group affected.
C.	When an employee returns to work after being absent for an extended period of time (greater than one (1) calendar week, excluding holidays) he will be credited with the number of hours necessary to bring his spread up to what it was prior to such absence. An Employee absent for one calendar week or less, excluding holidays, will not be charged for any overtime worked by employees in his overtime group unless the overtime
ARTICLE V
20
hours worked during his absence would cause the high employees in the group to be more than 24 hours ahead of the absent employee. In that case, the absent employee will be credited with only enough hours to bring him back within the 24 hour overtime spread.
D.	In the event the twenty-four (24) hour spread is exceeded as of the last workday of the month, then the employee with the least number of overtime hours in the affected classification or overtime group will be paid the hours necessary to bring him or her within the twenty-four (24) hour spread. This payment will be made to one employee for each mistake (i.e., payment will be made on a one-for-one principle) provided the spread violation is called to the attention of the Company within seven (7) working days from the last workday of the month in which the twenty-four (24) hour spread was allegedly violated.
Section 12.	Report-In -- Call-In Pay (Reference Overtime Manual)
A.	Any employee who has worked on the previous workday and who reports for work at his regular time on his regular shift unless he has been told in advance not to report, and whose regular work is not available, or whose regular work becomes unavailable prior to his completion of four (4) hours of work from the start of his regular shift, shall be offered other work on the following basis:
1.	If the employee is an incentive worker, he shall not receive less than four (4) hours' work which shall be paid for at the rate of job assigned, but not less than the occupational rate of the work normally performed by the employee.
2.	If the employee is a straight hourly paid worker, he shall receive not less than four (4) hours' work which shall be paid for at the rate of job assigned, but not less than his regular hourly rate.
ARTICLE V
21

If the employee's job is not in operation because of an occurrence beyond the Company's control, such as fire, flood or other weather conditions, explosion, power failure, interruption of power or heat because of unavailability of natural gas or other fuel, or work stoppage in violation of Article XVI, the above provisions shall not apply.
B.	Any employee who, having left the plant after his regular shift, is recalled to perform additional work, shall be given the minimum of four (4) hours' work on the following basis:
1.	If the employee is an incentive worker, he shall not receive less than four (4) hours' work which shall be paid for at the rate of job assigned, but not less than the occupational rate of the work normally performed by the employee.
2.	If the employee is a straight hourly paid worker, he shall receive not less than four (4) hours' work which shall be paid for at the rate of job assigned, but not less than his regular hourly rate.
3.	Any employee so recalled will be paid the appropriate shift premium, if any, determined by his starting time for the call-in period for the time he works.
C.	In either A or B above, such part of the four (4) hours worked shall be paid at the appropriate overtime rate, if overtime, and the unworked time shall be straight time.
D.	The straight time provided under the above provisions for unworked time, if any, shall not cancel out any payment for unworked time that may be due under Section 10-A of this Article.
Section 13.	Computation of Overtime
A. The overtime referred to in this article shall consist of actual straight-time earnings for the overtime hours plus
ARTICLE V
22
the extra pay provided for in such overtime and computed as follows:

C.	An employee who is absent from work on a scheduled workday for reasons other than as set out above may request pay for such absence which will be granted if and to the extent he is eligible for such pay.
