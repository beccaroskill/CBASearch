AGREEMENT
between
and
KAISER PERNIANENTE.
July 1,2004 through June 30, 2009
Dear Kaiser Member,
This book contains a greatly improved contract covering Local 5 members at Kaiser Permanente. In our negotiations, dozens of contract sections were rewritten, with improvements in contract language covering virtually every aspect of your life at work.
All in all, this contract is the best Kaiser contract in Local 5 history, and is far and away the best health-care worker contract in Hawaii. Local 5 achieved this by running a smart, sophisticated negotiation campaign that was based on the participation of hundreds of union members from Kaiser facilities statewide. This contract is a victory for our membership.
No contract means anything if we don’t enforce it and make use of it. Local 5 workers stepped up to win this new contract. We have every confidence that we will do so again.
Congratulations on your victory, now and for what we will achieve in the future.
In Solidarity,

B.	Issue Resolution. The parties are committed to trying to resolve complaints and problems before they become grievances. To this end, they will meet and discuss issues that may result in grievances. However, it is understood that a lack of discussion will not preclude a grievance being filed at Step 1.
C.	Process.

(a)	The arbitrator shall be chosen by mutual agreement between the parties from the panel of arbitrators listed in Exhibit D, Panel of Arbitrators, in the event mutual agreement cannot be reached within seven (7) calendar days of the receipt of notice to arbitrate, one (1) representative for both sides shall receive from the American Arbitration Association a list of five (5) names based on availability, willingness, and knowledge. The parties shall by a flip of a coin decide the first
-12-
choice to alternately strike names from the list until one (1) name remains. The one remaining will serve as arbitrator in the case.
(b)	Following the selection of an arbitrator, the parties will send a joint letter to the arbitrator notifying him/her of his/her selection and enclosing a copy of the original written grievance and a copy of the collective bargaining Agreement in effect at the time that the grievance took place.

All decisions of the arbitrator shall be in writing, and a copy thereof shall be submitted to each of the parties. The arbitrator shall receive for his/her services such remuneration as shall be acceptable to him/her and agreed upon by the parties.

B.	Workday Defined. A regular workday shall be defined as any work performed by an employee for shifts of four (4) hours or more up to eight (8) hours in a day. A regular workday shall not exceed eight (8) hours except as outlined in a separate letter of agreement between the parties. A workday shall commence at 12:01 a.m. and end at midnight. Any shift that begins before 12:00 midnight and ends after midnight shall be deemed to fall in the workday in which such shift begins. Shifts exceeding five (5) consecutive hours in duration shall include thirty (30) uninterrupted minutes off for a meal without pay.
C.	Workweek Defined. The workweek shall begin at 12:01 a.m. on Sunday and end at 12:00 midnight the following Saturday. The Employer has the right to change the workweek and shall give the Union thirty (30) days’ notice. A regular workweek shall not exceed forty (40) hours.

E.	Posting of Work Schedules. Work schedules on a department basis will be posted two (2) consecutive weeks in advance; such schedules shall not preclude emergency changes in hours of work. If the schedule is not posted according to the requirements of this Section, each employee scheduled to work on the first day of the new schedule shall be paid one and one-half (1-1/2) times their regular straight time rate for all hours worked on the first day of the new schedule, provided the employee’s number of scheduled hours or start time differed from the prior posted work schedule. An emergency shall be defined as an immediate and urgent nature that could not have been reasonably anticipated.
F.	Work Schedules, Licensed Practical Nurses. The Employer will schedule licensed practical nurses on a basis of a normal workweek of forty (40) hours, the eight (8)-hour workdays to fall in rotation so that each employee has five (5) or six (6) consecutive workdays, and days of rest need not fall within the same weeks as defined in Section 4.1(C), Workweek Defined.

H.	Workload Distribution. The Employer will maintain adequate staffing in each area as well as an adequate number of Call-Ins to support efficient operations. When an employee is absent for any reason and if a replacement cannot be obtained in time, it is the intention of the
-15-
Employer to distribute the workload equitably among the employees in the work unit so that no undue hardship may be placed on an individual worker. It is further the intent of the Employer, subject to the dispute section of the Agreement, to distribute the workloads equitably among employees in both single work units and departments. Grievances over distribution of workload shall take precedence over all other grievances except discharges, so as to be settled expeditiously.
I.	Make-up Time. An employee who is absent for any reason in any workweek may request work on her regularly scheduled day off within the workweek at her regular straight-time rate of pay. Where a request is made in a department/location that would normally not be in operations on the employee's day off, such employee may request to extend her working hours on her regularly scheduled day of work, provided she waives any and all daily overtime and/or premium provisions. The decision to grant such a request shall be at the discretion of the Employer. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be applicable in cases where an employee receives holiday pay (except in the case where employees are either on Ten (10)-Hour and/or Twelve (12)-Hour Shifts as outlined in Addendums II and III) or sick leave pay for such absences.
J.	Third Shift Premium. It is not the intent of the Employer to schedule regular employees to work three (3) different shifts within a workweek (day, evening, and night shifts) on a regular basis. In the event this becomes necessary, all hours worked by regular employees on the third (3rd) shift of that workweek shall be paid at one arid one-naif (1 /i) times the regular straight time rate of pay. This provision is not applicable to regular employees who may end up working three (3) shifts due to their working “double shifts” during the workweek, or as a result of switching shifts with a co-worker, or as a result of a work schedule requested by an employee.

Upon completion of the probationary period, the employee shall acquire seniority retroactive to the last date of hire.
B.	Trial Period. All employees who are promoted or transferred to a different job classification either within or outside the bargaining unit or to a different department shall serve a trial period from the date of promotion or transfer for a period equivalent to three (3) months (five hundred twenty [520] hours). If during such trial period the employee's work is not satisfactory or the employee chooses to return to her former job, she shall be returned to her former job and rate of pay without loss of and with accrual of bargaining unit seniority. When an employee enters a job classification where automatic progression is required as part of the classification requirements, the right to return to the former classification as outlined above shall apply only when the employee originally enters the classification.
C.	Extension of Probationary and Trial Periods. One extension of the probationary period and/or the trial period shall be allowed provided that the Employer notifies the Union and supplies justification for said extension. The extension shall not exceed three (3) months (five
-16-
hundred twenty [520] hours) and may be for a lesser, specified period. The employee shall be notified of the extension, its length, and the reasons therefore, and the notice shall be discussed with the employee. Until the employee successfully passes the extended probationary or trial period, she shall continue to be paid at the start rate of pay. If the employee successfully completes the extended probationary period or trial period, she shall be paid the appropriate rate of pay retroactive to the expiration date of the original probationary period.
D.	Promotion Or Transfer Within Probationary Period. If an employee is promoted or transferred to a different job classification or to a different department within the employee’s original or extended probationary period, the employee shall begin a new probationary period from the date of promotion or transfer for a period equivalent to three (3) months (five hundred twenty [520] hours).

-17-
4.4	Seniority in Scheduling
A.	While it is agreed that the Employer establishes employees' work schedules, subject to operational needs of the Employer, if an option of shifts and/or days off becomes open within a department, the senior qualified employee will be given preference as long as it does not impair the operation of the Employer's business.
B.	Temporary Work Opportunity. When additional work opportunity becomes available on a temporary basis, the Employer will offer work to regular qualified employees on the basis of bargaining unit seniority within the classification, department and location whose availability meets the needs of the operation. The Employer will then offer work to qualified non-regular employees on the basis of bargaining unit seniority within the classification, department and location whose availability meets the needs of the operation. Additional work opportunity will first be offered to those employees within the department or location who would not incur overtime or premium pay, if any. When additional work opportunity becomes available on an ongoing basis, it will be offered in 4.6, Promotions and Transfers.
C.	Assignment of Call-In Hours. When scheduling call-in hours, the Employer will offer work on the basis of bargaining unit seniority to qualified call-in employees within the department and location whose availability meets the needs of the operation.

1.	Seniority During Temporary Layoff. In cases of temporary layoff and recall from layoff, qualifications to satisfactorily perform the remaining work shall be considered. If qualifications to perform the work are satisfactory, the following order of seniority shall govern:
a.	All non-regular employees by reverse order of bargaining unit seniority.
b.	All regular employees by reverse order of bargaining unit seniority.
2.	No Displacement. An employee who is displaced from her position due to a temporary layoff shall not have the right to displace other employees.
3.	Recall. In making recalls from layoff, employees shall be recalled in reverse order of layoff, i.e., the last laid off shall be the first one recalled, provided that recalled employees are qualified for the position and can satisfactorily perform the work required. In recalling the laid-off employee, the Employer shall notify her by the most expeditious method. The Employer shall also provide the Union with a list of affected employees. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to keep the Employer informed in writing of her current address and telephone number. Employees who fail to return to work within forty-eight (48) hours of the date and'time of their receipt of such notification or within forty-eight (48) hours of the date and time of receipt by the Union of the list of affected employees shall be considered terminated unless such failure is determined by the Employer to be a valid reason. In such cases, the employee shall advise the Employer at the time she receives notification of the reason she is unable to return to work within the forty-eight (48) hours, and an availability date for her return shall be established.
-18-
B.	Non-Temporarv Layoff.

Within the classification, seniority shall be determined by bargaining unit seniority. Should all positions within the classification at a location be exhausted, the employee shall have the right to displace the least senior employee of equal or lower status in her classification on the island where the non-temporary layoff is occurring.
(b)	Should the employee desire to remain at the location where she is presently stationed but where all positions in her classification are being exhausted due to a non-temporary layoff, she shall have the right to displace the least senior employee of equal or lower status in any equal or lower classification for which she is qualified at that location.
(c)	Should all positions within a classification on an island be exhausted, the employee shall have the right to displace the least senior employee of equal or lower status in any equal or lower classification for which she is qualified on the island where the non-temporary layoff is occurring. An employee who transfers to a lower classification as the result of a non-temporary layoff shall receive the job rate of that classification or, if she has not reached job rate, the appropriate rate for that classification.
(d)	Any employee who moves into another position in the same classification or a different classification as the result of a non-temporary layoff shall serve a trial period from the date of transfer for a period equivalent to three (3) months (five hundred twenty (520) hours).

In recalling the laid-off employee, the Employer shall notify her by certified letter to the address last given to the Employer by the employee. The Employer shall also provide the Union with a list of affected employees. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to keep the Employer informed in writing of her current address. Employees who fail to return to work within one (1) calendar week of receipt of a recall letter shall be considered terminated unless such failure is determined by the Employer to be a valid reason.

ADDENDUM I
PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE
The parties agree on the following definition of Progressive Discipline.
For most offenses, management is expected to use a system of progressive discipline under which the employee is warned or given disciplinary suspensions before being hit with the ultimate penalty of discharge. A common pattern is oral warning, written warning, disciplinary layoff and discharge.
But management is not bound by a progressive-discipline formula in cases of serious offenses. Some offenses, such as stealing, loan-sharking, or drunkenness on the job are regarded as so serious that no specific warning or prior disciplinary action need precede discharge. Employees are presumed to know that such serious offenses will lead to discharge. As one arbiter explained:
"The policy of progressive discipline does not mean that for any given employee each penalty must necessarily be more severe than the immediate preceding one, regardless of the offense involved.... What progressive discipline does mean is that progressively more severe penalties may be imposed on each given employee each time any given offense is repeated.
Progressive discipline also means that after a specified number of offenses, regardless of whether the offenses are identical or not, the company may have the right to discharge the given employees.
Both of these...interpretations of progressive discipline avoid the inequitable meting out of discipline, and at the same time serve the dual purpose of progressive discipline, namely, the discouragement of repeated offenses by employees and the protection of the rights of the company to sever completely its relationship with any employee who by his total behavior shows himself to be irresponsible."

UNITE HERE LOCAL 5, AFL-CIO
-68-
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Pursuant to prior discussions and in conjunction with the applicable provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between representatives of KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITALS, KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN, INC. (hereinafter the "Employer") and UNITE HERE LOCAL 5, AFL-CIO (hereinafter the "Union"), effective September 7,1994. the following is understood and agreed to:
1.	It is agreed to and understood that the current programs of Reengineering and Total Quality Management (TQM) (aka Continuous Quality Improvement [CQI] and Quality Planning) are critical for the Employer to remain viable, competitive and able to offer continuing employment opportunities for its employees.
2.	Both Employer and Union recognize the value and contributions of employees to the process and agree that participation of the Local 5 membership is critical to the success of the organization and therefore agree to encourage active participation in the quality initiative teams.
3.	It is further agreed that the role of participating employees is to: a) provide "hands-on" experience, knowledge, and expertise in their area of functionality, b) assist in data collection, and c) work collaboratively with other team members in problem solving.
4.	The reengineering and/or quality improvement teams will focus on improving systems and processes which may enhance clinical practice, patient care outcomes, quality assurance, administrative process, etc. These teams may be unit-based, cross-functional and/or multidisciplinary in composition.
5.	It is understood that this process will likely take three (3) to five (5) years and during this period of time all provisions of the Agreement shall be applicable with the following exceptions:
1. Menu of Options for Displaced Employees (MODE). Any regular or part-time employee whose position is eliminated (exceptions being: discharge for cause, voluntary resignation or resignation as the result of a settlement agreement) is entitled to exercise one of the following options, exclusively. Once an option is selected, unless otherwise noted within this document an employee may not change his/her mind and request another option. An employee who is on a leave whose position is eliminated shall be given the MODE at the end of the leave or within ninety (90) days, whichever occurs first.
Option A. To displace the least senior employee in accordance with Section 4.5 Layoff of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
An eligible employee who chooses this option will be afforded all rights and privileges as indicated in Section 4.5 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Should the employee subsequently fail the trial period of the new position, the employee will be placed on a call-in list for 180 calendar days to maintain seniority (their last position) for bidding purposes only. Should they be unsuccessful in bidding for another position, they will be terminated.
-69-
Letter of Understanding
Page 2
Option B. Voluntarily resign and receive severance pay.
An employee who chooses this option receives severance pay and medical benefits based on the years of service with the Employer (see attached Addendum A). Employees eligible for early retirement may also choose from a variety of pension payment methods. An employee who chooses the severance pay option and is rehired by Kaiser within the severance period will be required to refund a prorated amount. Any bi-weekly payments being received by the employee will cease on the effective date of rehire.
Option C. Participate in a Skills Enhancement Program (SEP).
An employee who chooses this option (hereinafter "participant") will be placed on administrative leave for a duration not to exceed the schedule outlined in Addendum A. The leave's intent is to act as a wage replacement vehicle for the participant, during which time the participant will attempt to enhance appropriate skills to increase the likelihood of successfully bidding for a position within Kaiser Permanente within the duration of the SEP leave. Participants may bid for positions within the organization at any time during the SEP leave.
While participating in this program, participants will continue to receive their normal wages (based on their normally scheduled hours as indicated on the most recent PAN form) as though they were still "at work" and shall continue to receive their customary benefit package. The participant's PAN form will reflect a Day Shift position and wages shall be frozen at the predisplacement rate and shall not be subject to regularly scheduled general wage increases or adjustments normally received on or about July 1 of each year. The duration of the leave will be determined by the attached schedule outlined in Addendum A.
The SEP leave terminates when one of the following happens:
1.	Employee successfully bids for another position within Kaiser. Once another position has been obtained (including Temporary positions), the participant is no longer considered a displaced employee and participation in SEP ceases. Any subsequent failure of the employee in the trial period of the new position will result in termination.
2.	Participant resigns from Kaiser. The employee will receive a prorated severance based on the remaining time of SEP leave and will receive medical insurance to the end of the original SEP leave date.
3.	SEP leave expires and the participant has not successfully bid for another position. The participant will be terminated. Participants who have bid during the SEP leave but have not heard as to the disposition of their bid at the end of their SEP eligibility shall be placed on a call-in list until such time as a determination is made. If successful, there shall be no break in their seniority; if unsuccessful they shall be removed from the call-in status. Accrued vacation used at the end of the SEP leave will extend the leave an equivalent amount, however, vacation taken during the course of the SEP leave shall not extend the leave. With the exception of Personal, Educational, Union and Travel leaves, participants who take leave shall have their SEP leave extended by an equivalent number of days, but in no case shall the extension exceed ninety (90) days.

SEP consists of two main components:
1.	Skill Enhancement. Displaced employees will be assigned to a Case Manager. The Case Manager, in conjunction with the participant, will assess the participant's existing skills and will attempt to identify and provide skill enhancement opportunities. The Case Manager shall have sole authority to determine the appropriateness, scope and nature of the skill enhancement activities, which must be related to Employer functions. Should courses be offered, the Employer shall provide such at no cost to the participant.
2.	Regional Float Pool. When the participants are not engaged in skill enhancement activities, they shall be assigned to the "Regional Float Pool" and report to the "Float Pool Coordinator" for daily work assignments. This program is intended to be a wage replacement, versus wage supplement program. The intent is to provide work opportunity equivalent to the participant's pre-displaced "regular" work hours excluding any premium or overtime hours (i.e., if a participant was a regular full-time (40 hours per week) employee, and his/her retraining schedule is twenty (20) hours per week, the participant shall be assigned to twenty (20) hours in the "Regional Float Pool" for that workweek). Participants will be assigned to various jobs as determined by the Float Pool Coordinator. It is not the intent that participants in the Float Pool preclude any regular or part-time non-displaced employee of work opportunity. The participant shall continue to report to the "Float Pool Coordinator" until such time as the skills enhancement/training program ends or until the participant is assigned to a regular work unit. While in this program, the participant will observe all holidays based on a Monday to Friday day shift worker and shall continue to receive insured benefits.
2.	Chillinq/Filling Chilled Positions. It is understood that during this period, the Employer may freeze or not fill positions solely for the purpose of enhancing work and job opportunities for displaced participants and to minimize operational disruptions. Based upon operational needs, the Employer shall determine what positions should and should not be chilled. (See Addendum B.)
A.	Filling Vacant Chilled Position. The current Collective Bargaining Agreement provisions for filling vacancies shall be applicable with the exception that a separate chilled vacancy list will be created listing all vacant chilled positions. These positions shall not be available to nondisplaced employees except that, on a temporary basis, a chilled position may be offered to and/or occupied by a non-displaced employee when there is no qualified displaced applicant.
1.	Posting Within a Department. In the event that a position identified as a chilled position becomes available within a department, that position shall be first posted within the department, giving advancement opportunities to regular or part-time employees. If the position is not filled, it shall be posted as a chilled position vacancy. If the position is filled, the subsequent vacancy may be posted as a chilled position vacancy.
B.	Eligible Employees. Any regular full-time, regular part-time, or part-time employee who becomes a displaced employee and chooses to enroll in SEP is eligible to participate. This specifically excludes call-in employees. A non-bargaining unit employee may bid but the employer's current practice of placing them at the bottom of the bid list will continue.

3.	Committee Members of Reengineering Teams. It is understood that the committee members, and more specifically shop stewards, will not participate in any decision making relating to wages, hours, conditions of employment and displacement of employees belonging to the bargaining unit.
4.	Meetings. Prior to implementation of any reengineering, change team or management initiative that adversely affects the bargaining unit, the Employer will notify the Union of such changes so that the parties can meet and discuss the impact of such changes on bargaining unit members.
5.	Modification/Discontinuance of Program. The Employer reserves the right to amend or discontinue (totally or in part) this program with thirty (30) days notice.

ADDENDUM B
KAISER PERMANENTE - HAWAII
CHILLED POSITIONS PROCESS
In an effort to provide enhanced bidding opportunity to employees who are displaced from their current positions as a result of management change initiatives in the Region, Kaiser Permanente - Hawaii has established a "Chilled Positions Process." Supervisory personnel are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the following process.
Chilled positions can take one of two forms:
1.	"Chilled/No Post": A position is chilled and not posted, but made available for bidding only by displaced employees enrolled in the Skill Enhancement Program (SEP).
OR
2.	"Chilled/Post Temporary": A position is chilled and posted region-wide to be filled on a temporary basis* until a displaced employee in the SEP bids and is selected for the position. Hiring supervisors should advise candidates for a "Chilled/Post Temp" position that employees selected for these positions will be returned to their previous positions if/when a displaced employee is selected.
’Temporary assignment duration will be in accordance with existing collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). For NUNE positions, the Local 5 CBA terms apply.
Effective immediately, when an employee under your supervision vacates a position, the following procedure applies:
1.	Determine which posting option you wish to pursue and note it in the upper center portion of the Personnel Requisition (PR) form (see attached samples). You have three posting options:
Option	Terminology To Use On PR
a.	Chill & not post	"Chill/No Post"
b.	Chill & post as a temporary position	"Chill/Post Temp"
c.	Not to Chill & do a regular posting	"No Chill/Post"
NOTE: When Human Resources receives a PR that does not have a "Chill" designation at the top, it will be assumed to be a "Chilled/No Post." That is, if you want a position to be posted, you must indicate "Chill/Post Temp" or "No Chill/Post" at the top. In addition, for "No Chill/Post" you must have your senior manager's signature on the PR.
2.	If you choose either option A or B (to chill a position), you should first post within your department in order to give your current regular full-time, regular part-time, and part-time employees (not call-ins) the opportunity to bid for the vacancy (it may be a preferred position within the department). If the position is thereby filled by one of your existing employees, the position vacated by that employee would then become the chilled position. Please contact the Human Resources Employment section for assistance with this. No senior manager's signature is required on PRs for these intradepartmental postings.
-74-
Addendum B
Page 2
In making a decision regarding which option to use, please keep the following in mind:
a.	Top and senior management have made a very firm commitment to the chilled position process as a means of avoiding layoffs and providing work opportunity to the greatest extent possible for displaced employees.
b.	In order for the chilled positions program to work, your active participation is essential. If, however, you have chilled a position and later find that for operational reasons you can no longer maintain it in a chilled status, you may (re)post the position via the regular channels. To do this, simply write "Please Unchill" beside the Personnel Requisition number at the top of the white copy of the PR that was previously returned to you by HR, have your senior manager sign it, and send it back to the HR Employment Section.
c.	In addition to the above formal options, please keep in mind that you may utilize a call-in employee to fill a vacant position until a qualified displaced employee bids and is selected rather than using the "Chill/Post Temp" option.
d.	Shortage area positions should continue to be filled using the regular posting procedure i.e., "No Chill/Post."

Dear Mr. Gill:
Subject: Medical Coverage for Local 5 Regular Retirees
In conjunction with the collective bargaining agreement being executed simultaneously with this letter, it is expressly agreed and understood that the scope of coverage, type of coverage, and all other details of the medical coverage for Local 5 regular retirees will be determined by the Employer. The Employer shall have the authority to unilaterally amend, modify, or eliminate such medical coverage, and the Union waives any right to bargain over such coverage, any changes the Employer may institute, or the effects of such changes, and the provisions of Section 5.4, No Reduction of Benefits, shall not apply.
The Employer agrees to contribute sixty dollars ($60.00) per month toward the cost of medical coverage in retirement for employees who retire as normai retirees under the provisions of a Kaiser-Permanente Employees Pension Plan with twenty (20) or more years of service under the terms of the Plan.
Benefits will commence upon retirement and will consist of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan A or similar coverage without vision care or other supplemental benefits. Benefits will be provided for the retiree only and will continue for the life of the retiree.
The retiree will be required to maintain participation in Parts A and B of Medicare at her own expense and to assign Part B to Kaiser to remain eligible for any Employer-provided benefit.
Effective July 1, 2005, the above described benefit will no longer be available to new retirees. It will continue to be offered to then-current retirees who have elected such coverage.
Very truly yours,
Understood and Agreed:

Dear Mr. Gill:
Letter of Understanding
Re: Computation of Employer's Contribution
In conjunction with the collective bargaining agreement being executed simultaneously with this letter, the following is agreed to and understood.
The Employer's contribution will be computed as described in the following examples:
The Employer will contribute 50% on up to 2% of your gross earnings toward your TSA account. For example, if your gross income is $1,000 per pay period and you elect to contribute 2% or more to your TSA, your employer will contribute $10 per pay period to your TSA account. Effective July 3, 2005, the Employer will contribute 50% on up to 3% of your gross earnings toward your TSA account.
Example:
Employee Gross Compensation	$1,000 (per pay period)
x .05 (5% contribution)
Employee TSA Contribution	$50.00 (per pay period)
Employer's match is 50% on up to 2% of gross pay: $1,000 x .50 x .02 = $10
Annual projected contributions (26 pay periods per year):
Employee TSA Contribution:	$50 x 26 pay periods = $1,300
Employer Matching Contribution:	$10 x 26 pay periods = $ 260
Annual Total TSA Contribution = $1,560
If you elect to contribute less than 2% (3% effective July 3, 2005) of your gross earnings to your TSA account, the employer will match 50% of that percentage For example, if your gross income is $1,000 per pay period and you elect to contribute 1% to your TSA, your employer will contribute $5 per pay period to your TSA account.
Employee Gross Compensation	$1,000 (per pay period)
x .01 (1% contribution)
Employee TSA Contribution	$10.00 (per pay period)
Employer's match is 50% on up to 1% of gross pay: $1,000 x .50 x .01 = $5
Annual projected contributions (26 pay periods per year):
Employee TSA Contribution:	$10 x 26 pay periods = $ 260
Employer Matching Contribution:	$ 5 x 26 pay periods = $ 130
Annual Total TSA Contribution = $ 390
In summary: If you contribute an amount equal to or greater than 2% (3% effective July 3, 2005) of your gross compensation, your employer will contribute 50% of 2% (3% effective July 3, 2005) of your gross earnings to your TSA account. If you contribute an amount less than 2% (3% effective July 3, 2005) of your gross earnings, the employer will contribute 50% of that amount.

RE: Regular Part-Time (Quarterly) Employees
Dear Mr. Gill:
In conjunction with the collective bargaining agreement being executed simultaneously with this letter, the following is understood and agreed.
Regular Part-Time (Quarterly) Employees
Regular part-time (quarterly) employees shall, upon completion of a payroll quarter in which they are paid at least two hundred sixty (260) hours, be eligible for all benefits enjoyed by regular part-time employees for the following quarter. Employees must continue to be paid for at least two hundred sixty (260) hours in each succeeding payroll quarter in order to maintain regular part-time (quarterly) status.
In the event a regular part-time (quarterly) employee transfers into a temporary position, the employee will continue to receive prorated benefits as long as the employee is paid for at least two hundred sixty (260) hours in a payroll quarter.
The term “paid” for the purposes of Section 2.4.C shall mean payment actually received during a payroll quarter for hours worked, sick leave, vacation, holidays, jury duty, funeral leave and paid educational leave but shall not include payment under TDI or workers' compensation.
Regular Part-Time Employees (Quarterly)—Benefits
As defined in Section 2.4.C, regular part-time employees (quarterly) shall receive all insured benefits as outlined in Section 6 on the first day of the month following one month of continuous employment as a regular part-time (quarterly) employee.
Regular part-time (quarterly) employees shall, upon completion of a payroll quarter in which they earn at least two hundred sixty (260) hours, have their prorated benefit formula computed and shall earn paid time off benefits based on that formula during the next payroll quarter.
-79-
Letter of Understanding Page 2
Change in Status
Failure to be paid for two hundred sixty (260) hours will result in a change in employment status to Call-In or Casual. Such change will be effective on the first day of the payroll quarter after the quarter in which the employee was not paid for two hundred sixty (260) hours. Benefits under Section 6 will cease upon the first (1st) day of the month following one month as a Call-In or Casual employee in the new payroll quarter and accrued vacation hours, if any, will be paid out.
