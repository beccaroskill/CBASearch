PREAMBLE
Whereas, the Executive Branch of the State of Maine (hereinafter referred to as "State" or "employer") and the Maine State Employees Association, Service Employees International Union, Local 1989 (hereinafter referred to as "MSEA-SEIU") desire to establish a constructive, cooperative and harmonious relationship; to avoid any interruption or interference with the operations of the employer; to promote effective service and quality of work life towards the accomplishment of the missions of the State; and to establish an equitable and peaceful procedure for the resolution of differences;
Therefore, this Agreement by and between the parties is entered into as of July 1, 2005.
1
ARTICLE 1.	UNION RECOGNITION
Pursuant to the Maine Labor Relations Board certification dated May 3, 1977, the State recognizes the Maine State Employees Association (MSEA-SEIU) as the sole and exclusive representative for the purpose of representation and negotiations with respect to wages, hours of work and other conditions of employment for all employees included in the Administrative Services Bargaining Unit.
In the event of a dispute between the parties as to future inclusions or exclusions from the unit resulting from the establishment of new or changed classifications or titles, either party to this Agreement may apply to the Maine Labor Relations Board for resolution of the dispute.
Employees who are employed on a seasonal basis, i.e., for regularly recurring seasonal periods of three (3) months or more, shall be covered by the provisions of this Agreement upon the completion of six (6) months employment, subject to any special provisions relating to their employment. In order to qualify, such six (6) months must be worked in not more than three (3) consecutive years and only time in pay status during such seasons shall count. Employment time of persons outside State service who are on acting capacity assignment to a seasonal position, and employment time of persons holding a seasonal intermittent position shall not count towards the completion of such six (6) months.
Part-time employees will be covered by the provisions of this Agreement after completion of six (6) months of service except for the provision for dismissal for just cause. The just cause provision for dismissal shall apply after completion of one thousand forty (1,040) compensated hours exclusive of overtime hours. All benefits provided to part-time employees shall be prorated to the extent required by State law.
Temporary, seasonal and on-call employees, excluded by law from the bargaining unit, include project employees, seasonal employees not covered by the preceding paragraphs, persons from outside State service who are on acting capacity assignment, and intermittent employees. Project employees are employees appointed to a project position which is restricted to a planned work program to be completed within a specified period of time and which is not regularly recurring. Intermittent employees are employees who are appointed for a period of time on a sporadic basis and who work not more than one thousand forty (1,040) hours in any consecutive twelve (12) month period beginning with the date of hire or anniversary of date of hire.
Any employee designated as intermittent, who works in excess of the limits set out above and who works more than one thousand forty (1,040) regularly scheduled hours during the period since appointment as an intermittent employee without a break in service due to resignation or dismissal shall be covered by the terms of this Agreement. The sporadic periods such an employee is not in pay status because of the sporadic nature of the position shall not be 2
considered to be a break in service. Where a legislative position count permits, such employee shall be placed in a permanent or limited period full-time or parttime position as appropriate, provided that he or she is eligible for appointment. If necessary, the employee may reopen the appropriate register to establish eligibility.
Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted as removing any rights or benefits of temporary, intermittent, project or seasonal employees provided under Title 5, M.R.S.A., §§ 553-A and 559, Public Law 667, 1978, or any other provision of law or rule.
ARTICLE 2.	ACCESS TO EMPLOYEES
MSEA-SEIU shall have access to employees covered by this Agreement to carry out its legal responsibilities as a bargaining agent as provided for in this Article.
MSEA-SEIU's representatives will be granted reasonable access to employees during employees' working hours for the purpose of investigating and processing grievances and for the purposes of administering this Agreement. Such access will be subject to the representative providing the appropriate State representative with advanced notice of the visit. Such access will not disrupt State operations or violate agency security procedures. If access needs to be temporarily delayed for special reasons, those reasons shall be explained to the MSEA-SEIU representative.
Any MSEA-SEIU representative may have access to employees in this unit for the purpose of explaining MSEA-SEIU programs and benefits during employees' non-working time, e.g., breaks, lunch periods and after hours, provided such access does not interfere with State operations. Such access shall be to non-work areas.
ARTICLE 3.	ACTING CAPACITY
1.	Temporary Assignments
When an employee is assigned temporarily by his/her appointing authority to a job for which he/she is qualified in a higher pay grade for a period of five (5) days or his/her regular workweek, whichever is less, the employee shall be paid retroactively from the initial date of the temporary transfer for the duration of the temporary assignment. The employee shall be paid as if he/she had been promoted during such assignment. In no event may an employee acquire any status in a higher classification as a result of his/her temporary assignment. Acting capacity assignments shall not be made on an arbitrary or capricious
3
basis. Employees shall not be rotated in acting capacity in an arbitrary or capricious manner in order to avoid payment of acting capacity pay.
This Article shall not be used in lieu of the proper processing of any request for reclassification or reallocation of a position pursuant to the Personnel Rules and the Reclassifications Article, or the filling of a vacancy pursuant to the Personnel Rules and the Seniority Article.
2.	Seasonal Employees - Off Season Assignments
A seasonal employee who accepts a temporary or acting capacity assignment during his or her off season shall be eligible to accrue vacation, sick leave, and holiday benefits upon appointment to the temporary or acting capacity assignment. Vacation, sick leave, or holiday benefits accrued in an employee’s regular seasonal position shall not overlap into benefits accrued in the temporary or acting capacity assignment for the same period of time. Full-time seasonal employees shall accrue no more than eight (8) hours of sick leave in any one month, pro-rated for part-time employees.
ARTICLE 4.	APPROVAL OF LEGISLATURE
The parties hereto agree to jointly support any legislative action necessary for implementation of any provision of this Agreement. If the Legislature rejects any provision submitted to it, the entire Agreement shall be returned to the parties for further bargaining.
ARTICLE 5.	BEREAVEMENT LEAVE
Each employee covered by this Agreement shall be allowed up to five (5) days leave with pay, for absences resulting from the death of a spouse or significant other, or the death of a child, stepchild, parent or stepparent of either the employee or the employee’s spouse or significant other and up to three (3) days of leave with full pay for absences resulting from the death of other members of the employee's immediate family, as defined below.
"Other members of the immediate family" shall mean the guardian, brothers, stepbrothers, sisters, stepsisters, wards, grandparents and grandchildren of the employee.
“Significant other” means that a relationship exists between two people, neither of whom is married, that is intended to remain indefinitely and where there is joint responsibility for each other’s common welfare, there are significant shared financial obligations, and there is a shared primary residence. This relationship must have existed for at least six (6) continuous months before benefits under this Article may be provided.
4
ARTICLE 6.	BULLETIN BOARDS
The State shall continue to provide present bulletin board space for the use of MSEA-SEIU at each work location where bulletin boards are presently provided for the purpose of posting bulletins, notices and other materials in conformance with this Article. The posting of any MSEA-SEIU materials shall be restricted to such bulletin board space only except that, in each work location where bulletin board space is not provided for MSEA-SEIU, the State shall designate an appropriate alternative space where such materials may be posted.
In no instance may MSEA-SEIU post any material which is profane, obscene or defamatory to the State, its representatives or any individual, or which constitutes campaign material between competing employee organizations if it is determined that the posting of such material would violate any obligation of the State for neutrality. MSEA-SEIU is solely responsible for the accuracy and ethical standards of any material posted pursuant to this Article. The State retains the right to remove any materials in violation of this Article.
All posted MSEA-SEIU materials shall be signed by an authorized representative of the Association or stamped with an official MSEA-SEIU logo.

Eligible employees may apply for this payment between March 1 and April 15 of each year. Payment shall be made within thirty (30) days of receipt of the completed application. Any application received after April 15 will be considered on a case by case basis and shall not be arbitrarily rejected.

Childbirth or adoption leave shall be granted to an employee without salary for a period not to exceed one (1) year inclusive of any period of disability covered under the Sick Leave Article. Employees shall have the option of using accumulated compensating time and annual leave during such period. Employees shall be allowed to retain insurance benefits during such leave. Except during any period covered by the use of compensating time or annual leave, retention of insurance benefits shall be at the employee's expense.
ARTICLE 9.	COMPENSATING TIME
Compensating time earned by an employee may be accumulated up to two hundred forty (240) hours. Except where operational needs require otherwise, employees shall be entitled to use compensating time at times of their choice.

When an employee's anniversary date falls on any day from the first day of a pay week through Wednesday of the pay week, the employee's merit increase shall be effective as of the first day of the pay week within which the anniversaiy date falls. Otherwise, the merit increase shall be effective on the first day of the next pay week.
Grievances arising from the denial of merit increases shall not be arbitrable under this Agreement but shall be processed pursuant to the Agency Merit Increase Appeal Procedures developed under the 1978-1980 Agreement between the parties. In agencies where such appeal procedures do not fit, the parties shall establish additional procedures in the manner established by the predecessor Agreement. A decision of an Agency Appeals Board shall be final and binding, subject to appeal to the Director of Human Resources on the following grounds only: that the decision of the Agency Appeals Board was based upon clearly erroneous findings of fact, or that the decision of the Agency Appeals Board was based upon erroneous application of performance standards.

(c)	Employees' workweeks are irregular and work hours cannot be scheduled or determined except by the employee.
2.	Employees in a classification which is designated as non-standard shall be compensated at a rate of sixteen percent (16%) above the basic rates in their salaiy grades, except that any position that is found by the Bureau of Human Resources not to be exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act for overtime compensation purposes shall not be designated non-standard.
3.	The following classes are designated as meeting the above criteria:
D.	Call Out
Any employee who is eligible for overtime who is called out for work outside of and not continuous with his/her regular hours will be paid a minimum of four (4) hours of the employee's regular rate of pay or hours 7
actually worked at the appropriate rate, whichever is greater. This section shall not apply to an employee who is called in four (4) hours or less prior to the start of his/her workday or shift and who continues to work that day or shift or to an employee held over at the end of their regular workday.
Notwithstanding this provision, employees in agencies which have been compensated for call out on a higher basis as of January 1, 1997 shall continue to be compensated on the higher basis.
E.	Overtime
1.	Excepting employees designated as non-standard and Ferry Service employees compensated for overtime on a sliding scale basis, full-time employees in pay ranges 01 through 21 shall be paid one and one-half (1 Vz] times the hourly rate of pay after actually working eight (8) hours in any day, or after their regular scheduled hours if greater, or forty (40) hours of actual work in any workweek.
The above provisions shall apply to full-time employees working alternative compressed workweeks but shall not include other alternative work schedules such as flextime schedules, etc., or part-time employees who shall be eligible for overtime after forty (40) hours of actual work in any week. In lieu of premium pay employees may, upon mutual agreement, take compensating time at the rate of one and one-half (P/2) hours of compensating time for each hour of overtime worked.
2.	Employees in pay ranges 21 and above who, on September 3, 1984 were receiving some form of overtime compensation, shall continue to do so until they vacate their present positions. Notwithstanding, the foregoing, the State's policy with respect to special exceptions which have been made or which are made in the future under that policy, will continue.
3.	Employees in pay ranges 22 and above who do not receive any form of overtime compensation shall receive two (2) personal leave days per year with pay, as of January 1 of each year. Employees who first become eligible for personal leave days under this Article on or after July 1 of a calendar year shall receive only one (1) day for the year, instead of two (2). Except where operational needs require otherwise, these employees shall be entitled to take these personal leave days at times of their choice. These personal leave days shall not be carried forward or accrued from year to year unless the employee is denied his/her personal leave day because of operational needs.
4.	Time during which an employee is excused from work with pay under the Holidays Article, shall be considered as time worked for the purpose of computing overtime.
5.	There shall be no pyramiding or duplication of compensation by reason of overtime or holiday or other premium pay provision of this Agreement. It is understood, however, that with this limitation, the method of payment which gives the greatest amount will be followed.
8

ARTICLE 56.	SENIORITY
A.	Definition and General
1.	Seniority for the purposes described herein is defined as continuous employment, since the last date of hire into a status-granting position. Employees shall attain seniority upon completion of their initial probationary period retroactive to the date of initial hire.
2.	Seniority shall be broken only as provided in paragraph 4 of this Section. An employee shall continue to accrue seniority during any period while he/she is on layoff and subject to the recall provisions of this Article, during military leave, leaves occasioned by incapacity for work and during any period of an authorized leave of absence except those pursuant to the Unpaid Personal Leaves of Absence Article and voluntary cost savings.
3.	Lists of employees by seniority in their current classifications within an organizational unit shall be posted on the appropriate State bulletin boards as soon as practicable after execution of this Agreement and shall be provided to MSEA-SEIU simultaneously. These lists shall be updated from time to time as necessary.
4.	An employee shall lose his/her seniority if he/she:
(a)	voluntarily resigns;
(b)	is discharged for just cause;
(c)	is laid off and not recalled for work within three (3) years from the date of layoff;
(d)	fails to return to work or supply a satisfactory reason for not reporting within five (5) workdays of being recalled to work from layoff. Written notice of recall shall be sent by regular mail to the employee's last known address.
5.	Layoffs and recalls to work for a period of three (3) working days or less are temporary and not subject to the provisions of this Article.
B.	Layoffs
When an appointing authority determines that a reduction in force is necessary, implementation of that reduction in force will proceed as follows:
44
(1)	The appointing authority determines which positions, in each organizational unit and unit division, are to be abolished or funding eliminated.
(2)	The least senior employee(s) in the affected classification and unit division will be laid off. More senior employees who occupy positions that are abolished or for which funding is eliminated will be reassigned to vacancies created by these layoffs or to other available vacancies in the class and unit division. These employees will be offered their choice of vacancies into which they may be reassigned in order of seniority, provided they are qualified to perform the duties of the position they select.
(3)	If no option exists in (2), in lieu of layoff a displaced employee may accept, in order of seniority, reassignment to an available vacant position in his or her last previously held classification, regardless of changes to range, title, and/or bargaining unit of the classification since the employee left the classification, in the same unit division, provided the employee is qualified to perform the duties of the position.
(4)	If no option exists in (3) above, in lieu of layoff a displaced employee may displace, in order of seniority, the least senior employee in his or her last previously held classification, regardless of changes to range, title, and/or bargaining unit of the classification, since the employee left the classification, in the same unit division, provided he or she has greater seniority than the employee being displaced and is qualified to perform the duties of the position. The employee may also accept reassignment, in order of seniority, to an available vacancy in classifications that are lower related to the employee’s current classification in the same unit division, provided the employee is qualified to perform the duties of the position.
Any employee displaced pursuant to this provision shall have like reassignment and displacement rights.
No classified employee may displace any unclassified employee. No unclassified employee may displace any classified employee except to the classification in the other service that was the last previously held.
The State and MSEA-SEIU shall negotiate to establish appropriate organizational units and unit divisions. Either party may request a review of an organizational unit or unit division on a departmental basis. In the event that the parties are unable to agree to appropriate organizational units and unit divisions either party may submit the dispute at any time thereafter for a binding determination to a qualified arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties or selected through the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the rules and procedures of that Association.
No employee other than a permanent employee, including permanent seasonal employees, shall be used to perform work in a class in the unit division while a permanent employee who is qualified to do the work is on layoff unless the laid off employee refuses the work.
C.	Notice of Layoff/Reassignment/Displacement
45
Employees to be affected by pending layoff, reassignment, or displacement shall be given written notice as soon as practicable but at least five (5) workdays before the effective date of the layoff/reassignment, or displacement. Employees affected by layoff/reassignment/displacement shall be required to reply in writing within three (3) workdays of notice of layoff as to their decisions on layoff and displacement rights. Employees subject to actual layoff and not displacing other employees shall be entitled to notice of at least ten (10) workdays before layoff. Copies of any notices from the State to employees under this provision shall be given simultaneously to MSEA-SEIU.
D.	Recalls
A recall register shall be established for each class by organizational unit or unit division, as appropriate, from which any employee has been laid off, transferred or demoted in lieu of layoff. An employee who is notified of layoff will be placed on the recall register, immediately upon receipt of written notice to the Bureau of Human Resources from the employee in the manner prescribed by the Bureau, for the class from which he or she was laid off and, when applicable, his or her last previously held classification. Any vacancy occurring in that class, or the class last previously held shall be offered first to the employee on the recall register. Recalls to work shall be made as follows:
(1)	To the most senior employee in the unit division who possesses the minimum qualifications to perform the duties of the position;
(2)	To the most senior employee in the organizational unit who possesses the minimum qualifications to perform the duties of the position;
(3)	To the most senior employee statewide who possesses the minimum qualifications to perform the duties of the position.
Employees who refuse recall to the same classification, or to the last previously held classification, for a unit division, organizational unit, or on a statewide basis, from which he or she was laid off or to which they have recall rights shall be removed from the appropriate recall register.
E.	Other Vacancies
An employee laid off or about to be laid off may open any employment register for which he/ she is eligible for the purpose of establishing qualifications for any State position.
The placement on class registers and certification procedures for employees on layoff shall be treated as promotional in all cases, regardless of the pay grade of the class for which the employee is applying.
F.	Filling of Non-Competitive Vacancies
46
In the event of a vacancy in a non-competitive position, positions shall be filled on the basis of: first, ability and qualifications to perform the duties of the higher classification and second, where the "first" is equal among two or more employees, seniority will govern.
All job vacancies shall be posted in the applicable department, agency, organizational unit or unit division for ten (10) workdays. Notice of vacancies shall include the full particulars of the positions, including a job description, job location, pay rate, required qualifications and requirements for applying. Any employee wishing to be considered for an applicable promotion shall file a written, dated application with his/her appointing authority or designee within the posting period. Job posting notices shall indicate the name and title of the person to whom applications should be submitted. Seasonal and part-time employees shall have the right to apply for full-time vacancies and shall be given consideration in accordance with their abilities, qualifications and seniority.
Employees promoted under the provisions of this Agreement will be in a probationary status for a period of six (6) months from the effective date of the promotion. Such probationary period may be extended for just cause for an additional six (6) months. During such period the employee may be removed from the position promoted to for failure to fulfill the duties of the position. In such case he/she shall be returned to his/her former position if the employee so desires. An employee filling positions created by the promotion shall be likewise entitled to return to his/her former position.
G.	Filling of Competitive Vacancies
Current procedures for filling of vacancies in the competitive service shall be continued during the term of this Agreement.
The following principles, however, shall be followed in the filling of competitive vacancies:
(a)	Notice of all vacancies in competitive jobs shall be posted in the applicable department, agency, organizational unit or unit division for at least ten (10) workdays.
(b)	All employees certified to an appointing authority shall be offered the opportunity of an interview.
(c)	Each certified employee shall be notified by the appointing authority of his/her selection or non-selection.
(d)	Length of service representing satisfactory service to the State is important for any position and will be given appropriate consideration by the appointing authority along with the qualifications for the position.
The State certification procedures shall provide for concurrent certification of eligible employees instead of serial certification for the duration of this Agreement. Employees accepting a job offer must do so within five (5) business days from that job offer. An employee shall be entitled to refuse four (4) appointments from a register before being removed from the register.
47
Employees in a department or agency who are in the same classification or on a register for that classification who bid for transfer into a vacancy in the department or agency shall be offered the opportunity to interview for such vacancy.
Upon promotion an employee shall be entitled to return to his/her former position voluntarily within thirty (30) days of promotion; otherwise voluntary demotion rules will apply. An employee at any time during the probationary period or any extension thereof failing to attain permanent status in a promotional position shall be entitled to return to his/her former position. Any employee filling a vacancy created by a promotion shall be likewise entitled to return to his/her former position when a promoted employee returns to his/her former position in accordance with the above provisions.
H.	Promotions, Demotions and Transfers
An employee who promotes to a position in a higher pay grade shall have his/her rate of pay adjusted to the lowest rate in the new grade which is at least five percent (5%) higher than the rate in the class from which promoted. The percentage will be calculated as five percent (5%) of the base rate plus the following pay premiums, when applicable: scheduled overtime (when part of an employee’s negotiated work schedule), medication premium, direct care premium, and the appropriate state-paid retirement differential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Director of the Bureau of Human Resources may consider exceptions pursuant to Civil Service Rules.
An employee who demotes to a lower pay grade shall have his/her rate of pay adjusted to the highest rate in the new pay grade which is lower than the rate of the class from which the employee left, considering the same pay components listed above.
When an employee transfers (remains in the same pay grade) and remains within the same or equivalent salary schedule, his/her rate of pay will remain the same.
When an employee transfers (remains in the same pay grade), but moves from one salary schedule to another dissimilar salary schedule, his/her rate of pay will be adjusted to the closest step in the new salary schedule that does not result in a loss of pay, considering the same pay components listed above.
Determining the appropriate salary step upon promotion, demotion, or transfer may not result in a salary that is greater than the maximum or less than the minimum rates established in the salary schedule for the new classification.
I.	Permanent Seasonal Employees
The provisions of this Article shall apply to seasonal employees covered by this Agreement but in a separate seniority, layoff, reassignment, displacement 48
and recall track, for their respective seasons. Permanent employees laid off from their permanent position shall be entitled to return to previously held permanent seasonal positions. For purposes of this Article, when a seasonal employee moves from the seasonal track to the year-round track, seniority calculations shall be converted to reflect actual time worked in the seasonal position. Seniority credits for the purpose of this conversion shall be calculated in weekly increments. Any time worked within a given week shall be recognized as a full week.
J.	Part-Time Employees
Separate track seniority systems for layoff, reassignment, displacement and recall purposes shall be implemented for full-time and part-time employees. Fulltime employees will only be given options in full-time positions. Part-time employees will only be given options in part-time positions.
Full-time positions shall be defined as any position regularly scheduled for forty (40) or more hours per week.
If an employee is the least senior employee in his or her classification and unit division, he or she shall be given the options prescribed in section B of this Article in the other track, provided the employee has previously held that classification in the other track with the agency.
For purposes of this Article, when a part-time employee moves from the part-time track to the full-time track, seniority calculations shall be converted to reflect actual time worked in the part-time position. Seniority credits for the purpose of this conversion shall be calculated according to the employees scheduled workweek. Any time worked within a given week shall be recognized as a scheduled workweek.
Recall rights shall be limited to the track from which the employee is initially laid off, displaced, reassigned or demoted in lieu of layoff.
K.	Positions Outside Bargaining Unit
An employee in the bargaining unit as of the effective date of this Agreement in a position in a class covered by this Agreement but who becomes excluded pursuant to Section 979-A(6)(C) of the State Employees Labor Relations Act and an employee who by way of a promotion through a normal career ladder is in a classified position excluded from the bargaining unit pursuant to Section 979-A(6)(B) or Section 979-A(6)(D) of the State Employees Labor Relations Act and any other employee promoted through a normal career ladder to a position outside of the bargaining unit shall have the same layoff, seniority, displacement, recall and other rights under this Article for return to a position in the bargaining unit as a covered employee would have if the exercise of those rights is occasioned by a layoff.
49
Employees covered by previous MSEA-SEIU Agreements in any status described above shall continue to have such rights for return to a position in the bargaining unit as described above.
Otherwise, employees excluded from bargaining units pursuant to the State Employees Labor Relations Act shall have no rights under this Article within the bargaining unit.
L.	Laid Off Employees in State Housing
Full-time year-round employees who live in State housing and are laid off shall have at least sixty (60) days to vacate the State housing.
M.	Health Insurance Coverage for Laid off Employees
The State agrees to provide laid off employees with group health insurance at the employee's expense for one (1) year provided that the employee is unemployed. Premiums are to be paid directly to the insurance carrier. Failure to make payments would result in cancellation of insurance with no conversion privileges.
N.	Short-Term Seasonal Positions
Short-term seasonal position vacancies of fifteen (15) weeks or less duration shall not require posting as a method of filling the vacancy.
ARTICLE 57.	SEVERABILITY
In the event that any Article, section or portion of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable by final decision of a tribunal of competent jurisdiction, or shall have the effect of a loss to the State of funds or property or services made available through federal law, then such specific Article, section or portion specified in such decision or which is in such conflict or having such effect, shall be of no force and effect. Upon the issuance of such decision, if either party requests, the parties shall negotiate a substitute for such specific Article, section or portion thereof, provided that the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The parties agree to use their best efforts to contest any such loss of federal funds which may be threatened.
ARTICLE 58.	SHIFT ASSIGNMENTS
When an opening occurs in a shift assignment in an appropriate work group at a location, preference shall be given to employees within the
50
classification who possess the training, ability and any required special qualifications to perform the work required, on the basis of seniority. In the event that no employee desires a shift assignment, employees shall be selected in order of inverse seniority.
This provision shall not apply to necessary training assignments. This provision shall not in itself alter the practice of rotating shifts where such practice presently exists. No employee who has a regular shift assignment on the effective date of the Agreement shall be involuntarily displaced from such shift assignment as a result of this Article.
ARTICLE 59.	SICK LEAVE
1.	Sick leave credit shall be earned at the rate of one (1) day per calendar month of service. The current practices concerning the earning of sick leave credits shall be continued. Sick leave shall be earned from the employee's date of employment. Sick leave credit shall be earned for any month in which the employee has been in pay status for ten (10) or more workdays or eighty (80) hours. A part-time employee shall earn sick leave in the same proportion as his/her part-time service bears to full-time service. An employee may accumulate unused sick leave up to a maximum of one hundred and twenty (120) days. Employees currently with lapsed sick leave credits shall have such lapsed sick leave added to their accumulated sick leave up to the maximum allowable accumulation of one hundred and twenty (120) days. However, the amount of unused sick leave accruals which can be credited towards State service for retirement purposes shall be ninety (90) days. When the maximum limitation has been accumulated, days that would normally thereafter be earned shall lapse but shall be recorded by the appointing authority. Any employee who has such lapsed sick leave to his/her credit may apply to the Director of Human Resources to have the sick leave restored in the event of an extended illness. The Director of Human Resources at his/her discretion may authorize restoration of all or any part of the lapsed sick leave after thorough investigation, including complete medical reports of the illness requiring the continued absence of the employee.
2.	Sick leave may be used for illness, necessary medical or dental care, or other disability of the employee or a member of the employee's immediate family which requires the attention or presence of the employee. Immediate family as used in this Article shall mean the spouse or significant other, the parents of the spouse or significant other, the children of the spouse or significant other, the parents, stepparents, guardian, children, stepchildren, brothers, stepbrothers, sisters, stepsisters, wards, grandparents and grandchildren of the employee. For the purposes of this Article, “significant other” means that a relationship exists between two people, neither of whom is married, that is intended to remain indefinitely and where there is joint responsibility for each other’s common welfare, there are significant shared 51
financial obligations, and they must be living together in a shared primary residence. This relationship must have existed for at least six (6) continuous months before benefits under this Article may be provided.
Employees are encouraged to consult with their agency/department Personnel Officer to determine if they are eligible for benefits available under the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act. A medical examination or doctor's certificate may be required on account of use of sick leave for five (5) or more consecutive workdays, or because of repeated absences on days preceding or days following a holiday or weekend. When a medical examination or doctor's certificate is required on account of use of sick leave in excess of five (5) consecutive workdays, the State shall pay the difference between the cost of obtaining such certificate and the amount covered by insurance.
3.	Notifications of absence under the provisions of this Article shall be given as soon as possible on the first day of absence or as soon thereafter as circumstances permit.
4.	Upon application of an employee, a leave of absence without pay may be granted by an appointing authority for a period of disability because of sickness or injury. If the appointing authority denies the requested leave, it shall state its reason in writing. The appointing authority may, from time to time, require that the employee submit a certificate from the attending physician or a designated physician. If a certificate from a physician other than the attending physician is required, the State shall pay the difference between the cost of obtaining such certificate and the amount covered by insurance.
5.	An employee who is transferred to the jurisdiction of another appointing authority or who accepts employment under the jurisdiction of a new appointing authority without interruption of service to the State shall retain his/her accumulated unused sick leave credits.
6.	A former State employee who is reappointed within four (4) years of his/her separation may have his/her previously accumulated and unused balance of sick leave revived and placed to his/her credit upon approval of the new appointing authority.
7.	Any employee returning from layoff, including seasonal employees covered by this Agreement, shall have the unused sick leave accrued as of the time of layoff restored upon his/her reinstatement.
[Effective upon implementation of the MFASIS Project's Leave Accrual Module]
ARTICLE 59.	SICK LEAVE
1.	Sick leave credit shall be earned at the rate of 3.7 hours per completed two-week pay period of service. The current practices concerning the earning of sick leave credits shall be continued only for those employees regularly 52
scheduled to work in excess of forty (40) hours per week and only for as long as they are so scheduled. Sick leave shall be earned from the employee's date of employment. Sick leave credit shall be earned for any pay period in which the employee has been in pay status for five (5) or more workdays or forty (40) hours. A part-time or intermittent employee shall earn sick leave as follows: a part-time or intermittent employee shall earn .04625 hours of sick leave for each hour in pay status per two-week pay period. For part-time employees, "hours in pay status" shall be an employee's regularly scheduled budget authorized hours. An employee may accumulate unused sick leave up to a maximum of nine hundred sixty (960) hours. However, the amount of unused sick leave accruals which can be credited towards State service for retirement purposes shall be seven hundred twenty (720) hours. For part-time or intermittent employees, the maximum accumulation of sick leave and the amount of unused sick leave which can be credited toward State service for retirement purposes shall be a percentage of nine hundred sixty (960) hours and seven hundred twenty (720) hours, respectively, equal to ten percent (10%) for each eight (8) hours in pay status per two-week pay period. When the maximum limitation has been accumulated, days that would normally thereafter be earned shall lapse but shall be recorded by the appointing authority. Any employee who has such lapsed sick leave to his/her credit may apply to the Director of Human Resources to have the sick leave restored in the event of an extended illness. The Director of Human Resources at his/her discretion may authorize restoration of all or any part of the lapsed sick leave after thorough investigation, including complete medical reports of the illness requiring the continued absence of the employee.
2.	Sick leave may be used for illness, necessary medical or dental care, or other disability of the employee or a member of the employee's immediate family which requires the attention or presence of the employee. Immediate family as used in this Article shall mean the spouse or significant other, the parents of the spouse or significant other, the children of the spouse or significant other, the parents, stepparents, guardian, children, stepchildren, brothers, stepbrothers, sisters, stepsisters, wards, grandparents and grandchildren of the employee. For the purposes of this Article, “significant other” means that a relationship exists between two people, neither of whom is married, that is intended to remain indefinitely and where there is joint responsibility for each other’s common welfare, there are significant shared financial obligations, and they must be living together in a shared primary residence. This relationship must have existed for at least six (6) continuous months before benefits under this Article may be provided.
Employees are encouraged to consult with their agency/department Personnel Officer to determine if they are eligible for benefits available under the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act. A medical examination or doctor's certificate may be required on account of use of sick leave for five (5) or more consecutive workdays, or because of repeated absences on days preceding or days following a holiday or weekend. When a medical examination or doctor's 53
certificate is required on account of use of sick leave in excess of five (5) consecutive workdays, the State shall pay the difference between the cost of obtaining such certificate and the amount covered by insurance.
3.	Notifications of absence under the provisions of this Article shall be given as soon as possible on the first day of absence or as soon thereafter as circumstances permit.
4.	Upon application of an employee, a leave of absence without pay may be granted by an appointing authority for a period of disability because of sickness or injury. If the appointing authority denies the requested leave, it shall state its reason in writing. The appointing authority may, from time to time, require that the employee submit a certificate from the attending physician or a designated physician. If a certificate from a physician other than the attending physician is required, the State shall pay the difference between the cost of obtaining such certificate and the amount covered by insurance.
5.	An employee who is transferred to the jurisdiction of another appointing authority or who accepts employment under the jurisdiction of a new appointing authority without interruption of service to the State shall retain his/her accumulated unused sick leave credits.
6.	A former State employee who is reappointed within four (4) years of his/her separation may have his/her previously accumulated and unused balance of sick leave revived and placed to his/her credit upon approval of the new appointing authority.

ARTICLE 60.	STATE VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT
1.	No employee shall be required to operate any State vehicle or equipment which is unsafe. An employee shall not be subject to any penalty or disciplinaiy action because of failure or refusal to operate or handle any equipment which he/she reasonably believes to be in an unsafe condition. In any such circumstance an employee shall call the matter to the attention of his/her supervisor for proper action.
2.	Other than motor vehicles, and except where employees have traditionally supplied their own tools, all employees shall be provided such equipment and tools as are reasonably necessary for their jobs, such as, drafting equipment, potato rakes, flashlights and batteries, and supplies.
ARTICLE 61.	UNION SECURITY
1.	Selection of Fee
54
Any employee covered by this Agreement shall, as a condition of employment, be required to choose from the options of membership in MSEA-SEIU or payment to MSEA-SEIU of a service fee equal to their pro-rata share of the costs to MSEA-SEIU that are germane to collective bargaining and contract administration as defined by law. The amount of the fee charged to certain employees hired prior to July 2, 2003, who were not members of MSEA-SEIU on that date, will be capped for approximately the first year of the contract, as provided under the subsection titled "Calculation of Service Fee."
Employees shall be required to (a) sign a written payroll deduction authorization form authorizing deduction from their pay of the membership dues or service fee, or (b) tender the amount of the service fee due to the union, or (c) indicate in writing their religious objection to such fee and make contributions at least equal in amount to the service fee to a non-religious charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the employee so objecting and the Union. Employees choosing (b) or (c) shall make payments within ten (10) days after each payday.
The obligation to pay fees or dues shall become effective as follows:
a.	For employees first hired after December 1, 2004, the payment obligation shall be effective at the start of the pay period commencing closest to but not earlier than the thirtieth day after the end of their initial six months of probation;
b.	For all other employees, the period commencing closest to but not earlier than July 1, 2005. This obligation shall be implemented simultaneously with the salary increase scheduled for July 2005.
2.	Calculation of Service Fee
MSEA-SEIU shall determine the amount of the service fee to be charged to non-members, consistent with both applicable law and this Article and shall certify to the State the amount of the service fee.
Until the start of each employee’s pay period commencing closest to but no earlier than July 1, 2006, the amount of the fee charged to employees (a) last hired prior to July 2, 2003; (b) who were neither members of MSEA-SEIU nor agency fee payers as of that date; (c) who have continued in that status since then; and (d) who choose not to join MSEA-SEIU; shall be capped at fifty percent of the otherwise-applicable service fee.
The service fee paid by part-time employees shall bear the same ratio to part-time dues as the fee paid by full time employees bears to the dues amount paid by full time employees.
3.	Change of Status
Any employee may eliminate their payroll deduction for MSEA-SEIU membership or for the service fee at any time by providing written notice to the employee’s payroll officer at least one pay period in advance of the change.
55
Employees may change their payroll deduction options regarding MSEA-SEIU membership or service fee status during the months of June and December. The right to join MSEA-SEIU shall be determined by the Union’s own Constitution and Bylaws. Employees may otherwise change their status with regard to membership in MSEA-SEIU or service fee payer status at any time. Employees who are members of MSEA-SEIU may resign their membership at any time and revert to payment of the service fee described above or terminate payroll deduction and tender the required service fee or dues directly to MSEA-SEIU.
4.	Payments and Deductions
It shall be the sole responsibility of MSEA-SEIU to collect its dues or service fees and to verify contributions made in lieu of service fees. No payroll deduction of service fees shall be made from workers’ compensation benefits or for any payroll period in which earnings received are insufficient to cover the amount of the deduction, nor shall such deductions be made from subsequent payrolls to retroactively cover the period in question. Employees shall not be penalized for failing to pay service fees for any such pay period(s).
5.	Notice and Audit
MSEA-SEIU shall calculate the amount of the fee after the close of its annual audit, based on the expenditures reflected in the most recent available audited records. That calculation shall also be audited to verify that the union's records have actually been audited; have been correctly reproduced from the audit report, and that the union has performed any mathematical adjustments correctly, and for any other purpose required by law. The fee will be effective on a paydate at least 30 days after the notice described below has been mailed to members of the bargaining unit, or provided to newly eligible employees.
Once the audit is complete, MSEA-SEIU shall prepare a notice, consistent with applicable law, to all employees covered by this Agreement. Such notice shall be updated annually and shall explain the choices and indicate that the sums determined to be the service fee were audited by an independent auditor based on the union's financial records for its most recent fiscal year. The notices shall include all information required by applicable law, including at a minimum, the major categories of expenses, as reflected in the audit; whether each expense will be included in the service fee; the identity of the auditor(s); and the opinion of each audit, including the opinion included in any adjusted audit(s). The State agrees to distribute this notice and dues deduction forms, provided by MSEA-SEIU, to new employees at the time they are hired. MSEA-SEIU shall provide notices required by law to all current bargaining unit employees. Any change in the amount of the service fee to be deducted shall be certified to the Director of the Bureau of Employee Relations 56
by the Treasurer of MSEA-SEIU at least thirty (30) days in advance of the change.
6.	Religious Objectors
In the event that any employee covered hereby holds a sincere and bona fide religious belief that conflicts with an obligation to financially support MSEA-SEIU, public employee organizations or labor organizations in general, that employee shall have the right to refuse to make service fee payments; provided, however, that said right to refuse shall continue only so long as the employee makes contributions at least equal in amount to the service fee to a non-religious charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the employee so refusing and the Union. Part-time employees’ contributions to non-religious charitable organizations shall coincide in amount with the payments of those part-time employees paying the service fee. MSEA-SEIU shall not unreasonably deny the choice of such non-religious charitable organization suggested by the employee.
Should an employee have a pending written request for religious objector status or a pending administrative or legal challenge regarding their religious objector status, the employee must place an amount equal to the service fee in an interest-bearing escrow account pending resolution of such dispute or request. MSEA-SEIU shall pay for any maintenance fees associated with such escrow accounts. The State shall not be liable for any fees, costs, damages, expenses, or any other form of liability involved with regard to such escrow accounts.
7.	Disputes
The amount of the service fee shall be subject to review pursuant to the American Arbitration Association’s Rules for Impartial Determination of Union Fees. Pending resolution of any such dispute, the disputed amount of fees shall be placed in an interest-bearing escrow account. MSEA-SEIU shall pay for any maintenance fees associated with such escrow accounts. The State shall not be liable for any fees, costs, damages, expenses, or any other form of liability involved with regard to such escrow accounts.
MSEA-SEIU is solely responsible for payment of the fee charged by AAA for the cost of providing necessary administrative services. The arbitrator will be compensated by MSEA-SEIU, in accordance with the per-diem rate currently on file for that arbitrator with the AAA, and shall be reimbursed for expenses by MSEA-SEIU. Attorneys' fees, witness fees, and other expenses shall be borne by the respective parties.

8.	Failure to Pay Fee
It shall be the sole obligation of MSEA-SEIU to certify to the State the name of each employee who has not paid his or her service fee or who has not made a contribution in lieu of a service fee and who, in the case of employees who are actively challenging the amount of the fee or the procedures implemented pursuant to this article, are not paying the disputed amount into the interest-bearing escrow account established by the union. MSEA-SEIU agrees to cooperate in any State investigation performed due to or in reliance upon each statement.
The Discipline article does not apply to employees who have not complied with this Article. The following procedure shall apply. On the first occasion the State determines, after an opportunity to investigate, that an employee failed to comply with this Article, the State shall provide the employee with notice of a finding of a violation of this Article and afford that employee a 30-day period to comply fully with this Article, paying all arrears due. Should the employee fail to timely correct this deficiency or should the employee be subsequently found by the State as failing to comply with this Article, the employee shall be provided with a notice of proposed dismissal. The employee will be afforded an opportunity to meet with the appointing authority or his/her representative prior to the action proposed. The employee will be entitled to have a Union representative or steward present. At that meeting, the appointing authority or his/her designee will give the employee an explanation of the employer’s evidence against the employee (if that has not already been provided) and offer the employee an opportunity to respond. Any employee who has not timely complied with the obligations of this Article must be dismissed. A dismissal in compliance with this Article may not be challenged through the Grievance Procedure article of this agreement.

Indemnification
MSEA-SEIU agrees that it shall indemnify, defend, reimburse, and hold the State harmless against any claim, demand, suit, cost, expense, damages, or any other form of liability, including attorneys’ fees, costs, or other liability arising from or incurred as a result of any act taken or not taken by the State, its members, officers, agents, employees, or representatives in complying with or carrying out the provisions of this Article, including, but not limited to, as a result of being ordered to reinstate an employee terminated at the request of MSEA-SEIU for not paying the service fee; in reliance on any notice, letter, or authorization forwarded to the State by the union pursuant to this Article; and including but not limited to any charge that the State failed to discharge any duty owed to its employees arising out of the service fee deduction. MSEA-SEIU will intervene in and defend any administrative or court litigation concerning the propriety of any act taken or not taken by the State, including, but not limited to, termination for failure to pay the service fee. In such litigation the State shall have no obligation to defend its act taken or not taken.
10. Severability
Should the United States Supreme Court, the First Circuit Court of Appeals or any Court in Maine hold indemnity clauses relating to union security void or unenforceable on Constitutional or public policy reasons, this Article shall be stricken in its entirety upon written notification to MSEA-SEIU by the State. Should any Court find the indemnity clause in this Article to be void or unenforceable for any reason, this Article shall be stricken in its entirety upon written notification to MSEA-SEIU by the State. Should the State provide such written notification, the parties shall enter into negotiations regarding a replacement Union Security Article.
ARTICLE 62.	UNIT WORK
If the State contracts out work normally performed by employees within this unit, and if the contracting out results in the elimination of jobs within the unit, the State will negotiate the impact of the contracting on the affected employees. Negotiations, if demanded, will occur no longer than a thirty (30) day period prior to implementation of the layoff. If the parties have not reached agreement within the thirty (30) day period, the obligation to bargain shall continue.
In addition, the State shall assist those employees whose jobs are eliminated by such actions to find other employment. The resources of the Bureau of Human Resources, the Department of Labor and the affected department shall be used in coordination with MSEA-SEIU to help the affected employees secure employment inside or outside of State government.
