Dear Julie,
This letter Is to confirm the parties understanding regarding work on Christmas Eve in the Central Lab.

If the Employer were to schedule Employees differently on Christmas Eve with the result that Employees work past this time, prior to any implementation, the Employer will meet with the Union to discuss the application of Article 20, Section t.

Dear Julie,
This letter is to confirm the understanding that was reached during the negotiations for the 2002-2005 Collective Bargaining Agreement regarding eligibility requirements for Building Engineers for Educational Assistance.
The parties have agreed that employees in the Building Engineer I and Building Engineer II classification can access Educational Assistance without meeting the current requirement under Article 29, Section 1 of attending a course that is credited, e,g., an employee taking a welding class at a vocational school.

Article 15, Section 2, Nurse Midwives. The nurse midwife role in Group Health, Inc., is unique and because of its uniqueness, the hours worked by midwives are different from all other Employees in Unit IV. The number of "in clinic” hours and "in hospital" hours varies primarily due to the number of nurse midwives on staff.
When fully staffed, the hours worked by midwives can be scheduled efficiently between clinic hours and hospital hours.
It is the intent of the Employer, to fully staff the nurse midwife program and to adjust the hours of midwives accordingly when full staffing is not available. Only this provision and Sections 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12 of this Article apply to midwives.

However, such reassignment or restructuring shall not change an Employee's FTE. Any reassignment or restructuring that would modify the Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be agreed to by the Union and Human Resources prior to it becoming effective. Such approval shall not be unreasonably denied by either party.
42

evening and/or weekend hour schedule.

Consistent with this policy and intent, the parties recognize that work performed by Employees in the unit(s) may also be performed on a limited basis by a bona fide Supervisor. This shall not occur on a scheduled or regular basis except for those positions identified in the National Labor Relations Board decision of May 15, 1980, Case Numbers 13-RC 12460, 18-RC-12461, 18-RC-12462, or where the nature of a department or clinic/location requires unique staffing assignments, (until such time when regular staffing practices can be implemented).

Dear Julie,
This letter is to confirm the parties understanding regarding work on Christmas Eve in the Central Lab. My understanding is that Central Lab's current practice is Employees do not work past 6:00 or 6:30 p.m. on Christmas Eve. If the Employer were to schedule Employees differently on Christmas Eve with the result that Employees work past this time, prior to any implementation, the Employer will meet with the Union to discuss the application of Article 20, Section 1.
Sincerely,
