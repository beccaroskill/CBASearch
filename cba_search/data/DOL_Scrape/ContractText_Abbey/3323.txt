Teachers requesting such leave shall submit a written application to the Superintendent setting forth the reason for said leave and its proposed duration. This written application must be received at least one (1) month prior to the proposed commencement of the leave. For the purpose of this Section 6.12 only, the school year shall be assumed to begin September 1 and end on August 31. Any request for an extension of a leave must be submitted, in writing, to the Superintendent at least three months prior to the expiration of the leave.

Board’s business office, provided that such intervals are concurrent with those for teachers on leave; and provided further, that payments shall not be required more frequently than monthly.

In the event the leave is granted for an additional semester or school year, or m the event the leave is extended, the teacher will return to the first vacant position for which he/she is qualified by certification and seniority and shall have no prior claim to return to the same position which had been originally vacated by that teacher. Failure of a teacher to return to her teaching position at the end of said leave, or failure of the teacher to return to the first vacant position to which she is recalled and for which she is certified, as set forth above, will be regarded as a resignation or a voluntary quit by the teacher.
Teachers returning from leave will be granted the same accumulated seniority, retirement benefits, fringe benefits, and other service credits which they possessed at the commencement of such leave. Further, teachers will return to the same step on the contract schedule that they occupied at Che commencement of such leave if such leave is commenced prior to February 1st of the school year. If such leave commenced after February l6t of the school year, they will be advanced one step beyond the step they had obtained prior to the commencement of such leave, unless the teacher was already at maximum.
