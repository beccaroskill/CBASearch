For purposes of computing vacations, holidays, jury duty or overtime, wages will be based on the Classification Wage Rates established in Schedule “A”, prior to deducting the pension contribution at the above rates based on “hours worked”. For example, overtime will be paid at 1.5 times the Schedule “A” rate of pay times hours worked. Pension contributions for said hours are based on the above Minimum Contribution Rates times hours worked.
In the event that the Pension Trustees eliminate or reduce the Minimum Contribution Rates referenced above, the Employer shall at that point in time restore hourly wage rates and pension contributions commensurately and prospectively, but not retroactively.
