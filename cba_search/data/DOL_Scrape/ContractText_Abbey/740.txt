When employees are hired for the first time by the Company, they will be employed at the starting rate for the positions in which they are hired. One hundred fifty (150) calendar days later, their wage will he increased to Service Bracket Two (2). For each twelve (12) months of service for a period of six (6) years in Wage Schedule I an individual will be given an increase to the next higher service bracket, which will result in long term employees having a wage differential which is higher than new employees or fellow employees with less service. Increases referred to above will be effective on the first Monday following the eligibility date.
Wages increases will be placed into effect:
a.	Upon completion of the first one hundred fifty (150) calendar days of employment;
b.	Upon completion of the next seven (7) calendar months of employment;

Further credit will be given to returning personnel using their total accumulated service to trigger service bracket increases. Seasonal or returning employees with a break in service of more than twelve (12) months will lose all accumulative time for service brackets.
5.	Promotions. Reclassifications and Reductions in Wage Grade
When an employee is promoted to a position in a higher wage grade or moves to a position in a lower wage grade, he/she shall move to the same service bracket in the new wage grade as he/she occupied in the previous wage grade.
6.	Transfers
No wage action will be taken when an employee transfers from one position to another within the same wage grade.
7.	"Red Circled" Employees
Employees whose wages are above those contained herein shall not have their wages reduced as long as they remain in the same classification for which they received the overscale rate. If such employees voluntarily leave the classification to enter another classification, they shall receive the rate for the new classification as indicated herein. If such employees involuntarily leave the classification as a result of a reduction in force, the following rules shall apply:
a.	If such employees are laid off and then return to the same classification in which they were receiving the overscale rate, the amount of overscale they received prior to layoff shall be restored on the date of return.
b.	If such employees are transferred to a different classification, they shall receive the rate shown herein for their new classification. If they return to the same classification for which they were receiving the overscale pay, they shall receive effective of the date they return to the classification the same amount of overscale they were receiving prior to transfer.
c.	When the Company deems it appropriate to pay an employee overscale, it will be in compliance with Article 10, Section 2, Premium Conditions. The Company retains the right to specify the duration of the overscale pay at the onset of the increase. If the Company does not specify a time frame for the overscale rate, it will fell within the provisions of this section.
8.	Service Brackets
Service bracket effective dates represent the total amount of service the employee has acquired in the bargaining unit, as per Article 6, Section 1.
Page 51
Service bracket effective dates will be adjusted to take into consideration approved leaves of absence and layoff of less than twelve (12) months
Employees leaving the bargaining unit due to resignation, except as consistent with Article 6, Section 2, discharge for cause, or lay off in excess of one (1) year, will lose all accumulated time for service bracket increases, except as provided herein.
9.	Daily Paid Positions
Daily paid positions are those positions contained herein. An employee is paid consistent with the rate of each day, irrespective of the number of hours worked in a given day. In such cases where the employee is required to work a sixth (6th) day, he/she will be paid the number of days worked times their daily rate. Overtime provisions will be administered in accordance with applicable wage and hour law.
