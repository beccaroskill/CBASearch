Dills Act (Dills Act) commencing with Section 3512 of the Government Code, and has as its purpose the promotion of harmonious labor relations between the State and Union; establishment of an equitable and peaceful procedure for the resolution of differences; and the establishment of rates of pay, hours of work, and other conditions of employment including health and safety. The term "Contract" as used herein means the written agreement provided under Section 3517.5 of the Government Code.
ARTICLE 1	- RECOGNITION
A.	Pursuant to Public Employment Relations Board decision S-SR-17, the State recognizes CSEA Union Local 1000, SEIU, as the exclusive representative for Registered Nurse Bargaining Unit 17, hereinafter referred to as Unit 17.

Disputes regarding this paragraph may be appealed directly to Step 2 (Department Head) of the grievance procedure.
2.2	Access
Union stewards, Union staff, and/or elected bargaining unit council representatives shall not be unreasonably denied nor delayed access to employees to represent them pursuant to Section 2.1 A. above and subject to the constraints listed below. Access shall not interfere with the work of the employees. Union stewards, Union staff or elected bargaining unit representatives seeking access to employees must notify the department head or designee in advance of the visit.

D.	The Union shall be permitted incidental and minimal use of the State electronic communication systems for communication about employee organization activities as those departments permit for other non-business purposes.
Such information will be distributed to departmental employees based on the department’s policies and procedures in distributing other non-business information. If required by the department, such information will be provided to a departmental designee on a format approved by each department for posting.
E.	This information shall not contain language that is libelous, obscene, defamatory, or of a partisan political nature.
2.5	Use of State Facilities
The State will continue to permit use of certain facilities for Union meetings, subject to the operating needs of the State. Requests for use of such State facilities shall be made in advance to the appropriate State official. When required in advance, the Union shall reimburse the State for additional expenses, such as security, maintenance and facility management costs, or utilities, incurred as a result of the Union's use of such State facilities.
2.6	Union Steward Time Off
Upon request of an aggrieved employee, a steward shall be allowed reasonable time off during working hours, without loss of compensation, for representational purposes in accordance with Section 2.1 A. of this Contract, provided the employee represented is in the steward's designated area of representation.

Consistent with Section 2.2 of this contract, a Union staff member and/or designee will be afforded the opportunity to meet with Unit 17 employees for up to twenty (20) minutes during any regularly scheduled new employee orientation session, for orientation of the employees to the contract and the Union.

ARTICLE 3	- ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY
3.1	Union Security
The State agrees to deduct and transmit to the Union all membership dues authorized on a form provided by the Union. Effective with the beginning of the first pay period following ratification of this agreement by the Legislature and the Union, the State agrees to calculate, deduct and transmit to the Union, Fair Share fees from State employees who do not have membership dues deductions for CSEA, SEIU Local 1000, based upon an amount or formula furnished by the Union for Fair Share fees deductions. The State further agrees to recalculate, deduct and transmit Fair Share fees to the Union based upon revised amounts or formulas furnished by the Union for Fair Share fees deductions during the term of this agreement. The State and the Union agree that a system of authorized dues deductions and a system of Fair Share fee deductions shall be operated in accordance with Government Code Sections 3513(h), 3513(j), 3515, 3515.6, 3515.7, and 3515.8, subject to the following provisions:
1.	When Fair Share fees are in effect, an employee may withdraw from membership in the Union by sending a signed withdrawal letter to the Union with a copy to the State Controller at any time. An employee who so withdraws his/her membership shall be subject to paying a Fair Share fee, if such a fee is applicable.
2.	The Union agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the State and its agents harmless against any claims made of any nature and against any suit instituted against the State arising from this Section and the deductions arising therefrom.
3.	The Union agrees to annually notify all State employees in Unit 17 who pay Fair Share fees of their right to demand and receive from the Union a return of part of that fee pursuant to Government Code Section 3515.8.
4.	No provision of this Section nor any disputes arising thereunder shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure contained in this Contract.
13
BU 17
03-04
5.	Should a rescission election be successful, the written authorization for payroll deductions for Union membership shall remain in full force and effect during the life of this Contract except that any employee may withdraw from the Union by sending a signed withdrawal letter to the Union with a copy to the State Controllers Office within thirty (30) calendar days prior to the expiration of this Contract.
3.2	Home Addresses
A.	Home Addresses - Generally
Consistent with PERB regulations and State law, the State shall continue to provide the union with home addresses on a monthly basis for all non-law enforcement related employees covered by this contract until it expires.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, any employee may have his/her home address withheld from the union at any time by submitting a written request to his/her appointing power on a form provided by the State.
B.	Home Address Withholding By Non-Law Enforcement Related Employees
Effective one (1) month following ratification of this agreement by both parties, the State will no longer use an Employee Action Request form that provides Unit 17 employees who perform non-law enforcement related functions with the option of having their home address withheld from the Union. Instead, employees who perform non-law enforcement related functions will, upon request on their own initiative, be given a separate form by their appointing power that permits two (2) choices: (1) withhold their address from the Union, or (2) to cancel a previous withhold request thereby permitting release of their home address to the Union.
C.	Home Address Withhold Notification to Non-Law Enforcement Related Employees
Within one (1) month following ratification of this agreement by both parties, the State will send a letter to all existing Unit 17 employees who perform non-law enforcement related functions that have previously requested their home address remain confidential. The letter will provide said employees with the option of canceling their previous withhold request thereby permitting release of their home address to the Union.
D.	Release and Use of Addresses
The State Controller’s Office will send the Union a list of all Unit 17 employees who, pursuant to subsection C. above, either did not respond or responded by indicating they wanted to continue withholding their home address from the Union. The State Controller’s Office will also send the Union a list of all Unit 17 employees who perform law enforcement-related functions (if any). Said list(s) will contain the employees’ name, agency and reporting unit.
14
BU 17
03-04
E.	Home Address Mailings By The State
The State will mail union information once per year to the home address of law enforcement-related employees, and non-law enforcement employees who have requested their home address be withheld from the Union. Said material shall be provided by the Union. The cost of this mailing shall be paid for by the Union. The Union agrees to hold the State harmless for any annual mail that does not reach Unit 17 employees.

A.	Employees may elect to enroll in the annual leave program to receive annual leave credit in lieu of vacation and sick leave credits. Employees enrolled in the annual leave program may elect to enroll in the vacation and sick leave program at any time except that once an employee elects to enroll in either the annual leave program or vacation and sick leave program, the employee may not elect to enroll in the other program until twenty-four (24) months have elapsed from date of enrollment.
B.	Each full-time employee shall receive credit for annual leave in lieu of the vacation and sick leave credits of this agreement in accordance with the following schedule:
1 month to 3 years	11 hours per month
37 months to 10 years	14 hours per month
121 months to 15 years	16 hours per month
181 months to 20 years	17 hours per month
241 months and over	18 hours per month
Part-time and hourly employees shall accrue proportional annual leave credits, in accordance with the applicable DPA rules and Appendix B (Annual Leave - Parttime employees). Employees shall have the continued use of any sick leave accrued as of the effective date of this Agreement, in accordance with applicable laws, rules, or memorandum of understanding.
All provisions necessary for the administration of this Section shall be provided by DPA rule or memorandum of understanding.
C.	A full-time employee who has eleven (11) or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall earn annual leave credits as set forth in DPA Rules 599.608 and 599.609.
Absences from State service resulting from a temporary or permanent separation for more than eleven (11) consecutive days which fall into two (2) consecutive qualifying pay periods shall disqualify the second pay period.
D.	Employees who work in multiple positions may participate in annual leave, provided an election is made while employed in an eligible position subject to these provisions. Annual leave accrual for employees in multiple positions will be computed by combining all positions, as in vacation leave, provided the result does not exceed the amount earnable in full-time employment, and the rate of accrual shall be determined by the schedule which applies to the position or collective bargaining status under which the election was made.
E.	If an employee does not use all of the annual leave that the employee has accrued in a calendar year, the employee may carry over his/her accrued annual leave credits to the following calendar year to a maximum of six hundred forty (640) hours. A department head or designee may permit an employee to carry over more than six hundred forty (640) hours of accrued hours because the employee: (1) was required to work as a result of fire, flood, or other extensive emergency; (2) was assigned work of a priority or critical nature over an extended period of time; (3) was absent on full salary for compensable injury; (4) was prevented by department regulations from taking annual leave until December 31 because of sick leave; or (5) was on jury duty.

H.	Annual leave request must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on this subject. However, when two (2) or more employees on the same shift (if applicable) in a work unit (as defined by each department head or designee) request the same annual leave time and approval cannot be given to all employees requesting it, employees shall be granted their preferred annual leave period in order of State seniority.
I.	Each department head or designee will make every effort to act on annual leave requests in a timely manner.
J.	Annual leave that is used for purposes of sick leave is subject to the requirements set forth in Section 8.3, Sick Leave, of this Agreement.

L.	Employees who are currently subject to vacation and sick leave provisions may elect to enroll in the annual leave program at any time after twenty-four (24) months have elapsed from date of last enrollment.

B.	A full-time employee who has eleven (11) or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall be eligible for up to eight (8) hours of sick leave credit. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each qualifying pay period of service, each full-time employee in Bargaining Unit 17 shall earn eight (8) hours of credit for sick leave with pay.
C.	Credit for less than full-time employees shall be computed as follows:
1.	Part-time employees. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each monthly pay period of continuous service, each part-time employee shall be allowed, on a pro-rata basis, the fractional part of his/her appropriate accrual rate of credit for sick leave with pay in accordance with the Chart for Computing Leave and Holiday Credit for All Fractional Time Base Employees - Vacation & Sick Leave (Appendix A).
2.	Multiple positions under this rule:
a.	An employee holding a position in State service in addition to the primary full-time position with the State shall not receive credit for sick leave with pay for service in the additional position.
b.	Where an employee holds two (2) or more "less than full-time positions", the time worked in each position shall be combined for purposes of computing credits for sick leave with pay, but such credits shall not exceed full-time employment credit.
D.	An employee may be required to provide a physician's or licensed practitioner's verification of sick leave when:
1.	the employee has a demonstrable pattern of sick leave abuse; or
2.	the supervisor has a reasonable belief that the absence was for an unauthorized reason. Reasonable belief means that a prudent person would also believe the absence was for an unauthorized reason.
3.	Whenever practical the verification of absence for authorized sick leave will be requested prior to the employee's return to work.
E.	The department head or designee shall approve sick leave only after having ascertained that the absence is for an authorized reason and may require the employee to submit substantiating evidence including, but not limited to, a physician's or licensed practitioner's verification. The State recognizes the confidential nature of the relationship between the health care provider and patient. However, such substantiation shall include, but not be limited to, the general nature of the employee's illness or injury and, when applicable, the anticipated length of the absence, any restrictions upon return to work that prevent the employee from performing the full range of his/her normal work assignment and anticipated future absences. If the department head or designee does not consider the evidence adequate, the request for sick leave shall be disapproved. Upon request, a denial of sick leave shall be in writing stating the reason for denial and, if applicable, any additional information which, once provided, could reverse the decision. The employee shall have five (5) working days to provide additional documentation to verify the request for sick leave prior to the decision becoming final and the absence shall be considered unapproved.

In addition, when a full-time employee has a break in the continuity of employment because of a permanent separation of less than six (6) months or because of a temporary separation, the full-time employee’s prior unused sick leave balance is restored.
J.	When an employee’s sick leave balance is zero, other leave credits such as vacation, annual leave, compensating time off (CTO), personal leave program (PLP), personal holiday, or holiday credit may be substituted with the supervisor’s approval, and shall not be unreasonably denied.

A.	The State acknowledges its commitment to comply with the spirit and intent of the leave entitlement provided by the FMLA and the California Family Rights Act (CFRA) referred to collectively as “FMLA”. The State and the Union recognize that on occasion it will be necessary for employees of the State to take job-protected leave for reasons consistent with the FMLA. As defined by the FMLA, reasons for an FMLA leave may include an employee’s serious health condition, for the care of a child, parent, spouse or domestic partner that has been defined and certified with the Secretary of State‘s office in accordance with Family Code Section 297 who has a serious health condition, and/or for the birth or adoption of a child.
B.	For the purposes of providing the FMLA benefits the following definitions shall apply:
1.	An eligible employee means an employee who meets the eligibility criteria set forth in the FMLA;
2.	An employee’s child means any child, regardless of age, who is affected by a serious health condition as defined by the FMLA and is incapable of self care. “Care” as provided in this section applies to the individual with the covered health condition;

b.	Other leave may be substituted for the FMLA absence due to illness and/or injury, at the employee’s discretion. An employee shall not be required to exhaust all paid leave, before choosing unpaid leave, unless otherwise required by Section 8.9 (Transfer of Leave Credits - Work and Family Program) of this Contract.
c.	FMLA absences for reasons other than illness and/or injury (i.e., adoption or care of an eligible family member), may be covered with leave credits, other than sick leave, including unpaid leave, at the employee’s discretion. Except in accordance with Section 8.9 (Transfer of Leave Credits - Work and Family Program) of this Contract, an employee shall not be required to exhaust all leave credits available before choosing unpaid leave to cover an FMLA absence.
C.	An eligible employee shall provide certification of the need for an FMLA leave.

The reasons for the additional certification request shall be provided to the employee in writing.
D.	An eligible employee shall be entitled to a maximum of twelve (12) workweeks (four hundred eighty (480) hours) of FMLA leave per calendar year and all other rights set forth in the FMLA.

E.	Within ninety (90) days of the ratification date of this Contract, and on January 1 of each year thereafter, FMLA leave shall be recorded in accordance with the calendar year. Each time an employee takes an FMLA leave, the remaining leave entitlement is any balance of the twelve (12) workweeks that has not been used during the current calendar year.

For each employee with enrolled family members, the employer shall contribute an additional eighty (80%) percent of the weighted average of the additional premiums required for enrollment of those family members, during the benefit year to which the formula is applied, in the four Basic health benefit plans that had the largest State active civil service enrollment, excluding family members, during the previous benefit year.

A. Effective July 1, 2001, the State shall continue a Rural Health Care Equity Program for Bargaining Unit 17 members, which may be administered in conjunction with a similar program for State employees in other bargaining units, for excluded employees, and for annuitants. The Department of Personnel Administration shall administer any fund involving Bargaining Unit 17 members.
1.	The program shall operate in the following fashion:
a.	The State shall contribute $1500 per year on behalf of each bargaining unit member (employee) who lives in a defined rural area, as more definitely described in Government Code Section 22825.01.
(1)	For Bargaining Unit 17 members, payments shall be on a monthly basis.
(2)	For permanent employees, as in the “Medical Reimbursement Account” situation, the employees does not have to wait for reimbursement of covered medical expenses until the full amount has been deposited.
b.	As to any employee who enters State service or leaves State service during a fiscal year, contributions for such employee shall be made on a pro rata basis. A similar computation shall be used for anyone entering or leaving the bargaining unit (e.g., promotion in mid-fiscal year).
c.	The money shall be available for use as defined in Government Code Section (GC) 22825.01.
d.	A Rural Healthcare Equity Program will be established with a separate account for Bargaining Unit 17 members, as one of several similar accounts.
e.	Each Unit 17 employee shall be able to utilize up to $1500 per fiscal year, pursuant to GC section 22825.01, but with the exceptions for greater utilization hereafter noted. The pro rata limitation pursuant to paragraph 1(b). is applicable here.
49	BU 17
03-04
f.	If an employee does not utilize the complete $1500 pursuant to the procedures and limitations described in GC section 22825.01, then the unused monies shall be put in a “same year pool”. That same year pool shall be utilized to pay those who have incurred eligible health care expenses in excess of the $1500, but again according to the procedures and limitations in the attached bill. The monies in the same year pool would be distributed at the end, or even soon after, each fiscal year to that group of employees who had expenses in excess of $1500 in the relevant fiscal year. Those monies shall be distributed on a pro tanto (pro rata) basis.
Any employee not in Bargaining Unit 17 all year shall receive credit under this paragraph utilizing the same pro rata formula as in paragraph 1(b). above.
If an employee is entitled to less than twenty five dollars ($25) under this paragraph, the money shall instead go into next year’s fund pursuant to paragraph g hereafter.
g.	If monies still remain after a distribution to such employees (i.e., all employees who spent more than $1500 as provided in GC section 22825.01 were completely reimbursed), then those surplus monies shall be rolled over into the next fiscal year’s funds available for distribution to employees whose expenses pursuant to statute exceed $1500 in such subsequent year. Similar “rollovers” would occur in any years where all employees were completely reimbursed (or had payments made on their behalf) pursuant to GC 22825.01 and monies still remained in the pool.
9.3	Pre-Tax of Health/Dental Premium Cost
Employees who are enrolled in any health and/or dental plan which requires a portion of the premium to be paid by the employee, will automatically have their out-of-pocket premium costs taken out of their paycheck before Federal, State and social security taxes are deducted. Employees who choose not to have their out-of-pocket costs pretaxed, must make an election not to participate in this benefit.
9.4	Employee Assistance Program

Leaves of absence without pay may be granted by the department head or designee upon the recommendation of the Employee Assistance Program Coordinator if all sick leave, holiday credits, vacation, and compensating time off have been exhausted, and the employee is not eligible to use Industrial Disability Leave or Non-Industrial Disability Insurance. A list of all Employee Assistance Program Coordinators shall be furnished to Union annually.

E.	The name and phone number of each department’s Employee’s Assistance Program Coordinator shall be readily available during work hours to all Unit 17 employees.
The name of the external EAP contract provider and the telephone number for employee’s self-referral shall be readily available during work hours to all Unit 17 employees.
F.

D.	The State shall not use the Department of Industrial Relations' Rating Bureau's Advisory Rating form as the vehicle to justify removing a worker from his/her normal work assignments.
E.	The prompt treatment of injury and/or transportation of the employee shall have precedence over the gathering of information or completing forms.
9.7	Independent Medical Examinations
A.	Whenever the State believes that an employee, due to an illness or injury, is unable to perform his/her normal work duties, the State may require the employee to submit to an independent medical examination at State expense. The medical examination will be separate of any medical services provided under the State's Workers' Compensation program.
B.	The purpose of such independent medical evaluations is not to determine the degree of disability the employee has suffered, but rather as to whether illness or injuries sustained restrict the employee from performing the full range of his/her normal work assignment.
C.	If the State, after the independent medical examination, determines that the employee cannot perform his/her normal work assignments, the State shall give the employee the opportunity to challenge the State's medical evaluation by supplying his/her personal medical evaluations to dispute the State's findings.

At the option of the State, the assignment may be extended beyond sixty (60) days.
It is the intent of the parties that the limited duty assignments be of the minimum necessary durations and that the maximum limited duty assignment of sixty (60) days, and any extensions, be utilized for the most severe illnesses or injuries.
B.	The State may make alternative assignments, retrain employees, or as provided under the Government Code, medically terminate an employee whose prognosis for continued employment is poor.
C.	The State reserves the right to have an employee examined by a physician of its choosing prior to granting, continuing or extending a light/limited duty assignment.
D.	Nothing in this section shall be construed to contravene the State Personnel Board's constitutional and/or statutory authority to determine the appropriate classification of assigned duties, to require reasonable accommodation of an employee or applicant with a disability, or to determine the ability of an applicant or employee to perform the essential functions of a classification or job. Complaints under this Section alleging out-of-class work, denial of reasonable accommodation, discrimination based on disability, or inappropriate medical demotion, transfer or termination shall not be grievable under the grievance procedure contained in Article 6 (Grievance and Arbitration Procedures) of this Contract.
9.10	Continuation of Flexible Benefits Program
When an employee who is enrolled in the State's Flexible Benefits Program (Flex-Elect) for eligible nonrepresented employees changes employment status to that of a represented employee in the bargaining unit, the employee will maintain their flexible benefit elections through the duration of the flex plan year in lieu of the corresponding benefits provided by this Contract. At the conclusion of the flex plan year, the employee shall receive only those benefits contained in this Contract.
9.11	Reasonable Accommodation
A.	No State employee shall be unlawfully denied reasonable accommodation. The State agrees to take such actions as necessary to ensure that this purpose is achieved.

Complaints alleging denial of reasonable accommodation shall be appealed to the State Personnel Board through the complaint procedure specified by the Board.
9.12	Alternative Pre-Retirement Death Benefit
The Union agrees to support legislation that would provide State employees with an improved “alternative pre-retirement death benefit” and for the ability for the surviving spouse and dependent children to continue to receive health and dental benefits coverage. The enhanced death benefits would also be payable to surviving spouses or dependent children who are currently receiving the former death benefit, as would health and dental coverage. (Government Code Sections 21847 and 21847.5)
9.13	Long Term Care Insurance Plan
A.	Employees in classes assigned to Bargaining Unit 17 are eligible to enroll in any long term care insurance plan sponsored by the Department of Personnel Administration. The employee's spouse, parents, and the spouse's parents are also eligible to enroll in the plans, subject to the underwriting criteria specified in the plan.
B.	The long term care insurance premiums and the administrative cost to the Department of Personnel Administration and the State Controller’s Office shall be fully paid by the employee and are subject to payroll deductions.
9.14	Non-Industrial Disability Insurance
A.	Non-Industrial Disability Insurance (NDI) is a program for State employees who become disabled due to nonwork-related disabilities as defined by Section 2626 of the Unemployment Insurance Code.
B.	For periods of disability commencing on or after October 1, 1984, eligible employees shall receive NDI payments at sixty percent (60%) of their full pay, not to exceed one hundred thirty-five dollars ($135) per week, payable monthly for a period not exceeding twenty-six (26) weeks for any one (1) disability benefit period. An employee is not eligible for a second disability benefit due to the same or related cause or condition unless they have returned to their regular time base, and work for at least ten (10) consecutive work days. Paid leave shall not be used to cover the ten (10) work days.
C.	The employee shall serve a ten (10) consecutive calendar day waiting period before NDI payments commence for each disability. Accrued vacation or sick leave balances may be used to cover this waiting period. The waiting period may be waived when the employee is a registered bed patient in a hospital or nursing home, or receives treatment in a hospital or surgical unit or licensed surgical clinic. Procedure rooms and doctors’ offices are not included.
D.	If the employee elects to use vacation, annual leave, personal leave or sick leave credits prior to receiving NDI payments, he/she is not required to exhaust the accrued leave balance.
54
BU 17
03-04
E.	Following the start of NDI payments, an employee may, at any time, switch from NDI to sick leave, vacation leave, annual leave, personal leave, or catastrophic leave but may not return to NDI until that leave is exhausted.
F.	In accordance with the State's "return to work" policy, an employee who is eligible to receive NDI benefits and who is medically certified as unable to return to full-time work during the period of his/her disability, may upon the discretion of his/her appointing power, work those hours (in hour increments) which, when combined with the NDI benefit, will not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of their regular "full pay". This does not qualify the employee for a new disability period under Subsection B. of this article. The appointing power may require an employee to submit to a medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the Director of the Employment Development Department for the purpose of evaluating the capacity of the employee to perform the work of his/her position.
G.	If an employee refuses to return to work in a position offered by the employer under the State's Injured State Worker Assistance Program, NDI benefits will be terminated effective the date of the offer.
H.	Where employment is intermittent or irregular, the payments shall be determined on the basis of the proportionate part of a monthly rate established by the total hours actually employed in the eighteen (18) monthly pay periods immediately preceding the pay period in which the disability begins as compared to the regular rate for a fulltime employee in the same group or class. An employee will be eligible for NDI payments on the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of nine hundred sixty (960) hours of compensated work.
I.	All other applicable Department of Personnel Administration laws and regulations not superseded by these provisions will remain in effect.
J.	Upon approval of NDI benefits, the State may issue an employee a salary advance if the employee so requests.
K.	All appeals of a denial of an employee's NDI benefits shall only follow the procedures in the Unemployment Insurance Code and Title 22. All disputes relating to an employee's denial of benefits are not grievable or arbitrable. This does not change either party's contractual rights which are not related to the denial of an individual's benefits.
9.15	Enhanced Non-Industrial Disability Insurance
This Enhanced Non-Industrial Disability (ENDI) provision is only applicable to employees participating in the annual leave program referenced in Section 8.2 (Annual Leave).
ENDI is a program for State employees who become disabled due to nonwork-related disabilities as defined by Section 2626 of the Unemployment Insurance Code.

For periods of disability commencing on or after January 1, 1989, eligible employees shall receive ENDI payments at fifty percent (50%) of their gross salary, payable monthly for a period not exceeding twenty-six (26) weeks for any one (1) disability benefit period. An employee is not eligible for a second disability benefit due to the same or related cause or condition unless they have returned to their regular time base and work for at least ten (10) consecutive work days. Paid leave shall not be used to cover the ten (10) work days. Disability payments may be supplemented with annual leave, sick leave or partial payment to provide for up to one hundred percent (100%) income replacement. At the time of an ENDI claim, an employee may elect either the fifty percent (50%) ENDI benefit rate or a supplementation level of seven-five percent (75%) or one hundred percent (100%) at gross pay. Once a claim for ENDI has been filed and the employee has determined the rate of supplementation, the supplemental rate shall be maintained throughout the disability period.
B.	The employee shall serve a seven (7) consecutive calendar day waiting period before ENDI payments commence for each disability. Accrued paid leave or CTO leave balances may be used to cover this waiting period. The waiting period may be waived when the employee is a registered bed patient in a hospital or nursing home, or receives treatment in a hospital surgical unit or licensed surgical clinic. Procedure rooms and doctors’ offices are not included.
C.	If the employee elects to use annual leave or sick leave credits prior to receiving ENDI payments, he/she is not required to exhaust the accrued leave balance.
D.	Following the start of ENDI payments an employee may at any time switch from ENDI to sick leave or annual leave, but may not return to ENDI until that leave is exhausted.
E.	In accordance with the State's "return to work" policy, an employee who is eligible to receive ENDI benefits and who is medically certified as unable to return to their fulltime work during the period of his/her disability, may upon the discretion of his/her appointing power, work those hours (in hour increments) which when combined with the ENDI benefit will not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of their regular "full pay". This does not qualify the employee for a new disability period under Subsection A. of this article. The appointing power may require an employee to submit to a medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the Director of the Employment Development Department for the purpose of evaluating the capacity of the employee to perform the work of his/her position.
F.	If an employee refuses to return to work in a position offered by the employer under the State's Injured State Worker Assistance Program, ENDI benefits will be terminated effective the date of the offer.
G.	Where employment is intermittent or irregular, the payments shall be determined on the basis of the proportionate part of a monthly rate established by the total hours actually employed in the eighteen (18) monthly pay periods immediately preceding the pay period in which the disability begins as compared to the regular rate for a fulltime employee in the same group or class. An employee will be eligible for ENDI payments on the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of nine hundred sixty (960) hours of compensated work.

B.	In the event that the disability exceeds twenty-two (22) work days, the employee will receive 66 and 2/3% of gross pay from the twenty-third (23rd) work day of disability until the end of the fifty second (52nd) week of disability. No IDL or payments shall be allowed after two (2) years from the first day (i.e., date) of disability.
C.	The employee may elect to supplement payment from the twenty-third (23rd) work day with accrued leave credits including annual leave, vacation, sick leave, or compensating time off (CTO) in the amount necessary to approximate the employee's full net pay. Partial supplementation will be allowed, but fractions of less than one (1) hour will not be permitted. Once the level of supplementation is selected, it may be decreased to accommodate a declining leave balance but it may not be increased. Reductions to supplementation amounts will be made on a prospective basis only.
D.	Temporary Disability (TD) with supplementation, as provided for in Government Code Section 19863, will no longer be available to any State employee who is a member of either the CalPERS or STRS retirement system during the first fifty-two (52) weeks, after the first date of disability, within a two (2) year period.

G.	An employee may elect to supplement Vocational Rehabilitation Maintenance Allowance, which is provided pursuant to Section 10125.1, Title 8, California Code of Regulations, with leave credits.
H.	The State and Union agree to support legislation to amend Government Code Section 19863.1, to allow an employee to supplement Vocational Rehabilitation Maintenance Allowance with leave credits.
I.	All appeals of an employee's denial of IDL benefits shall only follow the procedures in the Government Code and Title 2. All disputes relating to an employee's denial of benefits are not grievable or arbitrable. This does not change either party's contractual rights which are not related to an individual's denial of benefits.

E.	EIDL eligibility and benefits may not exceed fifty-two (52) weeks (365 calendar days) within two (2) years of the first day of lost time. The employee’s full gross salary is reduced by the amount of federal and state income tax and OASDI or Medicare to establish the “EIDL reduced gross”. The intent of the EIDL program is to maintain, as closely as possible, the disabled employee’s monthly take home pay. The retirement contribution is computed and deducted based on the employee’s full gross salary. The EIDL benefit is subject to miscellaneous payroll deductions. Additional withholding for taxes, deferred compensation/administrative charge, tax sheltered annuity or Flex-Elect will not be withheld from EIDL payments. EIDL payments are not reported as taxable wages or other compensation on the Form W-2.
F.	EIDL may continue beyond the physician’s statement that the employee’s condition is “permanent and stationary” providing the employee has not exhausted his/her eligibility for EIDL benefits, the employee has been declared a “qualified injured worker”, and the employee would otherwise be entitled to Vocational Rehabilitation Maintenance Allowance (VRMA).

The Special Schools shall guarantee the opportunity for ten (10) months of compensation (as defined by State Personnel Board Rule 9) to permanent, full-time Special Schools' employees except when budgetary or program considerations preclude it. Budgetary or program considerations are those which are mandated by the Legislature, Governor, or Superintendent of Public Instruction. This means that these employees may be scheduled either for work, CTO, holiday credits, paid or unpaid leave; so, that when all of these are considered in total for the year, each employee at the California Schools for the Deaf and California School for the Blind receives a minimum annual compensation equivalent to approximately 1,734 hours of the employee’s regular (straight-time) rate of pay. Employees at the Diagnostic Centers will receive a minimum annual compensation equivalent to approximately 1,934 hours of the employee’s regular (straight-time) rate of pay based upon their twenty-five (25) day extended work year. The Special Schools may provide an annual compensation greater than 1,734 hours (1,934 hours for Diagnostic Centers employees) subject to budgetary and program considerations. If an employee chooses not to work, the Schools' obligation to provide a minimum opportunity for ten (10) months compensation shall be reduced accordingly.
During recess periods, the Special Schools may utilize any combination of work, training, vacation, annual leave, CTO or dock. Priority consideration will be given first to regular work assignments, second to training and third to work not associated with their normal duties. It is understood by both parties that regular work, work not associated with their normal duties, and training may not be available. Employees may request training that enhances the Special Schools program.
B.	Employees covered by this Agreement:
1.	May be scheduled and use vacation or annual leave during their initial six (6) months of employment. This is an exception to the Bargaining Unit 17 contract vacation leave provision.
69
BU 17
03-04
2.	Shall receive seventy (70) hours of vacation leave credit which will be credited to their vacation leave credit account upon commencement of the school year. This vacation leave credit shall be used to offset noncompensable absences during school recess periods. In addition, the Special Schools may allow employees to use these vacation leave credits during scheduled work periods. However, the minimum annual compensation (1,734 hours) shall be reduced by the amount of vacation used.
3.	Sections B.1. and 2. shall apply to permanent, part- time employees on a pro rata basis.
4.	The seventy (70) hours of vacation leave credit (and prorated amount for permanent, part-time employees) is contingent upon an employee's continued employment for a minimum ten (10) qualifying pay periods beginning with the employee's first qualifying pay period of the school year. If an employee terminates employment prior to this ten (10) qualifying pay period duration and the Special school is unable to adjust the employee's vacation and/or CTO credit balances in order to reflect the proper vacation leave credit balance, the employee shall reimburse the Special School for the amount that is outstanding.
C.	Work scheduled during school recesses may include training and other work assignments which may involve duties not normally associated with their normal and regular duties. These assignments which involve duties not normally associated with their regular duties shall only occur during recesses.
D.	The Special Schools have total discretion to determine the school year, including recesses, as long as the provisions of this Agreement are met.
E.	During school recess periods, the Special Schools may schedule work, training, paid leave (e.g., annual leave, CTO or vacation) or place employees on dock. “School recess” is defined as a scheduled closing of the school during the academic year (for example: Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter recesses). During recesses, it is the intent of the Department that all employees covered by this Agreement shall be scheduled the same number of vacation days based on the minimum accrual rate for ten (10) month employees plus or minus two (2) days (for example, if the minimum leave accrual rate for ten (10) months employees is 8.75 days per year, then during recesses the employee would be scheduled no more than 10.75 days of vacation nor less than 6.75 days of vacation.
F.	Employees who have taken a leave of absence without pay, who have been charged with an AWOL, or who have been "docked" will not be extended compensation opportunities to the extent that they would benefit over other employees from such docks.
G.	The Special Schools shall provide eligibility for medical and dental benefits during the months of July and August by scheduling a minimum two (2) days work, training, vacation, annual leave or CTO in July and a minimum two (2) days of work, training, vacation, annual leave or CTO in August.
H.	If an overtime opportunity is offered to and declined by an employee, only the amount of the overtime hours offered shall be charged toward the employee’s 1,734 hours. The premium that might have been earned shall not be charged toward the 1,734 hours.

I.	Special Schools Calendar
1.	The Superintendent of a State Special School shall obtain input from Unit 17 employees during the development of the proposed academic calendar. Special School employees shall receive a copy of the proposed calendar prior to adoption of the calendar.
2.	Upon the adoption of an academic calendar the State Special Schools shall provide a copy of the academic calendar to Unit 17 Special Schools employees.

The departments shall make arrangements so that NOC shift or first watch employees may pick up their pay checks during their assigned work shift which begins on the authorized pay day.
11.12	Salary Definition
A. For the purpose of salary actions affecting employees assigned to Bargaining Unit 17, the following definitions shall apply:
1.	"Salary range" is the range of rates between, and including, the minimum and maximum rate currently authorized for the class.
2.	"Step" for employees compensated on a monthly basis is a five percent (5%) differential above or below a salary rate rounded to the nearest dollar and for employees compensated on a daily or hourly basis is a five percent (5%) differential above or below a rate rounded to the dollar and cents amount.
3.	"Rate" for employees compensated on a monthly basis is any one of the full dollar amounts found within the salary range and for employees compensated on a daily or hourly basis any one of the dollar and cents amounts found within the salary range.
4.	"Range differential" is the difference between the maximum rate of two (2) salary ranges.
5.	"Substantially the same salary range" is a salary range with the maximum salary rate less than two (2) steps higher than or the same as the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
6.	"Higher salary range" is a salary range with the maximum salary rate at least two (2) steps higher than the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
7.	"Lower salary range" is a salary range with the maximum salary rate any amount less than the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
Under paragraph (2), one step higher is calculated by multiplying the rate by 1.05 (e.g., $2,300 x 1.05 = $2,415). One step lower is calculated by dividing the rate by 1.05 (e.g., $2,415 - 1.05 = $2,300).
71
BU 17
03-04
Unless otherwise provided, the lowest salary range currently authorized for the class is used to make salary comparisons between classes. Any rate falling within the salary range for a class may be used to accomplish appropriate step differentials in movements between classes and salary ranges.

D.	If an employee promotes to a different facility or department other than Avenal, Ironwood, Calipatria or Chuckawalla Valley State Prisons prior to completion of the twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods, there shall be no pro rata of this recruitment and retention bonus.

H.

ARTICLE 14	- PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL
14.1	Performance Appraisal
A performance appraisal is a constructive process to acknowledge the performance of an employee. An employee’s evaluation shall be sufficiently specific to inform and guide the employee in the performance of his/her duties. If an employee is not given an opportunity to perform on a particular element, the supervisor will note on the performance evaluation that the factor was not applicable, and the employee’s evaluation shall not be negatively impacted. Employees shall not have their evaluation negatively impacted by their use of any leaves permitted under the terms of this Contract.
1.	Performance evaluations are not considered as an independent step in the disciplinary process.
2.	If there is no evaluation of record within one (1) year prior to a scheduled wage increase, the employee’s overall evaluation shall be: “meets expectations”.
A.	PROBATIONARY REPORTS
Probationary performance reports shall be completed at sufficiently frequent intervals to keep the employee adequately informed of progress on the job. The final report may summarize the previously issued probationary performance reports.
B.	ANNUAL PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL
Annual performance reports shall generally include information from the immediate twelve (12) months prior to the due date of the report, exclusive of the probationary rating period.
The performance appraisal system of each department may include annual written performance appraisals for permanent employees. Such performance appraisals may be completed at least once each twelve (12) calendar months after an employee completes the probationary period for the class in which he/she is serving.
In the absence of any current annual performance appraisal, or performance evaluation material to the contrary, the employee’s performance shall be deemed satisfactory.
While in the process of completing the probationary report or annual performance appraisal, the supervisor shall personally meet with the employee to review the appraisal or report, any notes, documents, or audits utilized in preparing the report.
At the time an employee signs his/her annual appraisal, a copy will be provided to the employee. These reports, as a general rule, will be issued to the employee no later than thirty (30) days after the due date of the report.

BU 17
03-04
Any performance evaluation conducted of an employee who is a participant in Union/State collective bargaining negotiations shall recognize the employee’s frequent absence from his/her State job and the impact of such absences on the employee’s performance. Such absences shall not be included as excessive absences. This is not intended to abrogate the right of the State to take disciplinary action against any employee who happens to be involved in such collective bargaining.
Any Unit 17 employee may grieve the content of his/her annual performance appraisal through the third (DPA) step: (1) when he/she receives a substandard rating of the performance factors, or (2) when negative comments are inconsistent with the actual ratings received, or (3) when rating factors are not used and the narrative evaluation includes negative comments. DPA shall sustain the evaluation except where supported by substantial evidence to the contrary. When a grievance is granted on this subject, the annual performance appraisal will be modified to reflect the outcome of the grievance procedure and the original performance appraisal will be removed from the file.
14.2	Performance Appraisal of Nursing Practices
When Unit 17 employees who provide hands-on-care receive a rating from a nonregistered nurse supervisor of "Improvement Needed" on their Individual Appraisal Summary for nursing practices, the rating will be reviewed by a supervising registered nurse designated by the department head or designee. This Section is not to be construed as a limitation on supervisory personnel responsibility for the overall evaluation of employees.
14.3	Informal Performance Discussions
A.	The State and CSEA Local 1000 encourage periodic informal performance discussions between Unit 17 employees and their supervisor to discuss work performance, job satisfaction, and work-related problems. Except when immediate action is necessary for health or safety reasons, such discussions shall be held in a private setting or sufficiently removed from the hearing range of other persons.
B.	The issuance of work instructions by a supervisor does not constitute an informal performance discussion. This section shall not be construed to limit, in any manner, a supervisor’s right to issue work instructions.
14.4	Personnel and Evaluation Material
A.	There shall be only one (1) official personnel file (OPF) and one (1) supervisory working file regarding each Unit 17 employees.

An affected employee will be notified of the existence of such a court order or subpoena and provided with said copy. OPF’s shall contain an inspection log where any person reviewing the file shall sign and date the log, unless excluded by law.
D.	No rank-and-file shift lead shall be authorized access to a Unit 17 employee’s files, except with prior written approval of the employee.
E.	Evaluation material or material relating to an employee’s conduct, attitude, or service shall not be included in his/her OPF files without being signed and dated by the author of such material. Before the material is placed in the employee’s file, the department head or designee, shall provide the affected employee an opportunity to review the material, and sign and date it. An employee’s signature shall not constitute agreement. A copy of the material shall be given to the employee upon request.
F.	A Unit 17 employee or his/her authorized representative(s) may review his/her files during regular office hours.
G.	Where the OPF is in location remote from the employee’s work location, reasonable arrangements will be made to accommodate the employee and/or his/her authorized representative at the employee’s work location.
H.	The employee shall have the right to insert in his/her files reasonable supplementary material and/or a written response to any items in the files. Responses shall remain attached to the material it supplements for as long as the material remains in the file. Reasonable supplementary material includes, but is not limited to, letters of commendation, accolades, etc.
I.	Materials relating to an employee’s performance included in the employee’s OPF files shall be retained for a period of time specified by each department, except that at the written request of the employee, materials of a negative nature shall be purged after two (2) years if there has been no recurring behavior. This provision, however, does not apply to formal adverse actions as defined in applicable Government Code Sections or to material of a negative nature for which actions have occurred during the intervening years period, except that, by mutual agreement between a department head or designee and an employee, adverse action material may be removed.
J.	As provided for in A. above, supervisors may keep a working file on the performance and conduct of employees to provide documentation for matters such as, but not limited to, probation reports, performance appraisals, training needs, MSA reviews, bonus programs, adverse actions, employee development appraisals, or examination evaluations. Supervisory working notes placed in a supervisory working file shall generally not be kept for a period longer than one year from the date it was placed in the file. An employee and/or his/her authorized representative may, upon request, review the contents of his/her file with his/her representative and be provided a copy upon request.

14.5	Letters of Instruction (LOI)/Work Improvement Discussions (WIDs)
A.	LOI/WIDs (as well as counseling memos, informal letters of reprimand, letters of warning, etc.) shall contain a specified expiration date, not to exceed one (1) year if there has been no recurring behavior, upon which the employee may request the removal of the same. Upon request to the Appointing Authority of his/her designee, they shall be removed and destroyed, unless the employee requests the documents be returned to them for their own disposal.
B.	LOI/WIDs shall be issued in a timely fashion, generally within thirty (30) days from when the incident occurred or from date of discovery of the incident that forms the basis for the LOI/WID.
C.	In cases where departmental staff are investigating an employee in a situation which adverse action potentially may follow, and the decision is made to give the employee an LOI/WID, the LOI/WID shall be issued in a timely fashion, generally within thirty (30) days from the decision to give the employee an LOI. This will not prevent the parties from negotiating a formal adverse action down to an LOI/WID.
D.	This provision shall not be circumvented by calling the document by another title such as: Letter of Informal Discussion, Employee Counseling Record, Letters of Contact, or Expectations of Work Performance memos. These types of “minor” corrective memos are to be placed in the employee’s supervisory file, but not in the OPF.
E.	The employee shall have the right to submit a rebuttal to any LOI/WID, or any such comment referred to in Article 14.5 A. and D. above and/or Article 14, Section 4 E. of this Contract. The rebuttal shall be submitted no later than thirty (30) days after issuance of the LOI/WID to the employee unless mutually agreed by the appointing authority’s authorized representative and the employee or his/her representative to extend this time frame. The rebuttal shall be attached to the applicable LOI/WID and shall remain in the files only as long as the underlying document.
F.	Disputes concerning this section are grievable to Step 3 (DPA) pursuant to Article 6, of the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure of this Contract.
G.	Upon the employee’s written request, all official Notices of Adverse Action, all documentation leading to or supporting or proposing such action, and all SPB decisions rendered in such cases will be purged from the employee’s file(s) after three (3) years if there has been no recurring behavior.
H.	Although any performance problem may be addressed in an employee’s annual performance evaluation, the evaluation shall contain no reference to the issuance of an LOI/WID or adverse action.

ARTICLE 20	- HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
20.1	Workweek
The regular workweek of full-time Unit 17 employees shall be forty (40) hours and eight (8) hours per day. Workweeks and workdays of a different number of hours may be scheduled by the State in order to meet the varying needs of the State.
20.2	Overtime
A.	Overtime is defined as any authorized time worked in excess of forty (40) hours per week.
B.	Notwithstanding any other contract provision or law to the contrary, time during which a Unit 17 employee is excused from work because of sick leave shall be counted as hours worked within the workweek for purposes of determining if overtime has been earned.
C.	Payment for authorized overtime may be by cash payment or compensating time off (CTO), at the discretion of the State.
D.	Rate of payment for authorized overtime, whether cash or CTO, shall be at one and one-half (1-1/2) times the regular rate of pay for each hour of overtime worked, or fraction thereof rounded in accordance with the workweek group.
E.	If the State does not schedule CTO within one (1) year from the date the overtime was earned, the State must provide cash payment for the overtime or may, at the request of the employee, extend the time the employee can take CTO.
For the purposes of this contract section, authorized overtime is defined as overtime pre-approved by a designated supervisor. When an employee attempts to reach the designated supervisor for approval no later than thirty (30) minutes before the end of his/her shift, in order to request approval for overtime to complete mandated duties, failure of the supervisor to respond to the request or contract within thirty (30) minutes shall be construed as approved overtime authorization. Attempts for authorization must be supported by documentation as determined by departmental policy.
F.	A Unit 17 employee may initiate a request for scheduling CTO which will not be denied without a work-related reason.
G.	Both parties agree and understand that a different type of overtime payment (cash or CTO) may be provided to employees at different times and may even be different from employees in the same or similar situations.
H.	Employees in classes assigned to Work Week Group 2 shall be compensated for ordered overtime of at least fifteen (15) minutes at any one time. Overtime will be credited on a one-quarter (%) hour basis with a full quarter of an hour credit granted if seven (7) minutes is worked. Smaller fractional units will not be accumulated.

BU 17
03-04
I.	In the Department of Mental Health and Department of Developmental Services an employee shall have the choice of cash or CTO for overtime hours worked. Management shall have the option each fiscal year to compensate employees up to forty (40) hours with CTO. Prior to working overtime, the employee or the employer shall be notified if the overtime is to be paid in CTO. Employees may accrue up to one hundred (100) hours of compensating time off. All hours in excess of the one hundred (100) hour CTO maximum shall be compensated in cash. If cash compensation is paid to an employee for accrued CTO, such compensation shall be paid at the regular rate earned by the employee at the time the employee receives such payment. Employees shall have the right to hold up to forty (40) hours of accrued CTO exempt from mandatory buyout.
20.3	Work Week Group Definitions
A.	Work Week Group "2" applies to those classifications in State service subject to the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
Overtime for employees subject to the provisions of the FLSA is defined as: “all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a period of one hundred sixty-eight (168) hours or seven (7) consecutive twenty-four (24) hour periods.”
B.	Work Week Group "E" includes classes that are exempted from coverage under the FLSA because of the "white-collar" (administrative, executive, professional) exemptions. To be eligible for this exemption a position must meet both the "salary basis" and the "duties" test.
Consequently, Work Week Group "E" applies to classes and positions with no minimum or maximum number of hours in an average workweek. Exempt employees are paid on a "salaried" basis, and the regular rate of pay is full compensation for all hours worked to perform assigned duties. However, these employees shall receive up to eight (8) hours holiday credit when ordered to work on a holiday. A "salaried" employee may not receive any form of overtime compensation, whether formal or informal.
C.	Work Week Group "SE" applies to those positions that under the FLSA are statutorily exempted, (physicians, attorneys, teachers) from coverage.
20.4	Rest Periods
A.	One rest period of fifteen (15) minutes shall be scheduled by the supervisor during each four (4) hour segment worked by the employee. Employees shall be permitted to take breaks except when required to meet an unforeseen business necessity.
B.	A rest period shall not be granted during the first or last hour of the work shift. Rest periods may not be accumulated, nor may they be used for overtime purposes.
C.	With the approval of his/her supervisor, the employee may take the break away from the employee's work area provided the employee is back in the work assignment at the end of the rest period.
111
BU 17
03-04
20.5	Rest Areas
A.	Unit 17 employees shall be permitted to use non-work areas for breaks if it does not involve an additional cost; it does not involve areas restricted for health and safety reasons; it does not interfere with State business needs; or it does not negatively impact on patients, consumers, inmates, wards, or students’ health and safety. The State will endeavor to retain all existing break rooms or rest areas unless the space becomes necessary for the conduct of State business. Operational needs permitting, the State shall endeavor to allow reasonable time for nurses to travel to break rooms when the facility layout prohibits a local rest area.
B.	Unit 17 employees may identify and request specific alternative locations which allow them to be removed from their daily routine and the work area for other nursing employees.
20.6	Meal Periods
A.	Except for employees who are assigned to a straight eight (8) hour shift, full-time employees will be allowed a meal period of not less than thirty (30) minutes nor more than sixty (60) minutes which shall be determined by the State.
B.	Meal periods shall not be counted as part of total hours worked except for those employees who are required by the State to perform assigned duties or remain at their work station during meal periods. When employees are required to work through their meal period, the State shall either adjust the employee's workweek schedule or credit the employee for the time worked.
20.7	Flexible Work Hours and Alternate Work Schedules
A.	Departments shall establish policies for flexible work hours and alternate work schedules for Unit 17 employees who desire to participate. It is understood, however, that all Unit 17 employees will comply with any sign-in procedures established by a department. Requests for participation in a flexible work hour or alternative work schedule program shall not be unreasonably denied.
At the request of the Union, the departments agree to schedule a meeting at each facility to discuss union proposals related to flexible hours and alternate work schedules, for level of care employees. Additional meetings may be scheduled with mutual agreement.
B.	"Flexible work hours" allow for the change of work schedules on a daily basis. An "alternate work schedule" is a fixed work schedule other than regular/standard work hours.
C.	A regular alternate work schedule shall not exceed twelve (12) hours per work day.
112
BU 17
03-04
D.	The affected employees shall be surveyed to determine the preferred work schedule. In the instance of a twelve (12) hour day work week schedule, the choice shall be between 6 o’clock to 6 o’clock and 7 o’clock to 7 o’clock. A simple majority vote shall determine which 12 hour schedule will prevail. The State may start the shift at thirty minutes to the hour. The survey shall be jointly conducted by the Union and the Department designee. A written tabulation of the results shall be submitted to the Union. Atascadero State Hospital may continue its twelve (12) hour day scheduling program on a pilot basis for the term of this Contract.
E.	Alternate work schedules include, but are not limited to four (4) consecutive ten (10) hour days (also known as "4 ten 40's) and ("9 eight 80's) with each week utilizing consecutive days.
F.	Any denial of requests made under this section shall be in writing. In addition, permanent changes or cancellations to flexible work hours, alternate work schedules or reduced work time schedules shall not be made without prior adequate notice of at least thirty (30) calendar days to affected employees.
20.8	Exchange Of Days Off
A.	Unit 17 employees shall be permitted to exchange hours of work with other employees in the same classification, performing the same type of duties within the same work area(s) provided:
1.	The exchange and repayment shall occur within ninety (90) calendar days from date of approval;
2.	The employees make a written request to their supervisor(s) at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the exchange;
3.	The supervisor(s) approves the exchange; and
4.	The employee(s) exchanging hours of work shall waive consideration for any additional compensation (e.g., overtime, holiday credit/pay, shift differential) which they would not have otherwise received.
B.	Employees who fail to adhere to the agreed upon conditions of their exchange shall be denied subsequent requests to exchange days off.
20.9	Change in Shift Assignment
A.	The State will provide Unit 17 employees with fifteen (15) calendar days advance notice of permanent shift changes when the change is made at other than the employee's request. Upon request, the department or its designee will provide the employee with a reason for the shift change. It is the intent of the State not to arbitrarily make temporary shift changes for punitive reasons or to avoid the payment of overtime.
113
BU 17
03-04
B.	Unit 17 employees wishing to change shifts within a facility or program, if employed in twenty-four (24) hour facility, shall submit a written request to the facility/program management or designee. When management determines that a vacancy on the requested shift is available to a Unit 17 employee, the supervisor shall consider employees with shift change requests based on the needs of the clients/patients/wards/students/inmates, seniority, employee skills and abilities, performance and attendance, staffing requirements, and needs of the facility.
C.	Unit 17 employees wishing to change shifts within the same ward or unit, if employed in a twenty-four (24) hour facility, shall submit a written request to the facility/program management or designee. When management determines that a vacancy on the requested shift is available to a Unit 17 employee, the supervisor shall consider employees with shift change requests based on the needs of the clients/patients/wards/students/inmates, seniority, performance and attendance, staffing requirements, and needs of the facility.
20.10	Overtime Scheduling (Excluding CDC and CYA)
A.	The Departments recognize and understand the importance of reducing overtime to Unit 17 employees. To this end, the Departments will make every effort to schedule staff in a manner that will reduce the need for mandatory overtime. Both parties agree that mandatory overtime is an undesirable method of providing staff coverage.
B.	There shall be no mandatory overtime on an employee’s RDO or pre-approved day off, except:
1.	In an emergency situation such as a natural disaster; or
2.	During a state of emergency declared by the State or federal authorities; or
3.	During an emergency situation declared by a Superintendent, Executive Director or designee; or
4.	During a severe internal emergency (e.g., an incident which necessitates assistance from an outside agency or a health care crisis); or
5.	When the employee’s shift relief does not report for work or gave less than two (2) hours notice of intent not to report for work, an employee may be mandated if no volunteer is available.
6.	When all other options have been exhausted.
C.	Except in cases of emergency or planned program activity employees shall not be required to:
1.	work more than six (6) mandatory overtime shifts of at least two (2) hours of duration in a month; or
2.	work in excess of sixteen (16) hours continuously in a forty-eight (48) hour period; or
3.	Work in excess of two (2) mandatory overtime shifts per work week.
114
BU 17
03-04
4.	When an employee is required to work twelve (12) to sixteen (16) hours that employee shall not be mandated to work overtime the next calendar day.
D.	Upon request, and where practical, the State shall, upon consultation with the Union, establish a system to request and utilize qualified volunteers to perform overtime work from within the appropriate work area(s). Through the establishment of such a system, the State will endeavor to reduce the amount of mandatory overtime and number of mandatory holdovers, distribute overtime fairly insofar as circumstances of health and safety permit, and provide employees notice of possible or actual overtime assignments. The State shall also consider the use of intermittents, in-house registries, or float pools.
E.	Before an employee is required to work mandatory overtime, every reasonable effort will be made to find an acceptable volunteer within the program where the employee works. Overtime shall first be offered to level-of-care employees for level-of-care overtime assignments before allowing other BU 17 classifications to work overtime.
F.	Upon request of an employee who has been on duty continuously for sixteen (16) hours, the employer shall have the option to:
a.	Allow the employee to take the next shift off on vacation, CTO, or Holiday credit as staffing permits.
b.	Adjust the employee’s shift starting time to provide a ten (10) hour break between shifts.
c.	Allow the employee to take two (2) hours off without pay at the start of the next shift to provide a ten (10) hour break. Management will take into account the employee’s preference.
G.	The Department of Veterans Affairs - Yountville agrees to meet with the Union regarding the mandatory overtime policy for the Veteran’s Home.
H.	The Department of Developmental Services:
a.	Facilities that utilize the “red dot-blue dot” system for assigning overtime will count time worked, as a result of either a red dot or blue dot assignment, toward the mandatory overtime limitations.
b.	At management’s discretion all RN’s at a facility may be included in the mandatory overtime distribution process.
20.11	Rescinding Approved Time Off
A.	Approval for the use of accrued compensating time off (CTO), holiday credit, personal holiday, or vacation/annual leave credits shall not be rescinded unless the State determines the employee's presence is necessary for coverage, workload, or the continuation of services. The State shall provide advance notice of such cancellation, whenever possible.
B.	When scheduled CTO, holiday time off or vacation/annual leave is rescinded the State shall give priority consideration to the employee's request to reschedule the rescinded time off.
115
BU 17
03-04
C.	If the employee suffers a financial loss from the cancellation of vacation/annual, holiday time off or CTO time approved in writing, the employee may submit a Board of Control claim for nonrefundable expenditures which can be verified. The department shall support the claim, whenever possible.
20.12	Floating
Floating of Unit 17 staff may be utilized to avoid and/or minimize mandatory overtime assignments. Those programs where it is determined that special client/patient care is required (e.g., SNF, ICU), Unit 17 employees will be provided appropriate orientation prior to the start of the assignment. Where necessary and practical, a mentoring assignment will be made. The facility will attempt to float between program/unit with similar client/patient needs.
Registered Nurses shall not be floated to replace a non-licensed function.
20.13	Set Up and Shut Down Time
Time deemed necessary by the State for Unit 17 employees to set up and shut down a State function shall be included in the work day of such an employee.
20.14	Mixed Shift Work Weeks
A.	A mixed shift work week is one in which an employee is regularly scheduled to work more than one (1) shift or watch in fulfilling his/her normal forty (40) hour work week schedule.
B.	Within thirty (30) days of receiving a written request from CSEA Local 1000, the State agrees to meet at the local worksite to discuss issues relating to the scheduling of mixed shift work weeks. At these local meetings, the parties shall seriously consider alternative scheduling methods for mixed shift work weeks as well as the following alternatives in lieu of full-time mixed shift work week assignments: using inhouse registries, outside registries and intermittent work. Up to three (3) representatives of the Union shall be released without loss of compensation for these meetings.
20.15	Travel Time
Notwithstanding any other contract provision, departmental policy or practice, the travel time of employees who are covered by Work Week Group 2 shall only be considered as time worked if it meets the definitions and requirements of travel time in Sections 785.34 through 785.41 of Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
20.16	Workweek Correctional Institutions
A.	Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, any Unit 17 employee desiring to work an alternate number of hours during the workweek (i.e., 12-hour shifts) will do so with the understanding that overtime shall be computed on a forty (40) hour work week. Hours worked in excess of the pay period due to an employee’s normal work schedule will be treated as excess hours.
116
BU 17

C.	A maximum of eight (8) hours shall be credited for each holiday and personal holiday earned.
20.17	Call Back Time
A.	An employee in Workweek Group 2 who has completed a normal work shift, when ordered back to work, shall be credited with a minimum of four (4) hours work time provided the call back to work is without having been notified prior to completion of the work shift, or the notification is prior to completion of the work shift and the work begins more than three (3) hours after the completion of the work shift.
B.	When such an employee is called back under these conditions within four (4) hours of the beginning of a previous call or an additional call is received while still working on an earlier call back, the employee shall not receive an additional four (4) hours credit for the new call back.
C.	When such an employee is called back within four (4) hours of the beginning of the employee's next shift, call back credit shall be received only for the hours remaining before the beginning of the employee's next shift.
D.	When staff meetings, training sessions, or work assignments are regularly scheduled on an employee's authorized day off, the employee shall receive call back compensation. When staff meetings and training sessions are regularly scheduled on an employee's normal work day and outside the employee's normal work shift, overtime compensation shall be received in accordance with the rules governing overtime.
20.18	Show Up Time
A.	The provisions of this section shall apply only to Unit 17 employees in Workweek Group 2.
B.	An employee who shows up for work at an assigned starting time and has not been notified by the employer prior to reporting not to so report, shall be guaranteed at least four (4) hours of work or shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hours at the employee's appropriate rate of pay.

E.	CTO credited as a result of standby shall not be considered time worked for purposes of qualifying for overtime.
20.20	Overtime Scheduling - California Youth Authority and California Department of Corrections
The California Youth Authority (CYA) and the California Department of Corrections (CDC) shall make every effort to reduce the amount of mandatory overtime and mandatory holdovers, distribute overtime fairly amongst employees of the same classification(s) and provide employees notice of possible or actual unanticipated overtime assignments at least ninety (90) minutes in advance. CDC and CYA Fire Camps shall be excluded from this section.
When an overtime assignment becomes available, either expected or unexpected, the CYA/CDC shall make every effort to fill the assignment by the use of the Voluntary Overtime Roster (VOR). The VOR shall consist of Bargaining Unit 17 (BU 17) nursing staff (by classification) who desire to work overtime. The VOR shall be supplied, at a minimum, once a month, listing all the known and anticipated overtime assignments. When the need arises to fill an overtime assignment and there are no names listed on the VOR, the supervisor shall attempt to fill through Permanent Intermittent Employees (PIE’s), Retired Annuitants, on duty full and part time BU 17 employees, and contract nursing registry, in this order. After these avenues have been exhausted, a BU 17 classification employee may be mandated to work overtime as outlined below.
Voluntary Overtime
A.	BU 17 classification employees shall be assigned voluntary overtime by Departmental seniority, on a rotational basis by classification. Seniority scores will be determined by counting one point for each month of full time qualifying service, i.e., from full time hire date, less any time off for unpaid leave, suspensions, etc. In the event of ties, total State service will be used to determine seniority scores.
118
BU 17
03-04
B.	The CYA/CDC shall establish lists of BU 17 employees by classification in seniority score order. BU 17 employees may sign up for voluntary overtime by adding their name to the VOR.
To ensure equitable volunteer overtime opportunity, BU 17 employees shall be provided an opportunity to choose a voluntary overtime slot once. Thereafter, all other BU 17 employees will be provided the same volunteer overtime opportunity once, assuring each BU 17 employee is provided an opportunity for one sign up before returning to the most senior employee and beginning the process again. (i.e., the rotation will again start at the top of the seniority list and work its' way down.)
C.	If a specific position was indicated for the voluntary request, and was changed or no longer needed, the nursing supervisor will make all reasonable attempts to notify the affected BU 17 employee. If the BU 17 employee arrives to find the position changed or no longer needed, the BU 17 employee shall not be required to work that position, but may be offered an alternate assignment. If no alternate assignment is available, the BU 17 employee may choose to leave.
D.	Once a BU 17 employee has signed up for a voluntary overtime, it is their responsibility to work that position, unless they have given the nursing supervisor, or their designee, 72 hours notice to enable the timely scheduling of a replacement.
E.	A BU 17 RN may “bump” a scheduled registry nurse at any time during the month, provided they give the nursing supervisor, or their designee, 72 hours notice to enable them to notify the Registry that they will not be needed for the affected position.
Involuntary Overtime
A.	BU 17 employees (by classification) shall be assigned involuntary overtime on a rotating basis by inverse seniority.
B.	Each facility shall establish and maintain an up-to-date list, by inverse seniority of all full and part time BU 17 employees (by classification). Staff shall only be assigned an involuntary slot once, until the entire list has been depleted.
C.	The State will attempt to refrain from assigning mandatory overtime on a BU 17 employee's regular day off (RDO). For the purpose of this section, an employee’s RDO begins immediately after completion of their normal shift before the RDO.
D.	It is not the State's intent to mandate BU 17 employees to work involuntary overtime in classifications other than their own. Consistent with that expressed intent, a BU 17 employee may only be mandated to work in another classification when all other appropriate and possible staffing efforts have been exhausted and it is operationally necessary. (This expressed intent, however, does not preclude BU 17 employees from volunteering to work overtime in classifications other than their own, when it is appropriate.)
E.	Management shall make every attempt to schedule BU 17 employees:
•	no more than five involuntary overtime shifts per month; or,
•	in excess of sixteen (16) hours continuously; or,
119
BU 17
03-04
in excess of two overtime shifts within an employee's scheduled work week; or, More than two consecutive calendar days.
F.	A mandated holdover of two (2) hours or more is considered a mandated overtime.
G.	While on vacation, pre-approved absence, or on full work day absence due to sick leave(*), union leave or state release time, or any other authorized absence from the facility, BU 17 employees will not be considered for mandatory overtime. Upon return to work, the BU 17 employee will return to the involuntary rotation in seniority order.
*This includes instances where an employee was unable to complete their regular shift due to illness and had to be released from duty to go home.
20.21 Report Preparation Time
In the 24 hour institutions there are numerous reports required by the hospital and/or licensing and/or JACHO accreditation, where applicable. Many of these reports can only be performed by the Unit 17 professional licensed staff. In the interest of allowing Unit 17 employees to do thorough and timely reports, their day shall take into consideration the time necessary to complete these reports.
ARTICLE 21	- POST AND BID
21.1	Post and Bid Procedure for Vacant Positions - DDS & DMH
A.	Vacant Positions
As management determines that Registered Nurse positions become available, or vacant, they shall first be reviewed by the State to determine whether they shall be posted or filled without posting.
If the State determines to fill the position without posting, the position may be filled by hire, transfer, promotion, or any other method allowed by the Civil Service System. Such positions may be advertised where appropriate, but will be filled through the sole discretion of the State. As positions become vacant and determinations are made by the State, the excess of non-posted positions over posted positions shall not exceed two (2) at any hospital or developmental center at any time. In no case shall more than sixty percent (60%) of the filled Registered Nurse positions in a hospital/developmental center be held by employees through successful bids.
The post and bid process is designed as a method to advertise and fill current position vacancies with existing employees. The filling of vacancies by either promotion from an eligible list or external lateral transfers is not subject to the post and bid procedure.
B.	Posted Positions
Those positions which are determined to be posted shall be posted in a prominent place where such notices are customarily posted on each unit and, in addition, may be advertised in each hospital's/developmental center's publication. The posted
120
BU 17
03-04
notice shall be on a form designed for that purpose and shall include the following posting criteria:
1.	Identification posting number
2.	Level of position
3.	Program and unit (or ward) or other assignment
4.	Shift
5.	Days off or rotation pattern and cycle
6.	Time base
7.	Deadline for bid submittal
8.	Indication of an "incentive bid position"
9.	Location where bid is to be submitted
Each notice shall remain posted for no less than seven (7) calendar days.
C.	Bidding
Employees may bid on the posted position by filling out a bid form provided by the State. Bid forms shall be submitted in triplicate with the employee submitting the original to the appropriate central office, a copy to the union, and the employee retaining a copy. Bid forms shall include the identification posting number, the employee's name, classification, seniority points, current work location and business telephone number. The form must be dated and signed by the employee to indicate certification that the worksite has been visited.
Posted positions shall be available for bid only to those employees in the civil service classification specified on the posted notice.
D.	Assignment
Within fifteen (15) calendar days after the posting of notice of vacancy, the position shall be assigned to the eligible bidding employee with the most seniority. However, in emergencies or where severe staffing shortages exist in the employee's incumbent program, assignment may be delayed up to sixty (60) calendar days after the posting of notice. If no bids are received, management shall withdraw the bid notice. The withdrawn notice does not count against either party's ratios or 60/40 position count. These positions may be filled:
1.	In accordance with Subsection A. above, or
2.	Hire, promotion, reinstatement, transfer from within the facility or from another State hospital/developmental center or other State agency.
If that position is filled or committed within sixty (60) days of withdrawal of posting under (2) above, it shall not count in the 50/50 posting ratios.
121
BU 17
03-04
E.	Incentive Bid Position
A vacant position that is posted two (2) consecutive times and remains unbid may be identified as an "incentive position" on the third consecutive posting. In a program identified as a "designated program" an unbid position may be identified as an incentive position on the second consecutive posting.
An employee who successfully bids an incentive position and remains in the position for one (1) year shall be accorded super-seniority for their next successful bid. When two (2) or more employees with super-seniority bid, the position shall be awarded as follows:
1.	Length of super-seniority
2.	Seniority
3.	By lot
Incentive positions that are not bid upon may be filled through internal transfer from within the hospital without counting in the posting ratios or position counts. He/she is then eligible to receive super-seniority in the same manner as an employee who bid the position. Employees who successfully bid an incentive position and are bidding in-place (same unit and shift as the posted position) shall not be eligible to earn the super-seniority. In "designated programs" the super-seniority eligibility shall be limited to positions awarded to employees from outside the program only.
The facility shall provide the union with a weekly listing of "designated programs."

21.3	Post and Bid Assignments by Seniority - CDC
A.	Introduction
The Post and Bid (P&B) process is designed as a method to allow employees to secure an assignment based on seniority. Contained in this section are the provisions for the “24 Month P&B Process” which allows employees to bid twenty four (24) month assignments and the “Interim Vacancy Bidding Process” which addresses vacancies that occur while the twenty four (24) month assignments are in effect.
1.	The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) or their designee shall have responsibility for implementation and maintenance of this procedure at each facility and shall ensure compliance.
2.	The word “assignment” as used in this section is synonymous with that of “position”.
3.	Participation in the P&B process is limited to eligible employees. An eligible employee:
a.	Must be a permanent full-time RN: probationary employees are excluded.
b.	Must be permanently assigned to and work at the institution. Eligible employees may participate only in their institution’s P&B process. There shall be no inter-institution bidding on assignments.
4.	Excluded Assignments
Specialty areas shall be excluded from the P&B process. Such areas shall be dialysis, PACU, ICU, utilization management, and surgical assignments. Those RN qualifying posts which are considered specialty areas shall be counted as neutral assignments, that is, they shall not be counted in either Management’s or Union’s positions.
5.	Special Qualifications
Employees bidding on assignments which require specialized training shall meet the skills, knowledge, and abilities prior to the bid being placed. These special qualifications shall be defined in the bid notice.
125
BU 17
03-04
6.	Seniority
For purposes of this Agreement, “seniority” is defined as one (1) point for each qualifying month of full-time Departmental Unit 17 service, with ties broken by one (1) point for each qualifying month of full-time State service.
7.	Limits on Bid
An employee may not make more than one (1) successful open assignment bid each twelve (12) months except when an employee’s bid assignment is substantially modified and the employee elects not to stay in the position or as provided in section “G1. and 2. or if an employee is granted a bid under the provisions of subsection “I”. If these occur, the employee shall have the right to bid again. Exceptions to this limitation may be granted.
B.	Twenty-four (24) Month Bid Process
1.	There shall be seventy percent (75%) of the RN qualifying post assignments (excluding specialty areas) in the California Department of Corrections (CDC) allotted according to seniority at each facility that provides healthcare that is not a licensed acute care hospital.
a)	At licensed acute care hospitals (CMF,CIM, CMC, COR) there shall be 80% of the RN qualifying post assignments (excluding specialty areas) allotted according to seniority.
b)	Any new seniority positions as a result of the increase in percentages of the total seniority shall be posted for bid within ninety (90) calendar days of the ratification of the Contract by both parties. The term for these positions will end at the same time as the institution's original post and bid period.
2.	Participation in the twenty-four (24) month P&B process is voluntary. The choice not to participate shall result in management assigning the individual to an assignment that remains unfilled after this bid process is completed.
3.	Timeframes
a.	The twenty-four (24) month bid cycle begins in the month of October 2002, for those employees who wish to participate. An updated seniority roster and a listing of all available assignments open for bid shall be posted no later than October 1st every other year.
b.	Unless otherwise contested by October 15, an employee’s seniority as posted on October 1, shall determine the employee’s placement on the seniority list.
c.	All approved bid request forms must be completed and submitted, in accordance with the BIDDING provision below, no later than 4 p.m. on November 1, or 4 p.m. on the following Monday if the date falls on the weekend. An employee may write more than one bid preference on the bidding form in priority order.
126
BU 17
03-04
d.	An employee may voluntarily withdraw from participation in the twenty-four (24) month Bid Process by submitting a written request to his/her supervisor. Employees who withdraw will be assigned at management’s discretion. These assignments shall be counted neutral; that is, they shall not be counted in either Management’s or Union’s positions.
e.	Failure on the part of the employee to submit a request form by 4 p.m. on November 1, shall result in a no preference indicated (NPI) for the employee. The employee will then be assigned an assignment at management’s discretion. These assignments shall be counted neutral; that is, they shall not be counted in either Management’s or Union’s positions.
f.	At the end of the bid period, management will make the assignments based on the highest seniority of the bidders. Any assignment that does not receive a bid shall be filled at management’s discretion.
g.	The new assignments will begin the second Monday in January first watch.
h.	The time frames will be agreed upon at the local level by the Union and Management.
C.	Interim Vacancy Bidding Process
1.	The interim bidding process is designed as a method to provide current employees the opportunity to move to vacant assignments, if Management determines to fill the vacant position, created while the twenty-four (24) month assignments are in place, using seniority as the deciding factor on who will secure an assignment that is available by bid. The vacant assignments that have been determined by Management to be filled by bid shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this section.
2.	As RN assignments become available, they shall first be reviewed by the State to determine whether they will be filled, posted for bid, or filled without posting.
3.	The filling of vacancies by either promotions from eligible list or external lateral transfers are not subject to P&B.
4.	If the State determines to fill the assignment without posting, the assignment may be filled by hire, transfer, promotion, or any other method allowed by the Civil Service System. Such assignments may be advertised where appropriate, but will be filled through the sole discretion of the State.
5.	The excess of non-posted assignments over posted assignments at each institution shall not exceed two (2) at any time. In no case shall more than seventy percent (70%) of the filled RN assignments (as defined above) be held by employees through successful bids.

1.	Establish, maintain and improve the standard of nursing practices;
2.	Function as a central group to assist in:
a.	maintaining competence in nursing practices;
b.	increasing the scope of practice of registered nurses by exposure to new skills, trends, and developments of practice within the profession; and

4.	Serve as a centralized group for receiving individual or group concerns pertaining to nursing and channeling this input for study, evaluation and consideration; and
5.	Improve communications between members of the profession, related treatment/health care disciplines, and management and supervisors regarding new trends and changes in nursing practices such as a result of legislation, science or new applications and interpretation of existing laws.
B.	It is the intent of the State to support the establishment of PPG’s on either a facility or regional basis. All Registered Nurses employed at a facility are members of the PPG. The size, composition, and frequency of meetings for registered nurse PPG's shall be determined by facility management, which may include multi-disciplinary Professional Practice Groups (PPG). Facilities which currently have multidisciplinary PPG’s may continue their inter-disciplinary PPG’s. These meetings shall be open. Subject to supervisory approval based on operational need and with reasonable advance notice, an employee shall be permitted to attend a PPG meeting. The process of selecting officers shall include an election of representative rank-and-file registered nurses and may also include direct appointments by management. Direct appointments by management may not exceed one-half of the total officers. Prior approval of agendas may be required. Each PPG may elect officers, publish agendas in advance and distribute their minutes and notice of meetings only within the facility. Each professional practice group shall prepare minutes and provide a copy to management. Upon request, facility management may review the minutes prior to distribution.
C.	Professional Practice Groups shall be able to use State facilities, clerical support and mail systems consistent with current practices, workload and other facility priorities. Registered Nurses participating in Professional Practice Groups shall suffer no loss of compensation and shall receive no overtime as a result of attendance at any Professional Practice Group meeting or assignments made by a Professional Practice Group.
D.	Professional Practice Groups may submit recommendations to facility management. Management shall acknowledge the receipt of the recommendations and respond on a case by case basis as determined by management. It is understood by both parties that effective two-way communications improve morale and productivity.
E.	No Professional Practice Group shall discuss any subject that falls within the mandatory or permissive scope of bargaining as it relates to wages, hours, working conditions, classification studies, or a subject of any grievance or complaint. PPG’s may, however, provide suggestions to appropriate department management on improvements to in-service training, and the appropriateness of uniform requirements. Professional Practices Groups are also appropriate forums to discuss issues such as appropriate trauma and crisis counseling for special situations, the need for hospice training where applicable and in accordance with job requirements. No Professional Practice Group communications, written or oral, may occur with any agency or organization other than the facility management without prior approval of the facility director or designee.

This section is not arbitrable; however, it may be grieved to the third (DPA) level.
23.10	Recruitment and Retention Committee

139	BU 17
03-04
and the Union shall agree to utilize the existing Labor/Management Committee format identified in Article 23.5 of this Agreement.
Upon request by the Union, the State agrees to convene meetings with the Union for the express agenda to examine the recruitment and retention of Registered Nurses.

BU 17
03-04
D.	Where operational considerations permit, departments shall consider implementing telework opportunities as a recruitment and retention strategy.
23.12	Contracting Out
A.	Purpose
The union has presented evidence that State departments are presently contracting out work appropriately done by Unit 17 employees, and that said contracting results in unnecessary additional costs to the State. Thus, the purpose of this section is to guarantee that the State does not incur unnecessary, additional costs by contracting out work appropriately performed at less expense to the State by Unit 17 employees, consistent with the terms of this section. In achieving this purpose the parties do not intend this section to expand the State’s ability to contract out for personal services. The parties agree that this section shall not be interpreted or applied in a manner which results in a disruption of services provided by state departments.
B.	Policy Regarding Personal Services Contracts and Cost Savings
Except in extremely unusual or urgent, time-limited circumstances, or under other circumstances where contracting out is recognized or required by law, Federal mandate, or court decisions/orders, the State must make every effort to hire, utilize and retain Unit 17 employees before resorting to the use of private contractors. Contracting may also occur for reasons other than cost savings as recognized or required by law, Federal mandate, or court decisions/orders.
C.	Information Regarding Contracts To Be Let
1.	Departments will provide CSEA’s designated representative with copies of Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and Invitations for Bid (IFBs) for personal services contracts when released for publication if they call for services found in Unit 17 class specifications.
2.	To the extent that a department is preparing to enter into a contract (or amend a contract) and it does not require an RFP or IFB, the department shall provide CSEA’s designated representative with a copy of the Standard Form 215 (or its departmental equivalent) if and when the Form 215 is completed provided the contract is/will be for services found in Unit 17 class specifications. If the Form 215 contains confidential or proprietary information, it shall be redacted as discussed below in subsection D(2).
3.	The purpose of this subsection (C) is to provide CSEA with notice and an opportunity to present alternatives which mitigate or avoid the need for contracting out, while still satisfying the needs of the State to provide services. Directors (or their designee) shall therefore meet with CSEA for this purpose, if requested by CSEA.
D.	Labor/Management Committee To Review Personal Service Contracts In Existence
141
BU 17
03-04
1.	A Unit 17 Joint labor/management committee shall be established. It shall consist of representatives of CSEA, the Department of Personnel Administration, the Department of Finance and affected departments. Half of the committee members shall be CSEA representatives. The first meeting of this committee shall occur no later than 10 working days from ratification of the MOU, and shall be for purposes of determining the procedures by which the committee will operate. An initial review of all currently existing contracts as requested by the committee shall be completed within six (6) months from ratification of this agreement. However, if this deadline cannot be met due to the number or complexity of existing contracts for review, the committee may mutually agree to extend this deadline.
2.	Upon request of the committee (or either party on the committee) each department shall submit copies of any or all personal services contracts that call for services found in Unit 17 class specifications. For each contract, departments shall provide additional documents establishing the number, scope, duration, justification, total costs of all such contracts, and payment of all overhead and administrative costs paid through each contract, provided it does not disclose confidential or proprietary information, in which case it shall be redacted as discussed below. The requested contract and related information shall be provided as soon as reasonably possible. The parties expect that this shall be provided no more than twenty one (21) calendar days following the request by the joint labor/management committee, or longer if approved by the committee. This shall include contracts that may otherwise be protected from public disclosure, if they provide for services found in Unit 17 class specifications. However, the State may redact those portions of protected contract(s) that are proprietary, necessary to protect the competitive nature of the bid process, and that which does not pertain to the costing of personnel services found in Unit 17 classes. The goal shall be to protect against disclosure of information which should remain confidential, while at the same time providing the committee with sufficient information to determine whether unnecessary, additional costs are being incurred by contracting out work found in Unit 17 class specifications. Costing information provided to the committee for protected contracts shall include total personnel costs for personnel services found in Unit 17 classifications plus any overhead charges paid to the contractor for these services, provided such disclosure does not breach confidentiality requirements or include proprietary information.
3.	Within ten (10) workdays after receipt of the personal service contracts and associated documents as provided for in paragraph D(2) above, the committee shall begin reviewing the contracts. The committee shall examine the contracts based on the purpose of this section, the terms of the contracts, all applicable laws, Federal mandates and court decisions/orders. In this regard, the committee will consider which contracts should and can be terminated immediately, which contracts will take additional time to terminate, which contracts may continue (for how long and under what conditions) and how (if necessary and cost effective) to transition contract employees or positions into civil service. All determinations shall be through express mutual agreement of the committee. Committee determinations regarding contracts let by the Department of Corrections shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in subsection F below.
142	BU 17
03-04
4.	The committee will continue to meet as necessary to examine personal services contracts which have been let.
5.	If savings are generated by the termination of personal service contracts under this provision, it is the intent of the State to implement findings of the committee for utilization of said savings. Such findings may include:
a.	Contributing toward position reductions which would otherwise be accomplished by the layoff, salary reduction or displacement of Unit 17 employees.
b.	Enabling the employment of Unit 17 employees for services currently performed by contractors;
c.	Enabling of the conversion to Unit 17 civil service employment of qualified contract employees who wish to become State employees, as otherwise permitted by law, regulations, provisions of the contracts and resolutions by the State Personnel Board.
d.	Providing timely, adequate and necessary recruitment efforts. These efforts may include focused recruitment, publicizing in professional journals, use of the media, job fairs, expedited hiring, expedited background checks, spot testing authorized by the SPB, State employee registries, and recruitment and retention incentives.
e.	Such other purposes as may be mutually agreed upon by the joint labor/management committee.
E.	Displacement Avoidance
1.	The objective of this subsection is to ensure that Unit 17 employees have preference over contract employees consistent with, but not limited to the following principles.
a.	The duties at issue are consistent with the Unit 17 employee’s classification;
b.	The Unit 17 employee is qualified to perform the job; and,
c.	There is no disruption in services.
143
BU 17
03-04
2.	To avoid or mitigate Unit 17 employee displacement for lack of work, the appointing power shall review all existing personal services contracts to determine if work consistent with the affected employee’s classification is being performed by a contractor. Displacement includes layoff, involuntary demotion, involuntary transfer to a new class, involuntary transfer to a new location requiring a change of residence, and time base reductions. If the joint labor/management committee that reviews personal services contracts determines that the terms and purpose of the contract permit the State to assign the work to a Unit 17 employee who would otherwise be displaced, this shall be implemented consistent with the other terms of this section. The State and the Unit 17 exclusive representative shall meet and confer for purposes of entering into an agreement about the means by which qualified employees are notified and provided with such assignments. This shall include developing a process that ensures that savings realized by terminating the contract and reassigning the work to a Unit 17 employee to avoid displacement, are utilized to offset that employee’s moving and relocation costs, the amount of which shall be consistent with Section 12.3 (Moving/Relocation) of the parties’ Unit 17 collective bargaining agreement.
144
BU 17
03-04
F.	Department of Corrections
1.	This section shall not be applicable to the Department of Corrections until such time as it has been approved by the Federal court special master(s). Nothing in this section shall be interpreted or applied in such a manner as to interfere with Federal court orders, the authority of the Federal court or the authority of the special masters.
2.	The Department of Corrections shall present this section to the special master(s) immediately in writing upon ratification of this agreement. The parties agree to make themselves immediately available to meet with the special master, on a schedule determined by the special master(s).
3.	No contract for services by the Department of Corrections shall be prohibited, modified, restricted or terminated by virtue of this memorandum of understanding or by operation of the joint labor management committee established by this memorandum of understanding without approval of the Special Masters in Madrid v. Alameida et al (as it pertains to contracts effecting Pelican Bay State Prison), and/or the Special Master in the Coleman litigation (as it pertains to contacts effecting Coleman class members) , and/or counsel for the parties in the Plata litigation or the Plata court (as it pertains to contracts effecting medical care for Plata class members).
4.	If this section is not approved by the special master the parties agree to reopen negotiations for the purpose of agreeing on an alternative contracting out provision, with the goal of satisfying the concerns of the Federal court and CSEA.
G.	Relationship Between This Section And Related Statutes
The State is mindful of the constitutional and statutory obligations (e.g., Govt. Code § 19130) as it pertains to restriction on contracting out. Thus, nothing in this section is intended to interfere with pursuit of remedies for violation of these obligations as provided by law (e.g., Public Contract Code § 10337).

6.	Subsidies will be deposited into dependent care reimbursement accounts on January 1, 2003, January 1, 2004 and January 1, 2005.
The Department of Personnel Administration shall administer the subsidy program.
Side Letter 5 - Personal Leave Program
Effective the pay period following ratification by the Legislature, the State shall implement a mandatory Personal Leave Program (PLP) for all unit employees. This program shall remain in effect until June 30, 2004. Afterwards, employees may voluntarily participate in the personal leave program on a continuing basis.
A.	Each full-time employee subject to paragraph b. shall be credited with eight (8) hours of Personal Leave on the first day of the following monthly pay period for each month in the Personal Leave Program.
B.	Salary ranges and rates shall be changed to reflect the July 1, 2003 general salary increase; however, each full-time employee shall continue to work his/her assigned work schedule and shall have a reduction in pay equal to 5%. In exchange 8 hours of leave will be credited to the employee's PLP monthly.
C.	Personal leave shall be requested and used by the employee in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Requests to use personal leave must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on vacation and annual leave. Personal leave shall not be included in the calculation of vacation/annual leave balances pursuant to Article8 (Leaves) and Sections 8.1 (Vacation Leave) and 8.2 (Annual Leave).
D.	At the discretion of the State, all or a portion of unused personal leave credits may be cashed out at the employee's salary rate at the time the personal leave payment is made. It is understood by both parties that the application of this cash out provision may differ from department to department and from employee to employee. Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for unused personal leave credits in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Cash out or lump sum payment for any Personal Leave credits shall not be considered as "compensation" for purposes of retirement. If funds become available, as determined by the Department of Finance, for the Personal Leave program, departments will offer employees the opportunity to cash out accrued personal leave. Upon retirement/separation, the cash value of the employees personal leave balance may be transferred into a State of California, Department of Personnel Administration Deferred Compensation Program as permitted by federal and state law.
E.	An employee may not use any kind of paid leave such as sick leave, vacation, or holiday time to avoid a reduction in pay resulting from the Personal Leave Program.
F.	A State employee in the Personal Leave program shall be entitled to the same level of State employer contributions for health, vision, dental, flex-elect cash option, and enhanced survivor's benefits he or she would have received had the Personal Leave program not occurred.
G.	The Personal Leave program shall not cause a break in State service, a reduction in the employee's accumulation of service credit for the purposes of seniority and retirement, leave accumulation, or a merit salary adjustment.
151	BU 17
03-04
H.	The Personal Leave program shall neither affect the employee's final compensation used in calculating State retirement benefits nor reduce the level of State death or disability benefits the employee would otherwise receive or be entitled to receive nor shall it affect the employee's ability to supplement those benefits with paid leave.
I.	Part-time employees shall be subject to the same conditions as stated above, on a prorated basis.
J.	The Personal Leave Program for intermittent employees shall be prorated based upon the number of hours worked in the monthly pay period.
K.	The Personal Leave program shall be administered consistent with the existing payroll system and the policies and practices of the State Controller's Office.
L.	Employees on EIDL, NDI, IDL, or Worker's Compensation for the entire monthly pay period shall be excluded from the Personal Leave Program for that month.
Side Letter 6 - Reduction of Employee PERS Contribution-Miscellaneous
If the Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) informs the parties in writing that it has determined that the recent temporary arrangement whereby state employees were relieved of paying into their retirement fund may be extended for 12 months and that such an extension would be fiduciarily sound and meet the Board’s established actuarial standards, which in turn provides temporary cash flow relief to the State, the parties will agree to the following:
1.	Effective the first of the pay period following approval by the CalPERS Board and ratification of the legislature and continuing for the duration of the contract, June 30, 2004, the State agrees to the following:
•	Employees who are Miscellaneous members under the Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), shall have their employee retirement contribution rate reduced from 5.0% of monthly compensation in excess of five hundred and thirteen ($513) dollars each month to 0.0% of compensation in excess of five hundred and thirteen ($513) dollars each month.
•	Employees who are Miscellaneous members under the Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) and not subject to Social Security, shall have their employee retirement contribution rate reduced from 5.0% of monthly compensation in excess of five hundred and thirteen ($513) dollars each month to 0.0% of compensation in excess of five hundred and thirteen ($513) dollars each month.
2.	After 12 months, the employee’s retirement contribution rate shall be restored to levels in effect on August 30, 2001.
152
BU 17
03-04
3.	The State employer will continue to ensure that pension benefits are properly funded in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices. In accordance with the provisions of the June 20, 2001 communication to DPA from CalPERS’ Actuarial & Employer Services Division, effective the date referenced in paragraph 1 above, the State Employer’s CalPERS retirement contribution rate shall incorporate the impact resulting from the temporary reduction in the employee retirement contribution rate. As indicated in the above referenced letter, “10% of the net unamortized actuarial loss shall be amortized each year.” However, if the CalPERS Board of Administration alters the amortization schedule referenced above in a manner that accelerates the employer payment obligation, either party to this agreement may declare this section of the Contract, and all obligations set forth herein, to be null and void. In the event this Contract becomes null and void, the employee retirement contribution rate shall be restored to levels in effect on August 30, 2001 and the parties shall be obligated to immediately meet and confer in good faith to discuss alternative provisions.

Side Letter 7 -Mitigation
Section 4.10 of the Budget Act recognizes that the Budget Bill approved by the Senate does not provide funds for employee compensation increases that may become effective during the 2003-04 fiscal year, and grants the Director of Finance authority to reduce and reallocate appropriations in the Budget Act in order to ensure the integrity of the 2003 Budget.
The savings achieved in employee compensation for fiscal year (FY) 03/04 that have been agreed to by the parties shall first be applied to mitigate layoffs during FY 03/04 for Bargaining Unit 17, consistent with the provisions of Section 4.10 of the Budget Act of 2003.
In applying these savings, the following principles will govern: (a) it is understood that these savings will not be applied to any program reductions beyond the requirements of Section 4.10 and (b) the union understands that this provision does not obligate the employer to retain any position that is not supported by the work to be done or the organizational structure of the affected State agency.
Side Letter 8 - Monthly Recruitment and Retention Differential to be Added to Base Pay
Upon ratification of the entire Agreement by both parties, the Department of Personnel Administration and the Union will meet to review monthly Recruitment and Retention (R&Rs) Differentials of Unit 17 employees to determine in which classifications monthly R&Rs, or a portion thereof, can be added to the base salary. The resulting salary adjustment (s) will be effective July 1, 2003.

Side Letter 10 Organ Donation
Effective January 1, 2003, AB 1825 provides that employees who donate organs or bone marrow are eligible for paid leave. The following leave is extended to those employees who become an organ or bone marrow donor:
1.	Employees who donate an organ(s) to another person shall be eligible for up to 30 workdays of paid leave (Donor Leave) in any one year period. Employees who donate bone marrow to another person shall be eligible for up to five work days of paid leave (Donor Leave) in any one year period.
2.	The one-year period is the 12-month period measured forward from the date an employee’s first leave begins.
3.	The one-year period for an organ donor is separate from the one year period for bone marrow donation.
4.	An employee must first exhaust all sick leave balance to qualify for Donor Leave.
5.	Employees without a sick leave balance, including employees in the annual leave program, are immediately eligible for paid leave (Donor Leave).
6.	Employees must provide written verification to the appointing power that a medical necessity exists for the donation.
7.	Donor Leave taken for donations is not a break in continuous service, relative to salary adjustments, leave accrual, or seniority normally accrued on paid leave.
8.	Employees wishing to become a donor may be required to undergo medical, psychological or other tests. Absences for such purposes must be requested in advance in the same manner as required to use sick or annual leave. The time an employee is approved to be absent for such purposes shall be deducted from the employee’s accrued leave balance.
9.	If the donor employee is temporarily unable to return to work after exhausting Donor Leave, the employee may, subject to medical verification, use any paid or unpaid leave available to the employee until able to return to work. Such leave may include, but is not limited to, sick, vacation, annual, personal, CTO, Family Medical, catastrophic, NDI, and medical leave.
10.	If the donor employee is permanently unable to return to work following the donation, the employee will be separated and paid for any leave balances including but not limited to vacation, annual leave and/or CTO current balances. The payment for such balances shall be computed by projecting the accumulated time on a calendar basis as though the employee were taking time off. If during the period of projection, the employee is able to return to work, the employee will have a mandatory right to be reinstated to his/her former position.

Appendix E - FLSA Exempt Employee Differential
FLSA EXEMPT EMPLOYEE DIFFERENTIAL FOR EXTREMELY ARDUOUS WORK AND EMERGENCIES
Effective: 9/1/93
Revised: 7/1/99
CRITERIA
At the discretion of the appointing authority, excluded employees who are exempt from the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) shall be eligible to receive the differential when performing arduous work that exceeds the normal demands of State service employment. Excluded employees are eligible for this pay differential for up to four months per fiscal year (or per event for emergencies involving loss of life or property). All of the following conditions must be met in order to apply this pay differential:
Appropriate Duties
The duties and responsibilities may not include work that is covered by the provisions of FLSA.
Non-negotiable Deadline or Extreme Urgency
The work must have a deadline or completion date that cannot be controlled by the employee or his/her supervisor, or must constitute an extreme urgency. The deadline or extreme urgency must impose upon the employee an immediate and urgent demand for his/her work that cannot be avoided or mitigated by planning, rescheduling, postponement or rearrangement of work, or modification of deadline.
For example, preparing and presenting to the Governor’s Office, Legislature, or Legislative Committees fiscal/line item analysis and budgetary information concerning the State Budget or departmental and line program budgets by a specific date, or testifying before the Legislature or Legislative Committees at their request, or responding to a declared emergency situation.
Work Exceeds Normal Work Hours and Normal Productivity
The work must be extraordinarily demanding and time consuming, and of a nature that it significantly exceeds the normal workweek and work productivity expectations of the employee’s work assignment.
Employees who are excluded from FLSA are expected to work variable work schedules as necessary to meet the demands of the job. They may regularly be required to work more than 40 hours per week to complete their work. This pay differential is not intended for employees who regularly or occasionally work in excess of the normal workweek to meet normal workload demands. It is intended where in addition to working a significant number of hours in excess of the normal workweek, there is a demand for and achievement of greater productivity or result.
Work is Unavoidable
The work must be of a nature that it cannot be postponed, redistributed, modified, reassigned or otherwise changed in any way to provide relief.
210
BU 17
03-04
Work Involves Extremely Heavy Workload
The work is of a nature that it cannot be organized or planned to enable time off in exchange for the extra hours worked. The absence from work would cause difficulty or hardship on others and would result in other critical work not being completed. Occasional heavy workload of less than 12 to 14 days in duration would not normally satisfy this requirement because time off can be arranged as compensation for this demand.
For example, in an emergency involving extreme health, safety and/or cost consequence, an employee may be required to work evenings and weekends for several weeks, averaging more hours of work than can be scheduled/arranged for time off.
No Other Compensation
The employee who is receiving this pay differential is not eligible for any other additional compensation for the type and nature of the above described work.
The Circumstances That Support This Pay Differential Must Be Documented
Departments must maintain records of the employees and amounts paid in each pay period, and a brief description of the circumstances for which the differential was provided.
Departments are delegated responsibility for the review and approval of payment. Their review should occur after the work is completed to ensure that all of the conditions that warrant the pay differential were present. Application of the pay differential provisions is subject to audit or review by the Department of Personnel Administration (DPA) as necessary.
RATE	
$300.00 per workweek, up to $1200 total per pay period. Any workweek that overlaps months should be counted in the month that the workweek ends.	
An employee may be paid: period	$ 300 $ 600 $ 900 or $ 1200 per pay
