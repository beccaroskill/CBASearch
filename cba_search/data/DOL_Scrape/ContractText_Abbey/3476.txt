MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING	j
BY AND BETWEEN	:
PIERCE COUNTY	’"
AND
PROFESSIONAL & TECHNICAL EMPLOYEES LOCAL 17 - ENGINEERS UNIT
RE: 2012 Health and Welfare Insurance (Medical/Dental/Vision/Life)
This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is entered into by and between Pierce County (County) and the Professional & Technical Employees (PTE), Local 17 - Engineers Unit (Union), referred to herein collectively as the Parties.
As a result of collective bargaining for a successor agreement for 2012, the parties have agreed to the following:
1)	For the 2012 calendar year, employees will not receive a general across-the-board COLA.
2)	Effective January 1, 2012 and for the 2012 calendar year, the County will pay up to the first 10% increase of the total monthly premium for each medical/vision insurance plan. Any increase above 10% will be split fifty-fifty between the employer and the employee.
For example, if the increase for medical/vision is 8%, the County will pick up the full increase (to a maximum of 8%). If the increase is 10.5%, the County will pick up the first 10% and the County and the employee will split the remaining 0.5%. If the increase is 11.9%, the County will pay the first 10%, and the County and the employee will split the remaining 1.9%.
Following are examples to illustrate how this would apply:
The 2011 total monthly premium for the Teamsters Trust Medical Plan A with vision is currently $1054.75. If this premium increases 10%, from $1054.75 to $1160.23, the County will pick up the full increase of $105.48 per month and the employee will continue to pay their current monthly contribution of $64.87. If the total monthly premium for the Teamsters Trust Medical Plan A with vision increases 11.9%, to $1180.27, the County will pick up the first 10% of the increase ($ 105.48), the Employee will pick up half of the remaining 1.9% ($ 10.02) and the County will pick up half of the remaining 1.9% ($10.02). Therefore, the County would pay $1105.38 per month and employee’s new contribution would be $74.89 per month.
For Group Health Cooperative with vision through Teamsters Trust, the 2011 premium is currently $1022.52 per month. If the premium increases 8%, to $1104.32, the County will pick up the 8% increase of $81.80. Therefore, the County contribution in 2012 would be $1071.68 and the employee contribution would remain $32.64. If the premium increase is 11.9%, to $1144.20, the County will pick up the first 10% of the increase ($102.25), the Employee will pick up half of the remaining 1.9% ($9.71) and the County will pick up the remaining half of 1.9% ($9.72). Therefore, the County would pay $1101.85 and the employee would contribute $42.35.
3)	For the 2012 calendar year, the County will continue to maintain the current level of dental and life insurance coverage and will pay 100% of the premiums associated with each.

5)	All employee premium contributions will continue to be deemed authorized and made through automatic payroll deduction.
