1.2	The State and the Union further agree that should a classification or reclassification alter or convert present job titles within the City of New York herein specified or create new positions performing essentially similar work within the City of New York, then the Union shall continue to be recognized as the exclusive collective negotiating representative for any employees employed in such new titles and/or positions.
ARTICLE 2
STATEMENT OF POLICY AND PURPOSE
2.1	It is the policy of the State to continue harmonious and cooperative relationships with its employees and to insure the orderly and uninterrupted operations of government. This policy is effectuated by the provisions of the Public Employees' Fair Employment Act granting public

(b)	The number and location of bulletin boards, as well as arrangements with reference to placing material thereon and removing material therefrom, shall be subject to mutual understandings, provided, however, that any material reasonably objected to by the State shall be removed, which removal may be contested pursuant to the contract grievance procedure provided for herein.

4.6	Job Descriptions. The State agrees to furnish the Union copies of reclassified job descriptions and amendments to the reclassification plan in advance of promulgation.
4.7	Employee Organization Leave.
(a)	The Union shall designate at least quarterly, in writing, those employees who are authorized to take employee organization leave. The Chief of Employee Relations shall establish uniform procedures regarding the maintenance and submission of monthly reports of employee organization leave.
(b)	Individuals duly designated by the Union shall be permitted to perform the following functions without loss of pay or other employee benefits, except as limited by Section 4.7(d):

(2)	To participate in meetings of the Labor/Management Committee and the Labor/Management Health and Safety Subcommittee.
(3)	To meet or confer with the Chief Administrative Judge of the Courts or any of his/her representatives on matters affecting labor/management relations, where such meetings or conferences have been previously approved by the Chief Administrative Judge.

procedures.
(5)	To confer with and/or appear before PERB, Department of Audit and Control, New York State Employees’ Retirement System, and the Civil Service Commission on matters which may have any effect on labor/management relations.

(7)	To attend award, honor, graduating and promotional ceremonies as employee representatives, provided that no more than ten workdays in any calendar year are used for such purposes.
(8)	To attend funerals and memorial services for employees who are killed in the line of duty (officers of the Union and an honor guard and such others as the Chief of Employee Relations may approve).
(9)	To engage in any other activity which may be approved by the Chief of Employee Relations consistent with the conduct of labor/management relations.
(10)	To attend meetings as a trustee of Union Welfare Funds, up to four such meetings per year.
(11)	No more than eight employees will be granted up to five days plus travel time in any calendar year for the purpose of attending Union conferences, seminars or work shops, and to appear before and confer with members of the Legislature. Travel time shall mean actual and necessary travel time not to exceed five hours each way.
-5-
(12)	Conferences with counsel to prepare for trial or a hearing or attendance as a witness in an action commenced by or against the Union concerning a claimed violation or the interpretation of this Agreement or a reclassification of employees.

(d)	Individuals duly designated and authorized in writing by the Union shall be granted employee organization leave for time actually spent performing appropriate employee relations functions as specified in Section 4.7(b) provided that such time shall not exceed 5.5 hours per represented employee per year and, provided further, that unused time shall be carried over from one fiscal year to the next for the term of the Agreement. If employee organization leave is utilized beyond such amount, the Union shall have 30 days to determine whether to repay such amount to the State in cash as provided below or through a charge to the accrued annual leave credits or compensatory time credits of the employee who was absent from work performing such appropriate employee relations functions. Provided, however, that if an employee does not have sufficient annual leave or compensatory time credits to cover such absence from work, appropriate deductions shall be taken from subsequent paychecks. Provided further, however, that if the Union chooses to reimburse the State in cash for such excess time used, such payment shall be based on the hourly rate of the individual for whom such reimbursement is made. Such reimbursement by the Union shall be
-6-
made within 30 days after the State has notified the Union by certified mail that a deficit exists. If the Union fails to make such cash payment within 30 days and the Union has not notified the State that a dispute exists concerning the amount of employee organization leave due and owing, the State shall make an appropriate deduction from the affected employee's leave credits or subsequent paychecks. The hourly rate shall be determined by dividing an employee’s basic annual salary plus any additional compensation payable because of hours of work or location by 1,827. If the Union notifies the State within 30 days that a dispute exists concerning the amount of employee organization leave due and owing, then the Union must simultaneously notify the State whether it chooses to place the disputed amount of cash or leave credits in escrow pending resolution of the dispute by arbitration pursuant to Article 15 of the Agreement. The Union may elect to place a certified check for the full disputed amount in an escrow account which the State selects. If the Union does not make a timely election when it notifies the State within 30 days of notification of the overage of a dispute, the State will automatically freeze the disputed amount of leave credits of affected employees. Such leave credits cannot be used by affected employees while frozen and such (eave credits will not be released until there is a final resolution of the dispute.
In scheduling the use of employee organization leave time for such appropriate employee relations functions, the State shall use its best efforts to accommodate authorized requests for employee organization leave.

(c)	An employee absent on sick leave shall notify his/her supervisor of such absence and the reason therefor on the day of such absence and within ninety minutes after the beginning of his/her workday; provided, however, that an employee assigned to a night shift must report his/her absence at least two hours prior to the beginning of the employee’s shift or where any other work is such that a substitute may be required the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) or his/her designee may require earlier notification, but not earlier than two hours prior to the beginning of the employee’s workday. The Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) or his/her designee shall waive such notice requirements where he/she has determined that a medical
-20-
emergency existed which prevented the employee from complying with such notice requirements. Sick leave accruals shall be used in units of not less than 15 minutes.
(d)	Before absence for personal illness may be charged against accumulated sick leave credits, the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) or his/her designee may require such proof of illness as may be satisfactory to him/her, provided, however, the State will not routinely require proof of illness for absences of three days or less. Abuse of sick leave shall be cause for disciplinary action.
(e)	The Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) or his/her designee may require any employee who has been absent because of personal illness, prior to and as a condition of his/her return to duty, to be examined at the expense of the State by a physician designated by the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge for Management Support or his/her designee from a mutually acceptable panel of physicians to establish that he/she is not disabled from the performance of his/her normal duties and that his/her return to duty will not jeopardize the health of other employees.
(f)	In addition to personal illness of an employee, personal visits to a doctor, dentist, or other medical practitioner by the employee when approved in advance when practicable by the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) or his/her designee may be charged against accumulated sick leave credits.

(g)	When an employee is transferred or reassigned, his/her accumulated sick leave credits shall be transferred with him/her. When an employee is separated from service, for other than disciplinary reasons, and is subsequently reinstated or reemployed within one year after such separation, or is reinstated by action of the Chief Administrative Judge, or is reinstated or
-21-
reemployed while eligible for reinstatement from a preferred list, his/her sick leave credits accumulated and unused at the time of his/her separation shall be restored.
(h)The Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) or his/her designee may, in his/her discretion, advance sick leave credits to an employee absent due to personal illness who has exhausted his/her accumulated sick leave, annual leave and overtime credits. Such advance sick leave credits shall be repaid, as soon as practicable after the employee’s return to duty, from subsequent accumulations of time credits. The outstanding unrepaid sick leave credits advanced to any employee under the provisions of this section shall not at any time exceed the amount eamable in one year of service unless further extended by the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) or his/her designee. Upon termination of the employee’s services, any such advanced sick leave not offset by subsequent accumulations of sick leave, annual leave and overtime credits, shall be deducted from the salary or wages due the employee.
(i)	Charges to an employee’s annual leave shall be changed to a charge to sick leave during a period of verified hospitalization. An employee may request that a charge to annual leave be changed to a charge to sick leave during a period of documented verified illness. Such request shall be submitted to the Chief of Employee Relations or his/her designee for final determination.
(j)	The Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) or his/her designee may, in his/her discretion, grant sick leave at half-pay for personal illness to an employee having not less than one year of service, provided all of his/her sick leave, annual leave, compensatory time and overtime credits have been exhausted. Provided, however, that the cumulative total of all sick leave at half-pay granted to any employee during his/her service shall not exceed one pay period for each
-22-
completed six months of service. Any such sick leave at half-pay granted shall be from the present position. Hourly paid or per diem employees shall not be eligible for this benefit.
An employee requesting sick leave at half-pay shall submit his/her request for such sick leave benefit to the Chief Clerk on forms to be established by the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge for Management Support. A decision shall be made within 15 days after the request is properly submitted. In the event a request for sick leave at half-pay is rejected, written notice of such rejection shall be sent to the employee and a copy to the employee’s Union.
Any such sick leave at half-pay granted pursuant to this section shall be repaid, as soon as practicable after the employee’s return to duty, from subsequent accumulations of sick leave and compensatory time credits at the full rate of accumulation and annual leave credits at one-half the rate of accumulation. Upon termination of the employee’s services as a result of resignation, retirement or involuntary separation (other than by reason of death), any such sick leave at half-pay not offset by subsequent accumulations of sick leave, annual leave, compensatory time credits and overtime credits, shall be deducted from the salary or wages due the employee including, but not limited to, payments for terminal leave or lag payroll, but only to the extent that such payments are due the employee.
This section shall not be construed to require extension of any employment beyond the time at which it would otherwise terminate by operation of law, rule or regulation.
(k)	Incapacitated Employees.
(1)	When there is reason to believe that an employee to whom the disciplinary procedures contained in the Rules of the Chief Judge apply is physically and/or mentally disabled from performing the duties of his/her position, the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City
-23-
Courts) may require such employee to undergo a physical and/or psychiatric examination at the expense of the State, to be conducted by a medical officer selected by the Chief Administrative Judge of the Courts or his/her designee, to establish whether he/she is able to perform the full duties of his/her position and/or whether his/her continued presence on the job will jeopardize the health and safety of himself/herself or other employees.
(2)	Where the continued presence of an employee on the job represents a potential danger to persons or property or would significantly interfere with operations, the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) may place such employee on an involuntary leave of absence with pay immediately. After service of written notice pursuant to Section 9.3(k)(6)(a), and notwithstanding Section 9.3(k)(6)(b), such employee may be placed on leave without pay for no more than 30 days. During such period of leave, the employee shall be entitled to draw accumulated and unused sick leave, annual leave, compensatory time and overtime standing to his/her credit. Such employee thereafter may be continued on an involuntary leave of absence with pay notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.3(k)(6)(b). If such employee is finally determined to be physically and mentally fit to perform the duties of his/her position, he/she shall be restored to his/her position and shall have any leave credits or salary that he/she may have lost because of such involuntary leave of absence restored to him, less any compensation he/she may have earned in other employment or occupation and any unemployment benefits he/she may have received during such period.
(3)	An employee who is temporarily disabled from performing the full duties of his/her position may, as far as practicable, be assigned to in-title and related duties in the same title during the period of the employee's disability. If a suitable position is not available, the State may offer the employee any available opportunity for appointment to another title for which the employee is
-24-
qualified pursuant to applicable rules of the Chief Administrative Judge. If no suitable position is available, and there is no offer of appointment to another title, or the employee refuses such offer, such employee shall be placed on leave if he/she provides a doctor’s certificate containing a prognosis that the employee will be able to return to work within one year. Such leave shall be for not less than one year, unless the employee is capable of returning to work sooner. The total period of leave shall include any time charged to workers’compensation leave pursuant to Section 9.4(d)( 1) of the Agreement and any earned and accumulated sick leave, annual leave, compensatory time and overtime credits standing to the employee’s credit and such leave without pay as may be necessary to complete one year of leave. Such leave shall be in addition to and shall not be reduced by any time charged to workers’ compensation leave pursuant to Section 9.4(d)(2) (assault leave) of the Agreement. Effective April 1,1986, an employee who draws his/her accumulated leave credits under Section 9.3(k)(3) shall cease to earn and accrue sick and annual leave credits during that period. An employee placed on leave pursuant to this subsection who is not reinstated on or before the date that such leave is exhausted, may be terminated by the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) and his/ her position may be filled by a permanent appointment.
(4)	When an employee who is not permanently incapacitated from performing the duties of his/her position has been absent from and unable to perform the duties of his/her position by reason of sickness or disability not caused by an assault arising out of and in the course of the employee’s employment either for a consecutive period of one year or more or for a cumulative total of 250 workdays or more within a period of 24 consecutive calendar months and who reasonably cannot be expected to be able to resume performing his/her duties on a full-time basis shortly thereafter,
-25-
his/her employment status may be terminated by the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) and his/ her position may be filled by a permanent appointment.
(5)	This section shall not be construed to require extension of any employment beyond the time at which it would otherwise terminate by operation of law, rule or regulation.
(6)(a) Absent exceptional circumstances, prior to being placed on leave pursuant to Section 9.3(k)(2) or Section 9.3(k)(3) or terminated pursuant to Section 9.3(k)(4), or, under exceptional circumstances, as soon thereafter as reasonably possible, an employee shall be provided with written notice thereof, including written notice of the facts relied on therefor and written notice of the employee’s right to appeal the determination and of the procedures for perfecting such appeal. Such notice shall be served in person or by first class, registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, upon the employee and the Union. If such person elects to appeal, he/she shall file a written request for a hearing with the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) within ten workdays from service of the notice of the determination to be reviewed. The request for such hearing shall be filed by the employee personally or by first class, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
(b)	Upon receipt of such request, the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) shall supply to the employee or his/her personal physician or authorized representative, copies of all diagnoses, test results, observations and other data supporting the determination, and imposition of the leave or termination shall be held in abeyance until a final determination is made by the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) as provided in Section 9.3(k)(6)(c).
-26-
(c)	A hearing shall be held by a hearing officer designated for that purpose by the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts). The hearing officer shall be vested with all the powers of the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts), and shall make a record of the hearing which shall, with his/her recommendation, be referred to the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) for review and decision and which shall be provided to the employee free of charge. The employee shall, upon request, receive a copy of the transcript of the hearing without charge. The employee may be represented at the hearing by counsel or a representative of the Union and may present medical experts and other witnesses or evidence. The burden of proving mental or physical unfitness shall be upon the State. Compliance with technical rules of evidence shall not be required. The Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) will render a final determination and may either uphold the original notice of leave of absence, withdraw such notice or modify the notice as appropriate. A final determination of an employee’s request for review shall contain notice to the employee of his/her right to appeal from such determination and of the procedures for perfecting such appeal.
(d)	If such person elects to appeal, he/she shall make application to the Chief Administrative Judge of the Courts. Such employee shall be afforded an opportunity to present facts and arguments, including medical evidence, in support of his/her position at a time and place and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Chief Administrative Judge of the Courts. The reviewing authority shall make his/her determination on the basis of the medical records and such facts and arguments as are presented.
(7)	An employee on leave pursuant to Section 9.3(k)(2) or Section 9.3(k)(3) may, within one year of the commencement of such leave, make application to the Deputy Chief Administrative
-27-
Judge (New York City Courts) for a medical examination to be conducted by a medical officer selected for that purpose by the Chief Administrative Judge of the Courts or his/her designee. An employee whose employment status has been terminated pursuant to Section 9.3(k)(3) or Section 9.3(k)(4), may, within one year after the termination of his/her disability, make application to the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge (New York City Courts) for a medical examination to be conducted by a medical officer selected for that purpose by the Chief Administrative Judge of the Courts or his/her designee. If, upon such medical examination, the medical officer shall certify that such person is physically and mentally fit to perform the duties of his/her former position, he/she shall be reinstated to the former position, if vacant, or to a vacancy in a similar position or a position in a lower title in the same occupational field in his/her former promotion unit. If no appropriate vacancy shall exist to which such reinstatement may be made, or if the work load does not warrant the filling of such vacancy, the name of such person shall be placed on a preferred list for his/her former position in his/her former promotion unit, and he/she shall be eligible for reinstatement in such former promotion unit from such preferred list for a period of four years. In the event that such person is reinstated in a position in a title lower than that of his/her former position, his/her name shall be placed on the preferred eligible list for the former position or any similar position in such former promotion unit.
(8)	This section shall not be deemed to modify or supersede any other provisions of law applicable to the reemployment of persons retired from the public service on account of disability.
(9)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, when an employee’s disability permanently incapacitates him/her from performing the duties of his/her position, his/her employment status may be terminated and his/her position may be filled by a permanent
-28-
appointment. Such employees shall be entitled to due process and hearing as enumerated in Section 9.3(k).

An employee will continue to earn and accrue annual and sick leave credits while utilizing assigned credits under this section.
(3)	Any assigned sick leave credits not used by an employee prior to his/her first return to duty shall not be restored to those employees who made the donations, but shall be retained by the employee-recipient for his/her use. In the event the employee-recipient separates from service, such donated credits shall become property of the State.
(4)	Upon separation from State service for reasons other than retirement, and notwithstanding the minimum balance requirements set forth in Subsection (1) above, an employee may elect to donate all of his/her accrued and unused sick leave accruals to any nonjudicial employee eligible to receive such donations or to the Sick Leave Bank if established pursuant to Section 9.3(m) of the
