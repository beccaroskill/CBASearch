Section A.	Bargaining Committee
The Association may appoint a bargaining committee to represent the bargaining unit in all formal negotiations and/or discussions with the City representatives, but not more than three bargaining unit members will be in pay status during negotiations.
Section B.	Stewards
To provide employees with reasonable access to Union representation, the Union may appoint certain employees to serve in the capacity of steward. Said steward may receive, investigate and process complaints or grievances of employees.
2
City of Des Moines and
Des Moines Police Gold Braid Organization
July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2024
Whenever a steward enters a work area for the purpose of investigating a complaint or grievance, the supervisor of that area must be so notified and informed of the nature of the problem.
Stewards shall suffer no loss of their regular pay for the normal work shift when properly excused by the supervisor. However, such time spent investigating grievances shall be kept reasonable and commensurate with the circumstances with the matter at issue. Normally, such time will not exceed one-half (1/2) hour at the first or second step of the grievance procedure and will normally require the attention of only one (1) steward.
Section C.	Designation
The total number of stewards shall not exceed three (3) and shall be designated by the Union. The names of all bargaining committee members and stewards shall be transmitted in writing to the Police Chief and the Human Resources Director. Union representatives may not act in the capacity until the above notifications have been made. Accordingly, all changes in designated representatives must be reported promptly.
Members of the bargaining committee may, upon their written request, be permitted to use “C” time (accumulated) to attend regular meetings of the Bargaining Unit. Such requests shall normally be approved unless the temporary loss of personnel would be a serious detriment to the effective operation of the Police Department.
Article VI
Work Rules
The employer shall have the right to modify and/or establish such reasonable rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary by the employer for the conduct and management of the affairs by the City. All employees shall comply with the work rules. Any unresolved complaints as to the reasonableness of new or existing work rules, or complaints involving discrimination in the application of such rules shall be resolved through the grievance procedure.
Article VII
Hours of Work
An employee’s tour of duty shall be determined by the employer. The tour of duty will consist of not less than eight hours and not more than ten hours. The tour of duty shall be a continuous shift, i.e. an employee will not be required to split a tour of duty into more than one continuous block of hours.
During each tour of duty an employee will receive two fifteen-minute breaks and one lunch period that will be no less than thirty minutes and no more than one hour.
3
City of Des Moines and
Des Moines Police Gold Braid Organization
July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2024
All employees will have a work schedule that includes at least two consecutive days off. No employee shall be scheduled to work more than eighty hours consecutively without two consecutive days off.
An employee’s normal tour of duty will remain reasonably consistent. The union recognizes the need for the employer to occasionally require an employee to alter their tour of duty to accommodate the needs of the employer, provided the employee is given at least seventy-two (72) hours notice of the change. The employer may require an employee to report to work up to three hours before or three hours after the normal starting time for the employee’s tour of duty. The employer cannot extend a tour of duty without paying the appropriate overtime compensation.

However, when overtime work is required, each employee is expected to be available for such assignments unless excused by the supervisor, due to the personal commitments of the employee.
Permanent employees shall normally be given preference in overtime assignments. In all cases, however, overtime assignments will be made in such a way that the functions of the City service will be most effectively completed. All compensable overtime must be performed at the direction of the Police Chief or his/her authorized representatives, and overtime credit may be accrued for no other purpose.
For the purpose of computing overtime, vacation, holiday, and injury leave, and earned compensatory time off shall be considered the same as time worked, unless, the overtime work is done for the convenience of and at the request of the employees, in which case, the overtime shall be straight time rate.
The times when compensatory time off may be taken shall be at the discretion of the Police Chief, although the employee’s desires shall be given consideration whenever possible. When compensatory time off is ordered by the Police Chief or requested by the employee, reasonable advance notice shall normally be provided.

“Emergency nature” generally refers to an unplanned illness, accident or unscheduled doctor’s visit involving an urgent or life-threatening condition.
