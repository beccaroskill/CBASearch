ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
AGREEMENT by and between the Metropolitan Lithographers Association, lnc.( hereinafter known also as the “Association," and Local One, Amalgamated Lithographers of America, GCIU, AFL-CIO, hereinafter known also as the “Union," that:
Whereas, the parties hereto are 'desirous of promoting and maintaining harmonious relations between Employers and Employees and of assuring industrial peace;
Whereas, the parties acknowledge that individual negotiations by Employees or Employers during the contract term for additional wage increases over and above those provided in the contract tend to interfere with the competitive positions of the lithographic industry in this area and accordingly are not in the best interests of management and labor; and
Whereas, the Association and the Employers on the one hand, and the Union and the Employees on the other hand, are expected to cooperate so as to achieve the most efficient utilization of technological advances in the industry and productivity commensurate therewith;
Now, therefore, it is mutually agreed as follows:
EMPLOYER
1.	The Metropolitan Lithographers Association, Inc, consists of member concerns engaged in the operation of lithographic (also called “offset") plants or departments within the territorial jurisdiction of the Union. This contract shall be binding on all present and future members of the Association, for their plants or departments within said territorial jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in Section 3(a) herein, such members being hereinafter designated as “Employers." Every member of the Association shall be individually bound hereby whether or not such member continues to be a member of the Association.
Notwithstanding the above, any future member of the Association shall come under and be bound by this contract as of the time of becoming a member, unless there shall be pending at such time any dispute between such member and the Union.
TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION
2.	The term “territorial jurisdiction" as used herein comprises New York State, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
RECOGNITION OF THE UNION
3.	(a) The Employers recognize the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining agent for all of the lithographic (also called “offset”) production Employees in the plants or departments of the Employers within the
1
Union’s territorial jurisdiction. The term "lithographic production Employees," hereinafter referred to as "Employees," shall mean those Employees engaged in the manufacture of lithographic work including working foremen as well as non-working foremen and supervisors of such Employees, but excluding plant managers, assistant plant managers, and all other managerial Employees.
Excluded also are: sales, professional, sketch artists, office and clerical Employees. This contract shall not apply to any Employees in existing plants or departments located outside the "New York and New Jersey Districts' as that term was defined in the Agreement between the Union and the Association, effective May 1, 1973 to April 30, 1976, which were not covered by said Agreement.
(b)	During the term of this contract and during any period of negotiations for its renewal, extension, or succession no Employer shall, with respect to any plant or department covered hereunder sign any contract recognizing any other union for lithographic production Employees.
(c)	In the event any of the jobs or work under this contract are removed from the bargaining unit by the voluntary action of an Employer, the Union may in its discretion, and only as to such Employer, either terminate this agreement or reopen it in all respects, with the right to strike if the parties fail to agree upon a new contract within ten (10) days after written notice of such termination or reopening. This clause does not apply to: removal of jobs or work resulting from obtaining lithographic production work from sources outside the plant; production of work, in whole or in part, by a process other than the lithographic process; or the bona fide sale or removal of equipment.
(d)	In the event the Union files a petition for its certification as collective bargaining agent by the National Labor Relations Board in respect to the unit of lithographic Employees covered by the contract, the Association and the Employer or Employers involved will consent to any election required thereunder for such purpose.
(e)	In the event of the removal of any plant covered by this contract to a location outside the Union’s territorial jurisdiction, this contract shall nevertheless continue to apply. *
(f)	This Agreement shall apply to Employees in the classification of Electronic Operator.

Any person sent by the Union office for a job shall present his work card to the Shop Delegate after being interviewed by the Employer and before starting work.
(b)	Union Membership - If non-Union employees are now or hereafter employed, they shall apply for membership in the Union within thirty-one (31) days from the date of employment or the effective date of this contract, whichever is later, and if they fail to do so they shall be discharged upon written request of the Union. It shall be a condition of employment that all employees covered by this contract who are or shall become members of the Union shall remain members in good standing and upon their failure to do so, they shall be discharged upon written request of the Union. Notwithstanding the foregoing, non-working foremen and plant superintendents shall not be required to become or remain members of the Union but shall be permitted by the Employer to do so if they so desire. The Union agrees as to all non-working foremen and plant superintendents who may become members of the Union as well as those who are now members, that it will not interfere with or attempt to interfere with their performance of their supervisory duties, or their performance of production work in the regular course of their duties or during any work stoppage.

LAYOFF AND DISCHARGE
12.(a) Genera/-An Employee may be laid off in the normal course of the operation of the business; an Employee may be discharged for just cause. "Just cause" shall not include failure to pass any unreasonable physical test or refusal of an unreasonable request to undergo any medical or surgical therapy. Before the discharge of a Shop Delegate, or the change of his regular work shift, the Employer must notify the Union of its intention and shall give the Union a reasonable opportunity to confer with the Employer; the preceding provisions shall apply for a period of one year after the Employee ceases to be Shop Delegate in such Employer's plant. In the event of a permanent layoff (defined as a layoff of more than three consecutive months), the shop delegate shall be the last person in that category in which he worked immediately prior to the layoff (e.g., first pressman, second pressman, operator, preparatory journeyman, Electronic Operator) to be laid off (provided that in the event a shop delegate is regularly working as both a prepatory journeyman and Electronic Operator immediately prior to the layoff, such categories shall be treated as a single category for purposes of this paragraph). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Employer may lay off the shop delegate if, in the Employer's reasonable judgment, another Employee in the same category is more qualified.
(b)	Amount of notice - (n the event of a layoff of any Employee for less than a week, or a discharge or layoff for a week or more of an Employee working for the Employer for less than thirty calendar days, one working day’s notice shall be given. In the event of a discharge or layoff for a week or more of an Employee working for the Employer at least 30 calendar days, three working days' notice shall, be given. Lay-off notice may not be given to an Employee while he is on his earned vacation.
(c)	Where an Employee is laid off for less than a week and thereafter is given notice of a further layoff before returning to work, thus causing a layoff of a week or more, the Employee shall be entitled to a total of three working days’ notice, credit to be given to the Employer for the day's notice given at the time of the original layoff.
(d)	Notice on day of layoff - The day of the notice of layoff on a one-day notice shall hot be counted; but it shall be counted on a three days notice provided the notice is given before the end of the first half of the shift.
(e)	No notice of iayoff - There shall be no notice of layoff required in the case of any mechanical breakdown, discharge for disorderly or dishonest conduct, discharge of a new Employee on the first day of employ
10
ment, emergency as specified in Section 10, equipment rendered idle because of under-complement as specified in Section 10 or layoff of a temporary Employee hired to fill a jury vacancy.
(f)	Temporary Employees - A new Employee hired for a specified temporary period, or to fill a vacancy caused by an emergency absence.^ shall not be entitled to any notice of layoff unless working for the Employer'more than five consecutive days; thereafter, but not until then, the provisions of this section shall apply with reference to notice of layoff except as to an Employee hired to fill a jury duty absence.
(g)	Apprentices - In the event of a layoff in a job classification, probationary apprentices are to be laid off first; indentured apprentices may be laid off only if the work is being shared with journeymen, otherwise indentured apprentices are not to be laid off prior to journeymen, except in a case where there is but one journeyman left the apprentice must be laid off before the journeyman is laid off.
(h)	Share the work - The Employer shall confer with the Shop Delegate in order to attempt to share the available working time as equally as practicable among Employees in the same job classification working for the Employer at least six (6) months prior to any layoff, temporary or permanent, due to slack business; provided, however, the final right to determine whether or not to share the work is reserved to the Employer. In the event there are any layoffs by an Employer due to slack business of Employees working for the Employer at least six (6) months, there shall not be permitted (within a reasonable length of time after the layoff) in the job classification affected in the plant any regularly scheduled overtime which would justify additional employment under all the circumstances. In the event there is any overtime work within a reasonable length of time after the layoff, the Employer shall receive twenty-four (24) hours' notice from the Union of any claim by the Union that such overtime is “scheduled overtime." An Employee shall not be laid off a second time within a six (6) month period after the return from a layoff until all Employees doing the same work in such job classification have equally shared the lost working time where such sharing is practicable.
(i)	Sustained unemployment • In the event there is any sustained unemployment in any job classification, Management must take the responsibility of avoiding excessive overtime as a substitute for hiring additional help and Management must take the responsibility of utilizing equitable share-the-work programs in lieu of layoffs of permanent Employees because of slack work. The Association agrees to meet promptly with the Union upon notification that there is such sustained unemployment and to cooperate fully with the Union in reaching an agreement on the ways and means necessary to eliminate unemployment. The Union will take no unilateral action to curtail or interfere with overtime, but this shall not be deemed a waiver of its rights under Sections 7, 11 and 12(h) of this contract.

In any plant where the number of journeymen is less than five in any department, the number of journeymen in such departments shall be combined and one apprentice may be made if such number totals at least seven journeymen, but in no event shall this combination result in more than one apprentice. The department in which the apprentice is to be placed shall be mutually agreed upon. The Union will, however, consent to the making of apprentices on the basis outlined above unless it is not
22
warranted because of the unemployment status of the particular job classification in the industry, or other factors in the particular plant involved. If there is no mutual agreement, the apprentice is not to be made and there shall be no arbitration.
An Employee hired through the Union at journeymen's scale, and an Employee who has received journeymen scale in the classification for at least four years after becoming a member of the Union, are to be counted as journeymen for the purpose of computing apprentice ratios in the classification concerned.

In the event that there is no concurrence in the selection of an Employee for apprenticeship, the matter shall be submitted to a Committee of the Association and the Union and in the event of further lack of agreement the matter may be submitted to arbitration hereunder.
In absence of the receipt of such notice of disapproval, the proposed apprentice may commence serving his probationary period; any subsequent objection on the part of the Union shall not interfere with the serving of the probationary period only, until the disposition of any arbitration proceeding between the Employer and the Union with reference to such proposed apprentice.
(e)	Eligibility- Only journeymen shall be eligible to become apprentice pressmen.
(f)	Certificate - Any new apprentice placed in any concern shall be required after his probationary period is completed to sign a "Certificate of Apprenticeship" in a form jointly agreed upon and to be furnished by the Union.
(g)	Temporary Transfer - An apprentice pressman or operator temporarily transferred to a press paying a higher rate than that to which the apprentice is indentured shall be paid in addition to his regular rate the difference between the two journeymen rates involved for the period of
23
such transfer.
(h)	Employment After Apprenticeship Completed - When an apprentice completes his period of apprenticeship and becomes a journeyman, at the option of the Employer the Union will require said Employee to.continue to work up to one year for the employer with whom such apprentice served his apprenticeship.
(i)	Probationary Apprentice - During the probationary period of an apprentice, the Employer shall have the right to remove such apprentice and transfer the Employee to the Employee’s job classification immediately prior to the probationary apprenticeship; the Employer shall first give the Union reasonable notice and an opportunity to confer.
(j)	Apprenticeships during Sustained Unemployment - If the Union and the Association agree in writing that there is sustained general unemployment in any job classification, then during the period of continuation of such joint agreement (a) no apprentices shall be made in such classifications (b) qualified journeymen in such classification, from within the Employer’s plant or new Employees at the option of the Employer, may be made apprentices pursuant to this Section 22 in any other job classification at the journeymen rate of such unemployed job classification.
Such an apprentice who has been so made from the Employer's plant and has been replaced by another journeyman or who has been hired as new help may also work in his previous classification as long as the Employer does, not reduce the number of Employees in such previous classifications which it had prior to the making of such apprentice and provided the amount of work of such apprentice in his previous classification does not justify regular additional employment.
Lack of agreement as to the status or continuance of sustained general unemployment shall not be subject to arbitration.

In the event the Employer receives notice before the commencement of a shift that an Employee will be absent (except absence for jury duty, bereavement pay, time off under Section 15), and, if there are no men on this next shift to be shifted or upgraded to fill the absence, the Employer shall retain an Employee from the previous shift to make up the complement, but such Employee need not be retained for more than three and three-quarters (3 3/4) hours of overtime work in addition to the one-half (1/2) hour unpaid supper period.
