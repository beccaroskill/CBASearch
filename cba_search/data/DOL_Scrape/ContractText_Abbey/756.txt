If necessary to allow for flexibility in scheduling, nonconsecutive days off during weekdays (Monday through Friday) may be utilized. The scheduled work week need not correspond to the calendar week, and the pattern of scheduling may be such that more or fewer than five (5) days of work are scheduled in one (1) week provided that not more than ten (10) days of work are normally scheduled in any two (2) work weeks.

(22)	Qualified nurses will be ottered an opportunity in order of seniority to 7. replace less senior nurses within the dinicai group.
(33)	Qualified nurses will be offered an opportunity in order of seniority to | replace less senior nurses In other clinical groups.	,
(44)	Nurses may accept complete layoff and retain full rights to recall. »
A nurse displaced by a more senior nurse under (22) and (33) above would * then, in seniority order, be offered option (11) through (44).	i
In exercising seniority rights under steps (11), (22), and (33) the nurse will ( be offered a position for which qualified according to the step selected, such position to be determined on the basis of the nurse’s position I preference, greater seniority and the need to minimize multiple displacement i of nurses.
Concurrently with the offering of steps (11) through (44), nurses shall be	,;
offered the option of accepting reduced hours in their unit. A nurse accepting such reduction shall be considered on layoff and retain all recall rights. Before or at the time a nurse is offered vacancies or replacement opportunities, the nurse will be provided a description of available positions which includes the unit assignment, shifts and number of scheduled hours.
As long as any nurse remains on layoff, the Hospital shall not newly employ nurses into the bargaining unit and shall not transfer or temporarily assign nonbargaining unit nurses into the bargaining unit until all nurses holding recall rights who are qualified shall have been recalled.

w^stjyyj-wiaittyFuy ■ ■
Nurses on layoff who are presently qualified, shall be given first opportunity to work intermittent shifts that are available, before such shifts are offered , to casual part-time or non-bargaining unit nurses. To the greatest extent '( feasible, such shifts shall be offered to nurses on layoff in order of seniority । up to but not exceeding the number of scheduled hours per pay period , before layoff. Intermittent shifts reasonably expected to occur over a continuing period of time shall not be used in lieu of recall of nurses who retain recall rights.

When floating is needed, the Hospital will endeavor to take into consideration a nurse's interest in becoming qualified in another unit of the Hospital.
As part of on-going communication between the Association and the Hospital, the Hospital will notify the Association as soon as it determines that a layoff may occur. The parties will meet to review relevant data and to jointly develop the procedures for applying this Section 14 (o) to the specific situation.

(a)	Voluntary leaves
(b)	Permanent or temporary voluntary decrease of scheduled hours	'
(c)	Voluntary retraining
(d)	Early retirement as provided In	the Contract	1
(e)	Alternate positions	’
(f)	Mutually agreed severance packages
(g)	Other ideas mutually agreeable to the parties and consistent with the Contract Agreement

(3)	Apian wilt be mutually developed for implementing the contract j provision relating to layoff that fits the individual situation and +
- provides senior nurses greater options. It will identify units * affected, educatlon/training needs, competencies for replacing , junior nurses on specific units, mechanics of notifying nurses and data to be tracked (e.g., overtime, intermittent, casual and i extra shifts worked and volume increases) that will trigger a j recall.	'
(4)	The parties wilt jointly review data on a continuing basis. The indicators that a recall Is needed will be Identified.
(5)	In Implementing recall, a system will be used that results in senior nurses having greater options and not being disadvantaged by the recall of junior nurses. As In layoff, recall of nurses tothelr shift, unit and FTE will be done In seniority order and in a fashion designed to minimize multiple displacement.
(g)	Recall: Notice of recall shall be in writing to a nurse, with simultaneous copy mailed to Minnesota Nurses Association. Recalls shall be in order of seniority with the most senior nurse in layoff status recalled first. Recall shall continue in order of most seniority to least seniority until all nurses have been fully restored to their number of scheduled hours before layoff.

Determinations or actions by a Hospital include actions by parent ‘ or affiliates or entities which have the power ^to effectively direct such '	- determinations or actions in a contracting Hospital' Consequently, it is the policy
r V of the Hospital and Minnesota Nurses Association that determinations made ( ‘ and actions taken to serve the community and patients should not be at the
<:> expense of individual registered nurses employed a| an affected institution. In the event that such determinations or actions including corporate merger, •, consolidation, or reorganization of services, directly or indirectly will cause an -	■■ elimination or a reduction in the number of registered nurses in present, or if
: V greater in future bargaining unit positions in any classification on a station unit, j:	the following principles shall apply:

the ability to perform the duties of the position within a reasonable period
;; of orientation and in-house training not to exceed four (4) weeks. Such j	orientation and training shall be at no cost to the nurse. Reduction of nurses
; ’	on an affected area and the offering of reassignment in the Hospital shall
' :	be made on the basis of seniority in the Hospital as defined in Section 14,
j	Temporary Staffing Adjustments, Low Need Days and Layoff, of the Agreement
Page 51
?
(2)	"Qualified" means the ability to independently provide sate, direct patient care for the standard case toad on the unit within a reasonable ■ period of orientation not to exceed four (4) weeks; but said term does not require proficiency in all technical skills or the performance of leadership roles.

The nurse’s accrued seniority shall be maintained on the nurse's record and shall be restored to the nurse if she or he transfers back to a bargaining unit position within one (1) year. The nurse may nof exercise frozen seniority tor any purpose under this Contract while in the non-bargaining unit position. If the nurse does not return to a bargaining unit position within one (1) year from the date of the transfer out of the bargaining unit, all bargaining unit seniority is tost.
A revised and up-to-date listing of the seniority for each nurse in the bargaining unit will be posted by the Hospital and provided to Minnesota Nurses Association each month concurrent with the end of the last pay period of that month,
(b) Voluntary Low Need Days and Leave: Before resorting to Part (d) of this Section or any layoff procedure, the Hospital will offer the full-time and part-time nurses an opportunity to voluntarily request a low need leave of

ANA STATEMENT ON "RISK VERSUS RESPONSIBILITY IN PROVIDING NURSING CARE”
LOU 1998	!
Amended 2004
I
j
RISK VS. RESPONSIBILITY—Minnesota Nurses Association and Ailina believe that the American Nurses Association’s (ANA) statement regarding Risk Versus Responsibility in Providing Nursing Care addresses the concerns raised about related issues during 1995 negotiations. The ANA document is, therefore, adopted as a Minnesota Nurses Association/Afiina joint statement on this issue. Statement i follows:
“This statement, developed by the Committee on Ethics of the American Nurses' Association, examines the question, “At what point does it cease to be the nurse's duly to undergo risk for the benefit of the patient?" That question is particularly j relevant for nurses caring for patients afflicted with communicable or infectious diseases such as typhoid, tuberculosis, plague, Hansen's disease, influenza, hepatitis- ; B, Legionnaires' disease, cytomegalovirus and AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). Not only must nursing care be readily available to individuals afflicted with communicable or infectious diseases, but also, nurses must be advised on	?
the risks and the responsibilities they face in providing care to those individuals.	;
Accepting personal risk which exceed the limits erf duty is not morally obligatory; it | is a moral option.	I
According to the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses, nurses may morally refuse to	;
participate in care, but only on the grounds of either patient advocacy or moral	1
objection to a specific type of intervention. Nursing is resolute in its perspective I that care should be delivered without prejudice, and it makes no allowance for use of the patient's personal attributes or socioeconomic status or the nature of the health	'j
problem as ground for discrimination.	j
i
The first statement of the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses says, “The nurse pro-	;
vides services with respect for human dignity and the uniqueness of the client, un-	'
restricted by considerations of social or economic status, personal attributes, or the nature of health problems." Here, the code is addressing the issue of nondis-	'«
crimination in the allocation of nursing resources (a question of justice and fairness).	j
Historically, nurses have given care to those in need, even at risk to theirown health,	'>
life, or limb, indeed, the Suggested Code of 1926 proclaims that "the most	ij
precious possession of this profession is the ideal of service, extending even to the sacrifice of life itself..." Nursing history is replete with examples of nurses who have knowingly incurred great risk in order to care for those in need of nursing or to	J
contribute to the advancement of health science. Contemporary nurses, too,	j
knowingly place themselves in jeopardy when giving care on the battlefield, in places	<<
of squalor and poor sanitation at home or abroad, in situations of natural or man-	*
made disaster, and to those with communicable or infectious diseases.	*
As the Suggested Code of 1926 recognizes, the ideal of service is, in fact, an ideal. •< There are limits to the personal risk of harm the nurse can be expected to accept
Page 102
as a moral duty. The profession does not and cannot demand the sacrifice of the nurse's well-being, physical, emotional or otherwise, or the nurse’s life for the benefit of the patient.	J
For assistance in resolving the question of risk versus responsibility, nurses must turn to the field of ethics for guidance. In ethics, the differentiation between benefiting another as a moral duty and benefiting another as a moral option Is found in four fundamental criteria. As applied io nursing, they are as follows:
k
1.	The patient is at significant risk of harm, bss, or damage if the nurae does not assist.
2.	The nurse's intervention or care is directly relevant to preventing harm.
3.	The nurse’s care will probably prevent harm, loss, or damage to the patient.
4.	The benefit the patient will gain outweighs any harm the nurse might incur and does not present more than minimal risk to the health care provider.
i i
I i
Nursing, as nursing, creates a special relationship between nurse and patient, with special duties for the nurse. The nurse is not a "stranger* and this is not at liberty to walk away from those in need of nursing when all four of the criteria are met.
Forexample, in most instances, It would be considered morally obligatory for a nurse to give care to an AIDS patient If the nurse is immunosuppressed, however, it could be reasonably argued that the nurse is not morally obligated to care for that patient on the grounds that the fourth criterion, the most crucial, has not been met. Apart from the Issue of personal risk to the nurse, it must be mentioned that it is Incumbent upon the hospital or agency administration to provide adequate safeguards, such as equipment and enforcement of procedures, for the protection of nursing staff.
Nursing is a caring, patient advocacy profession. Because of nursing’s long history of standing ready to assist the ill and the vulnerable in society, society has come to rely on nursing and to expect that it will rise to the health demands of virtually any occasion. In a sense, this reciprocity is crucial to the lite of the profession. All must know that care wfil be given when needed and that it will not be arbitrarily, prejudicially, or capriciously denied.
Yet, there are limits to the moral obligation of the individual nurse to benefit patients. Beneficence stands as a moral duty in those situations where the four criteria can be met. When not all the criteria can be met, the individual nurse must evaluate the situation according to the criteria and choose whether or not to go beyond the requirement of duty."

1998 MERCY LOCAL ACTION PLAN	‘
I
Curing the 1998 negotiations, the parties reached agreement on a number of i 1 significant actions which are to occur during the term of the Contract. An Action Plan is a statement of agreed future actions and usually involves a general versus a specific process. It differs from Contract provisions in that it relies on the good faith of the parties for development and implementation. The Mercy/MNA Labor Management Committee wil be accountable for delegating action items for completion.
Action Plans may have a time schedule and are usually adaptable to the individual Hospital and Minnesota Nurses Association Labor Management process.
The following are the agreed upon Action Plans:
Bargaining Unit Composition
The Allina and Mercy Labor Management Committees in collaboration with the Allina and Mercy Nursing Practice/Care Delivery committees will:
I
♦	Develop and implement a short term plan by which to evaluate any direct/ ' indirect patient care role/responsibilities which are under consideration to move	'
from a bargaining unit RN role or be incorporated in a non bargaining unit position prior to implementation; consensus must be reached.	;
♦	Develop, implement and evaluate process(es) by which the;
•	New posilionsJroles/responsibitities are evaluated to determine if these are ; bargaining unit positions.	;
•	Existing non-management positions are evaluated for appropriate inclusion in the bargaining unit.	|
•	Changes proposed in the work of the bargaining unit nurse to shift work ; into a non bargaining unit role will be evaluated and consensus reached prior to implementation.
•	Examine/determine/develop process models by which changes in roles are accomplished.	।
■	Assure that appropriate accountability and authority are included in the above and are communicated within the organization.
