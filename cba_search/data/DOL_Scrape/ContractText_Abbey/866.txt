PREAMBLE
AGREEMENT between (1) The Mount Sinai Hospital, One Gustave L. Levy Place, New York, New York (herein called "Employer") and (2) New York State Nurses Association (herein called "Association"). Employer and Association recognize their common interests beyond their collective bargaining relationship. Thus, they pledge to strive together to insure the highest quality of service by Employer and the highest standards of professional nursing care and practice.
In addition, the parties agree to jointly foster the "Forces of Magnetism”, which incorporate adequate staffing as well as the autonomy of nurses (as defined by the Nurse Practice Act), communicating its benefits within the hospital and the community at large in an effort to promote patient and nurse satisfaction, in an environment of excellence.
1	.A REEMENT SCOPE
This Agreement covers each full-time (herein called "permanent full-time") and part-time (herein called "permanent part-time" and "per diem") employee licensed or otherwise lawfully entitled to practice as a registered professional nurse (herein called "employee") employed by Employer to perform registered professional nursing as a Clinical Nurse, Senior Clinical Nurse, Nurse Clinician, Home Care Nurse, Nurse Practitioner, Educational Specialist, Nurse Educator-Clinician Specialist, Case Manager or in such other title which is instituted as part of the Career Pathway Program. In the event that the Employer institutes a new bargaining unit position or changes any existing bargaining unit position, it shall notify the Association at least thirty (30) workdays before anyone is assigned to that position and provide a job description for purposes of determining the appropriate rate of pay. Each person employed by Employer as a registered professional nurse must be licensed or otherwise lawfully entitled to practice as a registered professional nurse in New York. Employer will, as soon as practicable, check and record the registration of each new employee at the time of employment and will check and record the registration of all employees biennially. Excluded from the aforesaid bargaining unit are supervisors, Coordinators, Clinical Nurse Manager, Clinical Director, Associate Directors of Nursing, Vice President, Nursing, Administrative Assistants to the Vice President, Nursing, or her designee, and students whose performance of work at the Employer is part of the educational course of study such students are pursuing.
At the time a new employee subject to this Agreement is employed, the Employer shall deliver to said employee a written notice that the Employer recognizes and is in contractual relations with the Association.
2	. ASSOCIATION STATUS
2.01 Recognition
Employer recognizes Association as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of every employee covered by this Agreement.
2.02 Association Membership
It shall be a condition of employment that every employee who is a member of Association in good standing as of the effective date of this Agreement shall remain a member in good standing and those who are not members on the effective date of this Agreement shall, on or after the thirty-first (31st) day following the effective date of this agreement or the execution thereof, whichever is later, become and remain members in good standing of the Association. Every employee who becomes such
1
after the effective date or the execution thereof, whichever is later, will become a member of the Association on or after the thirty-first (31st) day following the beginning of such employment become and thereafter will remain a member in good standing of the Association if he/she tenders her/his periodic dues uniformly required as a condition of membership.
Within five (5) days after the employee’s employment or change in status, the Employer shall notify the Association in writing of the name, address, social security number, position or change of status of each employee so affected. The Association shall notify the Employer in writing of any employee who has failed to become a member in good standing and the Employer shall upon the Association written demand terminate employment of said employee within twenty (20) work days of said notification. If during said fourteen (14) day period the employee pays delinquent dues, the Employer shall not be required to discharge such employee.
2.03 Deduction of Association Dues
After thirty (30) working days, upon receipt of a written authorization from an employee in the form annexed hereto, as Exhibit A, the Employer shall, pursuant to such authorization, deduct from the wages due employee each month and remit to the Association each month the dues fixed by the Association. The Employer shall be relieved from making such "check-off' deductions upon: (a) termination of employment, (b) transfer to a title other than one covered by the bargaining unit, (c) layoff from work, (d) an agreed leave of absence or (e) revocation of the check-off authorization in accordance with its terms or with applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the return of an employee to work from day of the above-mentioned absences, the Employer will immediately resume the obligation of making such deductions, except that deductions for terminated employees shall require a new dues authorization card. The Employer shall not be obligated to make dues deductions of any kind from any employee who, during any dues month involved, shall have failed to receive sufficient salary to equal the dues deductions.
By the tenth (10th) of each month, the Employer shall remit to the Association all deductions for dues made from the salary of employees for the preceding month, together with a list of all employees, addresses, social security numbers, and dates of hire, job title and employment status (full-time, part-time, per diem) from whom dues have been deducted.
It is specifically agreed that the Employer assumes no obligation, financial or otherwise, arising out of the provisions of this article, and the Association hereby agrees that it will indemnify and hold the Employer harmless from any claims, actions or proceedings by an employee arising from deductions made by the Employer hereunder. Once the funds are remitted to the Association, their disposition thereafter shall be the sole and exclusive obligation and responsibility of the Association.
2.04 Association Business: Local Representative
The Association will notify Employer of its local employee representatives who are authorized to deal with Employer about employment conditions and adjustment of any problems arising under this Agreement. The Corresponding Secretary of the Council of Nursing Practitioners will notify Employer, in writing, of said representatives' designation and authority and any change in either.
2
An employee representative intending to go to a division or department other than the one he/she represents shall notify and obtain the approval of the appropriate Clinical Director in her/his area and the appropriate Clinical Director of the other area. Such time or access shall not be unreasonably denied. No employee shall engage in activities which will interfere with the operations of the Employer.
2.05 Association Business: General Representative(s)
Duly authorized general representative(s) of the Association may visit the Employer's premises, by prearrangement with the Vice President, Nursing or his/her designee, at a reasonable time, to discharge Association's duties as the employees' collective bargaining representative so long as the representative does not interfere with the work of the employees and the operation of the Employer.
2.06 Association Bulletin Boards
Employer will provide the Association with at least twenty-one (21) (see exhibit c) bulletin boards on which to post official Association notices. These bulletin boards will at all times carry a label, device, or notice clearly identifying them as Association's space (for use). The signature (or facsimile signature) of a duly authorized Association representative will be affixed to every Association notice posted in this space. Notices to be posted must be submitted for prior approval to the Labor Relations Department and such approval shall not be unreasonably denied.
Bulletin boards displaced because of building renovation, alteration or demolition will be relocated within six (6) weeks, so as to maintain the total number of bulletin boards. The location of the replacement of such bulletin boards will be by mutual consent.
All bulletin boards shall be locked and keys held by the Employer and Association representative. See Exhibit C for bulletin board location.
3. PROFESSIONAL PRACTITIONER STATUS
A.	Non-Nursing Functions
The Employer and the Association recognize that the performance of non-nursing functions by registered nurses impedes their ability to deliver quality, cost-effective patient care and is not intended to be a part of their responsibilities. The Employer therefore agrees that registered nurses shall not perform non-nursing functions unless so directed by their supervisor where the non-performance of such functions would create an imminent, clear and present danger to patients.
B.	Joint Council Committee
A joint meeting with the Executive Board and the Vice President, Nursing or appointed designee will be held on a monthly basis, for the purposes of discussion of issues identified by either the Vice President, Nursing or the Council of Nursing Practitioners. The Vice President, Nursing, or appointed designee, is available to attend ad hoc meetings with a predetermined agenda with the Executive Board of the Council of Nursing Practitioners.
3.01 Council of Nursing Practitioners
The Council of Nursing Practitioners shall continue to provide leadership and direction to further the standards of Nursing Practice as enunciated by the profession and as defined by law. A committee shall meet on a regular basis to review and resolve practice problems and concerns.
3
3.02 Professional Practice Committees
Nursing Department assignments in the provision of nursing care are commensurate with the qualifications of nursing personnel and are designed to meet the nursing care needs of patients.
It is the Employer's intent to provide a sufficient number of qualified registered nurses so that patients receive the nursing care that requires the judgment and specialized knowledge of a registered nurse.
It is also the Employer's intent that staffing of nursing personnel be sufficient to assure prompt recognition of changes in a patient's condition and appropriate intervention by the nursing, medical or hospital staffs.
In each Care Center a Professional Practice Committee will be established composed of a mutually agreed upon number of Council members and the NYSNA General Representative(s) or his/her designee and members of Nursing Management and meet bi-monthly or as needed. Council members will be paid for the time they serve on the Committee. The Employer is committed to and will assure the release of Council Members for attendance at the above Committee meetings.
The purpose of the Committee shall be to:
1.	promote the retention and professional satisfaction of nurses;
2.	promote collaboration and communication among health care professionals;
3.	promote nurse involvement in organizational and clinical decision making processes;
4.	promote high quality patient care and family centered care.
The goals of these committees will be to:
1.	Review the standards of nursing practice in each Care Center;
2.	Make recommendations regarding the evidence-based standards of practice and patient care needs within each Care Center;
3.	Provide a forum for communication regarding staffing concerns or problems;
4.	Develop staffing guidelines for each unit within each Care Center;
5.	Review nurse and patient satisfaction surveys;
6.	Develop criteria for self-scheduling on a unit basis taking into consideration the needs of the patients and nursing staff to promote the fair and equitable scheduling practices including but not limited to vacation scheduling;
7.	Develop and implement a plan to promote and disseminate two-way communication between PPC committee members and unit staff.
To assist the committee in fulfilling its function the Employer will provide information related to the above goals requested by the committee as a whole.
The parties agree that the determination of staffing needs is a dynamic process influenced by any one or combination of the following factors: patient acuity, technology, unit and hospital census, unit size, unit geography, standards of professional practice, qualifications of staff, staff mix, and service specialty. The foregoing factors, which are illustrative and not exhaustive, shall be considered in determining adjustments to staffing guidelines.
The Professional Practice Committee shall develop staffing guidelines on a unit-by-unit basis. Where there is agreement reached, the staffing guidelines shall be
4
implemented by the Employer and, where necessary, recruitment efforts shall be made to achieve these levels no later than thirty (30) days following agreement.
In the event that the Committee is unable to reach agreement concerning the development of staffing guidelines or its implementation, the matter may be brought for review by the Care Center Director. If agreement is not possible, the issue may then be forwarded to the Vice President, Nursing, for resolution. Where there is no agreement reached by the Committee and the Vice President, Nursing, or if the Association believes the Employer is not adhering to the agreed to staffing guidelines, the dispute shall be brought before a qualified individual to mediate resolution of the issue. The mediator shall be a neutral with expertise in the subject matter under discussion. The mediator shall not make any recommendations on staffing unless the parties agree to such procedure. The parties agree that any recommendations made by the mediator shall be kept confidential unless waived by both parties. Any and all settlement agreements reached during the mediation process will be in writing and implemented within thirty (30) days following the signing of such agreements. The cost of the mediator shall be shared equally by the parties.
In the event that there is no settlement agreement regarding the development of a staffing guideline or its implementation following mediation, the parties shall submit their differences to expedited arbitration in accordance with the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator’s authority in such an arbitration shall be limited to establishing staffing guidelines and/or to a review as to whether the Employer has failed without justification, to adhere to the staffing guidelines it had adopted pursuant to the above process. Once the guidelines have been established and in the event of a claim made by the Association that the Employer is not adhering to the agreed to staffing guideline(s), the sole remedy that the arbitrator is empowered to award is a direction to the Employer to enter into substantial compliance with the staffing guideline(s) for the inpatient unit(s) in question.
It is understood that isolated incidents of variation in staffing level guidelines shall not be cited as evidence of the Employer’s failure to adhere to staffing guidelines. If the Vice President, Nursing, is actively recruiting for nursing staff, such action must be considered by the arbitrator with respect to the adherence to staffing guidelines.
It is understood by both parties that in the event of a drop or increase in census or patient acuity or change in any other factor that would have a significant effect on staffing needs, staffing guidelines are subject to change after consultation with the Professional Practice Committee. If the Professional Practice Committee is not able to reach agreement on the new staffing guideline(s), such guideline(s) shall be subject to expedited arbitration as outlined in the preceding paragraph.
Once staffing guidelines have been established and/or revised by the Professional Practice Committee or through the mediation/expedited arbitration process, they shall be incorporated by reference into this Agreement and shall be distributed to the members.
3.03 Labor-Management Committee
A Labor-Management Committee, consisting of the Vice President, Human Resources and Labor Relations or his/her designee, the Vice President, Nursing or his/her designee, the General Representatives for the New York State Nurses Association, and Executive Committee of the Local Bargaining Unit shall meet and
5
discuss issues of interest and concern. These meetings shall occur on a monthly basis, unless the parties mutually agree to meet more often, as long as a written agenda is provided five (5) working days prior to the meeting being scheduled.
3.04 Staff Development Program
The Department of Nursing is supportive of staff members in their continuing professional development through the provision of staff development education programs and encourages participation in continuing education activities.
Employer shall continue its practice with regard to the following:
A.	A planned orientation program under responsibility and direction of the Education Division for a minimum of two (2) weeks for each new employee. The Association shall be provided with one (1) hour to meet with new employees during the orientation period.
B.	An organized program of staff development on work time.
C.	Time off, within reasonable limits, without loss of pay, for participation in professional activities in the Association.
D.	Subject to staffing requirements, the Employer shall provide time off within reasonable limits and budget and allocate two hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($275,000) per annum, on staff development programs. Such monies shall be allocated as follows: thirty percent (30%) in the first quarter, thirty percent (30%) in the second quarter, twenty percent (20%) in the third quarter and twenty percent (20%) in the fourth quarter.
These monies shall be administered by the Vice President, Nursing or his/her designee in a reasonable non-discriminatory manner with recommendations from the Council of Nursing Practitioners and shall be used for expenses incurred by employees covered by this Agreement, for participation in educational institutes, workshops or meetings. The annual allocation of funds under this paragraph shall be non-cumulative and unused funds at the end of any year shall not be carried forward to the next year.
All requests to attend a conference will be limited to five (5) conference days per nurse per year. Requests will not be considered prior to ninety (90) days before the conference. Once considered, a response will be given within ten (10) working days. A system mutually agreeable to the parties will be used to select among applicants for such monies in those instances where there are multiple requests for attendance at the same conference. The maximum number of funded nurses permitted to attend one (1) conference is twelve (12); however this provision shall not limit the total number of nurses who may attend one (1) conference to twelve (12) where staffing permits. If at any time during the year, there are no funds available to the employee, he/she shall be eligible to utilize any or all of the five (5) conference day allotment to attend a conference at her/his own expense subject to staffing requirements.
E.	A quarterly report of the status of the fund shall be provided to the Council of Nursing Practitioners by the end of January, April, July and October.
F.	A joint committee will be maintained to advise on nursing library needs.
6
3.05 Appointment to Positi n
Upon hire, lateral transfer, promotion and/or other change in position or title, an employee shall receive in writing her/his job description, salary, differentials, assignment and shift. A copy of the Employer's Human Resources Policy Manual shall be maintained in an accessible unlocked area on each unit.
Part-time employees will receive a written explanation of how each benefit is prorated.
3.06 Protest of Assignment
In the event any registered nurse determines that in her/his professional opinion he/she has been given an assignment that is unsafe and/or endangers patient care, he/she shall immediately notify his/her Clinical Nurse Manager.
The Clinical Nurse Manager or other designee shall appear on the unit within thirty (30) minutes and shall review the assignment and make a determination in writing on a form developed by the parties as to whether the assignment is safe. In the event of multiple requests (more than 3), the Clinical Nurse Manager will prioritize the order of response based on patient classification data. In the event that the Clinical Nurse Managers are directly involved in an emergency, as soon as the emergency is resolved, they will respond to the request. It is also intended that the Clinical Nurse Manager will communicate with nursing staff regarding staffing issues and protests of assignment at monthly staff meetings.
If the employee disagrees with the Clinical Nurse Manager’s decision, he/she will accept the assignment and may do so under protest and such matter may be filed at Step Two of the Grievance Procedure. The Step Two hearing shall be scheduled within two (2) working days and heard within ten (10) working days.
An employee shall not in any way or manner be disciplined for questioning the assignment.
3.07 Posting of Positions
Where a vacancy in a covered title occurs, the Employer shall post a notice of such vacancy on bulletin boards it ordinarily uses for notices to bargaining unit employees for a period of not less than seven (7) working days excluding weekends and holidays before the vacancy is filled. Copies of each such posting shall be provided to the NYSNA office and the general nursing representative with the date of each posting not more than three (3) working days following each such posting.

4.06 Post-Probationary Discipline
Except as stated in paragraph 4.05, an employee will be demoted, suspended, otherwise disciplined or discharged only for just cause and Employer will promptly notify Association in writing of each such action not covered in paragraph 4.05 and the reason for it. Employees will receive copies of all disciplinary actions involving them.

An employee summoned to a disciplinary conference or hearing will be advised of his/her right to have an
8
Association representative present at the hearing at the time of the taking of proposed disciplinary action or disciplinary warning. Nothing in this paragraph shall delay the Employer in taking immediate disciplinary action it believes necessary. When immediate disciplinary action must be taken, the Employer will immediately notify the Association of such action.
For the purposes of transfers only, the Employer will remove from the personnel and departmental records warning notices except for final warnings, and final warnings with suspensions, for which there has not been a repetition of the infraction for the past three (3) years.

Seniority shall accrue during authorized leaves of absence up to one (1) year, but not during periods of suspension for just cause.
4.09 Loss of Seniority
An employee's seniority shall be lost when the employee: (a) terminates a bargaining unit position voluntarily and is not rehired within sixty (60) days into a bargaining unit position, (b) is discharged for just cause, (c) exceeds an official leave of absence, (d) is laid off for a period of twenty-four (24) consecutive months or a period exceeding the length of the employee's continuous service, whichever is less, (e) fails to return to work on a recall from a layoff to a comparable position as defined in 5.06 I, within a reasonable length of time after the Employer has sent notice to return by certified letter to the last address furnished to the Employer by the employee, unless the employee has a valid reason for inability to respond, or (f) is in an “acting” position, outside the bargaining unit for more than six (6) months.
9
4.10 Seniority: Appiicati n
Bargaining unit seniority shall apply in the computation and determination of eligibility for all benefits where length of service is a factor pursuant to this Agreement and to layoff and recall pursuant to Sections 5.06 and 5.07.
A.	Seniority Application: Vacation Selection
Vacation time selection as exercised for each Clinical Unit will be based on bargaining unit seniority of the employee within her/his assigned shift subject to the Employer’s operational requirements.
B.	Seniority Application: Permanent Vacancies
In filling permanent vacancies, Employer shall give first opportunity to: (a) present permanent full-time employees; and (b) present permanent part-time employees. Where a promotional vacancy or transfer in a bargaining unit position occurs and two (2) or more employees are under consideration for such vacancy, the Employer shall promote or transfer the employee with the greatest seniority, unless as between or among such employees there is an appreciable difference, as determined by the Vice President, Nursing, in their ability to do the job. Within five (5) working days after .an employee has been accepted for a position, the Employer will notify those employees not accepted for the position.
C.	Seniority Application: Promotions and Transfers
1.	Application of Seniority to Voluntary Promotions and Transfers
An employee who is promoted or transferred shall serve the same probationary period in the new position as a new employee. If the employee is removed from the new position during the probationary period, the employee shall be permitted to return to the employee's former position without loss of other benefits, excepting that if the employee is discharged, such discharge shall be subject to the Discharge and Penalties stated in Section 10.03 of this Agreement. If the employee opts to leave the new position within thirty (30) days of the transfer/promotion, he/she shall be permitted to return to his or her former position without loss of other benefits, provided the former position has not been filled. All transferees shall receive the regular unit orientation. An employee who is transferred from one Clinical Unit to another Clinical Unit within the same job classification shall not have her/his salary reduced by reason of such transfer.
2.	Application of Seniority to Involuntary Transfer
An employee involuntarily transferred will be notified of the reason for the transfer.
Such employee will maintain her/his posted scheduled hours unless he/she agrees otherwise for at least four (4) weeks unless a nursing issue is involved in which case such schedule will be maintained for only three (3) weeks.
D.	Seniority Application: Promotional Acting
The Employer may continue the practice of offering temporary promotional opportunities classified as "Acting". Such employee shall receive the pay of the higher position so long as the employee holds the position. An employee in an “Acting” position outside the bargaining unit for more than six (6) months will lose their seniority. A dispute concerning the period of such "Acting" status shall be subject to Section 13 herein.
E.	Seniority Application; Special Project Positions
1.	Seniority Application to Special or Non-Budqetary Fund Positions
When more than fifty percent (50%) of an employee's regular compensation rate is charged to a special or non-budgetary fund and such employee is
10
informed at the time of her/his employment or at the time of transfer that her/his employment is for a special non-budgetary or research project and subject to this paragraph shall not be subject to bump by employees not compensated fifty percent (50%) or more by the same special or non-budgetary fund. For purposes of layoff such employee will be considered to have bargaining unit seniority which may be exercised first within the project or grant to which assigned and then in accordance with Section 5.06 Layoff Procedure. Such employee shall be considered to have bargaining unit seniority for the purposes of transfer or recall to a vacant position outside of the special project, provided in each case that the Employer determines that the employees retained or recalled have the ability to do the work. Such determination by the Employer shall not be arbitrary.
2.	Seniority Application: Non-Grant Positions
Employees, fifty percent (50%) or more of whose regular compensation rate is charged to the Employer's budget, shall be considered as having seniority on that basis and not under a grant.
4.11 Seniority: Lists
Employer will, and at least monthly, post and furnish to the Association seniority lists and will correct such lists from time to time as may be necessary. The posted list will conclusively establish an employee's seniority unless the employee protests it, in writing, within thirty (30) days from presentation to the Association, or, if the employee is on leave of absence or vacation, or otherwise unable to so protest it within such time, within thirty (30) days after the employee returns from such leave or vacation or such disability is removed.
4.12 Status Report
A.	Employer will provide to each employee, in January and July of each year, a record of base salary, experience, educational and shift differential. Any questions regarding salary information contained in these reports should be immediately brought to the attention of the Nursing Department.

B.	The employer is committed to provide each employee “read only’’ access to “Acustaf” by no later than September 1,2005. If it is unable to do so by such date an employee may request on a monthly basis and the Employer will provide a copy of his/her holiday, sick, and vacation time from his/her Nurse Manager.
Within thirty (30) days after ratification of this agreement an investigation into the practice of tracking compensatory time on every unit will be conducted and the Labor Management Committee, outlined in Section 3.03, will be convened to establish a uniform system of tracking compensatory time on each unit. The established system will be in effect by December 1,2005.

Employees will not be required to work involuntary overtime except in a disaster/emergency. A disaster/emergency is defined as storms, blackouts, accidents, and unplanned staffing shortages. Unplanned staffing shortages shall not include routine and/or foreseeable gaps in the schedule. An employee will be permitted to postpone overtime assignment five (5) times a year. Written records will be provided on overtime usage. In the event of any of the aforementioned occurrences, overtime will initially be sought on a voluntary basis by nurses on duty who are qualified to perform the job functions. Where there are no volunteers, Nursing Administration will make a best effort to seek coverage from nurses assigned to other units, per diem and part-time staff who are qualified to perform the job functions. Such overtime will be assigned in reverse order of seniority on a rotating basis. Such assignment of overtime will be effected in as equitable and consistent a
13
manner as possible. Employees will have a minimum of nine (9) hours between scheduled shift assignments.
5.04 Overtime Work: C mpensatory Time Off
Effective June 2, 1991, with the mutual consent of Employer and employee which shall not be unreasonably denied, the Employer may grant, on a straight time basis, compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay for those hours worked in excess of 37.5 but less than 40 hours in a work week. Employees consenting to compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay may not reconvert such time into overtime pay.
Accrued compensatory time must be taken within six (6) months of the date that it is earned. Scheduling of such time off shall not be unreasonably denied by the Employer. Requests for time off must be made and responded to in writing. Employees who have been denied time off four (4) times for the same accrued compensatory time may apply to have their requests reviewed by the Vice President, Nursing, or designee, and efforts will be made to facilitate the scheduling of such time off within thirty (30) days.
Employees will not be compensated for compensatory time not taken if a reasonable effort by the employee has not been made to schedule the time and the above procedure has not been followed.
5.05 Work Schedule
A.	Posting
The Employer will establish a pilot program for self scheduling within thirty (30) days of the ratification of this agreement. The self scheduling program will be in effect for all units of the facility.

Shifts are defined as days, evenings and nights. Rotation shall be defined as any change of shift from that which is regularly assigned. Rotation is permitted only for the purposes of the new hire, transfer or promotional orientation/educational process during the probationary period and other educational programs of an advanced nature.
Except as provided elsewhere in this Agreement, or by mutual agreement, employees will not be required to rotate.
An employee who is off duty and has volunteered for overtime, or a per diem employee who is scheduled to work will be given at least one and a half (1/2) hours notice of cancellation of a scheduled shift or he/she will be paid for four (4) hours at the rate of compensation that they would have been paid for that shift.
C.	Floating

In the event that an existing care center is not listed above or if a new Area is created, placement into one of the groupings will be by agreement between the Association and the Employer.
2.	"Qualified," for the purpose of this section, shall be defined as the ability to independently provide safe, direct patient care for the standard case load on the unit within a period not to exceed sixty (60) working days.
B.	A reasonable notice, not less than twenty (20) working days, will be provided to the Association and to the employees subject to layoff, and such notice will be in writing to the Association.
C.	In the event of a layoff within a job classification, probationary employees within that job classification within a care center as defined above shall be laid off first without regard to their individual period of employment. Non-probationary employees, in the care center, shall be next to be laid off on the basis of their bargaining unit seniority. Employees transferred or promoted into a new position will be treated as non-probationary employees for the purpose of layoff.
Employees subject to layoff who had been promoted previously from a staff nurse position will first be assigned to vacant staff nurse positions within their care center if qualified to perform the duties of the position as defined in (2) above. If there are no vacant positions within the care center, such employees may utilize their bargaining unit seniority to bump the least senior staff nurse within their care center if qualified to perform the duties of the position as defined in (2) above.
D.	In the event employees in the same job classification are scheduled to be laid off in one care center, and there exists a vacant position in another care center which the employees are qualified to perform, then bargaining unit seniority shall prevail in assigning such employees scheduled to be laid off to such vacant jobs.
E.	If there are no vacant positions in the same job classification, then the employee may bump the least senior employee in that job classification, or in any other job classification covered by this Agreement, provided the employee is qualified to perform the duties of that position as defined in (2) above.
F.	At no point may a less senior employee bump a more senior employee regardless of job classification. There shall be no more than two (2) bumps as the result of any one employee's position being eliminated.
G.	It is expressly agreed that the mechanism of layoffs, including the bumping procedure, will not be detrimental to the operation of a department, due to the significant depletion of experienced nurses. To that end, a Joint Committee of Council members and Nursing Administration will work on recommendations for the establishment of minimum numbers of Registered Nurses with skills required to maintain a specific clinical unit's standard for safe, specialized care, due to
19
layoffs. The Vice President, Nursing will have the final right to decide on the implementation of the advisory recommendations.
H.	In the event an employee originally scheduled to be laid off does not wish to exercise her/his right to bump or accept a vacant position per this section, such employee shall be deemed to be laid off.
I.	In all cases where a position is offered to an affected employee, the Employer shall make its best efforts to offer the employee a comparable position, which is defined as the same shift and number of hours within the same care center.
J.	Employees who accept non-comparable positions and apply for posted vacant positions, for which they are qualified as determined by the Vice President, Nursing, shall be given preference in filling such vacancies. Where two (2) or more such employees are under consideration for the same position, section 4.10, Seniority: Application, shall apply.
K.	In the event of a layoff, the Employer will not replace a laid off employee in a Care Center where there are no vacancies, with a per diem employee or combination of per diem employees on a regular basis. Per diem employees may be scheduled in the event of an emergency as defined in Section 5.03 Work Obligation: Employee.
5.07 Recall
Whenever a vacancy occurs in a job classification within a care center, employees from that care center who are on layoff in that classification shall be recalled in accordance with their bargaining unit seniority within their classification in reverse order in which they were laid off. If a vacancy occurs in a job classification where no employee in that classification from that care center has recall rights, then the laid off employee with the most bargaining unit seniority will be recalled if he/she is qualified to do the work and if not, the next senior employee will be recalled and so on. Employees shall remain on the recall list for two (2) years.
Probationary employees who have been laid off have no recall privileges.
A part-time employee on layoff shall have recall rights to a full-time position only if he/she is willing to work the required full-time schedule of hours.
5.08 Alternate Workday and Workweek
Full-time employees assigned to work scheduling patterns whereby they work fewer than five (5) days a week but more than seven and one-half (7-1/2) hours a day will have their paid time off including holidays, personal business days, vacation days, sick leave, leave for death in family, marriage leave, paternity leave and adoption leave pursuant to paragraphs 7.01, 7.04, 7.05, 7.09, 7.11, 7.12, 7.13 and 7.19 converted to an hourly basis for utilization purposes. Employees assigned to work scheduling patterns under this paragraph will have rest periods, as provided in 7.16, scheduled on a pro rata basis and meal period as per Section 8.01.
A committee consisting of management and Council members will continue to propose guidelines for the implementation of alternative workday and workweek schedules.
5.09 Employment Security
An employee hired into a hospital budgeted position prior to January 1, 2003, shall not be subject to layoff during the term of this agreement except in the event of: closure
20
of beds for a sustained >• period, reduction or elimination of programs, any consequential reduction in reimbursement rates or a reduction in inpatient discharges/outpatient visits.
The Employer agrees not to layoff an incumbent bargaining unit employee in a hospital budgeted position for the purposes of replacing such employee with a non-RN position.
In addition, the Employer agrees not to reassign incumbent inpatient and outpatient hospital budgeted bargaining unit employees for the purpose of replacing them with unlicensed or unregistered personnel except in the event of a clinical programmatic change.
The Employer will notify the Association thirty (30) days prior to the replacement of an RN under this section and agrees to meet with the Association to discuss the replacement.
If there is a dispute under this section, the Association must file for expedited arbitration with the American Arbitration Association within five (5) working days of notification. The American Arbitration Association will assign the case to the first available arbitrator of those identified. However, if a decision by an arbitrator is not rendered to the contrary within seventy-five (75) days after notification of the
1	Association, the Employer may implement its decision.
An RN who is placed in another bargaining unit position as a result of his or her position being eliminated will have the same orientation as an employee who transfers into such position.
For purposes of this section, Clinical Programmatic change will solely refer to:
1)	change in type of patient population;
2)	change in acute care to sub. acute care;
3)	a demonstrated change in patient acuity within an area of clinical practice as the result of a change in clinical modality.
