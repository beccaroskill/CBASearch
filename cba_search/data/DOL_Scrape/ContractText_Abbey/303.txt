In addition the parties agree that the team concept inherently promotes work assignment rotation within a group environment, benefiting the individual, the team, and the organization.
The parties agree to explore alternatives and implement best practices as it relates to Work Assignment Rotation within a team or supervisory unit, inclusive but not limited to:
a.	Requiring employees to rotate assignments as prescribed by the Team Leader.
b.	Seniority does not dictate work assignments within the Team as it relates to work assignment rotation within the Team.

(89)	The Parties discussed at length the importance of achieving improvements in plant competitiveness to help assure viability for the Toledo Assembly Plant and for its employees.
To this end, the Parties agreed that repairmen can work off tags, work off travelers, and/or work at the instruction of supervisors, all for the common purpose of assuring a high quality product that is attractive to the consumer.
(90)	Additionally, the Parties agreed that employees, such as repairmen, must be able to “seek and repair” the product as it goes through their work areas.
In implementing the terms of “seek and repair” it is understood this may result in excess manpower on certain inspection assignments. Should this occur, the Parties agreed that the following procedure will be followed to address the situation:
a.	No attritional transactions (quits, discharges, retirements, deaths, bidding out, etc.) will be filled from the impacted position to aid in the leveling process.

Paragraph 7—Reduced Classifications
(91)	Understanding the need to continuously improve productivity and efficiency of operations relative to Safety, Quality, Delivery, Cost and Morale, the parties agree to
28
reduce and/or combine classifications where operationally feasible with consideration to the following criteria:

(92)	Non-skilled classifications shall be reduced to reflect and support expanded employee basic responsibilities. Non-skilled classifications may be limited to five (5) classifications.
Skilled Trades Classifications
(93)	Skilled Trades classifications shall be effectively reduced to reflect the consolidation of former M.E.S.A. classifications with UAW, Local 12 in addition to minimizing traditional lines of demarcation with respect to job responsibilities.

(96)	The lime required in relation to the principal job is relatively short. The employee has the capability to perform tasks. The work can be performed safely.
29
(97)	The parties agree to discuss and objectively assess flexible work practices in an effort to maximize operational efficiency relative to expanding employee basic responsibilities inclusive of incidental non-skilled work and non-production support traditionally performed by Skilled Trades. Skilled Trades job responsibilities will be focused but not limited to supporting production activity.
(98)	Disputes arising from the above understanding may be referred to the Chairman of the Shop Committee and the Union Relations Supervisor for expeditious resolution.
(99)	The parties shall attempt to resolve disputes outside the grievance procedure. Unresolved matters may, after joint good-faith efforts have failed, be ultimately referred to the grievance procedure for resolution.
2003 Operational Understandings Addendum
(100)	a. The parties acknowledged and agreed the separate and distinct agreement applicable to Daimler Chrysler’s Toledo Assembly Plant and UAW Local 12 is premised on an environment emphasizing jointness and world-class operational flexibility. As such, the provisions of this agreement will remain in place for a period of eight (8) years expiring November 14, 2011, and are not subject to change other than with respect to economic issues such as wages and benefits.
b.	The infrastructure and operational approach going forward will require employees to begin adopting new roles and institute training to ensure the successful transformation and migration to a world class competitive operation following ratification of this agreement.
c.	A primary consideration within the contemplated work assignments is the continued evolution of assignments in which team members will be
30
assigned in small groups of approximately 4 to 8 members on average and rotate fully within these assignments on a schedule designed by the LEPC. Team members will engage in problem solving and continuous improvement activities to support the implementation and maintenance of lean manufacturing principles inclusive of waste elimination, standardized work, cost reduction efforts, quality control, and process measures.
d.	In order to facilitate the continuous improvement philosophy all team members will be expected to engage in design, fabrication and installation on line-side operator support devices without being restricted to traditional lines of demarcation. Operators will also be responsible for the performance of preventive maintenance checks as developed by Team Coordinators and Team Leaders in conjunction with Team Members. These duties will include but are not limited to visual inspection, checking and adjusting equipment, TPM (Total Preventive Maintenance), and maintaining a clean work area including sweeping and maintenance, and the performance of related tasks during downtime and after production requirements have been met.
e.	The parties further agreed that work assignments would continue to be by natural work groups with a migration plan to two (2) classifications across both facilities for non-skilled and minimal skilled hourly classifications consistent with other world class operations. Team Leaders will be responsible for on-the-job-training for other team members in order to attain the versatility necessary to support full rotation and facilitate absentee coverage wherein the Team Leader will be primary replacement.
31
f.	In order to maintain the competitiveness of the operation and to address the needs of the market, several operating patterns may be instituted to ensure consumer demands for our products are met. The normal operating pattern and four (4)-day work week operating pattern includes a total of thirty-(30) minutes relief and five-(5) minute team meeting per shift, unless specifically noted to the contrary below.
g.	Relief minutes for operating shifts in excess of eight (8) hours will be calculated on a pro-rata basis.
Normal Operating Pattern:
•	Stickney — New Facility: Mandatory ten (10) hours per day, two (2) out of three (3) Saturdays.
•	TNAP: One (1) and two (2) shift operations may be scheduled up to ten (10) hours each & two (2) Saturdays per month from January to April with ten (10) hour mandatory weekday schedule & one (1) Saturday per month from May to December.
•	During launch of new products, mandatory ten (10) hour weekday schedule and two (2) out of three (3) Saturdays may be scheduled for a period of one (1) year from full volume production.
•	4 / I0’s: A four (4) day, ten (10) hour shift work pattern whereby the 9th and 10th hour are paid at straight time.
•	AWS: Three (3) eight (8) hour shift work pattern. AWS Relief Schedule: Thirty-five (35) minutes total relief time during eight (8) hour shift. Employees will receive a fifteen (15) minute paid lunch payment. Team Communication, as required, will be addressed during the relief period.
32
h.	Staffing vacancies and replacement process will be completed by enabling one primary move to a Team. Initial employee assignments will remain in place for a period of 2 years after full launch to support the investment in training and to ensure quality. All Team Members will be expected to participate and implement training in problem solving, standardized work practices, lean manufacturing concepts, conflict resolution, quality and inspection systems, pull systems concepts, safety and ergonomic applications.
i.	Recognizing operational flexibility is critical to the success of new and continuing operations in Toledo; the Company will communicate and implement an Attendance policy consistent with other world-class manufacturing operations. Temporary workers will continue to be utilized to cover high absences, vacations, launch requirements, etc. Employees will also be subject to a mandatory call-in procedure to assist with unscheduled absenteeism and its negative impact on product quality and process conformance. Absenteeism data may be posted by the team.
j.	In addition, modular assembly of major components at both facilities will be required in order to meet variable cost, investment, quality targets and floor space requirements. Incremental sourcing at TNAP will include front end modules, cradles, suspension assembly, door system modules, tire and wheel assembly and fascias. It is contemplated Stickney will mirror TNAP in this regard. Additionally a rolling chassis module is also planned for the Wrangler replacement model.
k.	The following non-core work will be performed by outside services at Stickney concurrent with
33
the deactivation of Parkway Operations.
•	Janitorial Services
•	Fire Prevention
•	Jitney Repair / Truck Garage
•	Medical Services (Nurses)
I.	The following non-core services will also be phased out at TNAP beginning coincident with Parkway operations deactivation, and will be completed no later than July 2008.
•	Fire Prevention
•	Medical Services
m.	Notwithstanding the above, Paint Booth Cleaning will be performed by an outside service coincident with the launch of a third shift.
n. As discussed previously the Stickney business case will require a Supplier Park arrangement in order to be viable. In the event that a third party provides investment and/or operates, Body and Paint facilities normally contained within a traditional OEM Manufacturing facility, employees would be employed by a third party and covered by Agreement(s) that mirror the Toledo UAW-DaimlerChrysler Agreement in terms of wages and benefits, and will likely be represented by the UAW.
o.	Individuals employed by Supplier Park firms providing direct or indirect services (including rolling chassis) to the new facility will be provided wages & benefits competitive with other Tier II firms supplying such products or services. The UAW or other unions will likely represent these firms.
34
p.	The Company acknowledges the UAW’s commitment to the continued development of an effective relationship between the parties and believes the provisions contained in this letter can serve as the foundation for future success and job security of employees represented by the Union. The terms and conditions of the Agreement will apply to all Chrysler Group, Toledo Jeep Manufacturing Operations.

Costs will be paid by the Plant. If the report of the independent physician places work restrictions or limitations on the employee equal to or greater than those previously placed on him by the plant physician, there shall be no retroactive pay. If the report or decision places work restrictions or limitations on the employee which are less than those previously placed on him by the plant physician, retroactive pay, if any, shall be limited to the period beginning with the day of the final examination by the independent physician and shall be calculated as provided in Article V.

The independent physician shall be selected by the Chairman of the Executive committee and the Union Relations Supervisor within seven (7) working days from the date the dispute arose. The employee shall submit to a physical examination by the independent physician who shall submit a written report of his findings and conclusions. Costs of such examination shall be paid by the Plant. The decision of the inde

(228)	If the basis of moving such work is equipment and not the cost of running the operation, the Company will make every effort to secure the machinery and keep the work in the plant. Failing to secure such needed equipment, whenever the Company becomes in financial condition to do so, the same issue may be again brought up for negotiations, and it will attempt to bring in work that is now being done on the outside whenever this is practicable at a comparable or lesser cost, it being understood that the cost of additional machinery must be amortized by the savings effected in the manufacture
68
of a reasonable number of the uniis that we can expect to manufacture.
(229)	It is also understood that when a patented article that cannot be made in the Company’s plant is found to effect savings or be more desirable in advancing the sale of the product than the article manufactured in the Company’s plant, the patented article will be procured after complying with the first sections of this paragraph.
(230)	It is further understood that the Company will endeavor to secure additional work of a more diversified nature so that the seasonal slack periods can be eliminated as far as practicable.
(231)	In the view of the mutual benefit to both the Company and the Union by effecting savings in the manufacture of the Company’s products in order to make them more competitive and to secure less interrupted operation, the Executive Committee agrees to study from time to time and conscientiously endeavor to meet the costs of any operation brought to the Executive Committee’s attention by the Company as being higher than the Company’s studies indicate it should be. In such cases, a reduction could be made in the labor cost, not withstanding any other paragraph in this Agreement.
69
ARTICLE XI OVERTIME
Paragraph 1—Overtime Scheduling
(232)	The parties have earnestly sought during negotiations of the Agreement dated September 4, 1990, feasible steps that the Corporation might take in scheduling employees for overtime work so as not to impair the Corporation’s ability to produce sufficient numbers of quality vehicles that are fully competitive on a worldwide basis.
(233)	The following represents the Agreement reached to permit the Corporation to schedule reasonable overtime to achieve its production needs in a timely manner. Therefore, employees shall be required to work scheduled overtime in accordance with the provisions set forth below:
a.	Overtime hours shall be equalized among employees on the same classification and performing like work on the same shift and in the same department (including holidays).
b.	Daily overtime will be worked by the employee on the job.
c.	Daily overtime hours in excess of nine (9) shall be voluntary. When daily overtime work is required, Management will provide three (3) hours notice before the end of the shift. When overtime work is scheduled for Saturday, Management will endeavor to give notice two (2) hours before the end of the shift on Thursday of overtime work on Saturday and to give notice two (2) hours before the end of the shift on Friday of overtime work on Sunday. It is understood that notice of scheduled overtime will be given to the Union at the Executive Committee Room and by bulletin board postings to employees of the affect
70
ed department. Failure to give such notice will relieve an employee of the obligation to work overtime. The Local Union and Plant Management shall provide for exceptions to such minimum notice requirements in emergencies or situations in which it is not practical or feasible for management to provide the agreed minimum notice (e.g., breakdowns, interruptions of electric or other essential services, delayed delivery of necessary parts of materials, or other such identifiable emergencies). If the Local Union and the Plant Management are unable to reach agreement as hereinbefore set forth, they shall refer the matter to the International Union and Corporate Union Relations.
d.	When an employee has worked two consecutive Saturdays, the employee may be off the third Saturday provided:
1.	The employee has not been absent on any day during the week proceeding such Saturday.
2.	The employee notifies his supervisor before the end of his shift on (i) the preceding Monday or (ii) any later day of the week on which the employee is notified that he is scheduled to work Saturday.
e.	Overtime work on Sunday shall be voluntary.
(234)	The Corporation may designate for a period of ninety (90) days any component operations in the plant as critical once during the term of the Agreement. Once those operations are designated as critical, overtime for such operation(s) will be required as scheduled. Management will give the Union fifteen (15) days advance notice of its intent to invoke this Agreement.

The recommendations of the Local Ergonomics Committee shall be mutually agreed upon with the Plant Shop Chairman and the Labor Relations Supervisor. Problems not resolved at the local level will be forwarded to the National Joint Committee for final resolution. Jobs considered potential candidates for administrative control practices will be reviewed by the health and safety train-
94
er/ergonomic analyst to determine that the original condition will not be further aggravated. Any type of control established should be evaluated after three (3) months of its implementation to confirm its effectiveness.
(D)	Job Analysis and Time Lines
Jobs will be identified as candidates for analysis by reviewing injury/illness and lost time data, including the “54-08” Report and appropriate OHM report(s). A good faith effort shall be made to conduct an initial job analysis, as required, within two (2) months of when a job is identified as having a potential MSD risk factor. Each facility will use a documentation process to record progress with ergonomic modification efforts. In that regard, a monthly report will be required of the Local Ergonomic Committee to be forwarded to Corporate OSH and the UAW DaimlerChrysler Department. Each facility shall implement feasible measures to control MSD risk factors. A good faith effort will be made to implement ergonomic solutions within a six (6) month time frame after the Local Ergonomics Committee determines that corrective action is required and it prioritizes the remediation. The parties acknowledge that there may be times when it may take longer than six (6) months to make the proper correction, and the reasons need to be documented. The Local Ergonomics Committee is to develop a “top five” list of the most concerning jobs requiring remediation. Factors to be considered for placing a job on the “top five” list shall include injury rates, ErgoPAL scores, lost work time rates and investment cost paybacks.
The LEC will work aggressively to find practical, feasible, economical solutions to the “top five” list. In the event that a Local Ergonomics Committee believes that a facility is not making proper technical resources 95
from the plant available, it should raise the issue with the LEPC. If not resolved, the matter should be referred to the National Employee Participation Council (NEPC) for immediate resolution.
(E)	Ergonomic Support Equipment
Seats, chairs and mats are considered appropriate solutions to control ergonomic risk factors. The Corporation agrees that it will not remove ergonomic support equipment that is currently in use for ergonomic reasons without mutual agreement with the Local Ergonomics Committee.
(F)	Program Management
The Corporation will continue to support a medical management program for early detection, treatment and placement of employees with MSD’s.
The NJC will continue to review and, when necessary, revise audit procedures in an effort to ensure the effectiveness of the ergonomic process. The NJC will also review periodic reports of the occurrence of cumulative trauma from all UAW represented facilities. Problems arising regarding the proper functioning of Local Ergonomics Committees may be referred to the NJC for review and resolution by appropriate Corporate and Union representatives.
The NJC will continue to develop and sponsor an annual conference, subject to the Joint Activities Board approval, for all designated Local Ergonomics Committee members to disseminate information about state-of-the-art application, to review project funding procedures and other ergonomic administrative matters and to share information on successful local ergonomics projects.
Acceptable new methods of employee training, medical evaluation, and Ergonomics Committee training will be
96
evaluated and implemented by the NJC, as appropriate, to assure efficient control of MSD’s. New workable ergonomic concepts, including specific technical information, will be distributed by the NJC to all UAW-represented plants. A video library of corrective actions taken regarding ergonomic problem areas, by various DaimlerChrysler facilities with documentation for dissemination to facilities will be maintained at the National Training Center.
The parties recognized that ergonomic activities are being conducted at many DaimlerChrysler facilities, including ergonomics committees established during the previous agreements. It is not the intent of the parties to reduce any currently existing efforts in ergonomics.
This procedure shall not preclude the filing of a Health and Safety Grievance at Step 1 of the Grievance Procedure.
The parties are hopeful that by providing these resources, positive gains in employee morale, injury rates, quality and costs will be realized.

An employee permanently separated or promoted to a salaried classification shall receive any remaining unused Paid Absence Allowance within thirty (30) days after the Corporation receives notification of his separation or promotion.
(f)-An employee disabled from work by compensable injury or legal occupational disease shall accrue credit toward pay periods worked for pay periods he would otherwise have been scheduled to work during the period of compensable disability provided such employee works at least three (3) days in a pay period in the eligibility year.

This list will be used by the Company to offer overtime from Monday through Sunday and reflect a two (2) week lag to current hours of each week. If an employee is bypassed through an error on the above list, it is agreed that no penalty will be incurred by the Company but the employee(s) will be offered the next overtime available in the department to make up the difference.
(385)	Employees eligible to work overtime shall not be bumped off their regular shift or a job secured under provisions of Section 16.
(386)	In the event an employee refuses overtime when offered he shall be charged with the overtime he would have earned had he worked.

Employees shall make their shift preference known in writing to their supervisor with a copy to the steward. Assignments made pursuant thereto shall be made as soon thereafter as practicable, but that such assignment will be effective on Mondays. When employees are assigned to a shift in accordance with their shift preference, they shall be required to remain on that shift for a six (6) month period, seniority permitting.
(390)	The ensuing vacancy created by this shift transfer will be bid plantwide by classification and seniority provided the employee has the ability to perform the work.

Outside Contracting Review Team
October, 2003
Mr. Lloyd Mahaffey
Regional Director - Region 2B UAW Maumee, OH 43537
Dear Sir:
During the 2003 Toledo-Jeep Negotiations, the parties discussed at great length matters pertaining to outside contracting notification. In particular, the Union cited many instances where certain in-house non-project work was performed by outside contractors and the local union was not afforded the opportunity to discuss with Management outside contracting arrangements due to “time and circumstance” preventing advance notification.
The parties agree that meaningful discussion can only occur between Management and the Union when the outside contracting arrangement is known in a timely fashion. Likewise, it is understood by the parties that emergency situations will arise where time and circumstances may prevent advance notification and discussion.
The parties recognize there is a need for constructive progress in communication for a complete understanding and cooperation of our contractual requirements in this regard. Therefore, the parties agree that an Outside Contracting Review Team be established on the local plant level consisting of the Plant Union Relations Supervisor, the Plant Manufacturing Engineering Manager, the Chairman and the Local Skilled Trades Committee Representative. The Outside Contracting Review Team shall meet on a regular and recurring basis to review cur-
142
n
rent maintenance and construction programs and plans for the facility.
■ The review process will be a positive approach for sharing information on manpower skills, equipment, and facilities to do the work competitively in quality, cost and perform-■ ance, and within projected time limits.
In a further effort to ensure all relevant considerations ■ have been reviewed by the Company and Union prior to letting an outside contract for the performance of skilled maintenance and construction work, the parties have prepared a checklist to guide the local review of potential out-■ side contracting matters. The checklist is to be used in conjunction with the Outside Contracting Review Team Meetings and is intended to assist in the advance discus-sion of projects other than those of an emergency nature.

Outside Contractor Property

Dear Sir:
During the course of these negotiations, the Union expressed concern pertaining to contractor equipment, trailers/cribs and vehicles remaining on-site following the completion of a contract or project. In particular, the Union believes outside contractor property left on sight increases or perpetuates the amount of work being performed by said outside parties which infringes on work customarily performed by Toledo Assembly Plant Skilled Trades personnel.
The Company informed the Union it would closely monitor the amount and content of outside contractor property on-site. In addition, the Company and Union will continue to address outside contracting issues pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Specific instances of outside contractors performing work which the Union believes to be contrary to contractual requirements will be referred to the Union Relations Supervisor for expeditious resolution.

Warranty and Service Agreements

H Toledo, Ohio
■ ■ H ■ ■ ■ ■ ■
Dear Sir:
During the 2002 negotiations, there was considerable discussion regarding the subject of warranty and service agreements. The Union expressed serious concern relative to warranty arrangements that extend beyond those customarily provided by suppliers and certain service contracts. They further asserted that certain locations fail to provide the Union with proper notice when suppliers are in the plant to perform particular warranty or service agreement work, especially during off-shifts and overtime periods. The Corporation reaffirmed that good business practice includes the use of warranty arrangements sufficient to assure that equipment purchased by the Corporation performs according to specifications required by the purchase contract. The Corporation further explained that to remain globally competitive, it must be able to utilize warranty arrangements and/or service contracts ordinarily provided by suppliers.
In an effort to address the Union’s concerns, it is agreed that any time a supplier visits a facility to perform warranty or service agreement work, as provided in the purchase agreement between the parties, the Union will be notified and an employee on that shift with the appropriate skilled trades classification will be assigned with the supplier. Additionally, in the event other employees from
145
the same supplier are performing different warranty or service agreement work in other areas of the plant, an employee with the appropriate skilled trades classification will be assigned with the supplier. The purpose of this assignment is for the employee to receive training, become familiar with the new equipment, and to help ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities to our skilled trades upon expiration of the warranty and/or service agreements.	f
Where concerns or abuses are cited by either party regarding the aforementioned understanding, such matters will be discussed in Outside Contracting Review Team Meetings in an attempt to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution.

Dear Sir:

During the negotiations, of the 2003 DaimlerChrysler-UAW (Jeep) Agreement, the Corporation reaffirmed its commitment for the replacement of personal tools of Skilled Trades employees broken or damaged on the job.
The Corporation informed the Union that the practice will continue during the term of the 2003 Agreement whereby the Corporation will repair or replace tools broken on the job by hourly Skilled Trades employees provided there is no evidence of employee negligence, abuse or improper usage, with the following limitations:
1)	The maximum amount expended for the repair or replacement of any one tool shall not exceed $300.00, and;
2)	The maximum amount expended at each plant in each year shall not exceed an amount equal to $10.00 multiplied by the total number of hourly Skilled Trades employees on the active roll at the plant in the last pay period ending in the month of June preceding the beginning of each year of the Agreement.
The local plant will be required to establish a repair or replacement of broken tool procedure whereby skilled trades employees may arrange for the repair or replace
149
ment of broken tools through the plant tool crib system. Any costs above $300.00 for the repair or replacement of a broken tool will be the responsibility of the skilled trades employee.

Apprentice Development
November, 2003 Attention: Mr. Lloyd Mahaffey
Dear Sir:
During the 2003 negotiations, the Corporation and the Union discussed at great length the current status of the Apprenticeship Program.
The Union and the Company acknowledged that skilled trades personnel provide vital support to operations, and that there is a direct relationship between the effectiveness of skilled trades personnel and the success and viability of the operations they serve. Establishing new levels of competence within the apprenticeable trades through training and retraining will permit the Union and the Corporation to pursue the critical objective of continuous improvement in quality, flexibility, operational effectiveness and, in turn, enhance job security.
The parties also discussed that in view of the fact that a number of skilled trades employees are currently on layoff and/or protected status the need for new Apprentices during the term of the Agreement is diminished.
Consistent with these discussions and in response to current skilled trades demographics, potential future retirements, and attrition, the Corporation has agreed to review the need for additional apprentices, and during the term of the 2003 Agreement, business conditions permitting, will place (sixteen) 16 apprentices in the program. The distribution of Apprentices may be equally allocated on an annual basis beginning in 2005. The Corporation will place the new Apprentices into the core trades that are
151
representative of the skill sets present in world class automotive manufacturing operations in the United States. Based on a semiannual review, should the Corporation determine it cannot meet this objective, the Corporation will provide the Union the reasons it cannot meet the objective, and the parties will make an adjustment to the objective as appropriate. Every effort will be made to manage the flow of accessions to facilitate the orderly scheduling of core skills training for new Apprentices.

It is also understood that this understanding does not preclude employees in exceeding twelve (12) hours when deemed necessary to ensure operational efficiencies.

Specialized Training

Jeep Unit - UAW Local 12
Toledo, Ohio
Dear Sir:
During the course of negotiations, the Union expressed interest in training for Skilled Trades employees on specialized work assignments currently performed by outside contractors. The parties discussed this at length within the framework of the necessity to remain competitive in a global automotive industry. In the past, many challenges arose a result of pre-existing barriers such as overtime, manpower movement, etc. that prevented the Company from fully utilizing its Skilled Trades workforce. The Company and the Union were in accord that the lack of flexibility threatened its ability to be truly competitive.
The common goal of the Company and the Union is to become a world-class manufacturer and the benchmark of the industry. Intense foreign and domestic pressures have forced both parties to find new ways of doing business. To that end, a commitment was made to explore opportunities to better utilize its existing workforce and expound upon the current knowledge base. The parties agreed to finalize a business case for specialized training which provides for creative ways to utilize those skills to enhance the business enterprise. Specialized training and improved processes to better utilize our workforce also corresponds to the goal of migration toward Skilled Trades teams.
To maintain operating efficiencies while facilitating
164
sophisticated training, new ways of assigning work have to be adopted. In order to enhance cooperative efforts and to create a framework promoting teamwork and non-adversarial communication while sustaining an environment that promotes constructive problem solving, the following guidelines were agreed to as a result of the discussions:
•	The parties acknowledge the necessity to maintain and ■ continue to develop certain specialized skill sets such as vibration analysis, spraymation lab, infrared analysis, facility walkthrough, etc. in addition to developing new types of specialized skill sets such as fiber optics instal-lation (all communication wires) and torque gun sys-terns.
•	Employees who accept work assignments that require B specialized training will be required to stay in their current work assignment for eighteen (18) months from the completion date of the training.
Employees who possess specialized skills and accept new work assignments will be retained in their current work assignment until a replacement is fully trained and proficient in the necessary subject matter.
Employees who possess specialized skills may be scheduled to any shift out of line of seniority or overtime hours as well as assigned to other forms of alternate work schedules.

Full Utilization of Skilled Trades

Mr. Lloyd Mahaffey
Regional Director - Region 2B UAW
1691 Woodlands Drive
Maumee, OH 43537
In our negotiations leading to the Production and Maintenance Agreement dated today, we discussed in great detail the meaning of full utilization of Skilled Trades manpower, as referenced in Letter (209) Full Utilization of Skilled Trades, during periods when outside contractors are being utilized to perform work on the plant premises.
The Union insisted that the Company do everything it can to “perform maintenance, construction and tool & die work with its own employees,” placing “primary reliance on its own skilled trades employees”, “fully utilize its seniority employees,” and maintain “maximum employment opportunity”, and “always keep the interest of our personnel in mind”.
In response to this matter, the Corporation assured the Union that its policy is to fully utilize its own employees to perform maintenance, tool & die, and construction work provided skilled trades employees are available to work and can complete the project under review consistent with cost and timing parameters as well as supporting production requirements of the plant.
The parties agreed the definition of “full utilization” may not necessarily be limited to skilled trades employees
173
working five (5) days per week, eight (8) hours per day but, also, is not necessarily seven (7) days per week, twelve (12) hours per day but may extend to daily, weekend and other overtime periods, when outside contractors are on the plant premises and are performing work customarily and historically performed by UAW bargaining unit personnel.
Any alleged abuses of the aforementioned may be referred to Corporate Union Relations and the UAW DaimlerChrysler Representatives to assist in resolving these issues.

During our discussions relative to outside contracting, the utilization of DaimlerChrysler skilled trades employees has been a matter of mutual concern. Although no agreement was reached regarding the definition of “full utilization”, the parties did agree that the appropriate forum in which to address this issue is at the local level, in conjunction with the outside contracting review process. It was indicated that the definition of full utilization will vary from location to location, depending upon the circumstances of each contract, including the number of skilled personnel involved, the number of hours allocated to the project, and the extent to which outside contractors are contemplated for utilization on weekend work.
The parties agreed that the following additional considerations may also bear on the definition of full utilization:
i)	Whether a contractor will perform work on overtime during the workweek and/or on a weekend.
ii)	Whether skilled trades employees are on layoff or in Protected status.
iii)	The necessity for specialized equipment not readily available at a cost which, when added to other factors, exceeds the cost of a contractor performing the work and/or contractor work skill sets or competencies that the Company may not possess.
175
iv)	The percentage of affected trades, if any, to be assigned work along with outside contractors.
v)	The requisite number of plant skilled trades employees available and/or willing to work overtime during the workweek and/or on a weekend which may be required to complete the project under review, consistent with cost and timing parameters.
Although no one of these considerations is necessarily controlling, each may be instrumental in assisting the parties in determining whether the skilled trades workforce is fully utilized as that concept relates to the decision to use an outside contractor.
Very truly yours

■	Dear Sir:
From time to time, circumstances may arise whereby there is a temporary shortage of qualified employees to cover changes in manpower levels. In discussing the issue ■I of supplemental employees for the Engineering and Office seniority groups, the parties agreed that it may be desirable to establish a supplemental work force. The supple-■ mental work force candidates will be comprised of qualified, active and laid off Jeep Unit employees. The supplemental employees will be used to augment temporary skill shortages in the Engineering and Office groups resulting ■ from temporary circumstances such as sick leaves or vacations.
Accordingly, the parties shall meet at a mutually agreed ■ upon time to establish such groups, qualifications, and terms of the program.

Suppliers in the Plant - Engineering
October 3, 2003
Mr. Nick Vuich
Chairman
Jeep Unit - UAW Local 12
Toledo, Ohio
Dear Sir:
During these negotiations, the Union expressed concern for the security of its membership and frustration over certain communication issues as well as complaints over the job assignments of non-Toledo Assembly personnel while in the plant.
The Company agrees that early involvement in special projects is key to a smooth transition from concept, to build, to launch and sustainment.
In an effort to address these issues and to utilize the Bargaining Unit Engineer’s considerable expertise, the Bargaining Unit Engineers will be utilized in project planning as early in the process as possible.
It is further understood that when supplier or nonBargaining Unit personnel perform tasks on the plant floor related to their product, they will work in liaison with Bargaining Unit Engineers, including advance communication, when the work in question has historically been done by represented employees. The intent of this advance communication with an appropriate represented Engineer is to allow for the clarification of roles and responsibilities and to prevent unannounced entry into the plant by supplier employees.
200
■
addition, communication will be enhanced through department meetings with the O, C, and E ■Committeeman or his representative, whereby the parties will share upcoming project information, estimated duration, and forecasted disciplines.
■The parties recognize that the future success of Toledo Assembly, its employees and the members of Local 12-Jeep Unit depend upon the cooperative effort of all con-Uperned in building a world-class vehicle.
Sincerely,

Memorandum of Understanding — Flexible Operating Patterns
Mr. Nick Vuich UAW Local 12 Jeep Unit Toledo, OH
Dear Mr. Vuich:
December 16, 2003
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the need for the Corporation to be flexible and adaptive to rapid changes in customer demand in the market place. When implemented, Flexible Operating Patterns will allow the Company to increase competitiveness, provide greater job security for our employees, more efficiently utilize assets and improve profitability.
This letter will confirm our understanding regarding models for the Alternative Work Schedule (AWS), and Four Day Work Week Flexible Operating Patterns (FOP’s).
It is anticipated that the AWS, a three crew three shift work pattern, will be appropriate for implementation when customer demand dictates a need for incremental production capacity. With this work pattern, employees would receive thirty-five (35) minutes relief, and will receive Fifteen (15) minutes pay for lunch. Team communication, as required, will be addressed during the relief period.
The Four Day Work Week is suitable in situations where more efficient plant operations can be realized with the additional benefit of a shorter work week for our employees.
204
Dependent on customer demand for our vehicles, the parties agreed that the Corporation at its discretion may implement either the Alternative Work Schedule. Implementation of the Four Day Work Week will require advance discussion and approval of the plant LEPC. The applicable administration guidelines for these Flexible Operating Patterns are attached.
It is further understood that in implementing a Flexible Operating Pattern, the Management would not prejudice its exclusive right to schedule and determine the working hours pursuant to Article III, Paragraph I of the Agreement, or its exclusive right, subject to the provisions of the Agreement, to assign and schedule manpower to work a regular five (5) day, eight (8) hour schedule with daily overtime and weekend work.

ALTERNATIVE WORK SCHEDULE
SKILLED EMPLOYEES MAINTENANCE CREWS
During recent discussions relative to the implementation of a three- (3) shift operation the Corporation emphasized the criticalness maintenance has to the continuing success of such a production schedule. The Corporation also explained in detail the necessity of establishing multiple Skilled Employees Maintenance Crews in order to fulfill maintenance requirements, which includes a regularly scheduled workforce for Saturdays and Sundays. In recognition of this need, the Union agreed to the establishment of such Crews in this unique circumstance.
The scheduling of such three (3) shift Crews will be aligned as follows:
•	A Crew: Regularly scheduled for eight (8) hours Monday through Friday, Saturdays will be scheduled as required and Sunday work will be voluntary.
•	B Crew: Regularly scheduled for twelve (12) hours on Sunday and eight (8) hours on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.
•	C Crew: Regularly scheduled for eight (8) hours on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, respectively and twelve (12) hours on Sunday.
In establishing the initial A, B and C Crews, Management will conduct a one (1) time canvass of all current Skilled Employees by seniority, to determine which shift, Crew and Center each employee desires to w'ork. In the event the number of employees selecting the B and C Crews is insufficient to meet manpower requirements, new hire employees may be added to supplement these Crews.
215
The starting times for Skilled Employees will be established pursuant to the recent discussions by the parties. However, Management reserves the right to adjust these times as required and will discuss the matter with the Union in advance of any change.
The starting times for A Crew employees who volunteer to work on Sundays, holidays and changeover will remain the same as the employees regularly assigned start time.
In addition to the above, the following understandings have been agreed upon:
•	When there is a surplus of manpower on one (1) of the respective Crews, volunteers from the affected Crew, or, in the absence of volunteers, the least seniority employees from such Crew will be reduced up to the number needed and assigned to fill an available opening on another Crew.
•	If Skilled Employees on the B and C Crews are excused in advance from a regularly scheduled work day, they will be given full consideration to work on their off days provided there is work available in their classification they can perform.
Management further agreed that thirty (30) days prior to the termination of the Alternative Work Schedule, they will meet with the Union and discuss the method to be used in realigning the maintenance workforce.

Dear Sir:
During these negotiations, the parties held extensive discussions regarding the potential impact that Parkway deactivation and other planned actions at the Toledo Complex might have on the current workforce.
Notwithstanding the contemplated product loading and capital investment considerations as well as current income security provisions provided to eligible employees, the Corporation recognizes the need to consider socially responsible programs to address potential layoffs resulting from deactivation of the Parkway facility as well as other planned actions affecting employment levels.
Accordingly, the Company will provide socially responsible programs consistent with the application to employees at facilities covered under the National PM&P Agreement that have been similarly impacted by a sale, deactivation, or plant closing. These programs include but are not limited to:
1.	Eligible employees will be offered an Incentive Program for Retirement (IPR) opportunity comprised of a cash payment and a car voucher that when added will have a gross value for tax purposes of seventy thousand dollars ($70,000).
218
2.	Eligible employees will be offered an opportunity for Early Retirement under the Pension Agreement.
3.	Enhanced credited pension service will be offered when appropriate.
The parties will meet in advance to determine which of these programs apply.

Dear Sir:
As we discussed in the recently concluded contract negotiations, and concurrent with the termination of the current Toledo-Jeep Plant Severance Plan, the excess monies (following the Plans’ asset distribution at 115% of eligible employee entitlement) will become the asset base for the Chrysler VEBA (referenced in the final Offer made to the UAW on July 29, 1997). It is our intention to make a six cent (60) contribution to this Fund, similar to contributions currently made to the Severance Plan.
Further, it is our intention to establish a separate internal account/department into which receipts and disbursements of the VEBA will be made. The administration (Payroll) for the actual training of employees or the actual reduction in Health Care costs will also be assigned to this account.
It is understood that, while the accounts continued contributions are discretionary, the purpose for and utilization of assets contained in this VEBA must continue to be agreed to by the parties.

3.	If, after exhausting the procedure described above, it is determined there is no suitable job for an employee with a PQX coded medical restriction, the employee will be returned to injury leave or laid off as unable to do work available - whichever is applicable.
4.	An employee affected by reason of health or physical handicap shall be required to furnish the Medical Department a doctor’s statement verifying the extent of the disability confirming the claim that his present job is detrimental to his health prior to a transfer or layoff in accordance with the above.

Dear Sir:
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the problems presented by the application and usage of Personal Leaves of ■ Absence as it relates to full protection of operating efficiency.
This letter serves to clarify the understanding reached between the parties regarding Personal Leaves.
^MThe contractual provision for Personal Leaves pre-dates the ^“introduction of the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993. The FMLA provides eligible employees a number of ■ weeks of unpaid, job protection leave for serious health conditions of the employee, the employee’s spouse, child, parent, or for the care of a newborn child.
■	It is understood that Personal Leaves of Absence may be granted for the sole purpose of providing time-off for good cause. Personal Leaves will not be granted for the purpose of ^—supplementing vacation entitlement. Employees who have ■I exhausted their vacation eligibility, above and beyond time reserved for vacation shut-down period, and experience a serious personal hardship which does not qualify for FMLA may
■	continue to request a Personal Leave through their department.
It is further understood that Departmental Management main-■ tains final discretion in approving or disallowing a Personal

Dear Sir:
This will confirm the understanding reached during the present negotiations regarding retired UAW-represented Chrysler employee use of in-plant Employee Fitness Centers. Retirees will be eligible to utilize the in-plant fitness center at the location from which they retired on a space available basis, at nonpeak usage periods, when the local fitness center is in operation. The schedule of usage will be determined by the local joint parties based on factors such as location of the fitness center, present hours of operation, present plant membership usage, and other locally determined criteria. No incremental staffing, equipment, or extension of operating hours will be approved for retiree use of local fitness centers.
Retirees will be required to complete the proper registration process (membership registration, physician consent form, liability waiver, fitness assessment, etc.) that regular employees are required to complete in line with the UAW-Chrysler Fitness Center Guidelines.
It is further understood that nothing contained herein or in existing or future statements concerning Employee Fitness Centers or steps taken to implement its programs and related services shall be construed or interpreted as constituting a waiver of either the Company’s or the Union’s rights or responsibilities under the Collective Bargaining Agreement,
241
nor are the Centers intended in any way to create for any employee or retiree any enforceable obligation against the Company, the Union, or their representatives.
In addition, it is the parties’ intent that any programs, approaches or related services provided in or through employee Fitness centers are not to be construed as benefits or insurance programs.

Employee New Vehicle Purchase Program Ordered Vehides/U.S. Build
September 29, 2003
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Nate Gooden
Dear Sir:
During these negotiations, the Union expressed concern regarding the subject of ensuring vehicles ordered through the Employee New Vehicle Purchase Program for employees are built at the appropriate U.S. plant. The Union cited concerns regarding UAW - Chrysler employees inability to order U.S. made product lines that are simultaneously produced in Mexico. The Company is sensitive to the desires expressed by the Union in this regard, and agrees to the following provision in an effort to accommodate our employees wishes.
The Company agrees, to maintain a system with our scheduling and distribution network that will enable new vehicle orders purchased through the Employee New Vehicle Purchase Program to be programmed to the appropriate U.S. plant if buildable. The Program will be limited to those product lines produced in St. Louis and Warren Truck that are also produced in Mexico. It is understood and agreed that during the course of this Program, periodically the Corporation may be required to move orders due to extenuating circumstances such as, but not limited to, component shortages and production scheduling needs.
In extending this provision of the Employee New Vehicle Purchase Program, it is understood and agreed that the Corporation may at any time modify, change or discontinue
244
this Program and it shall have no obligation to bargain concerning its decision to do so. The Union will be advised in advance of any such action. It is further agreed that the institution of this Program shall not constitute a precedent for future negotiations on this subject.

Equal Application Committee
June, 1997
Jack Sizemore
Region Director - Region 2B UAW 1691 Woodlands Dr
Maumee, OH 43537
Dear Sir:
For many years the Corporation and your Union, in their respective fields, have been leaders in adopting and effectuating policies against discrimination because of race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, status as a qualified person with a disability or membership in any other legally protected class, and to this end the parties have expressly incorporated in their Agreement an “Equal Application” provision that both insures adherence to that principle in all aspects of employment at Chrysler and provides the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure for the resolution of alleged violation of that principle.The parties now recognize the desirability of increased communication and cooperative effort on this subject (i) to encourage employees and grievance representatives to use the contractual method for the prompt resolution of all claims of denial of equal application rights or claims of sexual harassment, (ii) to determine the cause of such claims in order to reduce the probability of these claims arising or recurring, and (iii) to maintain liaison with appropriate federal, provincial and state civil rights agencies for the following purposes: (a) to increase understanding, (b) to promote and encourage the use of the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation in many forums simultaneously which is frequently time consuming, contradictory and hence, nonproductive to relieving employee problems, (c) to seek solutions to mutual problems, (d) to
249
relieve tensions in this area, and (e) to exchange information, expertise and advice.
Accordingly, the parties have established an Equal Application Committee.
At the Toledo Assembly Plant an Equal Application Committee shall be established consisting of up to three (3) representatives of the Local Union and three (3) representatives of Plant Management. The representatives of the Local Union shall be limited to the Unit Chairman, the Unit Vice Chairman, and the Chairman of the Civil Rights Committee of the Local Union or a designate representative. The representatives of Management shall be the Plant Manager, or his designated representative, and two (2) Plant Management representatives at least one of whom is active in the Corporation’s equal employment opportunity program. Local Plant Equal Application Committees shall meet during January, April, July, and November or at times mutually agreed upon, but no fewer than four (4) times a year. Copies of minutes from these meetings will be made available to the Union. Such Union representatives if not on a full time Leave of Absence for Union Business, and if working in the plant, shall receive pay from the Corporation at their regular hourly rates for time spent in such meetings or when jointly investigating and/or studying a complaint with a management member of the Local Plant Equal Application Committee, that they would otherwise have worked in the plant. Local Plant Equal Application Committees shall have the following duties:
A—Recommend to the Unit Chairman and Human Resources Manager ways and means of promoting use of the grievance procedure as the exclusive contractual method for resolving claims of denial of equal application rights.
250
B—Suggest guidelines for Union and Corporation representatives active in the grievance procedure in the proper and prompt handling or grievances alleging such claims.
C—Conduct or arrange for investigations and/or studies into the cause of equal employment opportunity and discrimination problems and tensions in an attempt to prevent such problems from arising.
D—Recommend to the Unit Chairman and Human Resources Manager means for determining the cause of equal application employment opportunities and discrimination problems and tensions in the plant.
The parties continue to recognize their legal and moral responsibility for assuring that all Chrysler employees have equal employment opportunities and freedom from discrimination. Consequently, the function of the Toledo Assembly Plant Equal Application Committees shall be advisory, consultative, and cooperative. While the Corporation and the Union will welcome the recommendations the Committees may make, the Committees may not commit either party to a specific course of action. However, the Union agrees that it will discourage its members form bypassing the grievance and arbitration procedure with respect to any claim or complaint against the Corporation which may be made the subject of a grievance under the contract.

Departmental Transfer Language
December 22, 1987
Dan Twiss, Chairman
Jeep Unit, Local 12
Toledo, Ohio 43657
On December 18, 1987, Company and Union representatives met to discuss a disagreement between the parties regarding the intent of the transfer language of the new agreement.
The union’s position was that the language on inter-depart-mental and intra-departmental transfers and the “Transfers Permitted” letter limited the total number of moves from one opening in each department to six (6) moves, but not the total amount of movement plant wide.
The Company pointed out that the language was clear in limiting the number of manpower moves (intradepartmental, interdepartmental and shift-to-shift) plant-wide, resulting from and opening, to a total of six (6). The Company emphasized that one of its main objectives during negotiations was to limit manpower movement and adopting the union’s interpretation would not accomplish that objective. The company specifically stated that the opening created by the inter-depart-mental transfer described in paragraph “d” of the “Transfer Permitted” letter was not another opening subject to an additional six (6) moves.
After considerable discussion the parties agreed during negotiations that the language limited the number of moves of plantwide as a result of one permanent opening.
The Union pointed out that during negotiations the preliminary discussions resolving the manpower movement issue
252
involved seven (7) moves and the “Transfer Permitted"’ letter only provided for six (6) moves.
The Company and Union agreed to resolve the entire matter by adding one additional move to the (1) inter-departmental transfer provided for in paragraph “d” of the “Transfer Permitted” letter, will be filled by one (1) intra-departmental transfer, from among those applications on file, if any.
Paragraph “F” of the “Transfer Permitted” letter would also necessarily be modified to provide that the seventh (7th), rather than the sixth (6th), “transfer, or less if applicants are not available, the resultant opening will be filled by the Employment Office.”
Schematically the maximum moves would now be as follows: 1. Employee “A” retires from Trim on first shift.
2.	Two (2) intra-departmental transfers on first shift in Trim.
3.	One (I) shift-to-shift transfer in Trim.
4.	Two (2) intra-departmental transfers on second shift in Trim.
5.	One (1) inter-departmental transfer from Body (first shift) to Trim.
6.	One (I) intra-departmental transfer on first shift in Body. Resultant opening in Body filled from Employment Office (other than inter-departmental transfer.)
This letter will be in effect at the Parkway facility until either one of the following occur:
•	Implementation of Team Concept
•	Deactivation

Transfers - Critical Times

During the negotiations the plant pointed out that employee transfers under Article XI would adversely affect product quality and the efficiency of plant operations during certain periods, such as model launch, line speed change, model mix, major production increases and the addition or elimination of a shift, when it is usually impractical to effectuate such transfers.
■ ■
In view of the seriousness of the problems discussed, the parties may mutually agree that employee transfers under Article XI may be suspended during the aforementioned periods. However, the Union and Plant Management may mutually agree to allow employees who are denied transfers during such periods to later displace probationary employees hired in a department before such employees gain seniority provided the efficiency and product quality of the involved departments are not adversely affected.
In any event, it is understood the release of employees from any department shall be subject to the condition that the necessary skills required in that department are fully protected and maintained at all times.

Falsification of Employment Application
February 25, 1977

2300 Ashland Avenue
Toledo, Ohio 43620
Dear Mr. Snyder:
This will confirm the understanding reached during the 1977 Contract Negotiations regarding the termination of an employee’s employment for falsification of information on an employment application.
It was agreed that if the Company discovers that an employee falsified information on an employment application subsequent to the employee’s one (I) year anniversary date, such employee shall not be terminated for such reason.

Reinstatement of Grievances
February 24, 1977
Mr. N. Snyder International Representative United Auto Workers 2300 Ashland Avenue Toledo, Ohio 43620
Dear Mr. Snyder:
Subject to the provisions of Article V, Paragraph 7 of the parties Agreement, in those instances where the UAW’s International Executive Board, Public Review Board, or Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee have reviewed a grievance disposition and found that such disposition was_^_ improperly concluded by the Union body or representative involved, the International Union may so inform the Industrial Relations Director of Jeep Corporation and request in writing that such grievance be reinstituted in the parties’ grievance procedure at the same level at which it was origi-(H nally settled. After receipt of such written request, the grievance will be so reinstituted by the Company.
It is understood by the parties, however, that the Company will not be liable for any back pay claims from the time of original disposition to the time of reinstitution of the griev-i^™ ance, and it is further agreed that the reinstitution of any such|U grievance shall be conditioned upon agreement by the Union and the employee(s) that neither will pursue such back pay claim against the Company.
272
This letter is not to be construed as modifying in any other way either party’s rights or obligations pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement or the final and binding nature of any other grievance resolutions. It is also understood by the parties that this letter of understanding and the Company’s obligation to reinstitute grievance consistent with the conditions set forth above and upon written request from the Union, can be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) day notice in writing, to that effect.

Early Exit
January 25, 1977
Mr. N. Snyder International Representative United Auto Workers 2300 Ashland Avenue Toledo, Ohio 43620
Dear Mr. Snyder:
This is to confirm the discussions between the Company and the Union during the 1977 Contract negotiations regarding early exits referred to in Article IX, Paragraph 6.
It is understood between the parties that the purpose of said paragraph’s existence is to preclude any interference with production schedules being fulfilled, to preclude any adverse effect on employees being able to work a full scheduled work day, and to preclude the adding of additional work to other employees placing hardship on them.
It is further understood that the language in said paragraph was not designed for supervision to deny early exits if conditions mentioned above do not exist.
It is agreed that if both supervision and the employees fully understand the purpose said paragraph’s existence as described in this letter, then neither party should experience the problems mm they have experienced during the duration of the past|m Agreement. This is the reason this letter has been published.

During the course of these negotiations, we agreed that two (2) issues within the area of ergonomics required fur-ther study and debate and, therefore, would be discussed |H| following the conclusion of negotiations. Accordingly, following receipt of notification of ratification of the Collective Bargaining Agreements, a study group shall be formed. The composition of the study group shall be the Senior Manager of Current Safety Processes and the Manager of Ergonomics for the Corporation and the head of the DaimlerChrysler UAW Health and Safety Department, along with the UAW International lead ergonomist for the Union. The study group shall investi- ___
gate and review their findings along with recommenda- HH tions, if any, with the NJC on two subject matters relating to secondary ergonomic analysis as follows:
The parties utilize a variety of tools such as the 1981 NIOSH Lifting and the Three Dimensional Static Strength MH Predictor (3DSSP) to help determine manual material handling lifting exposures. The study group will continue to discuss the use of these tools as appropriate.
The study group will investigate the potential for the use _
of additional secondary quantitative assessment tools such as Rapid Upper Limb Assessment Postural Risk (RULA), the ACGIH Hand Activity Level TLV, Multimedia Video
Task Analysis (MVTA), Humanscale, U of M Energy |^_ Expenditure, BAKPAK and others. Such analysis will

include practicality (including cost, ease of use, redundancy, and efficiency), the effect on standardization within the company, industry and suppliers, and the potential benefit of using the tools.

EARLY WARNING PROGRAM
October 03, 2003
International Union, UAW Attention: Mr. Nate Gooden
Dear Sirs:
The parties acknowledge that through significant efforts during the term of the last Agreement, tremendous gains have been made in reducing ergonomic recordable injuries. We also recognize that, while our priorities need to be focused on remediation of jobs creating injuries and lost work time, there may also be value on a prospective basis to look at jobs in the future that are producing employee complaints which have not yet risen to the level of recordable injuries. In that context, we explored the feasibility of the Company’s Occupational Health Manager (OHM) to be used as a tool. It was explained that an injury/illness database to capture such signs and symptoms exists within OHM which has the capability of matching job station data to key medical data.
In the assembly facilities, job stations are automatically fed into OHM via the Advanced Manufacturing Engineering’s AMPs software program. However, the AMPs feed is not currently present in every manufacturing location, and therefore Early Warning will be used in the assembly plants only.
Access to this data for the Ergo Analysts will be made available via key screens in OHM after each Analyst signs a medical confidentiality agreement. This information must be used for the sole purpose of injury identification and not be shared with other parties. The ultimate pur
292
pose for obtaining such data is to identify potential high-risk jobs that may ultimately create injuries to our employees.

During these negotiations, the parties discussed new and innovative ways to move our joint process forward to higher and better levels, enhancing our position as a Center of Excellence for health and safety which others will seek to benchmark. Toward this end, we will begin the SPEEDLINK process moving the Corporation to the next paradigm. SPEEDLINK is capturing potential injury-producing hazards and jobs information on the plant floor swiftly and efficiently. We have taken dramatic steps toward injury reduction to date, but the next level will be even more challenging as we direct our attention closer to zero injuries.
To complement our health and safety initiatives, an electronic database for Ergo Pal providing data retention reporting capabilities will be created. All of this data is to be readily input and accessed through PDAs, which will allow the ergonomic analysts and ergonomic safety remediation specialists to use the systems on the plant floor, at the work station level, gathering data on the spot.
The Company agrees to finance and develop the database application software, and reside it within our Corporate systems. Development of the system will begin after the ratification of the agreement and a deliverable will be targeted for the end of the 4th quarter of 2003. The parties agreed that SPEEDLINK will be jointly developed and implemented.

PDA devices shall be made available to the Union and management representatives in all major manufacturing facilities, National Depots, and eight (8) for Regional PDCs which will be rotated on a divisional basis. The cost of the PDA’s will be borne by the NTC, except that if an individual loses the device, he/she shall be responsible for the cost of replacement.

Maumee, Ohio 43537
Dear Sir:
During these negotiations, the Parties discussed their mutual interest in reducing the number of Toledo Assembly Plant Supplemental employees who were on indefinite layoff status as of the effective date of the 2003 Agreement. Notwithstanding the limited liability associated with the Supplemental workforce and the fact that seventy seven Supplemental employees have been transferred to permanent status, the Corporation continues to explore socially responsible programs in an effort to address the Supplemental workforce.
As a result of these discussions, the Parties agreed that a program that encouraged the voluntary attrition of these Supplemental employees was appropriate given the current circumstances. Accordingly, without prejudice, the Corporation agreed to offer the following options to Supplemental employees:
1.	Supplemental employees hired between March I, 2000 and November 1, 2000 will be eligible for a $5000 Separation Incentive payment.
2.	Supplemental employees hired between February 1, 2001 and July 1, 2001 will be eligible for a $2000 Separation Incentive payment.
303
3.	Upon receipt of the Separation Incentive payment, the employee will cease to be an employee of the Corporation and will be deemed to have lost his/her seniority, however will be eligible for preferential hire to other Supplier Park firms.
■
■
4.	Supplemental employees may sign up for a future preferential hire opportunity at a third-party owned body and paint facility at OEM wages and benefits. The Corporation will make arrangements with the supplier that these employees will be given preferential hiring considerations. If hired by a third-party, a supplemental employee may terminate employment with DaimlerChrysler Corporation.
5.	Supplemental employees may continue to remain on layoff status until expiration of their recall rights and may be recalled to a temporary, part-time or permanent position at the Toledo complex for the term of the collective bargaining agreement.
6.	Employees will be canvassed to select one of the three options outlined above. The intent of this program is to bring total and final resolution to the Supplemental workforce issue inclusion of any grievances associated with this subject matter.

Air Houses

Mr. Nick Vuich Chairman
Jeep Unit - UAW Local 12 Toledo, Ohio
November 7, 2003
Dear Sir:
During these negotiations, the parties had lengthy discussions concerning read-only access to the air houses at TNAP. The Union expressed concerns over the air houses operating properly and providing adequate ventilation.
■ ■
To address the Union’s concerns, this letter confirms the Plant’s ability to access and share information from the air houses with represented employees. The company is willing to share information, upon request, with members of the bargaining unit from all shifts.
The management and operation of the air houses at TNAP will be acquired by DTE through the
Energy Center Partnership. The company will cease to have control over the air houses upon the transfer of responsibility, however, future access will be discussed with DTE at that time.

New Hire Orientation
October 03, 2003
International Union, UAW Attention: Mr. Nate Gooden
Dear Sirs:
The Corporation and the International Union, UAW agree to implement the jointly developed, standardized New Hire Orientation Program when the number of newly hired hourly employees warrants such a program.
The orientation will be piloted at a Metro Detroit area location, and phased into out of state Manufacturing and MOPAR locations. This standardized training will be followed by one (1) additional day of training at the specific location where the employee is assigned to work. Employees will be scheduled and on a straight time basis paid for both the standardized and location specific orientation with their probationary period commencing on the first day of orientation.
The standardized orientation will consist of information presented in accordance with guidelines established by the Corporation and the International Union, UAW, and within ninety (90) days of ratification of the Agreement a program overview and participant’s manual will be made available to the NEPC. The information will acquaint the employee with our business, the benefits, opportunities and responsibilities they will have as employees of the Corporation and as members of the Union, to include the history of each organization. The information may also include the Union’s and Corporation’s perspectives on issues which affect the workplace and community. The location specific orientation shall be conducted, in part, 311
by a representative of the Plant Human Resource Department and, in part, by an elected or appointed Local Union representative, officer or Benefit Representative designated by the International Union whose other duties at the time of his election, appointment or designation shall already permit him, if he is working on the job, to take time away from work without loss of pay. The orientation shall be conducted during normal working hours, covering essential location specific information not covered in the standardized orientation, allowing for Local Union input and presentations.
■ ■ ■ ■
In the event that either party believes the program does not meet the provisions of this letter, notification of the party’s concerns may be given; if by the Union to the Corporate Union Relations Staff, or if by the Corporation to the DaimlerChrysler Department, International Union, UAW.
■ ■
The program will not be subject to the grievance procedure and may be terminated by either the International Union or the Corporation, upon written notice to the other party.

Diversity Training
October 03, 2003 International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Nate Gooden
Dear Sirs:
During discussions leading to the 1999 Agreement, DaimlerChrysler and the UAW discussed at length those social issues facing our workers. The parties unanimously agreed that diversity in the workplace was one of the most important issues facing the Union, Corporation, and its workers.
Accordingly, a joint study team, consisting of UAW and management members of the National Training Center staff, along with representatives from the Corporation’s Diversity and Work/Family department was established to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate a diversity training program for all employees. The parties reaffirmed their strong commitment to the program during the 2003 discussions and agreed to explore and implement the inclusion of diversity training in other National Training Center Programs such as Employee Participation, Paid Educational Leave and the Local Joint Training Facilitators Program. Status updates for existing programs and recommendations for continued diversity training opportunities will be presented to the Joint Activity Board (JAB) and the National Employee Participation Council (NEPC) quarterly. Funding for this activity will be provided from National Training Funds upon approval by the Joint Activity Board.

Parity Agreement
November 20, 2003
Mr. Lloyd Mahaffey
Regional Director-Region 2B UAW
1691 Woodlands Drive
Maumee, Ohio 43537
Dear Mr. Mahaffey:
This letter will confirm the understanding reached between the Corporation and the Union during the 2003 contract negotiations concerning parity between the Jeep Corporation Union Retirement Income Plan (the Plan) and the DaimlerChrysler - UAW Pension Agreement (the National Agreement.)
Substantial changes were made to the Plan as a result of this understanding, and it is the intent of the parties that the plans are to be interpreted and administered similarly. The parties further agree that the National Plan is the basis for comparison, and that the Plan will be interpreted and administered in a manner consistent with the interpretation and administration of the National Plan.
Two notable exceptions to parity with the National Agreement remain and are identified as follows:
1.	Enhanced 30 & Out Retirement Supplement for Employees with 30 Years of Credited Service as of October 1, 1999.
Employees who had accrued 30 Years of Credited Service by October 1,1999 continue to be eligible for an enhanced 30 & Out Early Retirement Supplement as described in Appendix D to the Plan.
314
2.	57 and 10 Protected Benefit.
In bringing the Plan into parity with the National Plan, the 57 and 10 Retirement Eligibility under Article III Section 2(A)(1) ceased to be a set of conditions under which an employee could elect to retire. A consequence of eliminating this eligibility criterion is that employees with an accrued benefit as of December 31, 2003 will have that accrued benefit “protected” with respect to the retirement provisions of Article III Section 2(A)(1), and the deferred vested provisions of Article III 5(C). This protected benefit will be referred to as the “2003 57 & 10 Protected Benefit”.
An Employee with a 2003 57&10 Protected Benefit who is not otherwise eligible to retire, shall retain the right to draw his 2003 57&10 Protected Benefit upon attaining age 57, under the terms of Article III Section 2(A)(1) and as calculated under Article Ill Section 2(B)(2)(b). Such action will terminate the Employee’s employment and, except with respect to such 2003 57&10 Protected Benefit for purposes of retirement under Article III Section (2)(1) or performing a calculation under Article III Section 23 (B)(2)(b) (and only to the extent of such 2003 57&10 Protected Benefit), the Employee will not be considered a Retired Employee under the Plan, but rather an Ex-Employee. The employee will be eligible to commence receipt of the balance of his entitlement (his accrued benefit less the Actuarial Value of his 2003 57&10 Protected Benefit expressed as a monthly annuity) upon satisfying the conditions of Article III Section 5(D).
315
Similarly, an Ex-Employee with a 2003 57&10 Protected Benefit, whose employment is terminated prior to the Employee attaining age 57, shall retain the right to draw his protected benefit upon attaining age 57 under the terms of Article III Section 5(C) and shall be eligible to commence receipt of the balance of his entitlement (his accrued benefit less the Actuarial Value of his 2003 57&10 Protected Benefit expressed as a monthly annuity) upon satisfying the conditions of Article III Section 5(D).
For the purposes of determining the actuarial equivalence of both the protected benefit and the accrued benefit above, the interest rate and morality table will be those used by the Plan to determine and Actuarial Equivalent of an equivalent lump sum value.

Mr. Nick Vuich
Chairman
Jeep Unit - UAW Local 12
Toledo, Ohio
Dear Sir:
During the course of these negotiations, the parties held lengthy discussions regarding Joint Programs and their value to the organization during both positive and negative economic conditions. Both parties acknowledged that Joint Programs improve employee morale and participation as well as enhance the competitive position of the Corporation in the global automotive industry. In order for the Corporation to become the premier manufacturing company in the world and the benchmark of the industry, it is imperative for Joint Programs to take part in the support of various programs and initiatives.
To that effect, the parties formally re-established their commitment to Joint Programs and to fully utilize the concept to meet and exceed plant goals. In addition to SQDCM, Joint Programs may include employee participation goals and objectives, PQI, health & safety, ISD, operating effectiveness, product launches, quality, and continuous improvement initiatives. The monthly LEPC will serve as the channel to establish guidelines, report on program ideas, address issues that enhance or inhibit the success of the program, and overall ways to improve the effectiveness of the process. The LEPC may also benchmark outside employee participation programs that encourage total employee involvement.
323
The implementation and facilitation in each department, including the assurance and measurement of the program’s effectiveness, will be led by the respective Center Manager and Committeeman. Any concerns raised by|H either party regarding the progress of the Joint Programs will be brought to the attention of the LEPC.
