1.	The purpose of this Agreement is to enable the SUFFOLK COUNTY POLICE DEPARTMENT (hereinafter referred to as the department) and the Suffolk county police benevolent association, inc. (hereinafter referred to as the PBA) to resolve disputed cases of illnesses or injuries (physical or mental) resulting from incidents which reportedly occurred while police officers were performing their official police duties whether on or off duty. ■ Section 207(c) of the General Municipal Law requires a due -process hearing to resolve such disputes. The parties wish to resolve these disputes in a prompt, fair and equitable manner and consequently have agreement that these issues in dispute may be resolved through the use of an employee option to utilize an independent medical consulting service and/or arbitration in lieu of the above stated due process hearings.
2.	Issues which shall be affected and/or determined by the use of an independent medical facility are as follows:
(a)	Whether a physical illness or injury (physical or mental) suffered by a police officer was incurred in the performance of his/her duties.
(b)	Whether a current illness or injury (mental or physical) is a recurrence or aggravation of a prior illness or injury (mental or physical) which occurred in the performance of police duties.
(c)	Whether a police officer who incurred an illness or injury (mental or physical) as the result of the performance of police duties has sufficiently recovered and is physically and mentally able for either temporary limited duty assignments or full duty.
For the purposes of this Agreement, temporary limited duty shall be determined by the hearing officer or medical consulting service.
3.	The Department may dispute the validity of a police officer's original illness or injury allegedly incurred in the performance of police duties, as set forth in paragraph 2 (a) above, within 30 calendar days of the date the department is notified of said illness of injury. Said police officer may elect to have the dispute resolved at a due process hearing conducted pursuant to General Municipal Law section 207(c) or by an independent arbitrator selected pursuant to the rules of the Public Employment Relations Board. In addition, at the request of either the Department or the PBA, such employee may be required to submit on a timely basis to the designated medical consulting service described hereafter for a full medical evaluation; the result of said medical evaluation shall be submitted
-1-
into evidence at the arbitration proceeding or 207(c) hearing established to resolve the causal connection dispute. The decision of the arbitrator or hearing officer designated to conduct the arbitration or the 207(c) hearing shall be final and binding on the Department and the police officer with respect to the issue of causal connection.
4.	In cases where a police officer alleges a recurrence or aggravation of a prior line-of-duty injury as set forth in paragraph 2(b) above, which is disputed by the Department, said police officer may elect to have the dispute resolved at a due process hearing conducted pursuant to General Municipal Law Section 207(c) or by the medical consulting service described herein. The decision of the hearing officer designated to conduct the 207(c) hearing or the medical consulting service shall be final and binding on the Department and the police officer.
5.	In disputed cases where the Department believes that a police officer who has been out of work as a result of a prior line-of-duty injury or illness (mental or physical) is capable both physically and/or mentally of performing either temporary limited duties or full duties as set forth in paragraph 2(c) above, the police officer may elect to have the dispute resolved at a due process hearing conducted pursuant to General Municipal Law section 207(c) or by the medical consulting service described herein. The decision of the hearing officer designated to conduct the 207(c) hearing or the medical consulting service shall be final and binding on the Department and police officer.
6.	Upon the election of the options described in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5, the police officer must waive his/her right to appeal any adverse determination, as well as any other right as may be granted by General Municipal Law Section 207(c). within 48 hours after notification by the Department to the member and the PBA of the existence of a disputed injury or illness as described in paragraphs 3, 4, and 5, the Police Officer, or the P8A acting on his behalf, must select an option. If a Police oiticer, or the PBA acting on his behalf, fails to select an option within the required time frame, the Department may proceed with a hearing as provided for under Section 207(c) of the General Municipal Law. Appointments with the medical consulting service shall be scheduled within seven (7) calendar days following the selection by the Police officer. A Police Officer, upon written request, shall be granted a delay in the scheduling of such appointment for the purpose of securing medical reports as described in paragraph 10. The parties agree, however, that such police Officer must submit to an examination within 28 calendar days of the date the dispute arose notwithstanding whether such records have been obtained.
-2-
7.	The provisions of this Agreement shall be fully set forth and incorporated in the collective bargaining agreement currently in existence between the Department and the PBA. It is expressly agreed by all parties that any pending and future dispute as set forth in paragraph 2 above shall be resolved in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
8.	The use of a medical consulting service shall be established by separate letter agreement, the terms of which shall coincide with the time periods of the collective bargaining agreement. The medical facilities being utilized to carry out the intent of this Agreement may be changed at any time with the consent of both parties signatory to this Agreement. If the parties are unable to agree on the selection of a medical facility then the parties shall select an arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the Public Employment Relations Board. At the arbitration of the issue, both parties shall submit the names and qualifications of those medical facilities located in Nassau or Suffolk Counties. The arbitrator shall conduct a hearing and make a determination regarding the selection of the facility to be utilized during the existing term of the collective bargaining agreement.
9.	The medical consulting service shall determine an employee's inability or fitness to perform temporary limited duty or full duty and whether such condition is of a temporary or permanent nature. If the condition is considered to be of a limited duration, then the medical consultant shall establish a date for that officer's re-evaluation. The parties agree that the examining physician assigned by the medical consultant service shall complete MEMBERS PHYSICAL CONDITION AND RESTRICTIONS REPORT, upon completion of the evaluation. The Department shall assign officers limited to restricted duty to duty assignments consistent with the restrictions noted on said report. Disputes concerning restricted duty assignments shall be resolved in an expedited basis by Arbitrator Martin Scheinman.
10.	Medical consultants, prior to making their determination, shall receive copies of the employee's diagnostic reports, x-rays, lab reports, hospital records and such other clinical evidence as the parties may deem relevant which would enable the consultants to render their own objective determination. Records may not be unilaterally submitted to the medical consultants. All records shall first be screened at a joint meeting of the representatives of both parties who will then forward said documents to the medical consulting service.
11-	The Department agrees to retain all police officers subject to such medical disputes as described in paragraph 2(c) on full pay, line-of-duty injury status (401) until such date as a decision is rendered by the hearing officer, arbitrator or medical consultant. The parties agree, however, that if the
-3-
Department prevails on the issue the Police Officer shall be transferred from 401 to 301 status effective the date the decision is rendered or the 15th calendar day after the dispute arose, whichever occurs sooner. However, in the event the medical consultant does not render a decision on or before the 15th calendar day after the dispute arose, through no fault of the employee, including the procurement of medical documentation or statements, the transfer from 401 to 301 status shall be effective the date of the decision.
12.	The Department agrees that upon a favorable determination to the officer stemming from a dispute described in paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b), the police officer shall be credited with line-of-duty illness or injury status retroactive to the date of said illness or injury or recurrence of same.
13.	Following the return to work by a Police officer in a limited or restricted duty capacity, the effect of which subsequently may render the officer incapable of performing limited or restricted duty, the officer shall be re-examined by the medical consultant service provided that the officer presents to the Department as his/her own expense a detailed report from a medical doctor specifying the changes that occurred in the officer's condition since his/her prior examination by the medical consultant service and how such changes have resulted in a deterioration of the condition. The parties agree that the officer shall remain on 301 status while out of work and be charged with a reduction of such leave accruals during the pendency of this re-examination period, should the officer be found unfit for limited duty upon re-examination due to the line-of-duty injury or illness, then his/her sick leave deductions shall be restored retroactive to the date the Department was notified by the physician of the change in condition.
14.	The cost and expense of utilizing the independent medical consulting service to resolve the disputes as set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) shall be split equally between the parties. However, the cost to the Suffolk County Police Benevolent Association, Inc., will not exceed Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) in the first year and Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00) thereafter.
APPENDIX 8
Substance Abuse Testing
In order to detect the illegal use of drugs by members of this bargaining unit, the following procedures will become effective upon the signing of this agreement:
Screening
The Department's random drug testing program for Police Officers will test for the illegal controlled substances as incorporated in the Mandatory Guidelines for Federal work Place Drug Testing programs administered by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA). The Commissioner of Police will be responsible for the random scheduling and administration of screening tests as set forth below.
Selection of Personnel
Selection of personnel for testing will be accomplished by a secure randomized computer process. This procedure will be performed by a representative of the Police commissioner and will be witnessed by a union representative designated by the P.b.A. President. No fewer than thirty five (35) officers and no more than eight (soJ officers on duty will be tested. If no more than eighty (80) workers are scheduled on a tour, then the Department shall have the right to test up to fifty (50%) percent of those members scheduled. The random selection of a member will not result in the member's name being removed from any future selection process. Employees will be randomly selected and notified to report to the testing location. After notification of the assigned test, the employee will be required to report for a test unless a physician directs that he/she is unable to do so.
Testing procedures
1.	The sample collection process shall be confidential and shall be performed in accordance with standards promulgated by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA).
2.	The members shall provide a urine sample for purposes of testing for illegal controlled substances. The employee shall provide a sufficient amount of the sample to allow for initial screening, a confirmatory test and for later testing if requested by the employee.
3.	Initial drug screening will be done by Enzyme Multiple Immunoassay Testing (EMIT). No sample will be further retested upon a negative screening for the specific illegal controlled substances, including marijuana. After the negative screening, the second sample will be destroyed.
-1-
4.	Each and every positive EMIT test will be confirmed using a Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry test. Only if confirmed will a test result in a positive report. The Department shall provide the employee tested with a report of a positive test.
5.	During the testing process, the member shall cooperate with requests for information concerning use of medications and with such other requirements of the testing process such as acknowledgement of giving of a urine or blood specimen.
6.	The integrity of the testing process will be maintained with the utmost consideration for the privacy of the person being tested. Only one person, of the same sex as the person being tested, may be present during the collection of a urine specimen. If the necessary precautions to ensure legitimacy of the sample can be arranged without undue cost, an observer will not be required.
7.	The laboratory must simultaneously collect two samples in separate containers. Each container shall have affixed a code number of the date of the collection. Both containers will be sealed in the presence of the member being tested, and will be maintained in a manner consistent with NIDA guidelines.
8.	Any member whose drug test results in a positive report may, within ten (io) days of receiving the notification of such result, request in writing to the Police Commissioner, that the second sample be made available for retesting at a licensed certified laboratory of the member's choosing. The Department will deliver the sample to such laboratory to assure the chain of custody. The second testing shall be at the expense of the member.
9.	Drug testing will be performed by a laboratory licensed or certified by National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the New York State Department of Health.
Chain of custody
The chain of custody block of the drug testing custody and control form shall be properly executed by authorized collection site personnel upon receipt of specimens. Handling and transportation of urine specimens from one authorized individual or place to another shall always be accomplished through chain of custody procedures. Every effort shall be made to minimize the number of persons handling specimens.
-2-
Reporting Results
Before any test result is reported (the results of the initial test, confirmatory test, or quality control data), it shall be reviewed and the test certified as an accurate report by the responsible individual. The report shall identify the drugs/metabolites tested for, whether positive or negative, the specimen number assigned by the Department and the drug testing laboratory specimen identification number. The laboratory shall report as negative all specimens that are negative on the initial '. test or negative on the confirmatory test. Only specimens confirmed positive shall be reported positive for a specific illegal controlled substance. Those test results which do not indicate the presence of an illegal controlled substance will be sealed and there will be no indication of testing in the member's personnel file.
The laboratory shall report test results to the designated Medical Review Officer (MRO) within five (5) working days after receipt of the specimen by the laboratory. The MRO, who shall be selected by the Department, must be a licensed physician with knowledge of substance abuse disorders and the appropriate medical training to interpret and evaluate test results. If the MRO receives a positive test result, he/she shall interview the individual in question, review the individual's medical history and review other relevant biomedical information. The MRO will evaluate these factors to determine whether a valid justification exists for the positive test result. If the MRO determines that valid justification exists, the test result will be treated as a negative test result and may not be released for purposes of identifying illegal controlled substance use.
Administrative Provisions
1.	Any violation of the confidentiality provisions of this agreement, if committed by an employee of the County, shall be grounds for disciplinary action against the employee. The county will also take appropriate action against a person and/or organization not employed by the County for violation of the confidentiality requirements.
