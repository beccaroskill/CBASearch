4.1	Association business which involves a called meeting of the general membership shall be conducted before the beginning of or following the conclusion of the usual duty day for teachers. Association business which involves a school unit of the Association shall be conducted before the beginning of the duty day or following the dismissal of students.

4.3	Consultants, advisors, or associates of the Association, who are not employees of the Board, may enter the school for such things as the delivery of items or short conferences. They will first report to the principal or his or her designee and, if in his or her judgment their continued presence will not be contrary to the best interest of the school, they may remain.

3
4.7	The Association will be given a place on the agenda of the regular meeting of the Board provided that a written request is received ten (10) days preceding the scheduled hour of the Board meeting and provided that the topic of concern and the name of the presenter(s) is designated in the request.
Should the specified presenter(s) be unable to attend, the Association will notify the Superintendent of the change in presenter(s) as soon as possible.
4.8	Every teacher shall be given a copy of the negotiated agreement. The cost of publishing the tentative agreement prior to ratification shall be shared equally by both parties. The cost of publishing the finally ratified negotiated agreement will be borne by the Board.

ARTICLE V
Grievance Procedure
5.1	Grievance. A grievance is an alleged violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of the terms of the negotiated agreement between the Board and the Association.
5.2	Settlement of Employee Grievances. The Association and the Board recognize their responsibility for the prompt and orderly disposition of grievances that arise out of the interpretation, application, or alleged breach of any of the provisions of this agreement. To this end, the parties agree that the provisions of this article shall provide the means of settlement of all such grievances provided, however, that nothing herein will be construed as limiting the right of any employee to have a complaint adjusted without the intervention of the Association so long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this agreement.
5
5.3	Procedural Steps. Any grievance that a teacher has not adjusted informally with the immediate supervisor shall be presented in the following steps:
Step 1. Between the grievant, a representative of his or her choice, and the employee's immediate supervisor and/or designated representative(s).
Step 2. Between the grievant, and his or her Association representative, and the appropriate director, elementary or secondary, and/or designated representative(s).
Step 3. Between the grievant and his or her Association representative, and the Superintendent and/or designated representative(s).
5.4	Grievance Presentation. All grievances shall be presented in writing at Step 1 within ten (10) school days from the date of their occurrence, signed by the grievant. The Administrator's answer at each Step shall be given in writing within ten (10) school days after the Step meeting which shall be held within ten (10) school days following receipt of the appeal. Unless a grievance is appealed to the next step within five (5) school days after the Administrator's answer, it shall be deemed settled in accordance with the Administrator's answer, which shall be considered acceptable to the grievant and the Association.
5.5	Arbitration.
(1)	Appeal Procedure. Any grievance concerning the interpretation, application, or alleged breach of any provision of this agreement that has been properly processed through the grievance procedure as set forth above and has not been settled, may be appealed to arbitration by the Association by serving written notice on the Board within fifteen (15) calendar days after the Superintendent's answer at Step 3 of the said grievance procedure. If the Association fails to serve such notice of its intention to arbitrate within this time limitation, it shall be deemed to have waived the arbitration and the grievance shall be considered settled. No individual employee shall have the right to invoke this arbitration procedure.
(2)	Selection of Arbitrator. If the Association and the Board are unable to agree upon the selection of an arbitrator within seven (7) calendar days after the Association's notice of appeal to arbitration, they shall jointly request the American Arbitration Association to furnish a list of not less than five (5) arbitrators, one of whom may be designated by the parties to act as arbitrator of the grievance. If no agreement can be reached as to the arbitrator within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the said list, the Association and the Board shall jointly petition the American Arbitration Association to furnish a second list of not less than five (5) additional arbitrators, one of whom shall
6
be designated by them within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of said list, to act as arbitrator of the grievance. Selection shall be made by the Association and the Board representatives alternately striking any name from the list until only one name remains. The final name remaining shall be the arbitrator of the grievance.
(3)	Jurisdiction of Arbitrator. The jurisdiction and authority of the arbitrator of the grievance and his or her opinion and recommendation shall be confined to the express provision or provisions of this agreement at issue between the Association and the Board. The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, alter, amend, or modify any provision of this agreement, or to make any recommendation which will in any way deprive the Board of any of the powers delegated to it by law. The arbitrator shall not hear or decide more than one grievance without the mutual consent of the Board and the Association. The recommendation in writing of the arbitrator within his or her jurisdiction and authority as specified in this agreement shall be final and binding on the aggrieved employee or employees, the Association, and the Board.
(4)	Arbitration Expenses. The Association and the Board shall each bear its own expenses in these arbitration proceedings, except that they shall share equally the fee and other expenses of the arbitrator in connection with the grievance submitted to arbitration.
5.6	If the Association claims a class grievance, defined as a general violation, misapplication, or misinterpretation of the agreement that directly affects three (3) or more unit members, the grievance may then be submitted directly to the Superintendent within ten (10) days from the date of its occurrence. The processing of such grievance shall begin at Step 3.
5.7	By mutual agreement of the grievant and the superior, the time limits stated herein may be compromised to allow the collection of pertinent information and in the interest of prudent resolution of the grievance.
5.8	No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the Board, the school administration, or Association against any teacher or official because of his or her participation in this grievance procedure.
5.9	Should the investigation or processing of a grievance require that a teacher or an Association representative be released from his or her regular assignment, he or she shall be released. In a grievance involving an individual, the individual will be released without loss of pay. In a class grievance, the three (3) individuals identified
7
by the Association as the parties involved in the grievance will be released without loss of pay. The Association shall reimburse the Board for the cost of the substitute teacher's pay for any other unit member who is required to be released from his or her regular assignment for the investigation or processing of a grievance.
5.10	All written and printed matter dealing with the processing of a grievance shall be filed separately from the central office personnel files of the teacher.
ARTICLE VI Transfers
6.1	Voluntary Transfer. Requests for voluntary transfers will be accepted from tenured teachers who meet the certification requirements for the position identified.
(1)	The names of new schools to which teachers may request transfers for the following school year shall be announced. When the principal is appointed, that information will be distributed through the normal channels of communication and shared with the association.
(2)	Requests for transfer to other than new schools are to be in writing and to be received prior to March 1 of the current year. A teacher may submit in writing a request to withdraw a request for a voluntary transfer prior to June 30. Applicants will be provided with the opportunity to interview with designated representatives of the school(s) to which they request transfer(s) at times and places designated by the Human Resources Department. Unsuccessful candidates will be advised.
The requests are to be in writing and to be received prior to March 1 of the current year.
Voluntary transfers will not be effected during a school year.
All such requests will apply to vacancies identified prior to June 1.
A part time teacher who has requested full-time employment shall be considered for a position for which he/she is qualified before a new teacher may be hired for that position, except that voluntary transfers, leaves of absence and administrative transfers shall be given priority.
6.2	Administrative Transfer. When an administrative transfer of teaching personnel is necessary because of a reduction of staff in a school, the administration will identify where the reduction is to take place:
8
1.	In an elementary school - Regular elementary teaching assignment; that is, an assignment in the grades at that school; e.g., K through 5 or 6; or an elementary subject field; e.g., reading specialist, guidance counselor, etc. For example, if there is a reduction of a regular classroom teacher, and assuming all other factors are equal, the principal will determine the teacher in grades K to 5 or 6 who has the least continuous service in Harford County Public Schools. This teacher will then be administratively transferred. If the reduction is a reading teacher, the principal will identify the reading teacher with the least continuous service in Harford County Public Schools for transfer.
2.	In a secondary school - Secondary subject field; e.g., geography, English, mathematics, biology, guidance counselor, work experience coordinator, etc.
The needs of the school system, and the needs and qualifications of the individual teacher(s) shall be considered. When all other factors are equal, the length of continuous service in Harford County will be the determining factor in identifying the teacher(s) who is to be transferred from the elementary school grades or the elementary or secondary school subject field. When the length of continuous service in Harford County is also equal, the length of continuous service in the school will then become the determining factor in identifying the teacher(s) who is to be transferred from the regular elementary teacher assignment or the elementary or secondary school subject field.
In an elementary school, if a teacher identified to be administratively transferred would leave a vacancy for which there would be no other teacher in the school certified to teach the vacated position, then assuming all other factors are equal, the next least senior teacher in line would be transferred to assure that all grades are taught by teachers certified to teach those grades.
In an elementary or secondary school, when a teacher receives written notice that he or she is administratively transferred; and if a vacancy in the same kind of teaching assignment occurs in the original school prior to the first preschool day, then the teacher will be permitted to be reassigned to his or her original school. To exercise the option to return to his or her original school, the teacher must notify the Human Resources Department, in writing, within ten (10) calendar days of his or her letter of transfer.
If a vacancy in the same kind of teaching assignment that the teacher held does not occur in the original school prior to the first preschool day, then the teacher will remain in the new assignment for the entire next school year. If at the end of this school year and prior to the first preschool day of this calendar
9
year, a vacancy in the same kind of teaching assignment becomes available in the original school for the following year, then, at the teacher's option, the teacher will be reassigned back to his or her original school, provided written notice was given to the Human Resources Department within ten (10) days of the original letter of transfer. This transfer must take place on the first preschool day. Following the first preschool day of this year, the transfer becomes permanent and the teacher will remain in the school to which he or she is transferred. For following school years, the voluntary transfer policy will apply.
In an elementary or secondary school, when it is determined that a grade level in one school will be transferred to another school, all teachers who are regarded as the teachers of pupils at that grade level will be transferred.
6.3	In the case of opening of a new school in the fall, the presently employed teachers to be assigned to it shall receive official notice in writing of that transfer by the close of school, if known.
6.4	Involuntary Transfer. If, as a solution to a problem (different from those listed in "Administrative Transfer") a teacher is to be transferred to another school, such a transfer may not be effected until after a meeting between the teacher involved and the appropriate administrators). At this time, the teacher shall be notified of the reason(s) for transfer, shall be apprised of his or her rights, and shall be given the opportunity to respond. In the event that a teacher objects to the transfer, he or she shall, upon request, have a meeting with the Superintendent or designee. The teacher, at his or her option, may have a person of his or her choice accompany him or her at the meeting.
ARTICLE VII
Promotion
7.1	Announcement of Vacancies. Vacancies which are to be filled in administration, supervision, helping teachers, teacher specialists and mentors will be advertised.
7.2	All applicants will receive consideration but in the case of equal qualifications, the first preference will be given to professional workers in Harford County. During the summer months, such announcements shall be posted in the central office and a copy sent to the Association.
10
7.3	Application. Candidates are to complete and submit a formal application form with a transcript of all college studies to the Human Resources Department.
7.4	Preliminary Screening. Applications and supporting data, i.e. transcripts, professional experience and references, will be reviewed, and the most promising candidates will be scheduled for interview. Candidates who are eliminated in the preliminary screening will be so notified.
7.5	Interview and Selection Committee. The Superintendent will appoint an Interview and Selection Committee to interview the remaining candidates and to make recommendations to him.
7.6	Referral to Superintendent. The Superintendent may accept the recommendations of the Interview and Selection Committee or reject all candidates as deemed best for the school system. The Superintendent's recommendation(s) for promotion will be submitted to the Board of Education.
ARTICLE VIII
Teaching Hours and Assignments
8.1	Teachers may be scheduled to be in attendance for a maximum of 190 days. Not less than two (2) half (1/2) days out of the four in-service days, to be scheduled each year, shall be reserved for teachers to work at their assigned work sites, performing professional educational tasks as they deem appropriate.

Elementary and Middle school teachers may be assigned to supervise school-related activities which are held before or after school or in the evening. Such assignments will be made so that the responsibilities for such supervision are shared among the members of the faculty. Consideration will be given to teacher preferences. Assignments will be filled by volunteers first. If there are not sufficient volunteers, to fill the assignments, the remaining assignments will be filled by assigning teachers in an equitable maimer.
High school teachers may be assigned to supervise school-related activities that are held before or after school or in the evening. Each high school principal shall establish a fair and equitable method for distributing extra duty chaperone responsibilities among the teachers in the school. Consideration will be given to teacher preferences when assigning teachers to supervised school-related activities. Assignments will be filled by volunteers first. Each teacher will be required to serve as a chaperone for nine (9) hours per school year without additional compensation. After a teacher has completed nine (9) hours of chaperone coverage without compensation, the teacher shall be paid for subsequent coverage at the rate of twenty dollars ($20) per hour. Duty hours for chaperone coverage shall be calculated from the officially assigned start time until the Administrator in charge of the event officially releases the teacher.

(3)	Under normal circumstances, teachers shall be present in their rooms and ready to begin their duties one-half (1/2) hour before the late bell and shall remain in school for professional purposes for twenty (20) minutes after the first dismissal. Principals shall set specific times in each school.
(4)	The duty-free lunch period shall extend for at least thirty (30) minutes but when the pupils have a regular lunch period of less than thirty (30) minutes, the duty-free period shall coincide with such regular period of less than thirty (30) minutes. In general, teachers are expected to remain at school during the lunch period. Permission may be granted for leaving the premises during the lunch period. The principal may limit the number of teachers who may leave the building during lunch at any one time. Duty-free lunch shall not be included as part of the planning time.

Teachers in secondary schools shall receive not less than 225 minutes of planning time on a weekly basis and shall be scheduled for one planning period per day of not less than forty-five (45) consecutive minutes. Neither this provision, nor 8.7 below will apply during times when the normal school schedule must be adjusted during emergencies; or in cases when an individual teacher has requested in writing to teach more than the usual number of periods for teachers in that subject in that school, or in the case of a teacher who volunteers for other school activities during the scheduled planning period.
8.7	The planning time provided on a weekly basis for elementary school teachers shall not be less than 200 minutes. Teachers in elementary schools shall be scheduled for planning time during the regular day for students in increments of not less than thirty (30) consecutive minutes per day.
8.8	Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten teachers shall assume responsibility for getting children from the morning session on the buses and shall be available to receive children as they arrive for the afternoon session. The balance of time between sessions is considered to be planning time and duty-free lunch period. Scheduled conferences between sessions should be kept to a minimum.
8.9	Teachers may not be scheduled on a regular basis for additional responsibilities to be performed during the minimum planning periods allowed by this agreement.
The Association and the Board agree to establish a collaborative work group on the utilization of planning time. The work group shall be made up of equal representation from each side, not to exceed five (5) persons per side. The work group will begin its work no later than October 15, 2003, and will complete its work by April 15,2004.
8.10	When a teacher whose assignment is direct instruction of students is absent from his or her assigned classes for one-half (1/2) day or more, reasonable effort shall be made to employ a substitute. This provision shall also apply in cases involving special area teachers who teach an entire class.
8.11	Teachers may be used to cover classes for absent teachers. Such coverage should not be excessive.
13
8.12	Reasonable effort will be made to assign high school teachers in their major field of certification and to restrict their assignments to no more than three (3) different subjects.

When a teacher is unable to attend a PTA meeting which involves parent conferences, he or she shall establish an alternate plan for meeting with those parents who desire to take advantage of such a plan. This plan must be approved by the principal, and the parents of all the teacher's students shall be notified of the alternate plan.
Teachers assigned to more than one school are encouraged to establish alternate plans for parent conferences for each of the PTA's involved on a rotating basis unless circumstances require more attention in a particular school.
ARTICLE IX

10.	3 Personal business is defined as a circumstance or obligation which is beyond the teacher's usual control and which must be done during school hours. Time off from work to shop, to attend or participate in sporting activities, to attend most social events, to pursue avocational interests, to take a holiday or vacation, or to engage in other similar activities is not personal business.
10.	4 In the event that the school system becomes aware that a claim for a personal business day is not founded on the foregoing criteria, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken including, but not limited to, forfeiture of pay.
10.	5 Teachers will not be paid for absence immediately, prior to, or following a school holiday unless such personal business constitutes an extreme emergency.
10.	6 The three (3) days allowed for personal business leave shall be in addition to sick leave days and shall be permitted to be accumulated as sick leave days.
10.	7 Religious Holidays. A teacher shall have three (3) days of leave for observance of recognized special holidays which he or she believes to be mandated by his or her religion provided that the leave he or she seeks would be given a positive recommendation by the proper authorities. The principal may contact the proper religious authority for their recommendation. The three (3) days allowed for religious holidays shall be in addition to sick days and other emergency days and shall not be cumulative.
10.	8 Family Bereavement Teachers shall be granted seven (7) consecutive days of leave for death in the immediate family. The teacher will be paid for any of the seven (7) consecutive days of leave which are duty days. Immediate family shall include spouse, child, parent, brother, sister, father-in-law, mother-in-law, grandparent, a person who raised the teacher, or anyone who lives regularly in the household of the teacher. Leave shall begin the day after the death, except when the service, funeral, or other appropriate ceremony is scheduled beyond the seven (7) days following the day after death. In the latter circumstances, all leave shall be taken at such time as to include the service.
10.	9 Jury Duty. A teacher who serves on jury duty will continue to receive his or her regular salary.
10.1	0 Legal Summons. A teacher may be absent in response to a legal summons without loss of salary provided that he or she is summoned as a witness or, if charged, he or she is found not guilty of an offense involving gross misconduct. This provision does not preclude appropriate action by the Superintendent in the event that there is an alleged violation of a policy.
16
10.1	1 When schools are closed due to unsafe road conditions, teachers are not required to report, except in the event of previously planned circumstances which cannot be rescheduled.
10.1	2 When schools are open, teachers are expected to be present. However, when in the opinion of the teacher, driving conditions prevent his or her presence at school, the salary of the teacher for that day shall be reduced by 1/3 80th for each day absent.
10.1	3 Summer School. Because the best interests of the pupils are served by an orderly and unhurried closing of school, teachers will not be permitted to leave before the official closing of school in June except when the circumstances allow no alternative. If no other alternatives are possible, teachers may, with written permission from the Human Resources Department and principal approval, be permitted to leave early for summer school. In the case of such early leaving, however, the teacher will have his or her salary deducted at the rate of 1/3 80th for each day's absence.
10.1	4 In the case of extended sessions of summer school lasting into the preschool meetings, a teacher may, with permission of the principal, be late in returning. His or her salary shall be deducted at the rate of 1/3 80th for each day absent.
ARTICLE XI Sick Leave
11.1	SICK LEAVE. Sick leave shall be defined as personal illness of the teacher. Teachers shall be granted sick leave at a rate of one (1) day per month during the first two (2) years of service with the Harford County Public Schools. Beginning in the third year of service in Harford County, sick leave shall be granted at a rate of one and a quarter (1.25) days per month of regular employment, the annual total of which shall be available at the beginning of the school year.
Accumulation of unused sick leave shall be unlimited. As of June 30, unused personal business leave shall be added to accumulated sick leave. Teachers shall be given a written notice of available sick leave days as of September 1, no later than October 30 of each year.
A teacher is permitted to use up to seven (7) work days of his/her sick leave per year for illness of a member of the teacher’s household or the teacher’s parent or anyone for whom the teacher is the primary caregiver. When leave is used for illness of a person for whom the teacher is the primary caregiver, other than a member of the teacher’s household or the teacher’s parent, appropriate documentation will be required.
11.2	Payment for Unused Days of Sick Leave. Teachers who enter retirement from the public schools of Harford County after ten (10) years of service in those schools shall receive payment for unused days of sick leave up to a maximum of 200 days effective July 1, 1998, at the rate of 25% of the daily rate of pay.*
17
All such days must have been accumulated while in service in Harford County. Sick leave shall be accumulated annually at the rate of the difference between sick leave provided and sick leave used.	•
*NOTE: This proposal requires fiscal support and will be subject to the decisions of the Fiscal Authorities ' and the Board of Education's final actions on the operating budgets for the school system.
11.3	Unused Sick Leave Benefit. A death benefit based upon the number of unused days of sick leave will be paid to the beneficiary of a teacher who has served ten (10) years with the school system and whose death occurs while the teacher is on active duty or on an approved leave of absence. The payment for unused sick leave will be up to 200 days effective July 1,1998, at the rate of 25% of the daily rate of pay.* *NOTE: This proposal requires fiscal support and will be subject to the decisions of the Fiscal Authorities and the Board of Education's final actions on the operating budgets for the school system.
11.4	Sick Leave Bank. All teachers on active duty are eligible to join and contribute to the sick leave bank. Contributors will be permitted to apply for use of the bank for salary payment for qualifying, incapacitating, and/or catastrophic personal illness during regularly scheduled duty days after all available leave has been exhausted. An approval committee appointed by HCEA shall assume administration of the sick leave bank, effective the second semester of the 2002-2003 school year. The Association and the Board shall mutually agree upon any change in formal procedures outlined in the Sick Leave Bank handbook.
ARTICLE XII
Extended Leaves of Absence
12.1	The Board of Education may grant leaves of absence for 1) personal illness; 2) maternity (including adoption); 3) study; 4) military service; and 5) illness of a member of the immediate family. Leaves for the first four of these reasons protect the teacher's right to apply for a disability retirement, to continue to qualify for the death benefit in the retirement system, to be reemployed by the local school system in an appropriate position as soon as a vacancy occurs after the request for reinstatement, and to unused accumulated sick leave provided he or she applies for reappointment prior to the termination of his or her leave. When a teacher requests reassignment from a leave of absence, and due to a reduction in force there are teachers on a recall list for the same kind of teaching assignment the teacher left, the teacher on leave will be placed on the recall list according to the length of continuous service he or she has had with Harford County Public Schools.
Leaves of absence are without pay and are generally granted for no more than one (1) year.
12.2	In Harford County, the requirement to be eligible for a leave of absence is that the teacher must be a tenured teacher.
18
12.3	Since the Maryland Retirement Systems do not recognize a leave for illness in the immediate family, such a leave provides for reemployment by the local school system and to unused accumulated sick leave provided he or she applies for reappointment prior to the termination of his or her leave.
12.4	A tenured teacher finding it necessary to request a leave of absence should make written application to the Superintendent stating the reason, date he or she wishes it to become effective, and the number of months desired.
12.5	Leave of Absence for Maternity. Sick leave is granted for disability due to maternity. An employee using sick leave for disability due to maternity must return to work as soon as she is physically able or a tenured teacher may request a leave of absence to protect employment and retirement benefits.
The need for and the time involved for absence due to disability for maternity shall be based upon the particular medical circumstances of the employee and the requirements of her employment. An employee may be required to submit a doctor's certificate establishing the medical need for absence and the time involved in the absence. The employee may also be required to submit a doctor's certificate stating that the employee is able to perform her regular teaching duties.
A tenured teacher has the option of requesting a leave of absence for maternity prior to or at the conclusion of her disability. However, if an employee elects to request a leave of absence prior to her disability, she will not be granted sick leave during the leave of absence. Her unused sick leave will be held in abeyance until such time as she returns to active service.
A teacher who is on a leave of absence for maternity will be reemployed in an appropriate position as soon as a vacancy occurs after the request for reinstatement.
12.6	Paternity Leave. A teacher who wishes to take leave related to the birth of his child shall be eligible to receive unpaid leave for up to six (6) calendar weeks without pay. The teacher granted such leave shall return to his same position providing he returns by the end of the approved absence. If the employee’s spouse is an employee of the Board of Education, the husband and wife shall be limited to a cumulative total of twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave in connection with the birth of an individual child.
12.7	Adoption Leave. A teacher adopting a child shall be eligible to receive unpaid leave for up to six (6) calendar weeks without pay. The teacher granted such leave shall return to his/her same position providing he returns by the end of the approved absence. If the employee’s spouse is an employee of the Board of Education, the husband and wife shall be limited to a cumulative total of twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave in connection with the adoption of an individual child.
19
ARTICLE XIII
Sabbatical Leaves
13.1	A teacher holding a professional certificate with seven (7) or more consecutive years of satisfactory, active service in Harford County Public Schools may be granted a sabbatical leave of absence for the purpose of furthering professional growth by means of graduate study or other means approved by the Superintendent. Previous leaves of absence will be considered as not causing the teacher to lose years of service credit prior to that leave. Leave time itself, in all cases, will not be regarded as active service insofar as determining the seven (7) year sabbatical leave eligibility requirement.
13.2	Sabbatical leaves may be granted for study or research (and travel if in conjunction with the study or research) that will be of service to the individual and to the schools and pupils of Harford County.
13.3	Sabbatical leave may be granted for not less than one (1) full semester or more than one (1) full year.
13.4	Any teacher to whom a sabbatical leave is granted shall be required, as a condition of accepting the leave, to return to the service of the Harford County Public Schools for at least two (2) years immediately following the expiration of the leave. Should the teacher not return to the service of Harford County, he or she will be required to refund the salary granted for sabbatical leave.
13.5	Applications for sabbatical leave must be filed with the Superintendent by April 1, prior to the school year for which it is requested with a proposed plan of study or research to which the time spent on leave wiP be devoted. After approval, any change of plan must be requested in writing and approved in advance.
13.6	The applicant for sabbatical leave for study shall complete at least 24 semester units of upper division or graduate work during the sabbatical year. It will generally be expected that not less than 12 semester units shall be completed during each semester. If travel or extensive research is involved, a lesser total number of semester hours may be considered if approved by the college advisor. Transcripts or other evidence of completion shall be submitted to the Superintendent's Office within 30 days of the teacher's return to duty.
13.7	A sabbatical leave for travel will only be considered when the travel is in conjunction with an organized program of study or research. Application for leave shall include, in general terms, an itinerary of the proposed objectives of the study or research of which the travel is a part. Upon completion of the leave and within 30 days of the teacher's return to duty, a detailed itinerary and written report of not less than 1,500 words shall be submitted to the Superintendent's Office setting forth the teacher's reactions to the travel and a statement of the benefit to the schools and the pupils of Harford County. A description of the travel will not satisfy this requirement.
13.8	Compensation While on Sabbatical Leave. Compensation while on sabbatical leave shall be one-half (1/2) salary in accordance with the provision of the Harford County salary schedule in effect during the period of the leave.
13.9	In the event a teacher on sabbatical leave receives extra monies through any type of grant, the combined amount of those monies and the sabbatical leave allowance shall not exceed the amount of mone’
20
this teacher would have received as a staff member for the school year in which the sabbatical leave has been granted. In cases where the combined monies exceed the regular salary, as outlined above, the sabbatical leave salary will be reduced accordingly.
13.10	Teachers receiving the support of a sabbatical leave will not be eligible to receive the usual payment for partial reimbursement for graduate studies.
13.11	Salary for sabbatical leave will be paid the teacher while on leave of absence in the same manner as if the teacher were on duty in Harford County, upon the furnishing by the teacher of a surety bond indemnifying the Board against loss in the event that the teacher fails to render at least two (2) years' service after return from his or her leave of absence. Such bond shall be exonerated in the event that failure of such teacher to return and render two (2) years' service is caused by the death or physical or mental disability of the teacher.
13.12	Effect of Sabbatical Leave on Salary Increments, Retirement, and Sick Leave Accumulation. The teacher's normal percentage rate of deduction for retirement purposes shall be applied to the actual salary received. The sabbatical leave year is counted as a year of service and experience on the salary schedule. There will be no sick leave accumulation for time spent on sabbatical leave.
13.13	Provision for Health Insurance. When a teacher is placed on a Board approved sabbatical leave of absence, he or she may continue to participate in the group program of health insurance and life insurance on the same basis as that of a full time teacher.
13.14	Return to Service. At the expiration of the sabbatical leave of absence, the teacher shall be assigned to a position of equal status but no guarantee can be given that it will be the same position he or she occupied at the time the leave was granted.
13.15	Accident and Illness on Sabbatical Leave. Interruption of a program of study or travel while on sabbatical leave, caused by serious illness or accident, evidence of which is satisfactory to the Superintendent and the Board shall not be held against a teacher with regard to the fulfillment of the condition regarding Study or travel under which the leave is granted, nor affect the amount of compensation to be paid the teacher while on leave, provided, however, that the Superintendent has been promptly notified of such accident or illness. In the case of such accident or illness while on sabbatical leave, notification shall be made by registered letter, within 30 days of the time of the onset of the illness.
ARTICLE XIV
Insurance
14.1	The Board will provide for group life insurance and for group accidental death and dismemberment insurance in an amount that will match the individual's salary rounded to the nearest $1,000 based upon the salary schedules. This amount will not be changed during the year. A teacher may purchase a matching
21
amount of insurance in both categories at full cost (100%) to the teacher. The Board will make payment of life and accidental death and dismemberment premiums for each teacher who so requests, to provide coverage for the full twelve-month period commencing October 1, and ending September 30.
The Board agrees to establish an insurance advisory committee to consist of representatives of the Superintendent and each bargaining unit. The purpose of such a committee shall be to review information and data relative to the Board’s insurance plans and to recommend cost containment strategies and improvements to the offerings. The committee will meet as needed to confer on insurance issues as they arise and make recommendations of possible changes in the implementation of the plans.
14.2	Effective July 1 through June 30, the Board will make available for the duration of the Agreement the following health insurance programs to eligible employees who enroll in the programs: The Traditional Health Insurance and Preferred Provider Program (PPN/PPO) plans and an HMO plan in effect as of November, 2000, or comparable plans providing comparable benefits and network. See page 24 for summary of benefits. Participation in the Traditional Health Insurance Plan will be limited to those employees enrolled in the Plan on July 1, 2001. Employees who elect to terminate their participation in the Traditional Insurance Plan after that date shall not be eligible to re-enroll.
Effective July 1 through June 30, the Board will similarly make available for the duration of the Agreement to eligible employees who elect to enroll therein the choice of either the standard dental insurance plan or the Preferred Provider Dental Insurance Plan in effect as of November 2000, or comparable plans providing comparable benefits. See page 24.
The Board will not provide two insurance programs, e.g. Blue Cross/Blue Shield and an HMO program; or two different HMO programs for any eligible employees or eligible members of their families. This applies to all employees and eligible members of their families whose spouses are also employees of the school system. However, if one employee’s eligibility for participation is terminated for any reason, the other employee family member shall continue to be eligible for the existing coverage.
Effective July 1, 2001, employees enrolled in the Traditional Insurance Plan will be able to use their membership card at participating pharmacies to obtain a discount on prescriptions.
14.3	The Board’s rate of contribution to the coverage made available under 14.1 is 90% of the total premium. The Board’s rate of contribution applicable to the coverage made available under 14.2 shall be 80% of the total premium for the Traditional Health Insurance Plan and 90% of the total premium for all other provided health and dental insurance plans.
14.4	All benefits provided under Maryland law for employees injured during and as a result of their work including death, injury, hospitalization, and medical and weekly disability payments, and lump sum awards, are available through a standard Workers' Compensation policy.
Employees who are injured on the job and who qualify for weekly disability payments through Workers' Compensation will receive their salary, less the amount of the disability payments for up to 20 duty days. Employees may then use their accumulated sick leave in order to maintain their full salaries. After the 20tl
22
day of absence, one-third day of sick leave will be deducted for each day compensated by Workers' Compensation to maintain an employee's full salary.
14.5	All employees of the Harford County Public Schools must meet the requirements for medical screening for tuberculosis as established by the Harford County Department of Health. An appropriate skin test, as provided by the school system, will be made available to teachers free of charge.

ARTICLE XXIV Health and Safety
24.1	The Harford County Public Schools has the responsibility to provide safe school facilities and to maintain them in a safe and adequate manner.

24.5	The confidentiality of this recorded information will be preserved by those who have access to it.
ARTICLE XXV
Reduction in Force
In a reduction in teaching personnel within any segment(s) of the school system such as a subject field, an elementary assignment, a special assignment or a vocational teaching assignment, the determination of those who are to be separated will be in the following order:
1.	Nontenured teachers holding provisional certificates
2.	Nontenured teachers holding regular certificates
3.	Tenured teachers
At such time when teachers in the above categories are to be separated when all other factors are equal the length of continuous service in Harford County Public Schools, appropriate certification and ability to teach the available grade levels or subject areas shall be the determining factor.
The regularly certificated teachers who are separated shall be placed on a priority recall list for a period of two years and shall be recalled in inverse order of their separation when appropriate positions become available.
A teacher on the priority recall list shall be notified in writing of any vacancy which occurs in his or her field of certification and shall indicate in writing within ten (10) days of the receipt of the letter his or her acceptance or rejection of the position. If the teacher rejects the position or cannot begin the new assignment within thirty (30) days from the date of notification, the teacher shall be deemed to have waived his or her rights to recall. However, a teacher who has accepted employment in another public school system in Maryland and is unable to get released from his/her employment contract may decline an offer to return to work and maintain recall rights if the offer is issued later than July 1, for a position which becomes available at the beginning of, or during, the following school year.
39
Leaves of absence will not be regarded as a break in the continuity of service although leave time will not count as active service.
The layoff and recall provisions of this article are subject to such Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines or other employment programs as required of or adopted by the Board of Education in order to maintain existing or required staff balance.
Any action taken under this policy will not be subject to the grievance procedure; however, it shall be subject to the administrative complaint procedure.

SIDE LETTER OF AGREEMENT
HCEA and HCPS agree to establish job-sharing positions for the 2003-2004 school year. This is a one-year agreement. Upon joint evaluation by both parties, it will be decided whether to continue the agreement for a second year and to ultimately include the concepts as formal contract language.
1.	This letter of agreement includes the following concepts:
a.	Definition of Job Sharing: Two members of HCEA’s constituency desire and seek to share one full time position. This position would normally be one that is currently being filled full time by one of the two interested individuals.
b.	Creation of the Job Share: A job share position is initiated by two interested certified employees. A job share position is generally not to be created by the HCPS, nor is to be advertised or recruited. The request exists solely to meet the needs of the two employees.
c.	Approval of Job Share Request: Approval by HCPS will depend on whether or not the job sharing will meet the needs of the students being served. It is acknowledged that certain positions are more naturally suited to job share than others. HCEA will be notified immediately of the creation and nature of each job share approved by the HCPS.
d.	Benefits: Insurance Benefits provided by the HCPS to HCEA bargaining unit members will be apportioned to job share participants as follows:
i.	Medical and Dental coverage, as well as any future coverage negotiated by HCEA and HCPS, will each be assigned solely to one or the other member of the job share. Individual benefits will not be " split,” unless such an agreement is reached between the two employees and HCPS. Life insurance coverage may be obtained by both employees if desired. The employees are also eligible to participate in the supplemental life insurance plan in accordance with HCPS policies.
ii.	Should an insurance-defined life style change occur for the member who chose not to take coverage occur during the year of the agreement, that employee will be allowed to take on HCPS coverage, but will be responsible for the total cost (employee + employer’s premium) of that coverage.
e.	Leave: Leaves for illness and personal business will be apportioned according to how the job is split. In a 60-40 split, one sick day will in actuality be .6 of a day for one employee and .4 for the other. The same will be in effect for the 3 urgent business days.
f.	In-Service Days: Both members of the Job Share will follow whatever the current policy is for part time employees’ attendance at staff development activities.
g.	Letter of Agreement: Both members will be subject to a letter of agreement. This letter will state the nature of the job share position and the assignment of benefits. It will state that if either of the two members options out of the share during the course of the school year, the other member must assume full responsibility for the position for the remainder of the school year. This may be due to resignation or any other situation that would involve separation. In such a case, no search for a replacement will be conducted. The remaining member will revert to a full time position with all duties and benefits.
h.	Dissolution of Job Share: The two members must notify Human Resources of their desire to continue or dissolve the job share for the next year by May 1st. Should the job share be dissolved for any reason the position will revert full time to the original holder of the position. The partner will be subject to administrative transfer policies. Should the position be eliminated by the system due to a reduction in force, the original holder of the position will retain seniority rights within the building. The other partner will be subject to administrative transfer.
2.	Job Sharing Vs. Part-Time:
a.	Job Sharing is not a replacement for part-time or half time employment. Current policies and contract
practices for part or half time employment remain in effect.
b.	Part-Time or Half time certificated employees serve in positions created by the needs of the school system. They do not share a full time job with another certificated employee.
c. Part-time certificated employees continue to be eligible for fulLbenefits.
