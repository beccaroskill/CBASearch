(d)	Distribution of PREP Funds
The intent of the PREP is to move toward, over time, a pro-rata pay process that would equalize non-contract compensation at 75% of contract faculty compensation. The above PREP will be allocated to those steps and columns on the hourly salary schedule, which are farthest away from the 75% goal. Amounts from the PREP will be distributed first to the lowest percentile step and column placement to bring it equal in percentage to the second lowest percentile placement. As funding permits, secondary, tertiary, etc. distributions will be made to each combined placement to move them to the next highest percentile placement. This process will repeat until the PREP is exhausted.
Step and column placement ranking will be calculated each year based upon the mean contract faculty salary for each hourly step and column, after application of the General Salary Increase Pool, 3.1B(2)(a), to both the contract and hourly salary schedules.
The amounts required to advance each placement will be based on the actual hours taught within the placement category the previous academic year. For example, if the lowest percentile placement is Doctorate 17 + semesters, and 16,000 hours were taught within that category the previous academic year and the category required a $2 per hour increase to advance to the next lowest category, the hourly salary schedule for Doctorate 17+ semesters would be increased $2 per hour and $33,600 ($32,000 salary plus 5% payroll-driven costs) would be reduced from the PREP. This process would repeat until the PREP is exhausted.
(e)	The formula, effective July 1, 2001, will remain in effect until modified/replaced through subsequent negotiations.
C. Salary is also subject to the following conditions:
C. (1) New contract employees shall receive a maximum of seven years credit for prior full-time experience and pro-rata credit for District part-time teaching experience for the purpose of salary-step placement.
C. (2) The maximum monthly rate for long-term substitutes is 1/10 of Class I, Step 8, with credit for prior full-time experience and pro-rata credit for District part-time teaching experience, subject to such exceptions as the Governing Board may determine in individual cases.
C. (3) At the option of the contract employee, the annual salary may be paid in ten or twelve equal monthly payments.
Classification on Instructor Salary Schedule
Placement in the salary classification set forth in Section 1, above, shall be determined by the District according to the following criteria, after receipt of appropriate verification of training and experience. All professional training shall be evaluated in terms of semester units (e.g., one-quarter unit equals 2/3 semester unit).

Extra days of assignments for extended contract for coaching positions shall be determined by the dean in consultation with the Federation prior to the start of the academic year.
Extra days shall be calculated by the number of non-contractual days, excluding weekends, that fall during the sport’s entire season, from when practice begins through the end of playoffs. (The Commission on Athletics Constitution shall be used to determine the dates of the start of practice and the end of playoffs for all sports.)
The amount of the extra contract shall be determined by dividing the number of noncontractual days (as outlined above) by 175. Example: Softball season practice begins Jan. 9 and playoffs end May 13. During this season there are eight non-contractual days (three holidays and five break days). Eight divided by 175 is .0457. The extended contract for the Head Coach for softball would be .0457 of a year.
Faculty who are in a coaching position on July 1, 2001 will not have their extra days of assignment reduced because of the implementation of this agreement.
3.6	B. District and Federation jointly agree to appoint a committee of three representatives each to review stipends and extra contract assignments and make recommendations to both parties.

ARTICLE 4
Health and Welfare Benefits
4.1	The District will, during the term of this Agreement, and subject to the remaining provisions of
this Article, continue to provide Blue Cross, Delta Dental and vision coverage for eligible faculty members and their dependents and domestic partners under the existing plans, or under such plans providing at least equivalent benefits as the District may designate. Provisions related to domestic partners are set forth in Appendix L.
4.2	An eligible faculty member who wishes to have health coverage provided through Kaiser or Health Net rather than Blue Cross may do so, provided that the District's share of the cost for such coverage shall not exceed the amount it would otherwise contribute for Blue Cross medical and vision coverage under this Agreement. The District's contribution shall in no event exceed the full cost of the monthly premium for any such coverage. The deletion or addition of any federally qualified HMO to the options available to faculty members shall only be by joint agreement of the parties.
The District will arrange with Kaiser for the following additional benefits:
4.2	A.	Durable medical equipment benefit.
4.2	B.	Special in-patient drug and alcohol rehabilitation benefit.
4.2	C.	Coverage for qualified dependents to age 25.
4.2	D. Vision Care 2.
It is understood that if addition of these benefits causes Kaiser premiums to exceed the amount the District would otherwise contribute under the terms of Article 4.5, an affected faculty member will pay the excess.
4.3	Faculty members bear the responsibility for meeting all requirements for eligibility in any plans provided by the District and for properly completing enrollment and/or application forms.
4.4	A. Faculty members eligible to participate in the District-provided insurance benefits and to receive District contributions toward these benefits are those employed under contract during the regular college year on at least a half-time basis.
B.	(1) The District will pay a pro-rata amount to provide medical benefits to non-contract faculty members teaching in two or more community college districts with a combined workload of at least 100%.
(2)	The District will pay 50% of the premium cost to provide medical benefits to noncontract faculty members whose teaching assignment equals or exceeds 40% of a fulltime load in the District.
(3)	If a non-contract faculty member meets the criteria in both (1) and (2) above, the faculty member shall choose the payment plan from (1) and (2) above.
(4)	If a non-contract faculty member’s workload drops below 40% (or below 100% in two or more districts) for two consecutive semesters, the benefit will terminate until such time as the faculty member’s load is once again 40% or more (or 100% in two or more districts).
(5)	If it is determined that the District will not be reimbursed 50% of the premium cost by the state, the District will be obligated, in the subsequent fiscal year, to cover only that percentage of the premium for which it received reimbursement and the noncontract faculty member may opt to pay that portion not reimbursed by the state or to drop the coverage.

Current coverage for retirees shall continue for faculty employed on or before June 30, 1990.
Faculty initially hired from July 1, 1990 through June 30, 2001 shall receive District-provided coverage to the age of 65 at which time the retiree's medical care plan shall be replaced by Medicare and a Medicare supplemental plan which provides comparable benefits and which is provided and paid for by the District. Dental and vision coverage will continue as provided above.
Eligible faculty members initially employed on or after July 1, 2001, who meet the years-of-service and age requirements stated above, and who retire, shall receive District medical coverage similar to current employees to age 65 only if they have attained at least age 55 and have served at least ten years of continuous eligible service in the District.

4.8	If the District plans to secure coverage through a joint powers arrangement or if responsive bids for alternative medical, dental and/or vision benefit plans are received, and if acceptance is likely and would result in premium contributions less than those specified above, the District shall promptly notify the Federation of such probable acceptance and shall, upon request, meet and negotiate regarding the allocation of any such savings.
4.9	Employees who are employed by the District at the time of retirement in accordance with Article 4.5 shall be retained in the District health, vision, and dental insurance, with premiums paid by the District, provided that such persons have a minimum of ten years of service with the District and have attained an age and years of service equal to or greater than 75. The minimum age for retirement is 55. The District shall provide paid dental benefits for currently retired contract faculty who are receiving District-paid health and vision benefits.
4.10	Any other contract faculty member who is serving the District at the time of retirement, and who has served the District a minimum of five years and has reached the age of 55, shall upon retirement, have the option of retaining membership in the District's group health insurance plan with premiums to be paid by the retiree.
Following a 30-day grace period during which the District will continue to provide District-paid health and welfare benefits, spouses of deceased faculty members shall have the option of retaining membership in the District's group health insurance plan with premiums to be paid by the individual if the deceased faculty member would have been eligible for District-paid benefits at the time of death. Faculty members receiving an State Teachers’ Retirement System disability allocation, and who, prior to receiving the disability allocation, had served the District a minimum of ten years shall have the option of retaining membership in the District's group health insurance plan with premiums to be paid by the individual.
4.11	Eligibility and benefits shall be as specified in the District’s then-existing group medical insurance plan.

5.4 C. (8)	Any non-contract faculty member who applies for a contract position in the
District and who meets the qualifications for that position as specified in the job announcement and determined by the Screening Committee shall be interviewed by the Committee.

7.1	The District will provide a safe working environment for faculty members.
7.2	Any faculty member who observes a condition in the working environment that he or she feels is unsafe and creates any imminent danger of harm to any person should immediately take whatever action may be necessary or appropriate to have such condition corrected and to notify his/her immediate supervisor of the existence of such condition. Faculty members should also notify the appropriate immediate supervisor regarding any other unsafe condition. Nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude such faculty member from contacting any other person or entity that may have the jurisdiction or ability to investigate or correct the alleged unsafe condition.
7.3	If any faculty member has notified his/her immediate supervisor of an alleged unsafe working condition, and the faculty member feels that District management has failed to take appropriate corrective action, the faculty member may submit a written statement of the alleged condition and any proposed corrective action to the Vice President of College Services. The Vice President shall then take appropriate corrective action or forward the complaint to the College President.
7.4	Within five days of receipt of any such complaint, the College President shall take appropriate corrective action, or shall convene an ad hoc safety committee consisting of two faculty members appointed by the Federation and two members of District management. The committee shall investigate the complaint and shall prepare written findings and recommendations within 15 working days.
7.5	If the ad hoc safety committee recommends corrective action, and such action is not taken, the faculty member who submitted the complaint may, within 15 calendar days after receipt of his/her copy of the recommendations, utilize the grievance procedure of this Agreement for further processing of the complaint. Except as specifically set forth above, the grievance procedure shall only be applicable to Articles 7.9 and 7.10.
7.6	The District will continue its practice of making health services available to faculty members for emergency medical treatment on the same basis upon which such services are made available to the students.
7.7	Any faculty member who is threatened with bodily harm, or who suffers bodily harm because of the actions of any individual or group while such faculty member is acting within the course of his/her assigned duties, shall report such threat or harm to his/her immediate supervisor, and where appropriate, to law enforcement authorities.
7.8	The District shall provide all legally required indemnifications and legal assistance to any faculty member who is exposed to any legal liability because of any threat of harm or any assault upon such faculty member while acting within the course and scope of his/her duties.
7.9	A faculty member who is injured while acting within the course and scope of his/her employment shall be entitled to industrial accident or illness leave for not more than 60 days in any one fiscal year for any such accident or illness. Utilization of such leave shall be subject to the following conditions:
7.9	A.	Such leave shall not be cumulative from year to year.
7.9	B.	Such leave will commence on the first day of absence due to such industrial accident
or illness.

7.10	Damage or Destruction of Clothing or Personal Property
7.10	A. As permitted in the Education Code, the District shall provide for payment of the costs of replacing or repairing property of a faculty member, such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, dentures, watches, articles of clothing necessarily worn or carried by the faculty member, or vehicles whenever any such property is damaged in the line of duty without fault of the faculty member.
7.10	B. In addition, and as permitted in the Education Code, the District shall reimburse a faculty member for the loss, or damage by arson, burglary or vandalism of personal property used in the schools of the District.

7.10	E. All claims shall be submitted on forms provided by the District’s Business Services Office, and shall include such relevant facts as costs of repairs, invoices, notations of circumstances, and witnesses, if any. The claim form shall be signed by the faculty member and his/her immediate supervisor and submitted within 15 working days of the incident.
7.11	The District will continue its efforts to assure the safety of faculty members using parking lots at District-owned facilities through the provision of lighted parking reserved for the use of faculty; through security and patrol for all lots within the limits of existing security personnel, and within such limitation, and when requested during evening hours by a faculty member having a reasonable basis to fear for his/her safety, by providing an escort between such faculty member's worksite and parking area.
7.12	In the interest of the health and welfare of the students, employees, and the public, smoking is prohibited in all District vehicles, buildings, and facilities, and within five feet of any exit or entrance of such buildings or facilities.
7.13	Those faculty members who are volunteering to perform services as commercial vehicle operators during their coaching assignment will be subject to the provisions of the District's Drug and Alcohol Testing Program for the time period of thirty days prior to the beginning of the coaching season and ending with the close of the season, including any post-season events. Faculty members volunteering to perform these services only for special events that occur periodically throughout the year shall be subject to these provisions for a period of thirty days prior to the special event and the day of the event. Actual testing shall only occur during that period of time between noon on the day before the faculty member is expected to

Leaves
8.1 Leaves Without Pay
8.1 A. Any contract faculty member may be granted an unpaid leave of absence by the Governing Board for reasons of study, travel, personal business, home responsibility, health, or for any other reason the Governing Board may determine. Any regular faculty member shall be granted an unpaid leave of absence for reasons of health.
8.1 A. (1) Health. An application for leave of absence for reasons of health in excess of the time for which sick leave benefits are payable to a faculty member must be supported by the written recommendation of a licensed physician or health practitioner.
8.1 A. (2) Study. An application for leave of absence for professional study must be supported by a written statement indicating what study or research is to be undertaken, or, if applicable, what subjects are to be studied and at what institutions.
8.1 A. (3) Travel. A leave of absence for the purpose of educational travel must be supported by a written statement and itinerary indicating absence from the District for a majority of the time covered by the application for such leave.
8.1 A. (4) Home Responsibilities. A leave for this purpose may be granted to a faculty member to care for his/her immediate family member whose health temporarily requires the full-time attention of the faculty member. The application for such leave must be supported by the written recommendation of a licensed physician or health practitioner. Such leave also may be granted to permit a faculty member to place a newborn or newly adopted child in his/her home in excess of the provisions of Article 8.5.
8.1 A. (5) Personal Business. A leave of absence may be granted to conclude essential legal actions or to obtain broadening professional experience, and must be supported by such evidence as the District may designate. The term "broadening professional experience" means experience gained through employment, study, or research which is not obtainable in a manner which might otherwise qualify a faculty member for study leave as set forth in Article 8.1A(2) above, and which, in the judgment of the Governing Board, will increase the faculty member's competence in relation to his/her present or anticipated assignment within the District.
8.1 A. (6) Military Leave. Such leave will be granted for required active duty only, and is without pay except for employees with one year or more in the District who will receive their regular compensation in the first 30 days of said leave if the first 30 days fall within the employee's period of paid contract employment. Annual military training duty should be taken during vacation periods or at the convenience of the District whenever possible.
8.1 B. The maximum length of any unpaid leave granted by the Governing Board shall be one year, provided that, upon receipt of request for extension, the Governing Board may extend such leave for a maximum of one additional year. A faculty member appointed or elected to a local political office which requires a full-time commitment may be granted an unpaid leave for not more than one elected term to be served in such office.
8.1 C. Except in exceptional circumstances when the need for leave cannot be anticipated, all applications for leaves of absence must be on file in the District Human Resources Office at least 90 days prior to the proposed effective date of the leave. Whenever

All leave applications shall be submitted to the office of the appropriate College President, or his/her designee, and, if the President or his/her designee recommends the granting of such leave, the recommendation shall be forwarded to the Chancellor and to the Governing Board for further consideration and evaluation.
8.1 E. Other than in such exceptional circumstances as the Governing Board may determine, or except as set forth below in Article 8.1F, a break in service time resulting from leaves without pay shall not be included in computing or granting other benefits such as sick leave, longevity pay, vacation time, step advancement, or other fringe benefits. A faculty member on leave without pay shall have the option of maintaining his/her medical, dental and vision coverage in the District group plans at his/her own cost.
8.1 F. In certain cases of personal leave for professional development, where no district funds are expended and where the employee engages in activities of an educational nature that do not result in the accumulation of college credits for salary schedule advancement, the employee may qualify for step advancement on the salary schedule on the basis of time occupied by the approved leave, with a maximum of one year's credit. The application for such leave must be filed with the College President and receive his/her recommendation; be recommended by the Chancellor; and be granted by the Governing Board in advance of the beginning of such leave in order to become effective.
8.1 G. Any transfer of a faculty member who is on an unpaid leave of absence shall be subject to the transfer provisions of this Agreement.
8.2 Absence With Salary

8.2	A.	(3)	Hourly paid faculty having a regularly-scheduled hourly assignment shall earn and accrue paid sick leave at the rate of one hour for each 16 hours worked.
8.2	A.	(3)	(a) No sick leave is earned for any fraction of 16 hours worked.
8.2	A.	(3)	(b) Sick leave earned on an hourly basis may be used only during regularly-scheduled hourly employment, not in regular contract employment, or for time outside the regular scheduled hourly assignment.

(b) A contract faculty member assigned on a partial contract shall be paid sick
110 111 112	8.2	A.	(5)	leave benefits only in proportion to the time which such assignments bear to full time. (c) Any faculty member wishing to utilize any form of sick leave or leave of

(6)	absence pursuant to this Article may be required to provide such proof as District management shall designate to justify the need for such leave of absence, provided that this requirement shall not be used to intimidate, coerce, or discriminate against any faculty member. The District shall establish a faculty voluntary cumulative pool of sick leave days
118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126	8.2	B.	and/or hours for non-contract faculty. Leave days or hours may be utilized from this pool to provide replacement services for a participating unit member who is on a long-term illness or accident leave and is in need of financial assistance. The Governing Board shall determine who should be allowed to use days from the pool based upon recommendations made by a committee composed of three representatives selected by the District and three representatives selected by the Federation. The committee shall recommend rules and regulations for the administration of the pool. Personal Necessity Leave	
127 128 129	8.2	B.	Accrued full-pay sick leave may be used by a faculty member, at his/her election, in the following cases of personal necessity: (1) Death of a member of his/her immediate family when additional leave is required

limited to 60% of the non-contract assignment. For such faculty who are employed for the Fall Semester, the base for calculating the projected accrual of sick leave shall be the number of hours offered multiplied by two; for such faculty who are employed for the Spring Semester only, the base shall be the number of hours offered in the Spring Semester. In the event a faculty member does not work the full number of hours projected, the faculty member shall not be granted more sick leave than has actually been earned.
"Immediate family", as used in this Agreement, is defined as mother, father, grandmother or grandfather of the faculty member or the spouse of the faculty member, spouse, sister, brother, son, daughter, uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, son-inlaw, daughter-in-law, grandchild, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, mother-in-law, father-inlaw, step-child, step-sister, step-brother, or any relative of either spouse living in the immediate household of the employee.
C. Bereavement Leave
Any faculty member shall be allowed a leave of absence not to exceed five working days on full pay when such absence is occasioned by reason of death in the immediate family of the faculty member, or by other acute bereavement. For the purposes of interpreting this provision:
C. (1) "Immediate family" is defined under Personal Necessity Leave in Article 8.2B(5) above.
C. (2) "Acute bereavement" is subject to interpretation by the District.
D. Subpoena Leave
When a faculty member is absent because of a mandatory court appearance, except as a litigant, said faculty member shall suffer no monetary loss by reason of said service.
D. (1) Fees, exclusive of mileage paid by the court or party requiring the faculty member's appearance shall be paid to the District unless the fees are greater than the faculty member's salary, in which case the faculty member may retain the fees and be listed as absent due to personal business.
D.	(2)	A copy of the subpoena or a court order must be filed with the absence report.
D.	(3)	Absence of a faculty member for a legal action in which he/she is a litigant may
be classified as a personal necessity.
Exchange Service Leave
Arrangements may be proposed by a regular faculty member to a properly credentialed faculty member of another district or college on a similar professional plane for the purpose of exchanging positions for a period normally not exceeding one year. Exchanges may be arranged with either foreign or domestic service in mind. Exchanges will normally be arranged to permit the District faculty member to receive his/her full remuneration from the District, while his/her opposite number will be reimbursed under an agreement he/she has reached with his/her own district or college. The Governing Board will consider the value of both to the District, and to the individual applicant of the exchange arrangement, in reaching its decisions concerning the granting of such service leaves.
Compassionate Leave
In any one school year a faculty member may be granted a maximum of three days (non-cumulative) paid leave to cope with an emergency in his/her family which, in the judgment of the College President and the Vice Chancellor, Human Resources, necessitates the faculty member's presence at the scene of a family emergency. Such leave may be granted only after all other applicable types of leave have been exhausted.

E.	(1) Cost of transportation shall not exceed round-trip coach, rail, or air fare where such service is readily available. The prevailing automobile mileage rate may be authorized when rail or air service is not feasible, or when numerous stops need to be made en route.

The compensation payable for use of personal car shall be at the rate determined by the Governing Board.
E.	(2) Expenses for lodging, meals, registration fees, necessary taxi, and local transportation and telephone charges are considered proper expenditures. Receipts are required for the following expenses: (1) lodging, (2) public transportation (passenger identification coupon or ticket stub required for any air, train, or bus trips) and (3) convention registration fees. In all cases it is expected charges will be reasonable for the place where conferences and meetings are held. Tip payments and service charges allowed on authorized conference and travel expenses may not be greater than 15 percent of the meal charge.
E.	(3) Requests for reimbursements and expenses shall be reviewed and approved by the Chancellor or his/her designated representative before payment is made.
F.	If part, or all, of a faculty member's expenses incurred during conference leave have been paid or reimbursed by the District, District management may require that information acquired at such conference be shared, in a written report or by other appropriate means, with the faculty member's colleagues.

In the event the department members decline or fail to select a Department Chair, the dean/immediate supervisor shall recommend a faculty member to the College President. Any faculty member so recommended may refuse to serve as Department Chair. A Department Chair will be appointed for a term of two years.
B.	In Departments such as, but not limited to, DSPS, EOPS, Athletics or Nursing which have a Coordinator, the Coordinator shall function similarly to a Department Chair.

D.	Department Chairs shall be evaluated annually by the Dean/immediate supervisor and annually by faculty members in the Department, and shall be evaluated with regard to the duties of Department Chairs. Evaluations of Department Chairs will be submitted to the Executive Vice President for review, who will make a recommendation to the College President.

F.	(1) Reassigned Time:
3 or less	0 FTE
More than 3 to 10	.2 FTE
More than 10 to 16	.4 FTE
More than 16	.6 FTE
FTE in a Department is computed based on 1 FTE for each full-time regular contract employee (a full-time regular contract employee assigned to more than one Department will be computed on a pro-rata basis) and 0.2 FTE for each hourly faculty member. The number of full-time regular contract faculty members and non-contract faculty members for an academic year shall be determined by the average number of such employees from the previous year’s Fall census and Spring census.
The above calculation will go into effect for a department chair with the commencement of a new term for the Department Chair. Until that time the method of calculation shall remain as in the 1998-2001 Agreement.

Grievance Procedure
16.1	Preface. It is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that any complaint which might later constitute a grievance be resolved at the earliest practicable stage. Therefore, every effort to resolve such complaints through informal conferences between the parties involved should be made without recourse to the grievance procedure. Since these informal conferences are not intended to be part of this grievance procedure, the discussion of any matter in such informal conferences shall not be considered a waiver of the right of any party to later raise a complaint or defense in the grievance procedure if the informal conferences are unsuccessful in resolving the complaint.

16.2	B. For the purposes of this procedure, a grievant may be an individual faculty member, except the Federation may file a grievance on Article 17, Federation Rights. Any grievant shall be entitled to a Federation representative at any stage of the grievance procedure. Nothing herein shall preclude any grievant from filing and processing his/her grievance without the assistance of a representative.
16.3	A grievance shall be submitted on the grievance form appended hereto as Appendix C. This form shall be provided by the District and shall be available at the District Office, the Office of the President of each College, and from the Federation.
16.4	Written notification or decisions to be provided under this grievance procedure may be hand delivered to the appropriate person or left with a person in charge of the office of the appropriate person, or mailed by certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested. If hand delivered, the date of such delivery shall be considered the date of submission. If mailed by certified U.S. mail, the postmark shall be considered as the date of submission.
16.5	During the processing of faculty member grievances, both the grievant and the District shall make a good-faith effort to provide available records and documentation in support of any position taken, provided that materials contained in the personnel file of faculty members other than the grievant shall be made available only with the consent of such faculty members. The grievant shall be deemed to have given such consent by the filing of his/her grievance.
16.6	No faculty member submitting a grievance with the assistance of a representative shall be required or requested at any stage of the grievance procedure to discuss privately with any District manager any aspect of the submitted grievance without the presence of such representative.
16.7	All reasonable efforts should be made to schedule meetings to discuss grievances pursuant to this grievance procedure so as to minimize disruptions of the work assignments of the faculty. The grievant, one Federation representative, and any witness requested or agreed upon by District management, may attend such meetings with District management without loss of compensation and, if requested, substitutes will be provided at District expense.
16.8	No grievance shall be resolved without first affording the Federation an opportunity to review the grievance, all evidence presented, and its proposed solution.
16.9	If it appears that the same grievance or substantially the same grievance has been submitted by more than one faculty member, the parties shall meet and attempt to agree upon a procedure for the handling of such grievances. If the parties agree that such grievances are sufficiently similar to create a reasonable probability that a resolution of one may produce results that should be equally applicable to all such grievances, the grievances may be consolidated for process as a single grievance, provided that any faculty member whose grievance is affected by such consolidation shall be notified of the proposed consolidation, and may, within five (5) working days after receipt of such notice, provide the District and the

Federation with written notice of his/her election to have his/her grievance processed separately.
16.10	All documents and communications relating to any grievance shall not be made part of any District files, personnel or otherwise, except that the District may maintain a separate confidential grievance file in the Human Resources Office. Any information contained solely in such file shall not be utilized in any evaluation or in providing any employment reference or recommendation.
16.11	No discrimination of any kind shall be taken against any participant in the grievance procedure by reason of such participation. Each of the formal requirements and time limitations stated herein for the processing of grievances shall be strictly adhered to; provided, however, that any such requirements or time limits may be extended or waived by the expressed written agreement of the parties. If the District's authorized representative fails to answer a grievance within the time limit specified in any step of the grievance procedure, the grievant shall have the right to appeal the grievance to the next step of the grievance procedure. Failure by the grievant to appeal a decision within the specified time limits shall be deemed an acceptance of the decision and the grievance is terminated.
16.12	Grievance Procedure
A grievance must be submitted within 15 working days after the grievant first knew, or by reasonable diligence should have first known, of the condition(s) upon which the grievance is based, provided that the time limit shall be extended by 5 working days if an informal conference is held. All deadlines in Steps I, II, and III shall not be extended except by mutual agreement in writing between parties. By mutual agreement in writing between parties, any step between and including Steps I and IV, may be passed over for the next step.
STEP I: IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR
If the informal conferences fail to resolve satisfactorily a complaint, the aggrieved faculty member may submit the grievance in writing to his/her appropriate immediate supervisor and appropriate Dean. Either party may request and shall promptly receive a meeting to discuss the grievance. The immediate supervisor and/or Dean shall render a written decision upon the grievance to the grievant and to the Federation within ten working days after its submission.
STEP II: COLLEGE PRESIDENT
If the grievant is not satisfied with the written decision in Step I, he/she may appeal the decision within five working days after the receipt of the written decision in Step I to the College President and/or Dean under whose jurisdiction the grievance occurred. Either party may request and shall promptly receive a meeting to discuss the grievance. The College President shall render a written decision to the grievant and to the Federation within ten working days after submission of the appeal.
STEP III: CHANCELLOR
If the grievant is not satisfied with the written decision in Step II, he/she may appeal the decision within five working days after the receipt of the written decision in Step II to the Chancellor or designee. Either party may request and shall promptly receive a meeting to discuss the grievance. The Chancellor or designee shall render a written decision to the grievant and the Federation within ten working days after submission of the appeal.
STEP IV: MEDIATION
If the grievant is not satisfied with the written decision in Step III, the Federation may appeal the grievance on his/her behalf to Step V, or, at the written request of either the grievant, the Federation or the District, within five working days after the grievant's receipt of the written reply in Step III, the grievance shall first be submitted to a conciliator of the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service for mediation and recommendation.

STEP V: ARBITRATION
A.	If the grievant is not satisfied with the written decision in Step III (or the recommendation in Step IV, if applicable), within ten working days after receipt of the written decision in Step III (or the recommendation in Step IV, if applicable), the Federation may notify the Chancellor or his/her designee in writing of its request to have the grievance submitted to binding arbitration.
B.	The Federation and the District shall attempt to agree upon an arbitrator, and if no such agreement can be reached, the parties shall jointly request that the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service supply a panel of seven names of arbitrators. The parties shall thereafter meet and determine the choice of first strike from such list by lot, and alternately strike names from such list until a single name remains.
C.	The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the hearing shall be borne equally by the District and the Federation. All other expenses, including fees for witnesses, or the cost of substitutes for witnesses, shall be borne by the party incurring them.
D.	The arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render a decision on the issues that were submitted to arbitration. If the parties cannot agree upon a summary of the issues, the arbitrator shall determine the issues by referring to the written grievance and the answers hereto at each level. In disputed cases regarding whether or not a grievance claim is within the scope of these proceedings, the arbitrator shall first rule on the arbitrability of the issue.
E.	The arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from or modify the terms of this Agreement.
F.	The District and the Federation may agree to any mutually acceptable procedure for expedited arbitration.

Any faculty member who is not a member of the Federation, or who does not make application for membership within 30 days of the effective date of this Article or within 30 days of the commencement of assigned duties shall pay a service fee to the Federation. At any time a faculty member may become a Federation member by following the procedure set forth in Article 18.1 above.
12 13 14 15	18.2	B.	The obligation to pay a service fee may be met by a monthly deduction from the faculty member's salary, by the faculty member's direct payment to the Federation using a method established by the Federation, or, if the faculty member is a religious objector, by complying with Articles 18.2 F. through 18.2 I.
16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24	18.2	C.	If a faculty member does not make application for membership within the prescribed time, make arrangements with the Federation for direct payment of the service fee, or submit proof of payment to a charitable organization as provided herein below, the Federation has a responsibility to inform the faculty member of their contractual obligations. If after proper notice the faculty member does not comply with the provisions of this Article, then the Federation shall notify the District and supply the District with proof of notice to the faculty member. Upon receipt of such notice and proof, the District shall withhold the service fee from the faculty member's salary and submit such fee to the Federation as provided in Article 18.3 below.
25 26 27	18.2	D.	The service fee shall equal an amount not to exceed the standard initiation fee, periodic dues, and general assessments of the Federation and shall be used only for those purposes permitted by law.

19.2	The wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment expressed or implied in any individual contract of employment between the District and a faculty member shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement.
19.3	The Agreement shall be deemed to supersede any and all policies, rules, and regulations that are contrary to, or inconsistent with, its terms.
19.4	No faculty member covered by this Agreement shall suffer a reduction in preexisting salary or health and welfare fringe benefits because of the signing of this Agreement.
19.5	The District and its representatives shall take no action in violation of or inconsistent with any provision of this Agreement.
19.6	A.	(1) Should any Article, Section, or Clause of this Agreement be declared
illegal by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, said Article, Section, or Clause, as the case may be, shall be automatically deleted from this Agreement to the extent that it violated the law. The remaining Articles, Sections, and Clauses shall remain in full force and effect for the duration of the Agreement if not affected by the deleted Article, Section, or Clause. In addition, upon the request of either party, the District and the Federation shall promptly meet and negotiate in an attempt to agree upon appropriate amendments to the Agreement with respect to any such matter declared to be illegal.
(2) The entire amount of the district’s share of the $62 million state allocation for part-time salary equity shall be distributed to part-time faculty salaries in the same manner as the PREP funds are distributed.

19.7	The parties agree that during the negotiations which culminated in this Agreement, each party enjoyed and exercised without constraint, coercion, intimidation, or other limitation, the right and opportunity to make demands and proposals or counterproposals with respect to any matter not reserved by policy or law from compromise through bargaining, and that the understandings and agreements arrived at after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth herein.
The parties agree, therefore, that the other shall not be obligated to negotiate or bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter, whether referred to herein or not, even though such subject or matter may not have been in the knowledge and contemplation of either or both of the parties at the time they negotiated or signed this Agreement.
19.8	It is agreed and understood that there will be no strike, work stoppage, slow-down, or picketing (except lawful informational picketing), or refusal or failure to fully and faithfully perform job functions and responsibilities, or other concerted activities intended to interfere with the operations of the District by the Federation, or by its officers or agents, during the term of the Agreement, including compliance with the request of other labor organizations to engage in such activity. The Federation recognizes the duty and obligation of its representatives to comply with the provisions of this Agreement and to make every effort toward inducing all faculty members to do so. In the event of a strike, work stoppage, slowdown, (or other concerted activities intended to interfere with the operations of the District) by faculty members who are represented by the Federation, the Federation agrees in good faith to take all necessary steps to urge those employees to cease such action, even if such
