The exercise of such rights shall not preclude Local 127 from consulting with management representatives about the practical consequences that decisions on these matters may have on wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. Management decisions shall not supersede the provisions of this agreement.

ARTICLE 10
Grievance Procedure
I.	Policy
A.	Employees have the right to file grievances without jeopardizing their positions.
B.	Employees may represent themselves or select a Local 127 representative to represent them at any or all steps in the grievance procedure.
(1)	The employee has the right to the assistance of a Local 127 representative in the investigation, preparation and presentation of a grievance.
(2)	Employees may have no more than one City employee and one non-City employee as representatives for grievance hearings. In the last three steps of the grievance procedure, an additional non-City employee may, at the discretion of the employee, represent the employee.
6
(3)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, an employee may not select as a representative, a supervisor in the employee’s chain of command or a higher ranking supervisor. This does not preclude Stewards or officers of Local 127 from representing any employee in a grievance.
C.	Grievances may be initiated by the employee, or by the exclusive formally recognized employee organization on the employee’s behalf. If an employee chooses to have representation on a grievance concerning a matter that directly involves the interpretation or application of the specific terms and provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding or wages, hours, and working conditions, such representation must come from Local 127.
D.	The employee’s or employee organization’s first contact regarding job and working conditions is with the immediate supervisor and supervisors shall attempt to settle grievances informally at this level.
E.	A grievance will normally be presented and processed on City time, and a grievant attending a grievance meeting in his/her own behalf on City time will not lose pay. In scheduling the time, place and duration of any grievance meeting, the employee, a Steward or Local 127 Representative and Management will give due consideration to all the participants’ responsibilities in the essential operations of the department. Management has the unequivocable right to schedule grievance hearings as convenient. Hearings may or may not be held during an employee’s normal shift. No overtime pay will be given to the grievant. Representatives, witnesses, or other participants will receive overtime pay if ordered to be present by the appointing authority.
F.	Waivers and Time Limits
(1)	Failure by Management to reply to the employee’s grievance within the time limits specified automatically processes the grievance to the next level.
(2)	Any level of review, or any time limits established in this procedure, may be waived or extended by mutual agreement confirmed in writing.
(3)	If an employee fails to appeal from one level to the next level within the time limits established in this grievance procedure, the grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of the last decision and the grievance shall not be subject to further appeal or reconsideration.
(4)	By mutual agreement, the grievance may revert to a prior level for reconsideration.
(5)	If a grievant fails to appear for a scheduled grievance meeting, such failure without an excuse approved by the appointing authority shall entitle Management to decide on the grievance without the presence of the grievant, or to schedule another meeting at that level (in which case the time requirements for hearing and decision are automatically waived). Failure to appear at two meetings on the same grievance without an approved excuse automatically terminates that grievance and it is deemed denied. The grievance shall then not be subject to further appeal or reconsideration.
(6)	When a grievant is on approved leave the time limits established in this procedure shall be suspended for the period of the leave.
(7)	No grievance shall be finally dismissed for an unexcused failure to appear at a scheduled hearing unless the grievant had been given 24 hours notice of the hearing.
G.	The Management Team shall provide Local 127 with copies of all grievances regarding this M.O.U. filed by employees, within the Local 127 Bargaining Units, who choose to represent themselves, within five working days.
H.	The Union agrees to pursue all claims of violation of this MOU through the grievance procedure. Resort to other remedies shall not be pursued until all steps of the grievance procedure have been exhausted. If Local 127 reasonably feels that it or an employee has suffered immediate and irreparable harm, the City and Local 127 agree that the Local shall directly contact the City Manager’s Office to seek a resolution prior to pursuing remedies outside the City. If the City Manager’s Office fails to address cases of immediate and irreparable harm within a reasonable period of time, Local 127 may initiate action outside the City. Utilization of this procedure shall be deemed to exhaust the grievance procedure.
II.	Definitions
A.	A grievance is a claim or charge of misunderstanding, or difference in interpretation, or violation of
7
provisions of the Civil Service Rules, the Personnel Manual, this Memorandum of Understanding, or management policy or regulations including but not limited to Administrative and Departmental Regulations, which affect wages, hours, or other terms and conditions of employment.
B.	Actions which are covered in the Management Rights Article of this Memorandum are not grievable, but this shall not preclude employees or their representatives from consulting with Management about the practical consequences such actions may have on wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. In addition, actions covered by another appeals process as described in the Civil Service Rules, Personnel Manual, or this Memorandum are not grievable and shall not be processed through this Grievance Procedure.
C.	If the grievance system is abused by an unreasonable number of submittals by one individual or group and which is obviously designed to thwart orderly processing or if the grievances are patently irrelevant, or incomprehensible, such grievances shall be rejected as non-grievable. Such rejection shall be grievable.
D.	Wherever applicable, the term “working days” means the actual work days of the individual on whom the time limits are imposed.
III.	Procedures
A.	General
(1)	Management of the department has the responsibility to inform an employee of any limitation of a given level of Management’s authority to folly resolve the grievance. In this regard, Management shall:
(a)	Supply the employee with the necessary information to process the grievance to the proper agency or authority.
(b)	Advise an employee when any matter under submission is determined by Management as not grievable according to the definitions in Section II above. The “grievance” paperwork submitted by the employee shall be returned to the employee along with a memorandum explaining why the matter is not grievable and what alternative procedures, if any, the employee may follow to process his/her complaint. A copy of this “grievance” shall be forwarded to Local 127. If a grievance is determined to be nongrievable, that decision may be grieved. A decision favorable to the employee or the Union in this latter grievance shall serve to reinstate the original grievance in whole.
(c)	At the request of Local 127, a fourth step hearing will be conducted to discuss the reasons for finding that a grievance is nongrievable. The decision at the fourth step may be appealed to the fifth step for final resolution.
(2)	When a group of identical grievances develop, only one grievance form shall be submitted. The grievants may select not more than two (2) spokespersons who thereafter will be their representative “grievants.” The acceptance of the decision by the spokespersons at any step (or final decision if the grievance moves to the fifth step) will be binding on all parties.
(3)	A grievance shall be recognized if it is brought to the attention of the immediate supervisor either informally or formally within ten (10) working days of the incident’s occurrence.
(4)	If the grievance is between the employee and any supervisor, the initial step may be to the next higher level supervisor.
(5)	To be recognized, a grievance must state which policy, rule, regulation, etc., is involved in the matter and the nature of the remedy sought by the employee or Local 127. In the event that the grievance is rejected for failure to state which policy, rule, regulation, etc., is involved, it may be amended by the grievant or the Union.
B.	Steps:
Step 1: At the employee’s or employee organization’s sole option, grievances may be presented to the supervisor either orally or in writing. If the complaint is presented orally, the procedure is informal and may be settled by an oral answer given within five (5) working days to the employee and Local 127 representative. If the grievance is presented in writing, the procedure is
8
formal and the answer must be given in writing within five (5) working days after submission.
Step 2: If the problem cannot be solved at Step 1, the employee or employee organization may present the complaint in writing to the second level supervisor (if not done at Step 1) within five working days. Within five (5) working days of the receipt of the grievance, a hearing shall be held and the Management representative shall give written decision to the employee and the Local 127 representative.
Step 3: If the problem is not resolved at Step 2, the employee or employee organization may submit the grievance to the division head within five (5) working days. Within five (5) working days of the receipt of the grievance, a hearing shall be held and the division head shall give a written decision to the employee and Local 127. In smaller departments, this step is deleted.
Step 4: If the dispute is not solved in Step 3, the employee or employee organization may present the grievance to the Department Head within five (5) working days. Within ten (10) working days of the receipt of the grievance, a hearing shall be held and the Department Head (or designee) shall give a written decision to the employee or Local 127 representative. The designee cannot be an individual who previously heard the grievance at a lower level. In non-managerial departments, this shall constitute the final resolution of a grievance involving management policy or regulations.
Step 5: Final Resolution of Grievance: If the grievance is still in dispute after Step 4, the employee or employee organization may request a further hearing, which at the discretion of the Management Team will take place before the Civil Service Commission, on matters over which the Commission has authority, or before the City Manager or his designee, by submitting the grievance within five (5) working days. (If it is determined that the hearing should be held before the Civil Service Commission, a fact-finding hearing to define the issues in the grievance will be held by the Personnel Director with the employee and/or employee organization, prior to the date set for the Commission hearing. The grievance may be settled during such fact-finding hearing, if a mutually acceptable solution is developed.) The decision of the Commission shall be issued at its next regularly scheduled meeting following the hearing by the Personnel Director. In grievances answered by the Manager, a hearing shall be held and a written response given within ten (10) working days from the date of receipt of the appeal from the fourth step. The employee or employee organization may only request a hearing before the Civil Service Commission, in matters solely involving Civil Service Rules or the Personnel Manual.
Step 6: Grievances arising out of the disagreement on interpretation or application of this Memorandum shall follow the City-wide grievance procedure. Local 127 may formally request to continue the grievance, not later than ten (10) days following receipt of the answer at the final step of the grievance procedure (provided it was heard by the City Manager), by serving written notice upon the Management Team. The Management Team will refer the grievance to the City Council for hearing and decision. However, during the term of this agreement Step 6 of the grievance procedure shall be held in abeyance and a pilot program for mediation and non-binding arbitration will be implemented to replace Step 6. The City and Local 127 agree to explore alternative dispute resolution methods using the Sempra Energy’s SDG&E model as a foundation for implementation. If the mediation/non-binding arbitration pilot program is withdrawn at the expiration of the agreement, Step 6 shall be reinstated.
C.	All grievances not responded to within the time limits in Steps 1 through 4 will be forwarded directly to Step 5.
D.	Management will ensure that grievances are properly handled in a timely manner and that any abuses of this grievance procedure are expeditiously corrected.
ARTICLE 11
Stewards
Section 1.	GENERAL
The Union may designate Stewards to represent employees in the processing of grievances subject to the following rules and procedures:
9
A.	The Union may select Stewards for the Unit represented herein according to the attached Exhibit B. Additional Stewards may be named after agreement between the parties. The parties agree to discuss the addition of Stewards in the event of decentralization in a City department.
B.	The Union shall furnish Management representatives on July 1 of each year a written list identifying by name and assigned work areas all regular and alternate Stewards, and the list shall be kept current during the term of this Memorandum.
C.	The Union will designate as Stewards only employees who have passed their initial City probationary period. The Union will also designate as Stewards only employees currently assigned to classifications in the Unit represented by Local 127, as listed in Exhibit A of this Memorandum.
D.	The City agrees to allow no more than ten [10] Stewards to operate outside of their assigned work areas. Local 127 and Management agree to develop a system to identify those Stewards eligible to operate outside of their assigned work areas, subject to ongoing review and the approval of the Labor Relations Manager.
All other Stewards may only function within the boundaries of their City approved area of union assignment. Stewards who are not on a current union submitted and City-approved list of Stewards shall not be recognized as Stewards by the City and shall have none of the rights or privileges agreed to as a Steward.
E.	In an emergency, or if no job site Steward is available, then the Chief Steward or a designated Officer shall have the right to investigate a grievance, or represent an employee.
F.	Management will make every effort not to temporarily or permanently transfer a Steward from a geographic location, as in Exhibit B, without 5 days prior notice to the Union. A prior notice to the Union shall not be construed as limiting Management in its prerogatives to transfer or change the work shift of a Steward.
G.	Stewards are responsible for an accurate accounting of their City compensated time spent on Steward duties as indicated by the time card entries submitted for payroll purposes.
H.	Management agrees that Stewards shall not be penalized or discriminated against in any way for their participation as union Stewards.
Section 2.	HANDLING GRIEVANCES
A.	When requested by an employee who has a grievance, a Steward, with permission of his or her supervisor, may investigate any grievance in his or her assigned work area and assist in its preparation and presentation.
B.	After notifying and receiving approval of the immediate supervisor a Steward shall be allowed reasonable time off during working hours, without loss of time or pay to investigate, prepare and present such grievances. The immediate supervisor will authorize the Steward to leave his or her work unless compelling circumstances require refusal of such permission in which case the immediate supervisor shall inform the Steward of the reasons for the denial and establish an alternate time within 24 hours, except in case of emergency, when the Steward can reasonably expect to be released from his or her work assignment.
C.	When a Steward desires to contact an employee at his or her work location, the Steward shall first contact the immediate supervisor of that employee, advise of the nature of the business, and obtain the permission of the supervisor to meet with the employee. The immediate supervisor will make the employee available promptly unless compelling circumstances prohibit the employee’s availability, in which case the supervisor will notify the Steward within 24 hours, except in case of emergency, he or she can reasonably expect to contact the employee.
D.	A Steward’s interview or discussions with an employee on City time will be handled expeditiously.
E.	A request by a Steward to investigate and process a grievance shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Section 3.	DISCIPLINE

Access to Work Locations
A. Authorized Union business representatives, or the President of the Union or his or her authorized designee in the case of his or her absence after notification to the City Manager’s Office, and one other member of the Executive Board of Local 127, who will not be on City time, shall be granted access to work locations in which employees covered hereby are employed, for the purpose of conducting grievance investigations and observing working conditions. Authorized Union representatives desiring such access to such work locations shall first inform the appropriate Management representative at that work site of the purpose of the visit. The Union representative shall not unduly interfere with the operations of the department during a visit. Representatives have the right to meet with employees on an individual basis during coffee, rest or lunch breaks at City facilities. Such access shall normally be granted by Management unless the visit will unduly interfere with the operation of the department. Such permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.
B.	When a class action grievance emerges, or when management requests to meet and confer during the term of the agreement, Local 127 representatives may request directly from the Labor Relations Manager, permission to have an opportunity to meet with affected employees for a reasonable amount of time during regular working hours for the purpose of discussing the grievance, or management proposals. The decision of the Labor Relations Manager shall be final.
ARTICLE 13
Employee Representation
A.	An employee may request representation from Local 127, not to exceed one City employee, who is not designated as a supervisory employee, and one non-City employee; or two City employees, who are not designated as supervisory employees; or two non-City employees. In addition, the President of Local 127 or a designated alternate may also attend if authorized by the Manager’s Office. Such representation may be present:
1.	During any investigatory or fact-finding meeting where there is reasonable expectation that discipline might result. Such representation is not available in cases requiring immediate removal or suspension as defined in Civil Service Rule XI.
2.	During the required discussion of any document, including an “Unsatisfactory” or “Below Standard” Performance Evaluation, written warnings, reprimands or notes of counseling which are to be made a part of the employee’s permanent record and/or which may be used as a basis for subsequent discipline.
3.	During any Skelly hearing prior to the imposition of discipline by a supervisor, reduction in compensation, demotion, or discharge.
4.	During the appeal of any disciplinary action.
5.	During Accident Review Committee meetings, Civil Service appeals, Long Term Disability and Industrial injury appeals and any other meeting in which representation is normally afforded employees.
6.	The employee will be provided an opportunity to notify Local 127’s office in the event that the employee is required to submit to “for cause” drug or alcohol testing. This opportunity to notify Local 127 is at the employee’s option and shall not be interpreted as a basis upon which any employee may refuse to submit to the required drug or alcohol testing. Local 127 shall utilize this notification to prepare for eventual investigations or fact findings as necessary. In no way shall this representation be interpreted as the right to an immediate appeal of the test.
B.	The City employee representative shall not be an employee subject to the same investigation or fact-finding.
C.	In all other instances, Management has the right to verbally counsel or interview employees as it deems appropriate without employee representation being present.
D.	The employee who is notified of a pending disciplinary action shall be given a reasonable time to consult with his/her representatives so that he/she may prepare a response to said action. All meetings between employees and their representatives on City work time shall take place in the immediate vicinity of the employee’s worksite.
E.	An employee is also entitled to representation as outlined above in appeals of disciplinary actions and less
11
than satisfactory performance evaluations.
F.	If an employee subject to disciplinary action elects to have a City employee as a representative, such employee may attend disciplinary hearings or meetings with management on City time. If these meetings or hearings extend beyond the representative’s normal work hours, no overtime will be paid.
G.	If during any unscheduled meeting in which the employee is informed that discipline may result an unrepresented employee may request representation. The meeting should be stopped and rescheduled affording the employee an opportunity to obtain representation.
H.	When feasible, management shall give an employee a five (5) day written prior notice of his or her right to representation.
I.	Management will encourage Appointing Authorities to schedule some representation matters at the Local 127 Union Hall.
ARTICLE 14
Disciplinary Actions and Appeals
1.	The employee may appeal the placement of any disciplinary document in his/her permanent record by submitting an appeal letter within 10 working days of the employee being notified that any such document is to be placed in his or her file. This appeal letter should contain pertinent details of the basis for the appeal and should be submitted to the Department Head. Disciplinary documents which may be appealed include written warnings, reprimands, and less than satisfactory performance reports. It is mutually agreed that satisfactory and above employee performance evaluations are not eligible to be appealed. As soon as possible after receiving the appeal letter, the Department Head or his/her designee will schedule a hearing on the matter. The employee is entitled to representation at such hearing as specified under Article 12, Section A. After the hearing the Department Head or his/her designee will make a decision within 10 working days as to whether the written document will be retained in or removed from the employee’s record. This decision shall be final and shall terminate the appeal procedure.
2.	Disciplinary actions shall remain a permanent part of the employee’s file, with the exception of the following:
a.	When the employee has appealed the placement of a document in his or her file and the appeal has been upheld by the Department Head or his/her designee.
b.	When a disciplinary action has been appealed to the Civil Service Commission in accordance with the appeal rights provided in Civil Service Rule XI and the Commission has directed that such record be removed from the employee’s file.
3.	The City and Local 127 ascribe to the principles of just and progressive discipline where warranted and appropriate. These principles include:
Performance Related Matters
a.	Performance Plan
b.	Oral Counseling
c.	Written Counseling
d.	Performance Evaluation
e.	Reduction in Compensation
f.	Demotion
g.	Termination
Misconduct Issues
a.	Oral Warning
b.	Written Warning
c.	Reprimand
d.	Suspension
e.	Demotion or reduction in compensation
f.	Termination
12
While these progressive steps are available, severity of the problems, circumstances and supervisory judgment dictate which disciplinary measure is appropriate.
4.	The City Personnel Department and the Appointing Authority shall keep and maintain an official personnel file for employees, which shall contain all information relative to the employee.
Formal reprimands without further penalty more than two (2) years old, and those with additional penalty more than three (3) years old, will be destroyed, and will not be considered for purposes of promotion, transfer, special assignments and disciplinary actions, except as to disciplinary actions when such reprimands show patterns of specific similar misconduct. Reprimands may be retained in the employee’s personnel jacket. Upon request of the employee, such reprimands will be destroyed on this basis. However, in the event that an employee fails to make such a request, on discovery by Management any reprimand will be destroyed in accordance with this provision.
Letters of counseling and letters of warning, more than one (1) year old will be destroyed and will not be considered for purposes of promotion, transfer, special assignments and disciplinary actions, except as to disciplinary actions involving specific similar misconduct as that addressed in the letter of counseling or letter of warning. Letters of counseling and letters of warning may be retained in the employee’s personnel jacket. Upon request of the employee, such letters of counseling and letters of warning will be destroyed on this basis. However, in the event that an employee fails to make such a request, on discovery by Management any counseling or warning will be destroyed in accordance with this provision.
An employee will have an opportunity to rebut any detrimental material which is placed in his or her permanent personnel record by having a letter of rebuttal attached to the detrimental material.
Upon request, an employee is entitled to a copy of specific materials placed in their current personnel record. An employee will receive a copy of any material placed in their personnel record at the time the material is placed in the employee’s personnel record.
All materials placed in the Appointing Authority’s personnel record for an employee will be located in one central file.
An employee’s supervisor may maintain an informal file of job related information on an employee. Any detrimental information will be discussed with the employee during counseling sessions or performance evaluations. Formal disciplinary documents will be maintained in the Personnel Department or Appointing Authority files. Both the City and Local 127 agree that an employee’s failure to challenge any material in such file does not justify the conclusion that the employee is in agreement with any such material.
5.	Less than satisfactory performance reports which are not resolved by the Department Head or his/her designee may be appealed by the employee to the Personnel Director. The Personnel Director will accept and take action on such appeals only when the employee has a valid complaint that:
a.	the employee was not rated by the first-line (immediate) supervisor, or
b.	the Employee Performance Report was not discussed with the employee, or
c.	ratings were changed without the employee’s knowledge, or
d.	the Performance Plan was not discussed with the employee when the employee first began a job or when the plan was revised due to changes in the job. (This applies only to employees in departments/divisions which have implemented the new Employee Performance Review Program.)
If an appeal is accepted, the Personnel Director will investigate the facts and consult with all concerned before a change, if any, is made in the rating.
6.	Less than satisfactory performance reports which are not resolved by the Department Head or his/her designee may be appealed to the City Manager or his designee if the rating was based on incidents that occurred outside of the rating time period.
7.	Skelly Rights
The City agrees to observe the “Skelly” rights of employees in disciplinary actions. Where the City disciplines a permanent employee in the form of a suspension, demotion, discharge, or a reduction in compensation, the City agrees to provide written notice and an opportunity to respond to the Appointing Authority proposing the discipline. The employee will be given a reasonable opportunity to obtain
13
representation and will be provided with the factual basis and pertinent documents for the discipline. The employee will be permitted to have one City employee and one non-City employee as representatives at the Skelly hearing.
8.	Reduction in Compensation
The compensation of any employee of the City may be reduced a maximum of 2 steps within the salary range of that employee’s current classification. Such reduction in compensation may be put into effect upon finding that the employee’s performance is unsatisfactory for the employee’s classification and/or position.
It is the intent of both parties that a reduction in compensation is an intermediary step, normally preceded by progressive discipline and may normally precede more severe disciplinary action.
a.	Procedure for Reduction in Compensation
An employee’s compensation shall be reduced only upon the completion of the following steps:
(1)	The employee receives an unsatisfactory performance report.
(2)	Upon being notified of the proposed action to reduce the employee’s compensation, such employee shall, within five working days, have the right to respond orally or in writing to the appointing authority.
(3)	After giving due consideration to the information provided by the employee, the appointing authority may elect to reduce the compensation of such employee.
(4)	At the time the employee is notified of such action, the employee will be informed of their representation and appeal rights.
(5)	The reduction in compensation may be in effect for only six months of active duty. At the end of that time the employee shall be reinstated to the previous salary step in the job classification or some other type of disciplinary action shall be taken.
(6)	At the end of 90 days the employee’s job performance must be reevaluated by the appointing authority. If the employee’s performance is unsatisfactory the reduction in compensation may continue. If the employee’s performance is better than unsatisfactory, the employee will be reinstated to the previous salary step in the job classification.
b.	Appeal of Reduction of Compensation
Within ten working days of receipt of notice of reduction in compensation, an employee may file a written appeal with the City Manager’s Office. The decision of the City Manager or his designee will be final.
9.	Except for the appeal process for reduction in compensation as stated above, members of the unit shall have all appeal rights currently provided in Civil Service Rule XI.
10.	Unless there are extraordinary and extenuating circumstances, management shall begin the discipline process within thirty days of the conclusion of the investigatory process. Local 127 may grieve violations of this provision directly to the City Manager’s Office.
11.	The use of Last Chance agreements is recognized by Management as a possible alternative to termination of employment in select cases. Consideration by Management of this alternative will be conducted in a fair and equitable manner. When Management agrees to a Last Chance agreement, the agreement shall be fully binding and the duration of the agreement shall normally be one year.
12.	The primary responsibility for conducting a disciplinary investigation and the resulting advance notice of disciplinary action when warranted will be delegated by the Appointing Authority to someone other than the individual prospectively responsible for hearing an appeal of such action. The individual delegated the primary responsibility will also sign the Advanced Notice. Exceptions may be granted by the Labor Relations Manager.
ARTICLE 15
14
Out-of-Class Assignments
Employees represented by Local 127 shall be compensated for out-of-class assignments on the 31st continuous day of assignment or on the 31st day of cumulative out-of-class assignments in the same classification. Out-ofclass assignments shall accrue on a fiscal year basis only. Accumulated days will not be carried into the next fiscal year.
Appointing Authorities should take into consideration all OCA time worked in a class when considering at what step to place an employee who is permanently promoted to a higher classification.
The City agrees that all out-of-class assignments, regardless of number of hours worked in a pay period, will be recorded in the employee’s personnel file.
For employees in classifications in the Maintenance, Labor, Skilled Trades and Equipment Operator representation unit, appointing authorities will give first consideration for appointment to an out-of-class assignment to employees on the eligible list for the class in which a vacancy occurs, except in those cases in which the specialized needs of the assignment or a requirement for an employee with specialized skills necessitates appointment of an employee not on the eligible list.
Management has discretion to determine when out-of-class assignments will be made. Management agrees to provide equal opportunity on a rotational basis for such out-of-class assignments to persons on the eligible list and will consider the seniority, availability, training and job performance of employees when making such assignments. In the event that there is no eligible list, the appointing authority will provide equal opportunity on a rotational basis to eligible employees and will consider seniority, availability, training, and job performance in making such assignments. If the out-of-class assignment lasts over five (5) days, an employee’s current shift or station assignment shall not preclude their eligibility for out-of-class assignment.
Out-of-class assignments shall not exceed thirty consecutive days nor shall a series of out-of-class assignments to any one vacant position exceed thirty calendar days without approval by the Personnel Director. The Personnel Department shall provide notice to Local 127 of assignments that are expected to last longer than thirty days when such assignments impact Local 127 represented employees. Out-of-class assignments shall not be made for the purpose of avoiding filling a position by a limited or permanent appointment.
Eligible City employees who are performing and compensated for out-of-class assignments both the last scheduled workday before and the first scheduled workday after a fixed holiday shall be compensated at the out-of-class rate.
ARTICLE 16
Use of City Facilities
A.	The Union may, with the prior approval of the Management Team, be granted the use of City facilities during non-work hours for meetings of City employees provided space is available, and provided further that such meetings are not intended for such internal employee organizational meetings as soliciting membership, campaigning for office, and organizational meetings and elections. Such meetings in City facilities may not interfere with the efficiency, safety or security of City operations.
B.	Solicitation of membership and activities concerned with the internal management of the Union such as collecting dues, explaining benefits, holding membership meetings, campaigning for office, conducting elections, and distributing literature to individual employees, shall not be conducted during working hours without prior approval of the Manager’s Office.

D.	Parkade parking stamps will be made available to a reasonable number of Local 127 representatives on official business for representation purposes at the Downtown City facilities. A monthly parking pass shall be provided to the President of Local 127.
ARTICLE 17
Bulletin Boards
15
The City agrees to furnish suitable bulletin boards in mutually convenient places for each work area to be used by the Union. The Union shall limit its posting to such bulletin boards and to matters relating to Union affairs. Present locations and allocations of space are considered adequate. Union representatives shall not be unreasonably denied access to the bulletin boards.
Management shall ensure that the space on bulletin boards allocated to Local 127 is clearly designated as such. This will not preclude Management from using other space on these bulletin boards for City information.
Management agrees to provide additional security for bulletin boards in those areas where both parties agree.
ARTICLE 18
Payroll Deductions
A.	It is agreed that AFSCME Local 127 dues shall be deducted bi-weekly by Management from the salary of employees when authorized by Section VI (B) of the Employer-Employee Relations Policy, who file with the City a written authorization requesting that such deductions be made. Remittance of the aggregate amount of all dues shall be made to the Union by Management bi-weekly at the conclusion of each pay period in which said dues and deductions were deducted.
B.	Dues deduction shall be for a specified amount and shall be made only upon the voluntary written authorization of the member. Dues deduction authorization or cancellation shall be made upon clearly marked cards provided by the Management Team or the Union. If an employee submits a payroll deduction authorization change to the City which has not been processed by Local 127, the City will forward a copy of the notice to the Union promptly.
C.	When a member is in a nonpay status for an entire pay period, no dues withholding will be made to cover that pay period from future earnings nor will the members deposit (with the City) the amount that would have been withheld if the member had been in a pay status during that period. In case of an employee who is in a nonpay status during only a part of the pay period and the salary is not sufficient to cover the full withholding, no deduction shall be made.
D.	The Union shall indemnify, defend, and hold the City of San Diego harmless against any claims or suits instituted against the City of San Diego contesting the check-off of Union dues. In addition, the Union shall refund to the City of San Diego any amounts paid to it in error upon presentation of supporting evidence.
E.	Payroll authorization forms may, at the election of Local 127, include a provision that the authorization is for a specific term. The responsibility to enforce this provision lies solely with Local 127. The City will assume all costs for design and printing of the form with Union concurrence and make available sufficient quantities at Union request.
F.	During the term of this agreement the City and Local 127 shall collaborate and cooperate to encourage employees to fully utilize electronic deposit of their paychecks.
The City shall instruct its departments to issue payroll checks and statements in a confidential manner.
ARTICLE 19

Presidential Leave
The parties agree to a Presidential Leave Program for the President of Local 127 with the following elements:
1.	The President will remain a full-time City employee receiving a salary equal to the salary the President is receiving at the time he or she takes office. This amount will reflect the base pay the President receives as calculated for retirement purposes and will not include any add-ons that are not part of the retirement calculation. During Presidential Leave, the President will receive raises commensurate to the raises of employees in his or her classification.
2.	The President will maintain all the rights and benefits of a City employee. During normal work hours
16

3.	The President will be covered by the City’s Workers’ Compensation Plan for any injuries incurred while the President is performing representational activities during normal work hours as defined in paragraph 2 above.

4.	Local 127 will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City, and its employees and agents, for any liabilities, including costs and attorneys’ fees, resulting from any conduct by the President in violation of any federal, state, or local law, or any City policy or procedure, including but not limited to Council Policies, Administrative Regulations, Personnel Regulations, Administrative Manuals, or Department Directives, Policies and Procedures.
5.	Local 127 will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City, and its employees and agents, for any liabilities resulting from the City’s not withholding employment taxes pursuant to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) from the President’s wages, including but not limited to the obligation to pay those employment taxes determined to be due (both the employee and City portions), interest on the late payment of those taxes, penalties for failure to timely file, pay, withhold and remit the taxes, plus costs and attorneys’ fees.
6.	An employee on approved Presidential Leave will submit his/her bi-weekly time card in a timely manner to the Labor Relations Manager or his/her designee for authorization signature.

7.	The Union President may enter Presidential Leave by providing a notice of such election to the City Manager/Labor Relations Office and executing an affidavit of adherence to the provisions of Presidential Leave outlined above.
ARTICLE 20
Rest Periods
A.	The City of San Diego endorses the practice of progressive management which recognizes that regular, authorized rest periods are beneficial both to employees personally and to the productivity of the organization.
B.	The following guides are established to assure that rest periods will be properly controlled and that maximum benefits will be derived from them. These guides also extend to personnel working on an overtime schedule.
1.	Two 15-minute rest periods (including “travel time” if the employee leaves the work area) may be allowed during each 8-hour work day (“travel time” means pedestrian travel or travel in the employee’s private vehicle). Subject to work assignments and departmental requirements, a rest period or a meal break should be allowed near the end of each 2-hour period of work.
Employees who work more than ten hours a day shall be entitled to a third rest period of 15 minutes duration. Employees who work 12 or more hours a day shall be entitled to a third rest period of 30 minutes duration.
Certain constant staffing positions may be exempt from the third rest period. In no case shall an employee working more than ten hours be provided more than a third break.

a.	combining two daily rest periods into one 30-minute period;
17
b.	“saving” rest period time to justify extended lunch hours or shortened work days;
c.	accumulating rest period time from day to day;

It is the City’s intent to accommodate employees’ requests to use annual leave and avoid any loss of this benefit.

Retirement
High One-Year Basis for Final Compensation
Retirement benefits for General Members shall be based upon the “highest one-year” annual base compensation.
Retirement Contribution Offset
The City agrees that it will apply an amount that is approximately equal to 5.4% of the base salary of employees covered by this agreement into the City Retirement System, thereby reducing the amount deducted from employees’ paychecks as the employees’ retirement contribution by that amount. The employee, upon termination, will have no vested right in the amount so contributed by the City. Substitution of this portion of the employees’ contribution by a City payment will not decrease the total amount applied towards the required retirement contribution, and will not affect retirement benefits.

2002 Benefit Changes
31
The City and Local 127, having met and conferred, have agreed to benefit improvements to the City Employees Retirement System for health eligible retirees.
1.	Effective July 1, 2002, a Health Eligible Retiree, as defined in the Municipal Code, will have the applicable Medicare eligible or non-Medicare eligible insurance premiums paid for the Health Eligible Retiree-only insurance, or the Health Eligible Retiree will be reimbursed the actual cost incurred from the Medicare eligible or non-Medicare eligible retiree-only premium up to the maximum amount allowed in Municipal Code Division 12. Municipal Code Division 12 will be amended to set the maximum amounts to be paid on behalf of or reimbursed to a Health Eligible Retiree for retiree-only Medicare eligible or non-Medicare eligible health insurance premiums base on the premium for the City-sponsored PPO plan for Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 and annually adjusted thereafter based on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Office of the Actuary, projected increase for National Health Expenditures for the full year period ending in the January preceding the start of the new plan year; such adjustment shall not exceed 10% for any given year. The_maximum amount of monies reimbursed to Health Eligible Retirees will be 100% of such Medicare-eligible or non-Medicare eligible retiree-only premium. Pursuant to this provision the based monthly maximums are established for FY 2003 as follows:
a)	For Non-Medicare eligible retirees: $489.16
b)	For Medicare eligible retirees: $460.67
Health Eligible Retirees may choose to participate in a City sponsored health insurance plan or any other health insurance plan of their choice.
Additionally, the Retirement System will reimburse the Part B Supplemental Medical Expense Premium for those Health Eligible Retirees enrolled in Medicare.
2.	The Disability Income Offset provision is eliminated. There will be no reduction of retirement benefits if the retiree has other income.
3.	A five year purchase of service credit provision is established effective January 1, 1997. Under this provision, the Member may purchase up to five years of service credit by paying both employee and employer contributions in an amount and manner determined by the San Diego City Employees Retirement System Board to make the System whole for such time. In addition, members retiring on or after January 1, 1997, may purchase probationary periods, military and veterans code leaves, waiting periods for the 1981 Pension Plan, actual time worked hourly or part time, special leaves without pay occurring prior to January 1, 1997, the difference in time between part time and full time prior to January 1, 1997, long term disability, vocational rehabilitation maintenance (VRMA) and temporary total disability (TTD), FMLA periods, special leaves of absence with job to be saved periods and any period preceding reinstatement by the Civil Service Commission following a termination appeal.
4.	A Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP) is established effective April 1, 1997. DROP provides an alternative form of benefit accrual while allowing a Member to continue working for the City.
During the DROP period, a DROP Member retains all rights, privileges and benefits of being an active City employee, except as specifically modified in the DROP Plan Document, and is subject to the same terms and conditions of employment including disciplinary actions up to and including termination. The Member continues to be eligible for the active employee Flex Benefits Program for the classification and is not eligible for “retiree” health benefits until such time as the Member completes or terminates the DROP period.
Under DROP, a monthly service retirement allowance along with any COLA increases, Supplemental Benefit checks and any adjustments to such payments applicable to retirements effective on the date the Member entered the DROP are deposited into a trust account. These SDCERS benefits are calculated as if the Member were retiring on the date the Member enters the DROP. The Member’s contributions to the Retirement System cease. The Member and the City each contribute 3.05% of the Member’s salary each pay period that the Member participates in the DROP. The Member’s contribution is made on a pre-tax basis pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 414(h) (2). These monies are placed in a trust account and are distributed to the DROP participant upon termination of employment or completion of the DROP period whichever occurs first. No withdrawals may be made from the DROP account until the Member completes or terminates his or her DROP period. Interest will be credited to the Member’s DROP account at a rate determined by the Board. The Member is 100% vested in the DROP from its inception.
A DROP participant who becomes disabled may apply for conversion of their deferred retirement allowance to a disability allowance calculated at the date of entry into the DROP.
32
A Member who participates in DROP irrevocably designates a specific consecutive period of months for participation, not to exceed sixty months. The Member must terminate City service at the end of the designated period.
5.	For retirements effective on or after January 1, 1997, the 50% continuance is available to the spouse to whom the Member was married on the date of retirement. The requirement that the member be married to his or her spouse at least one year prior to retirement for the spouse to receive the 50% continuance is eliminated.
6.	The surviving spouse of a Member who is killed while in the performance of duty is entitled to continued health coverage as provided in California Labor Code Section 4856.
7.	The Industrial Disability Benefit is increased from 33-1/3% to 50% of final compensation for retirements effective on or after January 1, 1997.
8.	The modified special death benefit provided to the surviving spouse of a Member killed in the line of duty is amended to eliminate the requirement that the benefit be discontinued if the spouse remarries. Any benefit terminated to such spouse as a result of remarriage shall be reinstated effective January 1, 1997.
1981 Pension Plan Credit for Service
Employees with 1981 Pension Plan credited years of service will be granted at no cost to the employee credit for past CERS service.
COLA Adjustments
Effective July 1, 1992, the cost of living adjustment (COLA) for retirees who retired before October 6, 1980, will increase from 1.5% to 2% per year.
IRS Section 414(H) 2
Implement pre-tax retirement contributions under IRS Section 414(H) 2, effective the first pay period in January, 1993, with the effect of reducing the employee’s income tax base.
A.	Change of Retirement Calculation Factors for City General Members
The Retirement Calculation Factors used to calculate a General Member=s Allowance will increase to the levels shown below (the "New Factors") for all retirements effective on or after July 1, 2002, unless the General Member elects, before retirement, to have his or her Allowance calculated using the Old Factors (2% @ age 55, etc., with 10% added to the Member's Final Compensation) or the Corbett Factors (2.25% @ age 55, etc.). The New Factors will apply to all City employees who join the Retirement System after June 30, 2002, and their Allowances will be capped at 90%. The 90% cap will also apply to: (1) General Members who joined the Retirement System on or before June 30, 2002, except as provided below, and (2) General Members who participated in the Retirement System on or before June 30, 2002, who left City employment but are rehired by the City on or after July 1, 2002.

61	2.60%
62	2.65%
63	2.70%
64	2.75%
65 and older	2.80%
Any General Member whose Allowance as of July 1, 2002 is 90% or more using the New Factors may continue to accrue benefits above the 90% cap until December 31, 2002. The General Member's Allowance will be capped at that time.
1.	Any General Member who joined the Retirement System before July 1, 2002 may continue to accrue benefits above the 90% cap using either the Old Factors or the Corbett Factors. If the Member selects one of these options, the Member's Allowance will not be capped, and the System will refund to the Member, at retirement, any excess contributions the Member made to fund the New Factors.
2.	Any General Member who joined the System before July 1, 2002, and reaches the 90% cap by choosing the New Factors, may continue to accrue benefits above the 90% cap until December 31,
33
2002, at which time the Member's retirement calculation factor and Creditable Service are capped; the Member's Final Compensation is not capped. On January 1, 2003, the Member must choose one of the following options:
a.	If the Member is eligible for a service retirement on January 1, 2003, he or she may:
i.	continue working and contributing to the Retirement System,
ii.	enter DROP, or
iii.	retire.
b.	If the Member is not eligible for a service retirement on January 1, 2003, he or she may:
i.	continue working and contributing to the Retirement System, or
ii.	enter the Cap Program [subject to City Council authorization]. If the Member enters Cap Program, the Member will stop contributing to the Retirement System, and will instead contribute 3.05% of his or her Base Compensation, biweekly at the end of each pay period, to a Cap account established for the Member. The City will match these contributions. The Member may continue participating in Cap until he or she first becomes eligible to retire, at which time the Member must either enter DROP or retire.
iii.	A Cap Program participant who becomes disabled while participating in the Cap Program is eligible to apply for disability retirement benefits. If the Cap participant's application for disability retirement is ultimately approved by the Board, his or her disability retirement benefit will be calculated using the participant's age, Creditable Service and Final Compensation as of the day he or she began participating in the Cap Program.
3.	A General Member may exceed the 90% cap if the Member:
a.	applied to purchase Creditable Service on or before June 5, 2002, and thereafter signed the contract to purchase that time,
b.	was hired at age 24 or younger, and
c.	will exceed the 90% cap because of the Creditable Service he or she applied to purchase on or before June 5, 2002. The Member may not exceed the cap by Creditable Service that he or she applied to purchase after June 5, 2002.
4.	When a Member who meets the conditions of paragraph 3 first becomes eligible for a service retirement, his or her retirement calculation factor and years of Creditable Service will be capped at that time, even if the Member continues to work and contribute to the Retirement System. The Member’s Final Compensation will not be capped. When eligible to retire, the Member may:
a.	continue working and contributing to the Retirement System,
b.	enter DROP; or
c.	retire.
B.	General Member’s SDCERS Contribution Rate Change
(1)	On December 20, 2003, General Members’ contribution rates to SDCERS will be increased by an approximate additional 0.53%.
Eligibility for Industrial Disability Retirement Change

The violent attack must occur on or after July 1, 2000, and such application for industrial disability retirement must be submitted before July 1, 2005.

Eligible employees have $4,725 to spend on Plan selections effective July 1, 2002. The Flexible Benefits Plan annual value for fiscal year 2004 will increase to $5,125 and for FY 2005 to $ 5,575.
On or about April 1, of each year during the term of this agreement, or earlier if mutually agreed, the parties will,
40
on an agreed date, exchange premium rates for the parties’ respective plan offerings.
The benefits available through the Flexible Benefits Plan and the respective annual costs are reflected in the Flexible Benefits Summary Highlights booklet provided to each employee each year of this agreement.
Notes:
1.	It is the intent of the parties that all plans comply with all applicable State and Federal Laws including IRS Regulations. All disputes over interpretation of the above shall be submitted to the appropriate agencies for interpretation.
2.	The employee must select a life insurance and health insurance (unless covered under another comprehensive health plan). An employee may opt out of City health insurance if he/she has other comprehensive health insurance by selecting the “waiver” option.
3.	With the remaining FBP monies, eligible employees may select from other optional benefits including dental, vision, cancer/intensive care protection, 401(k), Deiital Mcdical Visiou and Dependent Care reimbursement and/or cash payment.
4.	After selecting required health and life insurance coverages, employees who are unable to enroll in their desired dental plan for which they are eligible may purchase such benefit by making an “out-of-pocket” payment for the cost difference. Only dental coverage may be obtained in this manner. Such “out-of-pocket” contribution must be made at the time of Open Enrollment and is non-refundable.
5.	In addition to designating flexible benefits monies to pay for reimbursements, employees may designate a specific amount of pre-tax money (IRS restrictions may apply) to be withheld from their paycheck to reimburse eligible out-of-pocket medical, dental, or vision or dependent care expenses. These payroll deductions must be designated during the open enrollment period, are irrevocable, are subject to IRS regulations, and monies are forfeited if not used within the fiscal year.
6.	Eligible employees are required to enroll for their benefits each year during the designated open enrollment period. If an employee fails to complete enrollment within the open enrollment period, the employee’s current options for health (or comparable plan if unavailable), including dependent health offset, and life, will be automatically continued at the same level for the next year as if the employee had elected to keep them. All other benefits options will be cancelled. Any monies remaining from the FBP allotment will be paid out as taxable cash payment. All payroll deductions, including DMV and Dependent Care reimbursement, will continue and may not be eligible to be stopped until the following open enrollment period.
7.	The City agrees that it will not arbitrarily or unreasonably deny LOCAL 127 the opportunity to offer a health insurance plan to active and/or retired employees. Such coverage must include mental health coverage at an equal or better level of coverage than that offered through the City’s health plans. LOCAL 127 agrees to inform Employee Assistance Program (EAP) of any changes to the mental health coverage and/or provider in order for EAP to give input on the proposed changes to ensure that City employees are receiving adequate mental health coverage through their selected health plan.
8.	LOCAL 127 agrees to indemnify the City against any and all claims arising out of the administration of its benefits plans.
9.	Audit and Inspection of Records
The City Auditor is authorized to audit all necessary documents pertaining to the health insurance plans offered by Local 127.
10.	The parties agree that LOCAL 127 is authorized to audit the City’s health plans, during the August through January period, to the extent that documents are requested and provided pursuant to state and federal public information laws.
11.	Local 127 will be available to answer questions at the end of Open Enrollment and New Employee Orientation Sessions.

The employee must subsequently submit satisfactory evidence of attendance at the proposed event in order to receive reimbursement. The parties intend the general procedural requirements of the Tuition Reimbursement plan to be applicable except the requirement of a grade. It is the intent of the parties that this provision will supplement rather than replace training funds heretofore made available by departments for the benefit of employees. It is also the intent of the parties that this opportunity to avail oneself of one-half of the tuition reimbursement plan benefit shall be at the initiation of the employee based on his or her proposal for training or education.

ARTICLE 50
Contracting Out
The decision to contract out services by the City of San Diego is an exclusive Management right. The City however agrees to provide notice to Local 127 when studying the possibility of contracting out, and allowing Local 127 input prior to implementation. The City will refer Local 127’s concerns regarding the outside bidders to the Competition Committee.
The City agrees that it will meet and confer, as required by law, with Local 127 regarding the practical consequences of contracting out for services in the event it becomes apparent that such action will result in the layoff or reduction in work hours of employees covered by this Memorandum of Understanding. In such a case, the City will provide Local 127 with 30 days notice of such action and a reasonable time to meet and confer, as required by law, with Local 127.
If employees represented by Local 127 are to be laid off, the City will make its best efforts to find alternative City employment for those employees affected. Management will attempt to find alternative City employment as close as possible to the employee’s current salary level provided the employee meets the minimum qualifications for this alternative employment.
The City agrees to meet with Local 127 to explore and address Local 127’s “Contracting Out” concerns.

Industrial Leave
1.	PURPOSE
To establish regulations and guidelines regarding the City of San Diego’s Industrial Leave Program.
2.	SCOPE
This regulation applies to all City of San Diego employees including those represented by bargaining agents. If a conflict occurs between this regulation and an existing Memorandum of Understanding for represented employees, the Memorandum of Understanding shall prevail.
3.	DEFINITIONS:
3.1	Disability - the inability to perform the usual duties of one’s classification.
3.2	Emergency - a sudden unexpected happening; an unforeseen occurrence or condition; specifically, perplexing contingency or complication of circumstances; a sudden or unexpected occasion for action; a pressing necessity.
3.3	Gross Negligence - the intentional failure to perform a manifest duty in reckless disregard of the consequence as affecting the life or property of oneself or another; such a gross want of care and regard for one’s own well-being or the rights of others as to justify the presumption of willfulness and wantonness.

3.5	Light Duty - work status with limitations as provided in the City’s Light Duty Program.
3.6	Physician - as defined under 3209.3 of the California Labor Code.
4.	POLICY:
4.1	General:
City-wide safety program exists to prevent accidents and resulting injuries involving employees.
44
Continuing efforts are made to eliminate, guard against, or protect employees from physical hazards in the work environment. Several types of benefits are available to employees who sustain disabilities arising out of their employment. The specific benefits available depend on the circumstances in each case.
This Article sets forth only the eligibility requirements and benefits for industrial leave. Procedures are set forth for industrial leave and in part for other programs available for injured employees. Employees may be eligible for benefits under the Workers’ Compensation Act or the City’s Annual Leave or Sick Leave Programs. Eligibility and benefits under the Workers’ Compensation Act are established in State law (Division 4 of the California Labor Code). Eligibility and benefits under the City’s Annual Leave and Sick Leave Programs are set forth in the Personnel Regulations, Index Code 1-2 and 1-3.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the employee’s entitlement to medical, surgical and hospital treatment as provided in Division 4 of the California Labor Code nor be deemed to affect the employee’s entitlement to receive such temporary disability payments as also provided in Division 4. These rules define the granting of industrial leave only. Industrial leave is not within the jurisdiction of the California Labor Code nor the adjudication of the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board.
4.2	Eligibility for Industrial Leave:
Employees shall be eligible for industrial leave benefits subject to the following provision
a.	The employee is unable to perform his or her assigned duties and is entitled to Worker’s Compensation Temporary Disability under the provisions of Division 4 of the California Labor Code.
b.	The employee reported the injury or illness to his or her supervisor within 24 hours of the incident, except under extenuating circumstances. Extenuating circumstances under which an employee may report an injury beyond the 24 hour limit shall include but not be limited to a report at the time the employee realizes the injury is disabling and the medical evidence is consistent with the claim.
c.	Medical treatment is provided and maintained by a licensed physician acceptable to the City’s Worker’s Compensation Administration.
d.	The employee is medically incapacitated from the performance of light duty, or light duty is not available.
e.	Except in circumstances of obvious emergency, the disability did not result from the failure to:
1.	Wear prescribed safety or personal protective clothing or equipment.
2.	Use provided safeguards or safety equipment.
3.	Follow safety rules and regulations, or other departmental work rules.
f.	The disability did not result from an aggravation or recurrence of:
1.	A pre-employment, non-service connected medical condition or disability (either physical and/or mental), even if such condition is aggravated by on-the-job experience. It is the intent that industrial leave will not be approved when competent medical authority determines the disability to be a result of aggravation of, or caused by, a pre-employment or non-industrial medical condition.
2.	A medical condition for which the employee has received a Compromise and Release settlement pursuant to Division 4 of the Labor Code.
3.	An injury or illness previously denied industrial leave.
Therapy prescribed pursuant to Industrial Leave provisions shall be eligible for Industrial Leave. Therapy sessions shall normally be scheduled at the beginning or end of the day.
g.	The employee’s gross negligence or willful misconduct was not the proximate cause of the disability.
h.	The request for industrial leave is submitted in form and detail as prescribed by Risk Management,
45
is recommended for approval by the appointing authority, and is approved by the City’s Workers’ Compensation Administration.
i.	The employee fulfills his or her responsibility as outlined in this Administrative Regulation.
4.3	Industrial Leave Benefits
a.	The Industrial Leave Benefit shall be the employee’s normal compensation, less current deductions for state and federal tax withholdings, and other payroll deductions authorized by the employee. The injured employee shall be prohibited from amending his or her claim of deductions from the date of injury until after they have returned to work and industrial leave benefits have discontinued.
1.	The term “normal compensation” includes extra compensation for night or unusual schedule work shifts, motorcycle pay, emergency ordinance disposal pay, and educational incentive pay, which the employee was receiving at the time of the injury, but does not include overtime, standby, or out-of-class pay.
2.	Employees may receive normal merit increases while on industrial leave if they are otherwise eligible as provided in Personnel Manual Index Code H-8.
b.	Industrial leave is granted in lieu of Workers’ Compensation Temporary Disability.
c.	An employee cannot supplement industrial leave payments with accrued sick leave, annual leave, or compensatory time off.
d.	Employees shall earn annual leave credits while on industrial leave as if they were working. Employees shall be eligible to accrue and utilize annual and sick leave in accordance with the rules governing the accrual and usage of annual and sick leave respectively. (See Personnel Manual 1-2 and 1-3.)
e.	The City shall continue to make the contribution towards the employee’s health and life insurance coverage as if the employee was working.
f.	Duration of Industrial Leave:
1.	An employee’s maximum industrial leave benefit shall be the number of hours equivalent to the employee’s scheduled work-year.
2.	Industrial leave shall commence on the first workday following the injury or illness for which the employee is medically disabled from working.
3.	An injury shall be deemed to continue through any recurrence or aggravation to the original injury. Claimed recurrences, aggravations, or sequel of any injury approved for industrial leave shall be charged to the balance, if any, of the maximum allowance of such leave for the original injury.
4.	Industrial leave will terminate when one of the following occurs:
a.	The employee fails to follow the advice of the treating physician and pursue a course of treatment which will lead to recovery in as short a period of time as possible.
b.	The employee’s condition becomes medically permanent and stationary.
c.	It is medically determined that the employee will never be capable of performing the duties of his or her classification.
d.	The employee no longer qualifies for industrial leave.
e.	The employee is engaged in outside employment which would medically impede recovery and prolong his/her return to work.
f.	The employee uses the maximum benefits available.
5.	If industrial leave is terminated upon the basis of medical evidence and at a later date, the City relies on further medical evidence which is inconsistent with the earlier medical evidence, the
46
employee shall receive industrial leave benefits which are consistent with the subsequent report relied on by the City.
6.	Industrial leave provides only the benefits enumerated herein.
7.	Return to Duty:
a.	The employee shall return to duty when ordered by the department head, based upon medical reports and other reliable information.
b.	Determination of the proper time for the employee’s return to duty will be based on reliable medical advice.
c.	In cases of suspected malingering, when it appears that the employee and/or the employee’s personal physician are not cooperating toward return to limited or full duty within a reasonable period of recovery, the department head or the Workers’ Compensation Administration will order an investigation and take proper action.
d.	If further remedial action is indicated, the employee must follow a course of treatment which will enable return to full employment at the earliest possible time. This does not mean that the employee should be carried on industrial leave until completely able to perform every duty of the position. All reasonable efforts shall be made to return the employee to work, even in a light-duty status, as soon as, based upon authoritative medical advice, it is safe to do so.
e.	Prior to soliciting information from an employee’s treating physician concerning that employee’s ability to return from industrial leave to a selective placement position, the treating physician shall be furnished with a written statement describing the duties of such selective placement position. The City will allow the treating physician five (5) days to respond in writing. If the treating physician fails to respond in writing within five (5) days, the City may receive information from the treating physician orally. The City may extend the time for response for good and sufficient reason.
5.	PROCEDURE
Responsibilities	Action
Employee
5.1	Each employee is responsible for reporting the job related injury or illness to his or her supervisor within 24 hours of the incident, except under extenuating circumstances. The initial report should be made to the employee’s immediate supervisor, or if unavailable, to the next supervisor in the chain of command. The initial report may be made verbally, but must be followed by completion as soon as possible of the necessary forms outlined below.
5.2	For injuries which result in absence from work at any time following the day of the injury, the employee must complete Form CS-14-25B, Request for Leave of Absence for on-the-job disability, within 24 hours of the disability and have the attending physician complete the appropriate portion of the form. If, because of injuries, the employee is physically unable to comply with this requirement, it shall be the supervisor’s responsibility to complete and submit the form for the employee.
5.3	The employee must complete Form ES-1531A, Employee-Employer Report of Occupational Injury or Illness.
5.4	The employee and others concerned, shall provide the department head, City Manager or his representative with any additional evidence necessary to elaborate on or substantiate injury and medical reports.
5.5	When necessary, the employee must report as soon as possible to a licensed physician.
a.	In doubtful and/or controversial cases, the employee shall be required to report to a physician who is acceptable to the Workers’ Compensation Administration.
b.	The employee, if dissatisfied with the treatment received from the first approved physician, has the right to ask for a change of physicians; however, the physician selected must always be acceptable
47
to the Workers’ Compensation Administration.
5.6	The employee must obtain a medical diagnosis and prognosis for light duty with all applicable work restrictions, since industrial leave cannot be granted if light duty is available and can be performed.
5.7	The employee must follow a course of treatment which will lead to recovery in as short a period of time as possible.
5.8	If requested during prolonged disability, a fully completed set of Form CS-14-25B, including the physician’s certification, shall be provided by the employee for each pay period in order to obtain up-to-date medical information.
5.9	Each employee is responsible to cooperate with Risk Management in their function of determining eligibility and returning the employee to work.
Operating Department Supervisor
5.10	Each supervisor concerned must thoroughly investigate each accident within 24 hours after it is reported and complete the applicable “Employee Injury Investigation Report”. The supervisor must also fill out the supervisor’s portion of the Employee-Employer Report of Occupational Injury or Illness, and make sure the employee completes the employee portion of both that form and the Request for Leave of Absence form. All required forms must be promptly forwarded to the appointing authority for processing.
Operating Department - Appointing Authority
5.11	To make sure that the injury is promptly and thoroughly investigated, shall recommend whether or not industrial leave should be granted, shall determine the availability of light duty, and shall forward all required forms to the Workers Compensation Administration within one workday of receipt from the supervisor.
5.12	To promptly notify the Workers’ Compensation Administration of any potentially controversial case, and all instances of suspected malingering, or where the cause of injury is doubtful.
5.13	To cooperate in determining eligibility and returning the employee to duty.
Operating Department - Payroll
5.14	The day of injury is to be reported on time sheets as a day of work. Necessary leave due to disability shall start with the first part or full scheduled workday of required absence after the day of injury.
5.15	Necessary leave for medical treatment or granted because of recurrence, aggravation, or sequel of an injury previously approved for industrial leave shall be charged to the balance, if any, of the one-year maximum allowance of such leave for said original injury.
5.16	Any holiday falling during a period of industrial leave shall be charged as industrial leave and not be paid as a holiday. Industrial leave will be charged rather than holiday if industrial leave is paid the scheduled workday before or after the holiday. If an employee is scheduled to work on a holiday and is injured, the holiday credit will be granted.
5.17	In those cases where the appointing authority recommends industrial leave, the employee’s absence will be charged to industrial leave pending a determination of eligibility by the Workers’ Compensation Administration. If the employee is later determined to be ineligible by the Workers’ Compensation Administration, the employee will be required to reimburse the City for the number of industrial leave hours used. Reimbursement will be made by charging the employee’s accumulated sick leave, annual leave and/or compensatory time credits. If sufficient leave credits are unavailable, the employee will be required to make a direct monetary reimbursement to the City.
5.18	In those cases where the appointing authority does not recommend industrial leave, the employee’s absence shall be deemed sick leave to the extent the employee has sick leave credits pending a determination of eligibility by the Workers’ Compensation Administration. However, the employee may decline to use sick leave and, with the approval of the appointing authority, may instead take other leave or compensatory time off to which the employee may be entitled. In the event paid leave
48
is not utilized, the employee may receive Workers’ Compensation temporary disability to the extent he or she may be entitled under Division 4 of the California Labor Code. If it is subsequently determined that the employee is eligible for industrial leave, the industrial leave shall be deemed to commence pursuant to Section 4.3(f)(2) of this Regulation, and any sick leave, compensatory time off or other leave credits expended shall be restored to the employee’s balance. In the event temporary disability has been paid, the employee shall be paid the difference between temporary disability and the industrial leave amount.
5.19	The use of sick leave or annual leave credits may be requested if the requirements for industrial leave are not met, or in cases where the employee has exhausted the maximum industrial leave credits. The employee’s sick leave or annual leave credits will not be charged for the amount of temporary disability payments made under Workers’ Compensation Act provisions.
An employee shall not receive payment in excess of full salary through a combination of Workers’ Compensation temporary disability payments and paid sick leave or annual leave or compensatory time off.
5.20	When sick leave is used for an on-the-job injury, the employee’s sick leave account will be reimbursed in hours, by the equivalent amount due from temporary disability payments.
5.21	If a disabled employee is receiving Workers’ Compensation temporary disability benefits, but is not receiving payment for industrial leave, or annual leave, the appropriate payroll symbol is “green C”. It is unnecessary for an employee in this status to request a leave of absence from the Civil Service Commission since the City has a legal obligation under Workers’ Compensation laws to return the employee to gainful employment.
5.22	Leave without pay (payroll symbol “red A”) may be used if the employee is not receiving Workers’ Compensation benefits, annual leave, sick leave, industrial leave, or compensatory time credits. Employees in this status must request a leave of absence from the Civil Service Commission if their absence extends for more than 30 calendar days.
5.23	When sick leave, annual leave or leave without pay is used under these circumstances, a set of Form CS-14-25B shall be completed, routed and processed in the same manner as for industrial leave.
Workers’ Compensation Administration
5.24	All requests for industrial leave will be reviewed by the Workers’ Compensation Administration for a decision on whether the circumstances qualify the employee for industrial leave, under the requirements of this Administrative Regulation.
5.25	Workers’ Compensation Administration shall inform the employee and the department as to the employee’s eligibility for industrial leave.
5.26	Denial of industrial leave shall be in writing, shall contain information as to the specific reason for the denial, and shall clearly indicate the appeal procedure.
5.27	Workers’ Compensation Administration shall inform each applicant for industrial leave of his/her responsibilities under the Industrial Leave Program and of the right to appeal the denial of industrial leave.
5.28	When it appears from competent medical advice that a disability is permanent, and precludes the employee from returning to his or her regular job classification, the Workers’ Compensation Administration will refer the employee to its Rehabilitation Unit for consideration of vocational rehabilitation. All officials concerned will cooperate actively to assist the employee in rehabilitation consistent with proper position classification and compensation. The Rehabilitation Unit, in addition to providing vocational evaluation, training, and other assistance to the eligible employee, will initiate with the Personnel Department and appointing authority, consideration of class transfer, voluntary demotion and other appropriate personnel actions as alternatives to employee termination or disability retirement.
6.	APPEAL PROCEDURE
Responsibility	Action

Industrial Leave Benefits may be terminated if an employee misses a medical appointment.
Employees shall not be prevented from working light duty assignments outside their departments providing that light duty is not offered within their own department and the Risk Management workers’ compensation administrator has reviewed the employee’s work restrictions to ensure that the light duty assignment is appropriate.

The minimum and maximum contributions are determined by the employee’s hire date and participation in the City’s defined benefit plan. These contribution limits, along with all other plan provisions, are reflected in the separate Plan Documents.
The parties agree that the Supplemental Pension Savings Plans currently offered to all eligible employees will be amended to comply with the provision of the Economic Growth Tax Relief and Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA) that became effective January 1, 2002 and other administrative changes presented during the FY 2003 Meet and Confer process.

Personnel Practices
Citizen Complaints and Route Slips

If the complaint is resolved in the employee’s favor, the complaint, together with all related documents, shall be removed immediately from the employee’s personnel file(s), unless the employee requests in writing that the document be retained.
Performance Reports
Performance Reports will normally be given to the employee within 14 calendar days after the close of the rating period. However, in no case shall the Department give a performance report to an employee later than 30 working days after the close of the rating period without the prior approval of the City Manager’s Office or nonmanagerial Department Head. Approval is required for the presentation of the performance report more than 30
52
working days after the due date, not for the content of the report. Failure to obtain such prior approval gives rise to a grievance which Local 127 may present directly to the City Manager’s Office or to the non-managerial Department Head.
Management agrees to Meet and Confer with Local 127 without impasse on enhancements to Performance Report practices and procedures.

Catastrophic Leave Plan
Purpose
Establish a City of San Diego administered Catastrophic Leave Bank permitting City employees to assist other City employees who face extended leaves without pay due to a catastrophic occurrence in their lives.

Catastrophic Leave determinations are non-grievable.
Procedures
A.	1. The employee must have exhausted or expect to exhaust his/her accrued leave (to be verified by the department payroll specialist), as a result of a qualifying event in order to establish a leave bank.
If an employee is diagnosed as terminally ill, a leave bank may be established without meeting this requirement. In such cases, the donated leave will be paid out at termination. A recipient’s total annual leave balance including donated leave cannot exceed 2080 hours.
2.	The employee has received approval for an unpaid leave of absence from his/her Department Head.
B.	Requests to establish a Catastrophic Leave Bank for receipt of donations will be processed by the City Manager’s office.

a.	A medical statement from the attending physician, including a brief statement of the nature of the illness or injury and an estimated time the employee will be unable to work, or other appropriate documentation supporting the request.
b.	Evidence of the Department Head’s approval of leave of absence.
C.	Donations of annual leave may be made to an employee eligible for catastrophic leave. The Donor Department will be billed for the dollar amount of the Donor’s Annual Leave donation.
1.	Donations of leave will be strictly voluntary; the identity of leave donors will be held in absolute confidence.
2.	Employees may only donate accrued annual leave.
3.	Donations may be made in whole hour increments. There is no tax benefit to the donor.
4.	Donors must have an overall annual leave balance of 160 hours remaining after donated time has been deducted.
56
5.	Once donated to an individual, donated leave cannot be reclaimed by the donor.
6.	Employees wishing to donate time shall complete a “Confidential Authorization for Catastrophic Leave Donation” form and submit to their Department Payroll Specialist who will:
a.	verify that donating employee has the minimum required leave balance (160 hours),
b.	convert the donated time to dollars at the hourly rate of the donor and subtract from designated leave category, and
c.	forward to the Labor Relations Manager for tracking and submission to the Auditor-Controller.
Donation authorization forms which do not contain all requested information shall not be processed.
D.	Upon receipt of donation authorizations, the Auditor-Controller shall take the following action:
1.	Convert donated dollars as computed above to hours at the hourly rate of the recipient, and add to recipient’s annual leave balance. Recipient will be taxed for the leave when taken.
2.	Retain a confidential file of donation authorizations.
3.	All deductions (e.g. health premiums, parking, credit union, union dues, etc.) which have previously been authorized by the recipient will be made unless notified in writing by the recipient to cancel deductions.
E.	Donated time is treated as annual leave accrued by the recipient of the donation. Payments up to 80 hours per pay period will be made to the recipient until the donated leave has been exhausted.
1.	Donated time does not alter the employment rights of the City or the recipient, nor extend or alter limitations otherwise applicable to Leaves of Absence or Annual Leave, except as noted in this Article.
2.	Employees who are utilizing donated annual leave hours will continue to accrue annual leave in accordance with Personnel Manual Section 1-2, Annual Leave.
ARTICLE 72
Performance Management (or Pay for Performance) Program
Should the City propose to implement a Gainsharing program pursuant to the MWWD Bid to Goal program, Local 127 agrees to meet and confer for a reasonable period of time prior to implementation.
A Pay for Performance Program was piloted in the Operations and Maintenance Division of the Metropolitan Wastewater Department in FY 97, then refined and expanded Department-wide over succeeding years utilizing lessons learned from the pilot.

1.	High levels of productivity (effective and efficient performance)
2.	Appropriate creative/entrepreneurial initiatives
3.	Teamwork/cross-functional cooperation
4.	Best practices and safety behaviors
The following are rules and guidelines for program administration.

•	Levels of savings and goal achievement are subject to independent review by the City Auditor.
