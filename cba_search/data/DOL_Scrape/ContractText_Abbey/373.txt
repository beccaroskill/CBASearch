Performance Evaluation is designed to promote effective measurement of the value objectives listed below:
•	Problem Solving (Judgment)
•	Communication
•	Technical Skills & Knowledge
•	Integrity
*	Quality and Productivity
•	Customer Satisfaction
•	People Working Together (A Diverse and Involved Team)
•	Corporate Citizenship
*	Enhanced Shareholder Value (Business Knowledge)
*	Leadership
Performance Evaluation may also include measurable performance goals tailored to support the business goals of the individual’s organization. These performance goals may be specific to the organization, job classification, targets (e.g. Quality, Cost, Delivery, Safety, and Morale), or values.
A weighting methodology and value objective clarification can be applied to all or portions of these measures at the organization, skill team or employee level during the define session. These weighting methodologies and value objectives shall be explained to the employee during Defme/Interim/Final PE reviews.
4.2(a) The Performance Evaluation Process consists of three activities; define, interim review and final review. Additional reviews may be conducted as requested.
4.2(a)(1) “ Define” consists of commun Ratio n and docu mentationofcurrentjobresponsibilities, value objectives, performance goals, any weighting, and areas of strengths and weaknesses for development, as well as any other subjects relating to performance. Define activities will be completed within forty-five (45) calendar days of the beginning of the annual Performance Evaluation cycle.
4.2(a)(2) “Interim Review(s)” consists of ongoing communication and assessment of current job responsibilities, value objectives, performance goals, any weighting, and areas of strengths and weaknesses for development, as well as any other subjects relating to performance. Each employee shall have at least one interim review during each twelve (12)-month period. In these reviews, progress towards achieving the defined performance and development goals is assessed and summarized. Either the employee or manager may request additional reviews, as appropriate. Interim reviews will normally occur within two (2) weeks of being requested but in no case longer than thirty (30) days.
4.2(a)(3) “Final Review” will be completed by the end of the annual Performance Evaluation cycle. In the final review meeting, overall performance is assessed, summarized, and documented. Employees may attach a list of accomplishments and inputs from customers for discussion during the review period that are in addition to value objectives and performance goals. A copy of the form with the final review summary will be placed in the employees personnel folder. Supporting data may be retained by rhe employee and the manager.
6
4.2(b) It is expected that occasional disagreement over Performance Evaluation content will be 1 resolved at the lowest possible level. A skip-level manager may be involved in the process for this 2 purpose. However, in those few instances where such resolution is not possible, the Union may 3 involve the Major Organization Human Resource Director (or designee).	4
5
4.2(c) Performance Evaluation sessions (define, interim and final reviews) shall be scheduled 6 to maximize their utility in selective salary and retention index decisions. Recommended schedule 7 is; Define sessions; January - February; Interim sessions: June - July; Final review: December -	8
January.	9
10
4.2(d) When an employee transfers to a new group with differing performance goals, a new 11 Performance Evaluation Define session will be scheduled within forty-five (45) days of transfer to the 12 new group.	13
14
Section 4,3	Performance Evaluation Form. Forms used in the Performance Evaluation Process shall be 15 the same for all employees in this bargaining unit.	16
17
Section 4.4	Career Development. The Union and the Company agree that employees wanting to 18 pursue further career development may use the Performance Development Partnership procedure, 19 PRO-1488, as a tool to work toward that goal.	20
21
Section 4.5 New Employee Progress and Performance. In an effort to assist new-hire employees in	22
reaching their full potential, the New Employee Progress Review (NEPR) will be adopted to counsel new	23
employees to encourage and stimulate job progress and growth. The NEPR can also be used to identify	24
and constructively address performance deficiencies in a timely manner. The program includes;	25
26
•	Opportunities for positive, constructive exchange between a manager and a newly-hired employee. 27
28
•	Performance discussions upon completion of the 30th and 90th calendar days of employment. 29
30
*	Performance discussions upon the 180th and 360th calendar days of employment unless the 31 employee and supervisor have initiated a performance evaluation process.	32
33
•	Notifying the employee of a performance deficiency.	34
35
•	Developing a clear and cogent program for the employee to correct a performance deficiency. 36
37
*	Providing the Union with a copy of the proposed action in a timely manner.	38
39

Individual employee or Union contentions that a re-assignment or layoff is inappropriate, inasmuch as the employee’s assigned job classification and SMC prior to or at the time of such re-assignment or layoff is or was alleged to be inappropriate, are specifically excluded from the grievance procedure described in Article 3, and shall afford no basis for any claim on the part of the individual employee or Union that such re-assignment or layoff should be voided or set aside.
Section 8.2 Procedure Relating to the Filling of Positions.
8.2(a) The parties are agreed that it is in their mutual interest to assure that favorable promotional and retention consideration is granted to those individuals who are best able to maintain or improve rhe efficiency of rhe Company, further its progress and contribute to the successful accomplishment of current and future business. Accordingly, in the filling of positions, particular attention will be given to the development, advancement and retention of the existing workforce.
8.2(b) Re-assignments and transfers of the following kinds may be made by the Company without regard co the provisions of 8.2(e). Positions so filled shall not be regarded as open positions.

8.2(b)(4) Transfers into the bargaining unit of individuals who at some previous time were assigned to Job Classification and Skills Management Codes currently within the bargaining unit.
8.2(c) An “in-place” promotion is rhe promotion of an employee to a higher level within the same Job Classification and Skills Management Code. This promotion results from expansion of the employee’s own work assignment and is not for the purpose of filling a position vacated by another employee. Such an in-place promotion does not constitute the filling of a position within the meaning of 8.2, and the Company may make such in-place promotions without limitations.
8.2(d) All vacant positions other than those filled as described in 8.2(b) and 8.2(c) shall be designated as open positions.
8.2(e) The Company will seek candidates from within the existing workforce for all positions that are designated by the Company as open positions. Employees on the active payroll who have been declared surplus and/or who have been previously downgraded shall have priority rights to open positions as described in 8.2(e)(1) and 8.2(e)(2), respectively. For open positions remaining after the provisions of 8.2(e)(1) and 8.2(e)(2) have been met, other candidates shall receive consideration as described in 8.2(e)(3).

12
8.2(e)(2) If, after application of 8.2(e)(1), the open position still exists, first consideration shall 1 be given to an employee who meets all the following conditions:	2
3
8.2(e) (2)a Was, within six (6) years preceding the date on which the open position is 4 designated, while on the active payroll, downgraded for other than performance reasons as 5 specified in 22.4(b) from the same Job Classification and Skills Management Code as the open 6 position, or from a higher level of that Job Classification and Skills Management Code, or from 7 a directly-related management, engineering, or other payroll position.	8

12
8.2(e)(3) If the open position still exists following application of 8.2(e)(1) and 8.2(e)(2), other 13 candidates will receive consideration in the following order;	14
15
(a)	Individuals	on	file	for	recall	as described	in	8.4(b)	and	candidates	who	make timely	16
application	for	the	open position	through	the	Company’s	Employee Requested Transfer	17
system.	18

employees can make known their interest in transferring to other positions for which they are	26
qualified to perform and which may satisfy their personal needs. A job posting and transfer process	27
will be maintained which will allow employees, without fear of reprisal, to make application for	28
transfer and receive consideration as a candidate for open positions for which they are qualified. All	29
employees, including those involved in surpluses, shall have full access to the Jobs@Boeing process.	30
The Company will provide the Union with a copy of the request for transfer procedure and any	31
changes thereto.	32
33
Section 8.3 Retention System and Re-deployment Procedure.	34
35
8.3(a) Objective. The general objective of the procedure stated in this 8.3 is to provide for	36
the accomplishment of layoffs for business reasons, to the end that insofar as practicable the	37
layoffs will be made equitably, expeditiously and economically, and at the same time will result in	38
retention on the payroll of those employees regarded by management as comprising the workforce	39
that is best able to maintain or improve the efficiency of the Company, further its progress and	40
success and contribute to the successful accomplishment of the Company’s current and future	41
business. The occurrence and existence of any condition necessitating a layoff, and the number of	42
employees involved will be determined exclusively by the Company. Following such determination,	43
the Company will notify the Union of the anticipated layoff and, the affected retention groups	44
and numbers of employees apt to be affected. Affected employees will be given two (2) weeks’ notice	45
prior to layoff wherever practicable, and will receive consideration for open positions in accordance	46
with 8.2(e).	47
48
8.3(b) Retention Index. Management will assign a retention rating to each employee to whom this 49 Article applies with the basic objective of identifying those employees best able to maintain or improve 50 the efficiency of the Company, further its progress and success and contribute to the successful 51 accomplishment of the Company’s current and future business as identified in the employees 52 Performance Evaluation Process. Consistent with this objective, Management will take into account 53 each employee’s competence, diligence and demonstrated usable capabilities based upon the 54 employee’s current performance and a review of the employee's previous performance. Employees on 55 part-time work schedules as defined in 11.4 will be retention rated with employees on full-time work 56

schedules. Length of company service will be a positive factor to the extent that the experience so gained continues to be reflected in increased capability.
8.3(b)(1) Frequency. A retention index review will be conducted no sooner than four (4) months nor longer than twelve (12) months from the prior periodic retention index review. In each review, the Company will group employees for retention purposes and designate the retention rating of each employee in the group as Rl, R2 or R3.
8.3(b)(2) Retention Index Group Make-up. Management will determine retention index groups taking into account skill teams, Major Organizations, Principal Subordinate Organizations, Occupation Code, Job Family, Skills Management Code and Level. The Union will be provided a listing of the Retention Index Groups and as groups are formed or changed, the Union may make suggestions to the Company on how to improve the groupings. Whenever possible, retention groups will be defined in such a way as to group employees in groups of at least ten (10) who are performing rhe same type of work. In a Retention Index Group, the same-level employees should be able to perform each other’s work and higher-level employees should be able to perform lower-level work. Exempt and non-exempt employees will not be in the same retention group.
8.3(b) (3) Review Process. The Company will determine the retention rating of each employee, the members of management who will participate in retention index reviews, the retention index groups to be used, the timing, and the other details of such reviews. Members of management participating in	the reviews will be instructed	by	the Company	to make retention index
assignments with	care, giving full consideration to	the	objective stated	in 8.3(a) and 8.3(b). Such
instructions will	stress that retention rating is	to	be assigned without regard to potential
adjustments for	Company service as provided	for	in 8.3(b)(5).	It is recognized that any
practicable process of assigning a retention rating to each employee cannot be completely free of error as to method used or as to resulting retention rating, taking into account: the large numbers of employees, Skills Management Code, organizations and requirements involved; the fact chat numerous management representatives necessarily must participate in the process; and that many of the factors which must be dealt with are intangible in nature. The review process shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure; however, an employee may appeal rhe employee s assigned retention rating as provided in 8.3(b)(7).
8.3(b)(4) Distribution. Each employee will be assigned a retention rating such that, as nearly as is mathematically practicable, and except as provided in 8.3(b)(8), the retention index distribution for retention groupings within each retention index group is Rl - 38 to 42%, R2 - 38 to 42%, and R3- 18 to 22%.
Since personnel transactions will occur subsequent to each periodic review, it shall not be necessary to maintain this distribution during intervals between periodic reviews.
8.3(b)(5) Adjustments for Company Service. As a part of each periodic retention index review, and immediately following completion of the distribution procedure set forth in 8.3(b)(4), the retention rating of certain employees will be adjusted in compliance with the following;
Employees with twenty (20) or more years of Company service whose assigned retention rating is R3 will be given an adjusted retention rating of R2. Employees with thirty (30) or more years of Company service will have their retention rating raised one level if their retention raring is R3 or R2. Such adjustments will be reflected in the written notification to each employee described in 8.3(b)(6). (Employees who reach the aforementioned Company service dates between periodic retention index reviews will receive an adjusted retention rating accordingly.) Notwithstanding the above adjustments, management shall be obligated to protect employees with an unadjusted R2 or Rl retention rating from being laid off ahead of employees with an adjusted R2 or Rl retention rating in the same retention group.
14
The adjusted retention rating shall apply to the layoff sequence described in 8.3(d), Employees designated 1 pursuant to the process described in 8.5 below may not be eligible for retention service adjustments. Such 2 employees may appeal their R3 using the process described in 8.3(b)(7).	3
4
8.3(b)(6) Employee Notification. Following each periodic retention index review, the	5
Company will provide each employee with a written notification of the employees retention	6
raring prior to the effective date, except where such is made impracticable due to the	7
unavailability,of the employee or the supervisor occasioned by vacations, travel assignments,	8
etc, In such circumstance the notification will be given as soon as practicable. In addition,	9
management will discuss the new retention rating with employees. The written notification will	10
contain:	11
12
8.3(b)(6)a The employees Job Classification,	13
14
8.3(b)(6)b The employee’s retention rating prior to and following any adjustment under 15 8.3(b)(5),	16
17
8.3(b)(6)c The number of employees in each of the three retention index categories 18 [as adjusted under 8.3(b)(5)], within the employees retention index group,	19
20
8.3(b)(6) d The effective date, and	21
22
8.3(b) (6)e A description of the jobs and levels included in the retention group.	23
24
8.3(b)(7) Retention Index Appeals, An employee who feels the assigned retention rating 25 is inappropriate may at any time discuss the matter with his or her immediate supervisor. If	26
within 30 calendar days following notification of the assigned retention rating the employee elects	27
to appeal the rating, and discussion with the immediate supervisor has not resolved the 28 employees concern, certain ratings may be appealed for further review as provided below:	29
30
8.3(b)(7)a The retention rating represents a one or more position drop from the previous	31
raring, and it is substantiated that the drop is not due to the effect of workforce reduction	32
and/or consolidation of retention index groups.	33
34
8.3(b)(7)b The employee has been assigned a retention rating of R3 during four or more 35 consecutive retention reviews.	36
37
8.3(b)(7)c The employee so affected will address his or her concerns in writing to the Union 38 setting forth the basis for such appeal.	39
40
8.3(b)(7)d If the Union believes the employees appeal warrants further review, the Union 41 will notify the Workforce Administration Manager of the applicable Major Organization 42 within ten (10) workdays of receipt of the employee’s appeal.	43
44
8.3(b)(7)e Within ten (10) workdays following such notice, the Major Organization 45 Workforce Administration Manager (or designee who shall not have been previously 46 involved in the assignment or appeal of the retention rating), the appropriate Human 47 Resources Representative and a Union Representative will meet to resolve rhe appeal. 48 Pertinent information may be obtained from the employee, the immediate supervisor and/or 49 the Management Totem Captain.	50
51
8.3 (b) (7)f The Workforce Skill Team Strategist, the I^bor Relations Representative, and the 52 Union Representative will resolve rhe appeal by majority decision at rhe meeting or within five 53 (5) workdays thereafter. In the event the Union considers the decision to be inappropriate to 54 the facts of the case, rhe Union may advance its appeal to the Site Workforce Manager. After 55 this review of the matter by the Site Workforce Manager, unresolved appeals may be advanced 56

to the Site Manager of Labor Relations who shall resolve the appeal. Such resolution by majority decision or by decision of the Site Workforce Manager or the Site Manager of Labor Relations, as the case may be, will be final and binding and will conclude the appeal process.
8.3(b)(7)g If the result of an appeal over a two position drop in retention level is in favor of the employee, one of the following options may be selected as determined by Company and Union representatives:
(1)	Restoration to the previous retention rating of RI, or
(2)	Modification of the assigned rerention rating to R2.
8.3(b)(8) Summer Interns and Co-Ops. Summer Interns and Co-Ops will not be included in or subject to the periodic retention index review.
8.3(c) Out-of-Sequence Retention Rating.
8.3(c)(1) The retention rating of an employee who is reclassified between periodic retention index reviews will be sustained or revised, depending on whether the employee moves between retention groups that are sequenced with regard to levels.
8.3(c)(l)a With downward movement between sequenced retention groups, the employee will become an RI until the next retention index review or until management reassigns a retention.
8.3(c)(l)b With an upward movement between sequenced retention groups, the employee will automatically receive a retention rating of R3 until the next retention index review or until management reassigns a retention.
8.3(c)(l)c When no level sequencing between groups is involved, the employee will retain the same retention rating as before the reclassification until the next retention index review or until management reassigns a retention.
8.3(c)(2) An employee who returns from leave of absence between periodic retention index reviews shall retain the same retention rating as before the leave of absence until management assigns the employee a different retention rating and so notifies the employee.
8.3(c)(3) An individual who enters the batgaining unit between periodic retention index reviews shall automatically be assigned retention rating R3 until management assigns the employee a different retention rating and so notifies the employee.
8.3(c)(4) An individual who returns from layoffshall be assigned the retention raring of record at the time of layoff, providing there has not been a retention index review during the layoff period. The individual will automatically be assigned retention rating R3 if a retention index review has been conducted during the layoff period.
83(c)(5) The out-of-sequence retention rating assigned under the provisions of 8.3(c)(1) through 8.3(c)(4) will be reaffirmed or superseded by the retention rating assigned during the next periodic retention index review.
8.3(d) Re-deployment Procedures.

Section 8.4 Layoff Status and Return to Active Employment.
8.4(a) Maintenance of Layoff Status.
8.4(a)(1) Each employee laid off under rhe provisions of this Article will remain on layoff status for a total period of three years from rhe date the layoff was effective, subject to 8.4(a)(2).
8.4(a)(2) An employee shall remain on layoff status in accordance with 8.4(a)(1), provided he or she does not:
8.4(a) (2)a Fail to respond to a formal offer from the Company of a job within ten (10) workdays after it is extended or by such later date as may be stipulated by the Company, or
8.4(a) (2)b Refuse a formal offer from the Company for a full-time job within the bargaining unit or in the same labor market area from which laid off, for which rhe salary or level offered is equal to or greater than the employees salary at the time of layoff plus the inflation adjustment in effect at the time of layoff, or

8.4(b) Return to Active Employment.
8.4(b)( 1) It is a mutual objective of the Company and the Union that laid-off employees who have not been determined ineligible under 8.4(b)(3), 21.3(a), or 8.5 be recalled to active employment, and a mutual desire that such recall into the Major Organization from which the employee was laid off be offered in approximate reverse order of layoff. Accordingly, employees on file for recall pursuant to 8.4(b)(4) will be offered return to active employment within the applicable Retention Group in approximate reverse order of layoff, prior to workforce additions from sources external to the Company subject to the following limitations:
18
8.4(b)(l)a Nothing in 8.4 will preclude rhe Company from hiring from sources outside the 1 Company when projected requirements exceed the number of employees in applicable Skills 2 Management Codes on file pursuant to 8.4(b)(4) who are eligible for an offer of recall. 3 4

Consequently, not all Company 8 decisions relating to recall and hiring can promote the mutual objective and desire stated 9 above. Such decisions will not be subject to Article 3.	10
11
8.4(b)(2) If a Major Organization has an opening for a position or positions and the Major 12 Organization has no people who are eligible to return to active employment under 8.4(b), but 13 there are persons who are eligible for return to active employment under 8.4(b) in a different Major 14 Organization or in a different Retention Group, in the same Job Classification and the same Skills	15
Management Code, then those eligible people should be considered for the position or positions	16
before rhe job is posted externally. If no one is selected for the opening from the list of eligible 17 persons from another Major Organization or different Retention Group, then approval must be 18 obtained from the appropriate site-wide skill team before the position is advertised externally. 19 20
8.4(b)(3) The Company periodically will review with the Union the operation of 8.4(b)(1) in 21 order to facilitate achievement of the mutual objective and desire stated above.	22
23
8.4(b)(4) Prior to layoff, the Company will review those employees holding an R3 retention 24 index to determine eligibility for re-employment consideration under 8.4(b)(1). The review will 25 be limited to those employees for whom there is supporting documentation of performance 26 deficiencies. The review will be performed by the cognizant management for the employee’s Skills 27 Management Code. Based on the review, the employee will be advised no later than the time the 28 layoff notice is issued as to his or her eligibility for re-employment consideration under 8.4(b)(1).	29
An employee determined ineligible may appeal such determination to the cognizant captain. If 30 the appeal does not resolve the matter, the employee may then file a grievance in accordance with 31 Article 3. Such grievance shall be limited to the first three (3) steps of the grievance procedure 32 and shall not be subject to arbitration.	33
34
8.4(b)(5) At the time of layoff, the Company automatically will place in the file for priority	35

date, eligibility for coverage for medical/den tai insurance, life insurance, accidental death and	15
dismemberment insurance, business travel accident insurance, long-term and short-term disability	16
insurance, and voluntary personal accident insurance begins on the first day of the month following	17
the month in which the re-employment commences. If the temporarily-recalled employee begins at	18
least one (1) year after the original layoff effective date, eligibility for coverage for such benefits begins	19
the first day of the month following one (1) full calendar month of continuous employment.	20
21
8.6(g) With regard to the Retirement Plan, unused sick leave, and vacation, employees on Temporary 22 Recall will be set up in the system based on their respective layoff/recall circumstances. This will 23 include the reactivation of unused but earned credits and the generation of future benefits consistent 24 . with standard policies. Voluntary Investment Plan contributions may be resumed, beginning on the 25 first of the month following recall.	26
27
8.6(h) Company service will be earned beginning the first day back on the active payroll.	28

8,6(j) Employees on Temporary Recall will not receive a retention index based on Temporary Recall 33 assignments.	34
35
8.6(k) Employees on Temporary Recall will generate funds fora selective adjustment exercise if they 36 meet contractual criteria.	37
38
8.6(1) Employees on Temporary Recall will not be eligible for layoff benefits when their Temporary 39 Recall assignment ends.	40
41
8,6(m) TTte Company is in the process of developing a policy on temporary recalls. Upon	42
implementation of that policy the terms and conditions of the policy will govern employees on	43
temporary recall and supersede this Section. The Company will review the draft policy with the Union	44
prior to implementation and will consider its comments when forming the contents of the policy. 45 46

11.5 (e) Cost of Living Adjustments.	30
31
11.5(e)(1) Employees eligible to participate in the selective adjustment funds under 11.5(a) may 32 also receive Cost of Living Adjustments to the extent such adjustments become effective under and 33 in accordance with all of the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Section 11.5(e). The 34 terms, definitions, and limitations stated in 11.5(a) and 11.5(b) also apply to such adjustments. 35 Cost of Living Adjustments would be delivered to each eligible employee separately from those 36 selective adjustment funds derived in 11.5(a). Cost of Living Adjustments would be effective on 37 the dates specified in Table 1.	38
39
11.5(e)(2) Determination of Cost of Living Adjustments shall be made in reference to the series 40 U.S. city average “Consumer Price Index Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers” published 41 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, with the following base period: 42 1982-1984 = 100, such Index being referred to herein as the BLS Index.	43
44
11.5(e)(3) Computations will be made using the three (3)-month average of the BLS Index for 45 July, August and September 2000 as the base period.	46
47
11.5(e)(4) During the life of this Agreement, Cost of Living Adjustments shall be computed	48
using the three-month average of the BLS Index for the periods specified in Table II and the	49
corresponding BLS Index threshold values expressed as percentage increases over the 2000 base	50
period. The formula will be: percentage of Cost of Living Adjustment equals fifty percent (50%)	51
of the percentage increase in the BLS Index, from the 2000 base period to the BLS Index	52
Comparison Quarter, that exceeds the BLS Index Threshold Percentage shown in Table II. In	53
order to preclude recognition, on more than one effective dare, of the same percentage increase	54
in the BLS Index, any recognition on one effective date of a percentage increase over the	55
applicable BLS Index Threshold Percentage will cause that percentage to be set aside and	56

disregarded in ensuing computations. [E.g., if the BLS Index for October, November, and December 2003 represented a 12.0 percent increase over the base period (yielding a 2.5 percent Cost of Living Adjustment effective March 5, 2004), no Cost of Living Adjustment would result for the March 4, 2005, effective date unless, and to the extent, the BLS Index for October, November, and December 2004 represented an increase in excess of 18.2 percent (18.2%) over the base period.] BLS Index three (3)-month averages, BLS Index increase percentages, and salary increase percentages will be rounded to the nearest tenth, with five hundredths rounded upward to the nearest tenth.

Specifications related to cost, number of days per week, equipment, and participation criteria are not specified in Boeing policy. Each organization has the latitude to utilize and tailor the application of Virtual Office policy to best meet its needs according to requirements, skills, and responsibilities.
The employee’s duties, obligations, responsibilities and conditions of employment with the Company remain unchanged. Employees remain obligated to comply with all Company rules, policies, practices and instructions. Participation in the Virtual Office Program ‘Work at Home’ element is entirely voluntary and may be terminated by the employee, his or her manager, or the Company at any time.
The detailed terms and conditions of this Program are covered in the Virtual Office Program procedure, PRO-497, which is subject to change ar the Company’s discretion. The parties intend that union-represented employees be eligible to participate in the Program to the same extent as non-union employees.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING	34
RELATING TO SEX CRIMES	35
36
The Company and the Union recognize (1) the growing awareness and abhorrence in our society of sex	37
crimes victimizing children, and (2) the deleterious effect the presence in the workforce of perpetrators of	38
such crimes would have on the efficiency and morale of pro fess ion al/engineer! ng and technical employees 39 of the Company and on the reputation of the Company and its products. The parties therefore agree as 40 follows:	41
42
(1)	Any discipline or discharge of a Union-represented employee who has committed a sex crime	43
victimizing a child or children shall be deemed to be for “just cause” and shall not be subject to	44
the grievance and arbitration provisions of the parties’ collective bargaining agreements or to any 45 other challenge or proceeding by the Union.	46
47
(2)	For purposes of this Letter of Understanding, the term “sex crime victimizing a child or children” 48 includes rape, sexual assault, statutory rape, incest, child molestation, child pornography, public	49
indecency, indecent exposure, indecent liberties, communications with a minor for immoral	50
purposes, promoting prostitution, and similar crimes as defined in the jurisdiction in which the	51
offense is committed, where the victim of said crime(s) is under the age of 18 years at the time of	52
I	the commission of the crime(s). An employee shall be considered to have committed such a crime	53
b	if the employee is convicted of the crime, or if the employee pleads guilty or nolo contendere	54
1	to the crime, or if the employee enters a special supervision program pursuant to a deferred 55
K	prosecution arrangement relating to the crime,	56

SECTION 1 ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES
Employees eligible for the Package are active Boeing salaried employees represented by the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (‘SPEEA’). The employee is nor eligible to enroll if he or she is working in a capacity that, at the sole discretion of the plan administrator, is considered contract Labor or independent contracting.
SECTION 2
ELIGIBLE DEPENDENTS
Dependents eligible for the medical and dental plans are the employee’s legal spouse and children (natural children, adopted children, children legally placed with the employee for adoption, and stepchildren) who are under age 25, unmarried, and dependent on the employee for principal support, including children who are attending school.
An employee may request coverage for the following dependents:
1.	A common-law spouse if the relationship meets the common-law requirements for the state in which the employee entered into the common-law relationship.
2.	A same-gender domestic partner if the employee and same-gender domestic partner meet all of the following requirements. The employee and partner must be:
a.	Of the same gender.
b.	Eighteen years of age or older.
c.	financially interdependent and share the same residence.
d.	Not married to or legally separated from another person or involved in another same-gender domestic partner relationship.
e.	Not blood relatives of a degree of closeness that would prohibit marriage.
A same-gender domestic partner is considered a spouse for the purpose of the medical and dental plans. The employee must complete an Affidavit of Domestic Partnership to cover a same-gender domestic partner under the medical and dental plans.
3.	Unmarried children of the employee’s same-gender domestic partner who are under age 25. These children are considered stepchildren for the purpose of the medical and dental plans. The Affidavit of Domestic Partnership requirement applies.
4.	Other children, as follows, who are under age 25, unmarried, and dependent on the employee for principal support, including children who are attending school;
a.	Children who are related to the employee either directly or through marriage (e.g., grandchildren, nieces, nephews).
b.	Children for whom the employee has legal custody or guardianship, or has a pending application for legal custody or guardianship, and are living with the employee.
Annual certification of eligibility is required to continue coverage for children from age 19 through age 24.
A-4
In accordance with federal law, the Company also provides medical and dental coverage to certain	1
dependent children (called alternate recipients) if the Company is directed to do so by a qualified medical	2
child support order (QMCSO) issued by a court or state agency of competent jurisdiction.	3
4
Documentation is required to request coverage for a child named in a QMCSO, for a child for whom the	5
employee has been given legal custody or guardianship or for a same-gender domestic partner or his or her	6
children.	7
8
A.	Special Provisions When Family Members Arc Boeing Employees. No person may be covered both	9
as an employee (active or retired) and as a dependent under any type of plan offered by Boeing, and	10
no person will be considered a dependent of more than one employee. Eligible dependents do not 11 include other Boeing employees covered under any Company-sponsored plan providing medical, vision 12 care, prescription drug, dental, or similar services. However, if a dependent spouse is also a part-time 13 Boeing employee, the spouse and eligible dependent children are considered eligible dependents if 14 other Boeing coverage is waived. If the employee and spouse both are Boeing	employees and	15
have dependent children, the parents may elect medical and dental coverage for eligible children	16
under one parent’s plans. As an alternative, parents may elect medical coverage for eligible children 17 under one parent’s plan and dental coverage under the other parent’s plan. In	either case, all	18
eligible children must be enrolled in the same medical plan and the same dental	plan (except as	19
required by a QMCSO). The same provisions apply to a same-gender domestic partner and his or 20 her children.	21
22
B.	Incapacitated Children. A disabled child age 25 or older may continue to be eligible (or enrolled if	23
the employee is a newly-eligible employee) if he or she is incapable of self-support due to any mental	24
or physical condition that began before age 25. The child must be unmarried and dependent on the	25
employee for principal support. Coverage may continue under the medical and dental plans for the	26
duration of the incapacity as long as the employee continues to be eligible under the plans and the	27
child continues to meet these eligibility requirements.	28
29
Special applications for coverage are required for disabled dependent children age 25 or older.	30
31 32
SECTION 3	33
HOW TO ENROLL	34
35
A.	Life Insurance and Accidental Death and Dismemberment Plans. Employees automatically are 36 enrolled in the Life Insurance and Accidental Death and Dismemberment Plans when eligible. The 37 employee may designate a beneficiary for life and accident benefits through the Boeing Service Center. 38 39
B.	Medical Plans. In designated locations, the Company provides employees with a choice among 40 medical plans. The Traditional Medical Plan offers enhanced benefits when a member of its network 41 is used. Coordinated care plans also rely on selected networks of providers.	42
43
Employees receive enrollment instructions at the time of employment and may elect medical coverage 44 under one medical plan by the date indicated on the enrollment worksheet. All family members,	45
including the employee, must be enrolled in the same medical plan, except as specified in Section 2.A.	46
47
The Company provides medical coverage as follows:	48
49
1.	Employees who live or work in a coordinated care plan service area may enroll in a coordinated care 50 plan or the Traditional Medical Plan.	51
52
2.	Employees who do not live or work in a coordinated care plan service area may enroll in the 53 Traditional Medical Plan.	54
55
Some coordinated care plans do not offer same-gender domestic partner coverage.	56

3.	Each employee with a spouse (or same-gender domestic partner) enrolled in a Company-sponsored plan must provide information regarding coverage available through another employer to determine whether or not special contributions are required to enroll the spouse. If the employee does not authorize a required contribution, the spouse will not be enrolled for medical coverage. The employee will not be able to enroll the spouse until the earlier of:
a.	The next annual enrollment period.
b.	The date the spouse loses the option to be covered under the other employer-sponsored medical plan.
The Company will require periodic verification of data.
C.	Dental Plans. Employees in certain areas are offered three (3) dental plans: the Scheduled Dental Plan, Preferred Dental Plan, and Prepaid Dental Plan. In certain areas, provider networks for the Preferred Dental Plan and/or Prepaid Dental Plan may not be available and employees are offered only the Scheduled Dental Plan. Employees receive enrollment instructions at the time of employment and may elect dental coverage under one dental plan by the date indicated on the enrollment worksheet. All family members, including the employee, must be enrolled in the same dental plan except as specified in Section 2.A.
The Company provides dental coverage as follows:
1.	The Company provides coverage under the Scheduled Dental Plan, Preferred Dental Plan, or Prepaid Dental Plan for employees who live in a service area of the Preferred Dental Plan or Prepaid Dental Plan.
Under the Prepaid Dental Plan, employees must select a participating provider from the prepaid provider network. No dental benefits are payable until the employee selects a participating provider.
2.	The Company provides dental coverage under the Scheduled Dental Plan to employees who do not live or work in a service area of the Preferred Dental Plan or Prepaid Dental Plan.
D.	Annual Enrollment Period. The Company establishes an annual enrollment period when employees may change medical and/or dental plans.
E.	Special Enrollment. If an employee declines dependent enrollment in the medical and dental plans because of other employer-sponsored health care coverage (such as through a spouses employer), the employee may be able to enroll eligible dependents in the Company-sponsored medical and dental plans during the year as long as enrollment is within sixty (60) days after other coverage ends.
If an employee declines dependent enrollment when first eligible and the dependent’s other health care coverage was through continuation coverage from a previous employer (coverage mandated by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, or COBRA), the dependent must exhaust his or her COBRA coverage to be eligible for the special enrollment period.
If a dependent’s other health care coverage was not through COBRA, the coverage loss must be due to loss of eligibility for the health care coverage (including from divorce, death, termination of employment, or reduction in hours of employment) or termination of employer contributions toward such coverage.
If an employee has a new dependent as a result of marriage, entering into a same-gender domestic partner relationship, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, the employee may enroll the new dependent during the year as long as enrollment is requested within one hundred twenty (120) days after the qualified event. See “Changes in Status,” Section 3.E, for more information.
A-6
F.	Changes in Status. An employee will not be able to make enrollment changes until the next annual	1

SECTION 16
COORDINATION OF BENEFITS
If an employee or dependent has medical, dental, or other health coverage in addition to being covered under these medical and dental plans, the following rules govern coordination of benefits with the other coverage. Other coverage includes, whether insured or uninsured, another employer’s group benefit plan, other arrangement of individuals in a group, Medicare (to the extent allowed by law), individual insurance or health coverage, and insurance that pays without consideration of fault.
The service representative has the right to obtain and release any information or recover any payment it considers necessary to administer these provisions.
The exclusion of government benefits and services is described in “Medical Plan Exclusions" in Section 11.H., in “Dental Plan Exclusions” in Section 12.B., and in “Scheduled Dental Plan Exclusions" in Section 15.H.
A.	Order of Payment
The primary plan pays its benefits first and pays its benefits without regard to benefits that may be payable under other plans. When another plan is the primary plan for health care coverage, the secondary plan pays the difference between the benefits paid by the primary plan and what would have been paid had the secondary plan been primary.
1.	A plan is considered primary if:
a.	It has no order of benefit determination rules.
b.	It has benefit determination rules that differ from coordination of benefit rules under state regulations or, if not insured, that differ from these rules,
c.	All plans that cover an individual use the same coordination of benefit rules, and under those rules, the plan is primary.
2.	If the aforementioned rules do not determine which group plan is considered primary, this plan applies the following coordination of benefit rules:
a.	A plan that covers a person as an employee, retiree, member, or subscriber pays before a plan that covers the person as a dependent.
b.	A plan that covers a person as an active employee or dependent of an active employee is primary. The plan that covers a person as a retired, laid-off, or other inactive employee or as a dependent of a retired, laid-off, or other inactive employee is secondary.
A-50
c.	If a dependent child is covered under both parents’ group plans, the child’s primary coverage 1 is provided through the plan of the parent whose birthday comes first in the calendar year,	2
with secondary coverage provided through the plan of the parent whose birthday comes later	3
in the calendar year.	4
5
d.	If a dependent child’s parents are divorced or separated and a court decree establishes	6
financial responsibility for rhe health care coverage of the child, the plan of the parent with	7
such financial responsibility is the primary plan of coverage. If the divorce decree is silent on 8 the issue of coverage, the following guidelines are used:	9
10
1)	The plan of the parent with custody pays benefits first.	11
12
2)	The plan of the spouse of the paretic with custody pays second.	13
14
3)	The plan of the parent without custody pays third.	15
16
4)	The plan of the spouse of the parent without custody pays fourth.	17
18
e.	If none of the aforementioned rules establishes which group plan should pay first, then the 19 plan that has covered the person for the longest period is considered the primary plan of 20 coverage.	21
22
f.	Continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985	23
(COBRA) always is secondary to other coverage, except as required by law.	24
25
g.	If the employee or dependent is confined to a hospital when first becoming covered under 26 this plan, this plan is secondary to any plan already covering the employee or dependent for 27 the eligible expenses related to that hospital admission. If the employee or dependent does 28 not have other coverage for hospital and related expenses, this plan is primary.	29
30
Benefits under a Company-sponsored medical or dental plan are not coordinated with benefits paid 31 under any other group plan offered by the Company. An employee can receive benefits from only 32 one (1) Company-sponsored medical or dental plan. However, when dental services performed by 33 a licensed dentist also are covered under the medical plan, the dental plan pays its benefits first 34 and the medical plan is secondary;	35
36
Federal rules govern coordination of benefits with Medicare. In most cases, Medicare is	37
se	condary to a plan that covers a person as an active employee or dependent of an active	38
em	ployee. Medicare is primary in most other circumstances.	39
40
B.	Traditional Medical Plan	41
42
The primary plan pays benefits without regard to any other plan. When the Traditional 43 Medical Plan is secondary, it adjusts benefits so that the total payable under both plans 44 for expenses covered under the Traditional Medical Plan is not more than would be payable 45 under the Traditional Medical Plan. Neither plan pays more than it would without coordination 46 of benefits.	47
48
Plan means any plan providing medical, dental, vision care, hearing aid benefits, or treatment under 49 individual insurance, group insurance, or any other coverage for individuals in a group, whether on 50 an insured or uninsured basis.	51
52
Treatment of end-srage renal disease is covered by the Traditional Medical Plan for the first thirty (30)	53
months following Medicare entitlement due to end-stage renal disease, and Medicare provides 54 secondary coverage. After this thirty (30)-monrh period, Medicare provides primary coverage and the 55 Traditional Medical Plan provides secondary coverage.	56

C.	Coordinated Care Plans
Coordination of benefit provisions vary by plan,
D.	Dental Plans
Benefits payable under the Scheduled Dental Plan, Preferred Dental Plan, and Prepaid Dental Plan take into account any coverage (including orthodontic coverage) the employee or family members have under another plan.
Plan means any plan providing medical, dental, vision care, hearing aid benefits, or treatment under group insurance or any other coverage for individuals in a group, whether on an insured or uninsured basis. However, plan excludes any medical plan sponsored by the Company. This means the dental plans pay first when dental expenses performed by a dentist also are covered by any medical plan sponsored by the Company.
The dental plans always pay regular benefits in full or a reduced amount that, when added to benefits payable by another plan, equals one hundred (100%) percent of allowable expenses.
Allowable expense means any charge, up to the maximum allowable fees incurred during a year and while eligible for benefits under the Scheduled Dental Plan, Preferred Dental Plan, or Prepaid Dental Plan part or all of which would be covered under any of the plans.
No benefits are payable under this provision unless the charges were incurred in connection with a dental service or treatment.
SECTION 17
WHEN AN INJURY OR ILLNESS IS CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANOTHER
If a third party is legally liable for an injury or illness to a person covered under these medical and dental plans, regular plan benefits will be paid if the injured person agrees to cooperate with the service representative in administering the plan’s subrogation rights. This includes providing all the necessary and requested information and submitting bills related to the injury or illness to any applicable insurer. The injured person also must agree to reimburse the plan if he or she recovers payment from the liable party or any other source. A third party includes any party possibly responsible for causing or compensating the injury or illness of a person covered under this plan, or the covered person’s automobile, homeowner’s, or other insurance coverage.

SECTION 19 TERMINATION OF COVERAGE
A.	Life Insurance Coverage
Life insurance coverage stops on the date employment terminates.
Within thirty-one (31) days after the employee terminates employment, by making application and paying first premium to the Plan’s insurer, the employee may convert life insurance coverage to an individual life insurance policy on any regular whole life insurance plan. This individual policy will be issued, without medical examination, at the insurer's regular rates. The amount of life insurance converted cannot exceed the amount in force on the date insurance terminates.
If, after an individual conversion policy is issued, benefits under the Life Insurance Plan are continued due to total disability, the individual policy must be surrendered without claim other than the return of paid premiums.
If the employee dies within the thirty-one (31)-day conversion period, the conversion amount is payable.
An employee who is being transferred and is no longer eligible for coverage under the Life Insurance Plan, but who remains employed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries, also may convert the difference between the amount of life insurance provided by the Life Insurance Plan less the amount provided by the plan for which the employee has become eligible. Application must be made within thirty-one (31) days of the date of transfer.
B.	Accidental Death and Dismemberment Coverage
Accidental death and dismemberment coverage stops on the date employment terminates.
C.	Medical Coverage
Medical coverage for the employee and dependents stops at the end of the calendar month in which the employee terminates employment or the end of the last month required contributions are paid, whichever occurs first. If earlier, a dependent’s coverage stops at the end of the month in which he or she no longer qualifies as a dependent.
However, coverage may be continued under certain circumstances as specified below. Any required contributions must be paid during these periods for coverage to continue.
1.	In case of layoff, medical coverage for employees and dependents continues until the employee is covered by any other group medical plan either as an employee or as a dependent, but in no event beyond three (3) months after the date of layoff.
2.	If the employee dies (other than from an industrial accident), medical coverage continues for eligible dependents until the earlier of twelve (12) months after the employees death or when the dependents become covered by any other group medical plan.
3.	If the employee dies from an industrial accident, medical coverage continues for eligible dependents until the earlier of thirty-six (36) months after the employees death or when the dependents become covered by any other group medical plan.
A-58
The service representative will make available to a terminating employee an individual program of I medical benefits similar to those then being issued for group conversion. The benefits provided under 2 the individual plan will not exactly duplicate the benefits provided under this group medical plan. 3 This conversion privilege is also available to covered dependents that cease to qualify under the group 4 policy and to surviving covered dependents if the employee dies. No evidence of insurability is 5 required.	6

eligible dependents until the earlier of twelve (12) months after the employee’s death or when	15

If the employee becomes totally disabled 26 before coverage ends under the Package, the life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment 27 benefits of the Package, which would have continued if the employee had stayed in the eligible class, 28 will continue during the total disability instead of all other Company life insurance and accidental 29 death and dismemberment benefits.	30
31
F.	Continuation of Medical and Dental Coverage (COBRA)	32
33
If medical and dental coverage for the employee and dependents (including a same-gender domestic	34
partner and his or her children) otherwise would terminate due to one of the following reasons, these	35
benefits may continue for specified periods under Public Law 99-272, Title X, as amended, if the	36
individual makes a timely request to the Company and pays the required contribution;	37

44

A.	Approved Medical Leaves of Absence
An employee who is eligible for coverage and begins an approved medical leave of absence due to a total disability is eligible for the Package the same as an active employee until the last day of the calendar month in which the leave began. (Eligible dependents also are eligible for medical and dental benefits.)
If the employee is totally disabled and remains on an approved medical leave of absence that extends beyond this period, the employee’s life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment, medical, and dental benefits (and dependent medical and dental benefits) continue up to six (6) full consecutive calendar months during the approved medical leave with Company contributions.
If the approved medical leave extends beyond this six (6)-month period due to continuous total disability, medical coverage for the employee continues for up to an additional twenty-four (24) months with Company contributions. (If an employee is not on an approved medical leave and has been totally disabled for six (6) consecutive months, this twenty-four (24)-month provision may apply.) Medical coverage ends earlier if the employee becomes eligible for Medicare or is no longer considered totally disabled. The employee also may continue the life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment, and dental benefits (and medical and dental benefits for eligible dependents) during this time by paying the required rates on or before the 10th day of the month in which they are due. Life insurance waiver of premium may apply if approved by the service representative.
If the total disability continues beyond the thirty (30)-month period, or a covered family member is considered disabled by Social Security during the seventh or eighth month of the absence, the employee may continue medical and dental coverage for himself/herself and eligible dependents for up to five (5) more months by paying one hundred fifty (150%) percent of the cost ofcoverage. The employee may continue life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment coverage for the duration of the approved leave of absence.
B.	Other Approved Leaves of Absence
An employee who is eligible for coverage and begins an approved leave of absence is eligible for the Package the same as an active employee until the last day of the calendar month in which the leave began. (Eligible dependents also are eligible for medical and dental benefits.)
If the approved leave extends beyond this time, the employee's life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment, medical, and dental benefits (and dependent medical and dental benefits) continue for up to three (3) full consecutive calendar months with Company contributions.
If the approved leave extends beyond this time, the employee may continue life insurance coverage for the duration of the approved leave of absence by self-paying the premiums.
C.	Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
If the required coverage for family and medical leaves of absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 is more generous than that already provided in Section 20.A. and Section 20.B., the Company provides any required additional coverage under its group health plans.
D.	Uniformed Services Leave of Absence
If the employee takes a leave of absence for service in the U.S. uniformed services (including the military, National Guard, and the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service), he or she is covered under the Package until the end of the month in which the leave began. If the employee remains on an approved leave of absence, coverage under the Package continues until the end of the third full calendar month of the leave as if the individual were an active employee on an approved non-medical leave of absence.
A-60
If uniformed service extends beyond three (3) months, the employee may continue medical and 1 dental coverage under COBRA.	2
3
If the employee returns to active employment promptly after uniformed service, according to federal 4 law the Package is reinstated on the date the employee returns to the active payroll.	5
6
E.	Changes in Leave Types	7
8
For an employee changing directly from an approved non-medical leave ro an approved medical leave 9 or from an approved medical leave to an approved non-medical leave, the coverage period provided 10 with Company contributions under one type of leave reduces the coverage period provided with 11 Company contributions under the other type of leave.	12
13
F.	Successive Periods of Leaves of Absence	14
15
Two (2) medical leaves of absence separated by fewer than thirty (30) days of continuous work are 16 considered one (1) leave of absence unless the second leave is due to entirely unrelated conditions. 17

Documentation is required to request coverage for a child named in a QMCSO or for a child for whom the retired employee has been given legal custody or guardianship.
A disabled child age 25 or older may continue to be eligible (or enrolled if the employee is a newly eligible employee) if he or she is incapable of self-support due to any mental or physical condition that began before age 25- The child must be unmarried and dependent on the employee for principal support. Coverage may continue under the Retiree Medical Plan for the duration of the incapacity as long as the employee continues to be eligible under the Plan and the child continues to meet these eligibility requirements.
Special applications for coverage are required for disabled dependent children age 25 or older.
A spouse or dependent child no longer is eligible for coverage under the Retiree Medical Plan described in this Attachment after attaining age 65 or becoming eligible for Medicare.
SECTION 3
HOWTO ENROLL
A.	Initial Enrollment
The retired employee and eligible dependents automatically will be enrolled at the time the retired employee becomes eligible, provided the retired employee pays any required contributions. The retired employee and dependents are enrolled in the same plan as immediately before retirement, if applicable.
A retired employee who has been enrolled in a health maintenance organization (HMO) or coordinated care plan may elect to change to the Traditional Medical Plan by calling the Boeing Service Center within thirty-one (31) days of the date the employee retires. The Company will supply enrollment instructions at the time of retirement.
All family members, including the retired employee, must be enrolled in the same medical plan.
B.	Spouse Coverage
Each retired employee with a spouse must provide information regarding coverage available through another employer to determine whether special contributions are required to enroll the spouse. If the retired employee does not authorize a required contribution, the spouse will not be enrolled for medical coverage. The retired employee will not be able to enroll the spouse until the date the spouse loses the option to be covered under the other employer-sponsored medical plan.
The Company will require periodic verification of data.
G Special Enrollment
If a retired employee declined enrollment for himself/herself or dependents in the Retiree Medical Plan because of other employer-sponsored health care coverage (such as through a spouse’s employer), the retired employee may be able to enroll himself/herself and eligible dependents in the Company-sponsored Retiree Medical Plan at a later date as long as enrollment is within sixty (60) days after other coverage ends.
If a retired employee declined enrollment for himself/herself or dependents when First eligible and the retired employees or dependents other health care coverage was through continuation coverage from a previous employer (coverage mandated by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, or COBRA), the retired employee or dependent must exhaust his or her COBRA coverage to be eligible for the special enrollment period.
B-4
If a retired employee’s or dependent’s other health care coverage was not through COBRA, the	1
coverage loss must be due to loss of eligibility for that health care coverage (including from divorce,	2
death, termination of employment, or reduction in hours of employment) or termination of 3 employer contributions toward such coverage.	4
5
If a retired employee is not enrolled in the Company-sponsored Retiree Medical Plan and has a new 6 dependent as a result of an event such as marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, the	7
retired employee may enroll himself or herself, his or her spouse, and any dependent children during	8
the year as long as enrollment is requested within sixty (60) days after the event by contacting the 9 Boeing Service Center.	10
11
If a retired employee is enrolled in the Retiree Medical Plan and has a new dependent as a result of 12 marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, the retired employee may enroll the new	13
dependent during the year as long as enrollment is requested within one hundred twenty (120) days	14
’after the qualified event. See “Change of Dependent Status," Section 3.E., for more information. 15 16
D.	Transfer Between Plans	17
18
Transfer between plans is permitted only during authorized annual enrollment periods or following a 19 change of residence.	20
21
1.	Annual enrollment period.	22
23
The Company establishes an annual enrollment period each year when retired employees may 24 change medical plans.	25
26
2.	Change of residence.	27
28
A retired employee who moves out of an HMO or coordinated care plan service area has sixty 29 (60) days to select a medical plan available in the new location by calling the Boeing Service 30 Center.	31
32
It is the retired employee’s responsibility to notify the Company of the change in residence 33 within the sixty (60)-day period.	34
35
E,	Change of Dependent Status	36
37
A	retired employee will not be able to make dependent enrollment changes until the next annual	38
en	rollment period unless the retired employee experiences one of the qualified changes in status	39
de	scribed in this section. Any change in enrollment must be consistent with the change in status. To	40
be	consistent, the event must cause the retired employee or family member to gain or lose eligibility	41
fo	r the Company-sponsored health care coverage or health care coverage sponsored by a spouse’s or	42
de	pendent child’s employer, and the election change must be on account of and correspond with the	43
ga	in or loss of eligibility. Qualified changes in status include the following:	44
45
1.	The retired employee marries, divorces, or becomes legally separated, or the marriage is annulled. 46 47
2.	The retired employee acquires a new, eligible dependent child, such as by birth, adoption, or 48 placement for adoption.	'	49
50
3.	The retired employees spouse or dependent child dies.	5!
52
4.	The retired employee, spouse, or dependent child starts or stops working.	53
54
5.	The retired employee, spouse, or dependent child has any other change in employment status that	55
affects eligibility for coverage such as changing from full time to part time (or part time to full	56

The retired employee also may change an election to comply with a qualified medical child support order (QMCSO) to provide or cancel coverage for a child resulting from a divorce, annulment, or change in legal custody.
In most situations, the retired employee must request the dependent enrollment change within sixty (60) days after the qualified event. A retired employee can enroll a new dependent within one hundred twenty (120) days following the retired employee’s marriage or a dependent child’s birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. Enrollment may be requested by calling the Boeing Service Center. To request enrollment for a new dependent more than sixty (60) days but within one hundred twenty (120) days after marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, the retired employee must call the Boeing Service Center and speak with a customer service representative. The retired employee must provide the Boeing Service Center with any required supporting documentation within thirty-one (31) days of the date the dependent enrollment change is requested or the coverage change request will be denied.
