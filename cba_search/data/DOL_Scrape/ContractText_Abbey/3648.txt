a.	Each cost center will compile a list of all positions to be eliminated for the following school year. At that time the cost center head will also identify tne least senior employee at that cost center currently working within the job classification in which the position(s) is/are being.eliminated. Pursuant to the procedures outlined in subparagraph (b) below, the cost center head, prior to May 20 of any given school year, will transmit .to the Personnel Office a listing of all positions eliminated, employees surplussed, and vacancies anticipated.
b.	The efnployee(s) to be surplussed at each cost center will.be the least senior at that cost center currently working within the job classification of the position(s) to be eliminated; provided, however, that an employee who has had his/her position eliminated may elect to remain at that cost center should s/he possess more seniority than another employee.at that cost center holding a position for which the employee is qualified in his/her present job classification. In. such a case, the employee possessing the least seniority at that cost center will.be surplussed. An employee whose ■ position, has been eliminated must be given the opportunity to • elect to remain at his/her cost center in another position in his/ her former or a lower job classification for which s/he is qualified, and mustexercise his/her election, prior to surplus lists being transmitted from thecost center to the personnel office (with the appropriate salary adjustment).
c.	Upon receipt of surplus lists from all. cost centers, the Personnel Office will compile.a listing, in seniority order, of all employees who have been surplussed. That listing, as well as a listing of all vacancies county-wide, will be posted for a period of five working days. Employees may update their preference.lists through the conclusion of this five day period.
d.	All employees will be placed into vacant assignments according to seniority, based upon their expressed preferences. The most senior surplussed employee will be considered first and placement will continue on a seniority basis. Each employee must be qualified for the assignment selected. During the.placement process, if remains for which an employee is replace the least senior employee in
south county region (as selected by the employee) in his/her job classification. The employee may elect to switch his/her region selection and pick from vacancies in the other location. This process will continue until there remains no employee on the surplus list who has more seniority than any employee in the district holding a position in that job classification. Those employees who are junior to all others in the district within their job classification will thus be identified. Those junior employees, for whom there are no positions available within their job classification, will be laid off Those laid off employees will have recall rights within the parameters set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.

Directors; of work activities are often faced with the problem of an employee who is developing a poor work habit, such as sloppy housekeeping, inappropriate dress, unsafe procedures, improper use of the telephone, late reports, etc. A poor work habit which develops in one employee may spread to the rest of the work group. Therefore, it must be handled immediately and effectively. A poor work habit should be dealt with as soon as it appears because habits ate much easier to change as they are developing than after they have become established. The effective Head Custodian/Senior Head Custodian notices the work habits of the employees in the work group. When an employee starts to . develop a poor work habit, the Head Custodian/Senior Head.Custodian takes immediate action to change the habit before it becomes a bigger problem.

When an employees performance improves, it is imperative that the Head 3 Custodian acknowledge that improvement in a way that will encourage the 4 employee to maintain-the improvement.

Handling Employee Complaints.........................................  4	hours 21
22
Every employee has a complaint from time to time. Sometimes the Head Cus- 23 todian can take actions which will resolve the complaint; at other times he/she 24 can do little more than listen to the complaint. At all times it is important that 25 the Head Custodian establish a climate which encourages employees to bring 26 their complaints to him/her. Employees will voice their complaints no matter 27 what the work climate. If there is ah open climate, the complaint will be voiced 28 to the Head Custodian. If a relatively closed climate has been established, the 29 complaint will probably be voiced only to other employees.	30

Organization: Each cost center shall determine the organization and structure of its decision making structure. Administrators and classified staff shall agree on (a) cost center improvement-goals and (b) whether to use a hierarchical or shared decision making model. A two-thirds favorable ballot by staff and student leaders shall be used for this purpose.
For those cost centers utilizing Cost Center Based Management/Shared Decision Making, the following procedures will apply:
a. Individual Cost Centers: the shared decision making team should be structured to meet the unique needs of each cost center. Its size should be functional but large enough to represent costcenter's administrators. Its members shall be selected by peers.
The shared decision making team shall make decisions on cost center site policies and procedures through a consensus development approach.
A significant responsibility of the shared decision making team shall be its participation in the cost center’s strategic planning process. In assuming this role, greater flexibility will be provided to the site in its use and management of human and material resources.
Traditional organization:.Cost Centers choosing to utilize a hierarchical model shall continue to employ appointed staff leaders and Working Conditions Committees in their traditional advisory roles.
