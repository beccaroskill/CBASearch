ARTICLE 2
ACADEMIC FREEDOM
2.1	Institutions for higher education exist for the common good in a democratic society. The welfare and strength of the University and of society at large depend on free inquiry and its free expression. Academic freedom is based upon the premise that scholars are entitled to immunity from coercion in matters of thought and expression, and on the belief that the mission of the University can be performed in an atmosphere free from administrative or political constraints on thought and expression. Thus, academic freedom is essential for the maintenance of vital democratic institutions and of an informed and energized citizenry. The University of Cincinnati and the AAUP reaffirm their long tradition of and deep commitment
5
to academic freedom.
2.2	Academic freedom applies to freedom of thought and expression in teaching, research, and extramural activities. Freedom in research is fundamental to the advancement of free inquiry. Academic freedom in its teaching aspect is fundamental for the protection of the rights of the teacher in teaching and of the student to freedom in learning. Academic freedom is also essential to protect the rights of Faculty Members freely to discuss and debate all ideas, however controversial or unpopular, before the broader community. The right of academic freedom shall be the right of every Faculty Member. The University shall continue to be pledged to recognize and protect full freedom of inquiry, teaching, and research in all aspects of University life.
2.3	The University shall also continue to recognize that all Faculty Members are citizens and members of learned professions. When they speak or write as citizens, they shall be free from institutional censorship or discipline. As persons of learning and educational officers, they should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances. Hence they should at all times be accurate, exercise appropriate restraint, and show respect for the opinions of others. Faculty Members shall be free in their public utterances or activities to identify their University affiliation so long as no false impression of University sponsorship or endorsement is created.
ARTICLE 3
ACADEMIC SAFEGUARDS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
3.1	The AAUP and the University recognize the following:
3.1.1	That in the practice of their profession, Faculty Members' principal academic functions are teaching, discovering, creating, and reporting knowledge.
3.1.2	That in the practice of their profession, Librarians select, acquire, and provide access to scholarly information according to the duties and responsibilities contained in their individual job descriptions. As part of their professional responsibilities they may also participate in teaching, discovering, creating, and reporting knowledge.
6
3.1.3	That in order to carry out these functions, special protections are acknowledged to be essential by the parties to this agreement. These protections are known as academic freedom and tenure.
3.2	The general statements which follow take as their source and guide the "1940 Statement on Academic Freedom and Tenure" and the "1987 Statement on Professional Ethics" found in the Policy Documents and Reports of the AAUP (the Redbook).
3.3	The primary justification for academic freedom is service to society's need for independent criticism and advice and a continual flow of new ideas vital in a democracy. The creation of knowledge is inherently threatening to the established order. Academic tenure, therefore, is vital to the nurturance of new ideas and new knowledge. Tenure is the bulwark against the application of economic and political power in limitation of the topics of inquiry and the publication of results.
3.4	Academic tenure, therefore, entails significant responsibilities: to enlarge the common body of knowledge; to raise hard questions; to take unpopular positions; and to accept intellectual risks. The real freedoms associated with inquiry and expression, however, are always bounded by the responsibilities associated with those freedoms.
3.5	Members of the academic community, guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of the advancement of knowledge, recognize the special responsibilities placed on them. Their primary responsibility to their subject is to seek and to state truth as they see it. To this end they devote their energies to developing and improving their scholarly competence. They accept the obligation to exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in using, extending, and transmitting knowledge. They practice intellectual honesty. Although they may follow subsidiary interests, these interests must never seriously hamper or compromise their freedom of inquiry.
3.6	As teachers, Faculty Members and Librarians encourage the free pursuit of learning in their students. They hold before students the best scholarly standards of their discipline. They demonstrate respect for the student as an individual, and adhere to their proper role as intellectual guides and counselors. To that end, their responsibilities as teachers are not confined to formal instructional
7
settings but also include accessibility to and engagement with students outside the classroom. Accessibility of Faculty Members includes posting and keeping of office hours convenient to students and availability by appointment. Faculty and Librarians make every reasonable effort to foster honest academic conduct and to assure that their evaluations of students reflect their true merit. They respect the confidential nature of the relationship between teacher and student. They avoid any exploitation of students for their private advantage and acknowledge significant assistance from them. They protect students' academic freedom.
3.7	As colleagues, members of the academic community have obligations that derive from common membership in the community of scholars. They respect and defend the free inquiry of their associates. In the exchange of criticism and ideas they show due respect for the opinions of others. They acknowledge their academic debts and strive to be objective in their professional judgment of colleagues.
3.8	As principals of an academic community, Faculty Members and Librarians accept that active participation in the governance in their academic units, colleges, and the University cannot always be coterminous with their teaching responsibilities. Active participation in governance and academic planning is expected and necessitates a commitment to joint efforts with colleagues (e.g., Faculty meetings, planning retreats, Faculty workshops, Faculty Senate, AAUP, and University governance activity) that extend throughout the academic year.
3.9	As members of their institution, Faculty Members and Librarians seek above all to be effective teachers and scholars. Although they observe the stated regulations of the institution, provided they do not contravene academic freedom, they maintain their rights to criticize and seek revision. They determine the amount and character of the work they do outside their institution with due regard to their paramount responsibilities to it. When considering the interruption or termination of their service, they recognize the effect of their decision upon the program of the institution and give due notice of their intentions.
3.10	As members of their community, Faculty Members and Librarians have the rights and obligations of all citizens. They measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of their responsibilities to
8
their subjects, to their students, to their profession, and to their institution. When members of the academic community speak or act as private persons, they avoid creating the impression that they speak or act for their university. As citizens engaged in a profession that depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, members of the academic community have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom.
3.11	The responsibilities of members of the academic community encompass many professional functions appropriate to their varied roles. The responsibilities of individual Faculty Members and Librarians will vary depending upon the specific areas of activity in which they are engaged. It is recognized that the protections afforded by academic freedom are not to be taken lightly. Academic freedom protects Faculty Members and Librarians in refusing to accept specific responsibilities they find morally, politically, or intellectually reprehensible; but, this does not imply that the safeguards of academic freedom may be used on unprincipled grounds.
ARTICLE 4 NON-DISCRIMINATION
4.1	The University will not discriminate or tolerate discrimination against any Bargaining Unit member or applicant in matters of wages, hours, terms and other conditions of employment on the basis of sexual orientation or any characteristic prohibited by Federal or Ohio law.
4.2	The University will not tolerate any form of sexual harassment.
4.3	The University and the AAUP will not discriminate against any
Bargaining Unit member for any activities for or against the AAUP or for membership or lack thereof in the AAUP.
4.4	No person shall be employed or promoted to a position within the Bargaining Unit if the result would be that an academic unit head and a member of his or her immediate family (i.e., spouse, child, parent, brother, sister) would be members of the same unit except upon the recommendation of a majority of the members of the unit, subject to the approval of the Provost.
9
ARTICLE 5 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
5.1	Both the University and the AAUP agree to the importance of developing and implementing non-discriminatory and affirmative action employment policies. Faculty Members and Librarians have a shared responsibility and commitment to promote a nondiscriminatory University environment.
5.2	In order to facilitate the creation and implementation of such policies, the Administration shall provide proposed plans or revisions to a committee whose membership shall be named by the Faculty Senate. The Committee shall have the opportunity to make recommendations to the President or the President's representative prior to the University's submission of future affirmative action plans or before the revision of present plans. After submission of its recommendations, if the Committee desires to have a meeting on the matter, the President or the President's representative shall meet with the Committee and respond to the Committee's recommendations if requested to do so by the chairperson of the Committee. Copies of current affirmative action plans and revisions thereof shall be maintained in every college and library office and shall be available there for inspection.
5.3	On or before October 15 of each year of this Agreement, the Affirmative Action Office and/or the appropriate Provost shall distribute to each college dean, library administrator, academic unit head, and to the AAUP copies of the current affirmative action employment policies, procedures, and guidelines. The staff of the Affirmative Action Office and other designated affirmative action coordinators shall be available upon request to assist Faculty Members and Librarians in ensuring compliance with University affirmative action policies and procedures.
5.4	A copy of the annual Affirmative Action Report, submitted to the Department of Labor, shall be sent to the AAUP upon written request to the University Contract Administrator.
10

6.4.3	The Dean or administrator shall notify each person appointed to a qualified title that the appointee does not have the right to be reviewed for tenure, of the terms of the appointment, and of any conditions for reappointment or promotion. This Article does not restrict the right of the Board to grant tenure to any person whose value to the University merits that action.
6.5	Initial Appointment of Library Faculty
6.5.1	Job descriptions for each new position within the library jurisdiction shall be written by the appropriate Library Administrator and sent to the Librarians' RPT Committee. The Committee will review and comment on the job description and recommend the rank or ranks at which the position will be recruited.
6.5.2	The selection and initial appointment of Librarians shall be based on the recommendation of search committees. Such committees shall consist of the following: the immediate supervisor of the position to be filled and two Librarians, whenever possible elected by the Librarians of the appropriate library jurisdiction using procedures developed by the Librarians of the library jurisdiction. Whenever a library jurisdiction has fewer than the requisite number of Librarians to serve on a search committee, unfilled positions on the search committee shall be filled through an election
16
of Librarians in the Bargaining Unit according to procedures developed by Librarians in the Bargaining Unit.
6.5.2.1	In those instances in which the position to be filled reports directly to a Library Administrator, the administrator may designate another person to serve on the search committee in the place of the Library Administrator.
6.5.2.2	When appropriate, up to three (3) individuals in the University community, one or more of whom may be a member of the library support staff, may be appointed by the Library Administrator to serve on the search committee.
6.5.2.3	Search committees shall elect their own chairs.
6.5.3	In those instances in which a search committee and the Library Administrator cannot agree on the appointment recommendations, the matter shall be referred to the search committee either for reconsideration or for a further search and recommendation.
6.5.4	Normally, initial appointments of Librarians are at the Beginning Librarian, Assistant Librarian, or Associate Librarian rank. The rank of initial appointment shall be based upon the established criteria and depend upon the experience and qualifications of the individual and the nature of the position being filled.
6.5.5	Assignment of a Librarian to a rank shall be based upon the tasks, responsibilities, and qualification requirements of the position held, and the experience, professional development, and scholarly and service achievements of the Librarian. The satisfactory performance of job responsibilities shall be the primary requirement for the advancement of Librarians to a higher rank. In addition, Librarians seeking promotion should also demonstrate scholarly and service accomplishments appropriate to the level of advancement.
6.6	Changes in a Librarian's Job Description. When considering changes in a Librarian's job description, the Library Administrator
17
will continue the practice of consulting the incumbent in a position and all other appropriate supervisors. Consultation will address workload and additional compensation where appropriate. Consultation means participation at least 30 days prior to the decision being made.
ARTICLE 7
REAPPOINTMENT, PROMOTION, AND TENURE ("RPT”)
7.1	Shared Responsibility.
7.1.1	Evaluation meetings. Within three months of a new Faculty Member's appointment and annually thereafter, the appropriate academic unit head shall meet with each nontenured Faculty Member to review the Faculty Member's prospective and actual performance, plans for continued professional growth, and RPT criteria and procedures. The academic unit head and the Faculty Member share responsibility for these meetings.
7.1.2	Summary statement. Each meeting shall conclude with joint preparation of a written summary of the discussion. Either party may submit in writing any differing opinions about the content of the summary statement that shall become part of the summary statement. The summary statement shall be part of the personnel file maintained by each academic unit and a copy of the statement shall be given to the Faculty Member.
7.1.3	Delegation. If necessary, the academic unit head, with approval of the Dean, may delegate these duties appropriately; however, final responsibility shall remain with the academic unit head.
7.2	Board Authority
7.2.1	The granting of tenure or promotion to the rank of Professor as set forth in Article 6 shall be determined by the Board upon recommendation of the President after the recommendations set forth in this Agreement have been made. All other promotions, initial appointments and reappointment decisions shall be made by the President after the recommendations set forth in this Agreement have
18
been made. Any person (excluding Instructors, Beginning or Assistant Librarians) promoted to a higher rank shall receive indefinite tenure in the higher rank unless otherwise provided in the terms of the promotion. Reappointment, promotion, or tenure cannot be awarded on the basis of a clerical error.
7.3	Layered Responsibilities for Review
7.3.1	RPT recommendations and the length of each reappointment shall be initiated by the academic unit based upon criteria and procedures developed by the members of the academic unit. These recommendations shall be forwarded by the academic unit head to the College RPT Committee (or equivalent committee or Dean); from the College RPT Committee, or equivalent committee, to the Dean or appropriate administrator; and from the Dean or administrator to the Provost. At each level, the review committee or administrator shall assess the sufficiency of the dossier and the conformity of the review process to established criteria and procedures and may remand the dossier to a previous level of review for appropriate action.
7.3.2	Each academic unit, college, or library jurisdiction shall publish the responsibilities of the academic unit, college, or library jurisdiction and the responsibilities of the candidate for developing dossiers. The academic unit head, Dean, or administrator, as appropriate, shall be responsible for initiating and completing in sufficient time those parts of a candidate's dossier required by the RPT procedures and criteria (e.g., external reviews, administrative summaries of teaching evaluation, etc.) for which the candidate is not responsible to ensure a timely and fair evaluation of the candidate.
7.3.3	The dossier shall include evidence and evaluation of the candidate's qualifications as well as any other information or documentation deemed pertinent. This information and documentation shall be provided to: the academic unit RPT committee; the college RPT committee; or the librarians' RPT committee by the date specified by the appropriate committee.
19
7.3.4	For the Department of Biomedical Engineering, the academic unit shall initiate RPT recommendations. The academic unit head shall forward these recommendations to the combined Ad Hoc Biomedical RPT Committee of the Colleges of Medicine and Engineering that will be comprised of three (3) members of the College of Medicine RPT Committee selected by the Chair of the College of Medicine RPT Committee and three (3) members of the College of Engineering RPT Committee selected by the Chair of the College of Engineering RPT Committee. The combined Committee will make recommendations to the Deans of the Colleges of Medicine and Engineering, who will make recommendations to the Provosts for Health Affairs and for Baccalaureate and Graduate Education. The Deans and the Provosts will rotate responsibilities for RPT on a yearly basis as follows: in even-numbered years, the Dean of the College of Engineering and the Provost for Health Affairs will make all decisions regarding tenure and promotion to the rank of Professor, and the Dean of the College of Medicine and the Provost for Baccalaureate and Graduate Education will make all other RPT decisions as necessary. These roles will be reversed in odd-numbered years.
7.4	Review Process
7.4.1	The candidate has primary responsibility for the development of the dossier submitted for review. Each dossier shall be covered by the approved "File Checklist".
7.4.2	All information received and considered in making recommendations regarding reappointment, promotion, or tenure, at any level becomes part of the candidate's dossier. All material added or attached to a candidate's dossier after it leaves the candidate's hands shall be routinely copied to the candidate at the time said material is added or attached. The candidate may inspect the dossier in accordance with University policies on access to personnel files and must be given the opportunity to review and respond in writing to any material in or added to the file.
7.4.3	If new material bearing on the substance of a prospective decision becomes available during the review process, the
20
candidate, academic unit head, Dean, or appropriate administrator may add such material to the dossier until the appropriate Provost renders his or her recommendation. The candidate shall be provided with a copy of any information or document added to the dossier.
7.4.4	The candidate shall have the opportunity to review and respond in writing to the material within fourteen (14) days following receipt of the copy.
7.4.5	All responses shall become part of the dossier. Any new material and any responses from the candidate shall be provided to all RPT committees and administrators who have participated in the review and made a recommendation.
7.4.6	The recommendation from an academic unit shall be given serious consideration, and no committee or administrator shall make a different recommendation except for substantial reasons stated in writing. When a review committee, Dean, or administrator recommends contrary to the academic unit, the academic unit shall be notified of the reasons for the contrary recommendation within fourteen (14) days.
7.4.7	Copies of any written recommendation made at each step in the review process prior to the Board's consideration shall be transmitted to candidates for reappointment, promotion, or tenure, simultaneously with transmittal of the dossier to the next level of review. Any negative recommendation must be accompanied by a written statement of reasons.
7.4.8	A candidate shall be guaranteed the right to reconsideration at the first level at which a negative recommendation occurs. Within fourteen (14) days after receiving notice of the negative recommendation, the candidate has the right to request reconsideration and may submit supporting substantive or procedural information. The candidate shall be informed of the result of the reconsideration within twenty (20) days following submission of the request. When a candidate exercises this right to reconsideration, the review process shall remain at the level at which
21
reconsideration is being requested. The individual or committee making the first negative recommendation shall make a good faith effort to maintain the recommendation at that level pending the candidate’s right to reconsideration. However, failure to do so shall not be cited as a process violation in any resulting grievance. No further evaluation of or recommendations concerning the candidacy shall be made until the requested reconsideration process has been completed. This restriction shall not prevent administrative action to meet the appropriate notice requirements of Subsection 7.4.10 herein.
7.4.9	Unless the candidate, within fourteen (14) days after receipt of notification of a recommendation regarding reappointment, promotion, or tenure, withdraws from candidacy by written notice to the academic unit head, Dean, or Administrator, the process will continue.

This written notice must be given six (6) months in advance of the earlier deadline date. In the case of Faculty Members in the first year of their initial appointment, this information shall be communicated in writing at the beginning of that appointment.
7.5	Criteria and Procedures for Reappointment, Promotion and Tenure
7.5.1	RPT recommendations shall be based upon criteria related to the responsibilities and functions of the candidate's academic unit or library jurisdiction.
7.5.2	RPT criteria shall be established by each academic unit and library jurisdiction, subject to written approval by the Dean or Library Administrator, and the Provost. (Each academic unit shall review its RPT criteria and procedures at least once every five years. When revisions are made or existing criteria are reaffirmed, as the result of a review, the academic unit's new or reaffirmed RPT criteria and/or procedures shall be subject to the written approval of the Dean or Library Administrator and the Provost. Failure to conduct this periodic review shall not be a grievable matter.)
Academic recommendations at all levels of evaluation shall be based on approved RPT criteria. The recommendations of the Provosts, and the President, and the decisions of the Board, to the extent that they are concerned with academic performance, shall also be based on these criteria. In individual cases, the committees, appropriate administrators, or the Board shall consider the recommendations of the preceding committees or appropriate administrators, but will make an independent determination based on the same criteria.
7.5.3	If a reasonable time has not elapsed since a change in RPT criteria, due consideration shall be given to the former criteria.
26
7.5.4	The academic unit head or Library Administrator will notify all members of the academic unit of the RPT criteria upon appointment or when changes occur.
7.5.5	Academic performance based on RPT criteria shall be the only consideration in RPT cases, except reappointment or tenure may be denied because of program needs or budget restraints.
7.5.6	Budget restraint or program need in an academic unit may, of necessity, have an adverse impact on an individual Faculty Member; however, the determination of a budget restraint or program need shall be independent of the academic review of the Faculty Member for reappointment or tenure.
7.5.7	If a Provost determines that a budget restraint or program need exists for an academic unit or college, the Provost shall notify the academic unit, the Dean, and the AAUP. The Dean and academic unit head shall then work with the Provost to ascertain if the budget restraint or program need can be resolved without adverse impact on an individual Faculty Member. The academic unit as a whole, at least thirty (30) days after it has been provided documentation of the budget restraint or program need and of the total resources available to the unit, shall be consulted and its suggestions for resolution given full consideration, including any alternatives that would not adversely affect any Faculty Member.
7.5.8	If the budget restraint or program need can only be resolved by adversely affecting a Faculty Member, the Faculty Member so affected shall be notified, no later than fifteen (15) months prior to the effective date of the nonreappointment. The notice shall state explicitly that the reasons for non-reappointment are based on program need or budget restraint.
7.5.9	To continue the progress achieved, the University's affirmative action policies shall be considered in making a decision concerning non-reappointment or denial of tenure for reasons of program need or budget restraint.
27
7.5.10	When a Faculty Member is denied reappointment for reasons of budget restraint or program need, that position may not be filled on a full-time basis for two (2) years, unless it is first offered to the individual denied reappointment. However, the position may be filled on a part-time basis without regard to the two-year limit (1) if the position is first offered to the individual denied reappointment, and (2) if the part-time position accounts for no more than 50% of the full-time course load of the Faculty Member denied reappointment. The Faculty Member denied reappointment shall be given thirty (30) days to accept the full-time or part-time position. If accepted, prior service credit shall be allowed toward any applicable probationary period.
7.6	Rules of Committee Procedure
7.6.1	All RPT committees shall be standing committees.
7.6.2	Only full-time University Faculty Members, or those granted full-Faculty status by the academic unit, shall serve on the RPT committees.
7.6.3	The quorum necessary for voting shall be two-thirds of the members of a RPT committee. Each member of a RPT committee shall have one vote.

Deans, associate deans, assistant deans, assistants to the dean, and academic unit heads may not serve on the Committee. The chairperson shall be selected by the Committee from its members. If an academic unit has fewer than four full-time tenured Faculty Members, it must select by democratic means additional Committee members from full-time Faculty of the college, or from related disciplines in other colleges of the University. If the committee membership has been supplemented, the chairperson must be a member of the academic
28
unit. Except for these requirements, the Faculty of the academic unit shall decide by democratic means the Committee's structure, size, and method of selection.
7.6.4.2	Committee Responsibilities. The Committee shall forward to the College RPT Committee or to the Dean, through the academic unit head, the candidate's file and the academic unit's recommendation regarding reappointment, promotion, or tenure.
7.6.4.3	Academic Unit Head Responsibilities. The academic unit head shall submit an independent recommendation to the College RPT Committee or to the Dean.
7.6.5	College RPT Committee
7.6.5.1	Composition. The College RPT Committee shall be composed of full-time Faculty of the college, with no more than two (2) from any single academic unit. Deans, associate deans, assistant deans, assistants to the dean, and academic unit heads may not serve on the Committee. Except for these restrictions, colleges shall democratically determine the structure, size, and method of selection of the Committee.
7.6.5.2	In colleges without academic units, the RPT Committee shall be composed of the Faculty of the college, with the exception of the Dean, associate deans, assistant deans, and assistants to the dean. The Committee shall select a chairperson from its members. Except for these requirements, the Committee shall democratically determine its structure, size, and method of selection.
7.6.5.3	College Committee Responsibilities. The Committee shall review and consider academic unit and academic unit head recommendations for reappointment, promotion, and tenure. The Committee shall forward its recommendation and
29
the candidate's file to the Dean.

7.6.6	Librarians' Reappointment, Promotion, and Tenure Committee
7.6.6.1	Composition. The Library Faculty shall have a RPT Committee composed of full-time Library Faculty in the Bargaining Unit from at least two (2) library jurisdictions. Except for these restrictions, the Library Faculty shall determine by democratic means the structure, size, and method of selection of the Committee.
7.6.6.2	Committee Responsibilities. The Committee shall make a recommendation about reappointment, promotion, or tenure based upon consideration of the candidate's dossier, the supervisor's recommendation, and other relevant documentation. It shall forward to the Library Administrator the candidate's file and the Committee's recommendation. When the Library Administrator is also the candidate's immediate supervisor, the candidate's file shall not contain a recommendation by the immediate supervisor as to reappointment, promotion, or tenure. The candidate's file shall contain the written evaluation prepared by the supervisor along with the summary of the evaluation conference signed by both the candidate and the supervisor. The candidate may include a written statement in the file about the evaluation and the summary.
7.6.6.3	Appropriate Library Administrator's Responsibilities. The Library Administrator shall submit an independent recommendation to the Provost.
7.7	Except as provided in Section 11.12, these procedures apply to all
30
academic units and colleges.
7.8	This Article shall not prevent the more rapid advancement of persons of exceptional ability whose accomplishments and value justify earlier promotion or grant of tenure.
ARTICLE 8

8.1	Grievances. Whenever possible, disputes should be resolved informally at the lowest level. All Faculty Members and administrators are encouraged to engage in free and open communication to resolve differences.
8.1.1	Definition.

Faculty Members shall be notified of the list of nominees prior to the May meeting of the University Faculty. Additional nominations may be made from the floor at the meeting.
8.2.2	Members of the UFGC shall be selected by secret ballot of the Faculty Members by an election held at a single polling place in each college or library jurisdiction on a day designated by the Faculty Senate Chairperson as soon as practicable after the May meeting.
8.2.3	The term of office of UFGC members shall be two (2) years, commencing July 1. Any interim vacancies shall be filled by appointment by the Faculty Senate Chairperson until the next May University Faculty meeting. After two (2) consecutive terms on the UFGC, a member may not serve another term until after an interval of two (2) years.
8.2.4	The UFGC shall elect its own Chair and Vice-Chair who shall serve for terms of one (1) year. UFGC officers may succeed themselves.
8.2.5	The UFGC Chair shall be allowed release time pursuant to Article 23. The Chair may, alternatively, request funds equivalent to this release time to use for staff support to the Committee.
8.3	Type A Grievances: Reappointment, Promotion, and Tenure Grievances
32
8.3.1	Definition. A Type A grievance involves complaints regarding RPT processes of the University including a decision not to reappoint, promote, or grant tenure to a Faculty Member who alleges that:
8.3.1.1	Academic freedom violations are significantly connected with the decision; or
8.3.1.2	Procedures used in reaching the decision leading to the grievance were applied in an improper or discriminatory manner (the term “procedures” as used in this Section includes the requirements of Sections 6.2 and 6.5 and Article 7, as they apply to the candidate, excluding the merit or lack of merit, or the weight or substantiality of the reasons, judgments, or substantive determinations by administrators or committee involved with RPT recommendations); or
8.3.1.3	A negative recommendation by a Provost has followed positive recommendations by (1) the academic unit, (2) the college or library jurisdiction, and (3) the Dean or administrator, and is arbitrary and capricious.
8.3.2	Filing Type A
8.3.2.1	Type A grievances can be filed only within twenty-one (21) days after the receipt of the Provost’s negative recommendation.
8.3.2.2	The grievant shall present the University Faculty Grievance Committee (“UFGC”) Grievance form to the AAUP office with copies to the respondent(s), the UFGC Chair, the Provost, and the Dean or administrator.
8.4	Type B Grievances
8.4.1	Definition. A Type B grievance is any alleged violation of this Agreement, except those involving reappointment, promotion, or tenure. This includes:
33
(1)	Claims of discrimination or harassment prohibited by Article 4.
(2)	Grievances about proposed disciplinary action (including dismissal) against a Faculty Member, including allegations of substantive or procedural violations of Article 9.
(3)	Grievances brought by the AAUP on behalf of a class of Faculty Members.
(4)	All other grievances between a Faculty Member and the Administration covered by this Article and not restricted by this Agreement, including the claim by a part-time Faculty employee of erroneous exclusion from the bargaining unit.
8.4.2	Filing Type B
8.4.2.1	Prior to requesting mediation for a Type B grievance other than discipline or dismissal the Faculty Member must attempt to resolve the complaint with the appropriate University Contract Administrator within thirty (30) days of knowledge of the incident causing the complaint. The names and phone numbers of the University Contract Administrators for the East and West campuses are available from the Provosts’ offices and from the AAUP office. If this attempt at resolution fails, the University Contract Administrator will notify the Faculty Member in writing that s/he must file a “Request for Mediation” if s/he wishes to proceed with a grievance. A Type B grievance other than discipline or dismissal can be filed only after mediation has failed to resolve the complaint. A complaint involving discipline or dismissal will be submitted to mediation unless both Parties mutually agree to waive the mediation process.
8.4.2.2	The complainant has ten (10) days from the waiving or closing of mediation to file a grievance with the UFGC. The grievant shall present the University Faculty Grievance Committee (“UFGC”) Grievance form to the AAUP office with copies to the respondent(s), the UFGC Chair, the Provost, and
34
the Dean or administrator.
8.4.3	Filing for Mediation
8.4.3.1	Filing Deadlines. The Faculty Member (complainant) must file for mediation with the appropriate AAUP representative or the appropriate college or provostal representative within ten (10) days of a notice of proposed discipline or within twenty-one (21) days after receiving notification from the University Contract Administrator that the informal attempt at resolution was unsuccessful.
8.4.3.2	Filing Procedure. To file for mediation, the Faculty Member must contact the office of the AAUP, Dean, or Provost, as appropriate, to obtain and to file a Request for Mediation form. The mediation begins when the Faculty Member timely signs and files the Request for Mediation form.
8.4.3.3	Mediation Team Composition. Each team shall consist of one person appointed by the AAUP and one person appointed by the University Contract Administrator.
8.4.3.4	Training and Service. All persons assigned mediation duties should receive formal training in mediation processes. Any person serving on a mediation team may serve on more than one mediation team.
8.4.3.5	Conduct of Mediation. The mediators shall have thirty (30) days after their appointment to resolve the complaint. During that period, the mediators shall have access to persons and information appropriate to speedy resolution. The mediators may meet with the complainant and respondent separately or in a group and if resolution occurs, they shall sign an agreement identifying the remedy. The mediators shall establish a process for mediation. Other than the Request for Mediation form, this signed agreement shall be the only written record of the mediation process. Any personal notations or other
35
records of the mediation teams shall be destroyed.
8.4.3.6	Mediation Responsibility. The complainant and the Respondent shall be available to meet at the mediators’ request during the thirty day mediation period. A complainant who is not available to meet during the thirty day period, for the time deemed necessary by the mediation team to reach resolution, forfeits the right to mediation. If mediation cannot be completed within thirty (30) days, extensions may be granted by the Parties.
8.4.3.7	Implementation of Resolution. The mediators shall notify the Parties whether the complaint has been resolved. If the resolution requires some action by the Dean or Provost, they will have fifteen (15) days to begin implementation. If implementation does not begin within that period, or in the time period stated in the mediation resolution, the complainant shall have ten (10) days following that period to file a grievance with the UFGC.
8.5	Grievance Hearing Statements. The UFGC discourages proliferation of grievance claims and rebuttals that are not supported by facts. The UFGC also discourages excessive documentation. Hearing statements should generally be no more than ten (10) pages in length and should have no more than thirty (30) documents attached.
8.5.1	Grievant’s Hearing Statement. Within thirty (30) days after filing the UFGC Grievance form, the grievant must submit to the respondent, the UFGC, and other parties listed on the UFGC Grievance form, a hearing statement or brief. This statement should: incorporate the information contained on the UFGC Grievance form; outline the precise grounds for the grievance; summarize the issues; the supporting facts, and the relief requested; and include copies of relevant documents or other supporting materials.
8.5.2	Respondent’s Hearing Statement. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the grievant’s statement, the respondent(s) must submit a hearing statement or brief, responding to each issue addressed in the grievant’s hearing statement
36
and providing relevant documents and other supporting materials to the grievant, the UFGC, and other parties listed on the Grievance form.
8.5.3	At least one week before the hearing the grievant may submit additional materials and documentation responding to specific issues in the respondent’s hearing statement. The respondent(s) may submit rebuttal materials within four (4) days thereafter.
8.6	UFGC Committee Procedure
8.6.1	The Chair or the Vice-Chair of the UFGC may chair a grievance hearing. Hearings may proceed as long as a quorum is present.
8.6.2	Five (5) Members of the UFGC shall constitute a quorum. In Type A grievances at least one Member shall be nontenured or have been non-tenured when elected to the UFGC. When considering grievances at least two (2) Members shall be from the campus (East or West) where the grievance originated.
8.6.3	The UFGC shall hold a full evidentiary hearing on each grievance properly filed (including the hearing statement) and accepted.
8.6.4	The UFGC may appoint a fact-finding panel to gather information in preparation for a hearing.

8.6.7	The Grievant and any Respondent who is not an administrator should be present at the hearing. In the event that a Grievant names as a Respondent one or more administrators, including Department Chairs, the University Contract Administrator will make such persons available at the hearing on reasonable notice to respond to questions
37
posed by the Grievant or the UFGC.
8.6.8	Grievants and respondents are entitled to representation and are entitled to present and cross-examine witnesses.
8.6.9	Each UFGC case file shall include copies of all correspondence, the tape and/or transcript of the hearing, the UFGC recommendation, the findings of any ad hoc committee, and the President’s disposition. The UFGC file shall be kept in the Faculty Senate office.
8.6.10	The Committee shall notify all parties listed on the Grievance form of its findings and recommendations which shall be kept in the Committee’s file.
8.6.11	The UFGC may, by a vote of one more than a majority of its members, reject any grievance except a dismissal for cause. The UFGC shall provide the grievant a written statement explaining its refusal to accept the grievance. The grievant may seek reconsideration of such decision by presenting new evidence to the UFGC within thirty (30) days from receipt of the decision.
8.6.12	In all grievances (other than discipline and dismissals), the burden of proof rests with the grievant. In all cases, the party bearing the burden of proof shall proceed first with its presentation. The parties shall confine their presentations to facts relevant to the charges.
8.6.13	Within six (6) months from the effective date of this Agreement, the AAUP/UC Joint Committee shall consider alternatives to the UFGC procedures outlined in Articles 8.5.1 - 8.5.3, 8.6 and 9.2 with the intent of developing new procedures that enhance the effectiveness of the process. If adopted by the AAUP and the University, the new procedures shall replace the provisions contained in Articles 8.5.1 - 8.5.3, 8.6 and 9.2 and shall be incorporated into this Agreement by a Memorandum of Understanding.
8.7	Deciding Grievances
8.7.1	Timeline. Except for grievances filed between May 15 and September 1, the UFGC shall conduct a hearing and
38
transmit its written findings and recommendation to the President within seventy-five (75) days of receipt of the grievance. (If the Grievance form is filed between May 15 and July 1, the UFGC shall make its recommendation by September 30; if filed in July and August, the UFGC recommendation shall be due by October 31.)
8.7.2	The President shall respond in writing to the Committee’s recommendation within thirty (30) days of its receipt, except if the recommendation is received between June 1 and September 1, the President shall respond within forty-five (45) days.
8.7.3	Presidential Action
8.7.3.1	If the President accepts the recommendation, the case will be resolved on that basis. If the President rejects or modifies the recommendation in any way, the President shall return it to the Committee with objections specified in writing. The Committee shall have ten (10) days to consider the President’s rejection or modification of its decision and forward its written reply to the President. The President shall have ten (10) days to make a final decision and to notify the UFGC.
8.7.3.2	The President may seek advice or counsel. It is improper, however, for anyone to initiate an approach to the President on matters under consideration in the grievance process.
8.7.4	Ad Hoc Review Committee
8.7.4.1	In tenure cases, after a full evidentiary hearing, the UFGC may appoint an Ad Hoc Review Committee to conduct a substantive review. The UFGC, after its review, shall notify the President of its findings and decision to create an Ad Hoc Review Committee. Thereafter, the UFGC Chair shall have thirty (30) days to appoint this Committee, with the concurrence of the Dean or administrator. If the UFGC Chair and the Dean or
39
administrator fail to concur, either party may request the assistance of the Provost in securing an acceptable committee.
8.7.4.2	The UFGC Chair shall appoint to the Ad Hoc Review Committee Faculty (within or outside the University) in the grievant’s discipline. The Ad Hoc Review Committee shall consist of five (5) to seven (7) members, acting by majority vote. The Ad Hoc Review Committee shall consider the grievant’s dossier as presented to the Provost, and may seek further evaluation of the candidate. The Ad Hoc Review Committee shall follow all relevant and appropriate criteria, procedures, and guidelines of the grievant’s academic unit.
8.7.4.3	The Ad Hoc Review Committee, within sixty (60) days of its formal appointment, shall recommend to the President whether the grievant should be awarded tenure. The President, in considering this recommendation, shall follow the guidelines and time limits in 8.7.2.
8.8	Rights of the AAUP and Administration. The AAUP and Administration shall be notified in advance of each grievance procedure and shall promptly receive copies of all correspondence and decisions regarding the grievance. Decisions shall contain a statement of all issues and their disposition. The AAUP, Provost, or their designated representatives, have the right to attend all hearings or meetings between the grievant and respondent, unless the grievant objects. The AAUP may represent a consenting grievant before the UFGC. No grievance settlement may violate any provision of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 9
DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES
9.1	Discipline Standards and Procedures
The University shall not impose discipline except for adequate cause. The University subscribes to the principles of progressive discipline except when summary action is necessary and
40
appropriate. Any disciplinary action shall be predicated upon a violation of this Agreement or of the University's rules or standards of professional conduct including consistent failure to fulfill responsibilities in the academic unit. Only Administration officials can initiate Article 9 disciplinary proceedings, but anyone, including the academic unit head, may provide the official with information relevant to deciding whether to implement Article 9 proceedings. In the event that a student has a complaint against a Faculty Member, the student should be encouraged to meet with the Faculty Member, with the Ombudsperson or with the academic unit head in order to resolve the complaint. It is preferable, but not required, that the meeting be with the Faculty Member. If the student's complaint remains unresolved, the student may proceed under the Student Grievance Procedures, as established by the Board from time to time. However, nothing shall prevent an appropriate University official from commencing a proceeding under this Article 9 for any violation of this contract.
9.1.1	Rights of the AAUP and Administration. The AAUP and the Administration each have the right to have a representative present at all Article 9 proceedings.
9.1.2	Suspension Pending Investigation. When, in the judgment of the President, the presence of a Faculty Member on University property presents a threat to the health or safety of the Faculty Member or anyone in the University community or represents a threat of substantial disruption or substantial interference with the normal and lawful activities of the University community, the President may suspend with pay the Faculty Member pending the disposition of the disciplinary process provided in this Agreement. The President may also direct that the Faculty Member be removed and barred from University property.
9.1.2.1	In the event the President is absent from the University, a Provost may exercise the above authority to suspend the Faculty Member with pay and direct that the Faculty Member be removed and barred from University property.
9.1.3	Investigation. When the University has reason to believe an incident(s) has occurred that might constitute grounds for discipline, an appropriate University official shall notify
41
the Faculty Member involved, by letter, that a formal investigation will take place, unless to do so would compromise the investigation.
9.1.4	Notice. Prior to proposing any disciplinary action, an appropriate University official will meet with the Faculty Member to discuss the charges against the Faculty Member and provide the Faculty Member with an opportunity to present the Faculty Member's case. Before any interview, the Faculty Member shall be advised of the right to be represented and accompanied by an AAUP representative. The appropriate University official shall notify the Faculty Member and the AAUP, prior to the meeting, of the charges and who brought them. The purpose of the meeting is to try to resolve the charges by mutual agreement. The Faculty Member may, in writing, request that the AAUP waive its right to be present at the informal resolution meeting.
9.1.4.1	If the matter is not resolved by mutual agreement at the meeting and the appropriate University official decides to propose discipline, the Faculty Member shall be sent a written statement of the charges and the discipline proposed. The AAUP shall be sent a concurrent copy of that letter.

The Bargaining Unit member may elect to use any accrued vacation prior to going on medical leave without pay.
17.10.2	One-year medical leaves without pay are renewable twice. During the renewals, a Bargaining Unit member may participate in the same fringe benefits as in the first year of medical leave without pay by payment of the full costs thereof.

17.10.6	Following the completion of the final year of medical leave without pay, the University may, at its discretion, choose to release a Bargaining Unit member.
17.11	Continuation of Extended Sick Leave/Medical Leave. Normally, the decision about whether a Bargaining Unit member should take or continue on sick leave or medical leave without pay or return to active faculty status will be made by the Bargaining Unit member following consultation with his or her attending physician. If, however, there is a disagreement between the University and a Bargaining Unit member in such matters, the following procedure shall apply:
17.11.1	The Bargaining Unit member and the University shall each designate a medical doctor specializing in treatment of the Bargaining Unit member's alleged illness or disability.
17.11.2	The two medical doctors shall confer and choose by agreement a third medical doctor. These three doctors shall be given the right to examine the Bargaining Unit member and review his or her medical records.
17.11.3	After such examination, the three medical doctors shall confer and decide by majority vote among them whether the Bargaining Unit member is so disabled as to be unable to adequately perform under the terms of his or her contract with the University. The decision of the doctors shall be binding upon the University and the Bargaining Unit member.
17.11.4	The University shall bear all costs associated with examinations and opinions rendered under this procedure.
17.12	Continuation of Benefits. A Bargaining Unit member who is approved for long-term disability benefits, may continue to

17.13	Payment for Accrued Sick Leave at Retirement
17.13.1	At the time of retirement from active service, Bargaining Unit members who are members of a retirement system and who meet the age and service or disability requirements to be eligible for retirement under the applicable system, and have applied for and will begin drawing a pension benefit from the applicable retirement plan, and with ten or more years service with the University, the State, or any of its political subdivisions, may elect to be paid in cash for one-fourth of the value of unused, accrued sick leave credit, up to a maximum of thirty (30) days.
17.13.2	Those Bargaining Unit members employed prior to July 1, 1977, meeting the age and service or disability requirements specified above, with twenty-five or more continuous years of full-time service with the University immediately preceding retirement, at the time of retirement from active service, may elect to be paid in cash for one-half of the value of unused accrued sick leave credit up to a maximum of sixty days. Any Bargaining Unit member who meets the age and service requirements above, with three hundred (300) or more days accrued as of December 31, 1989, shall automatically access this benefit upon retirement.
17.13.3	Payment will be based upon the individual's rate of pay at the time of retirement. The payment for sick leave under the policy outlined in Subsection 17.13 eliminates all sick leave credit accrued by a Bargaining Unit member at the time of retirement. In the case of a person who is reemployed after retirement, any accumulated sick leave from previous employment would be eliminated by the operation of Subsection 17.13.

Such benefits shall be provided upon payment by the individual of the full costs thereof. If a person on Child-Rearing Leave is fulfilling partial responsibilities, benefits shall be provided as if the person were not on leave. The continuation of salary-based benefits is upon payment by the individual of his or her portion of the costs. Payment arrangements must be made with the Benefits Division. However, retirement contributions will be based on the actual salary paid to the Bargaining Unit member.

70
Quarter in the penultimate year of service toward the tenure clock limit, will not be granted an extension of the probationary period.
Time off the clock granted under the provision of childcare responsibilities in combination with any other approved time off the clock, cannot exceed two years.

ARTICLE 24
FACULTY DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES
24.1	The University and the AAUP recognize that Faculty development is a shared responsibility of Bargaining Unit members and academic administrators. To that end, the University and AAUP pledge to work together to create and support a range of professional development opportunities appropriate to the various colleges, libraries, populations, and academic missions of this institution. The purpose of a development program is to improve
75
the quality of the teaching, research, and service in individual units and in the University as a whole, by assisting Bargaining Unit members in reaching their full potential as researchers, teachers, and/or as librarians.
24.1.1	A Faculty development program must address needs of Bargaining Unit members at varied stages of their careers. For example, the following purposes may be identified with three distinct needs:
24.1.1.1	relief strategies to facilitate the work of active researchers and engaged, effective teachers and librarians;
24.1.1.2	recharging strategies designed for the researcher/scholar, teacher or librarian in need of stimulation; and
24.1.1.3	redirecting strategies to offer individuals a new start.
24.1.2	Included among development opportunities should be programs on curricular and technological innovation, the RPT processes, leave and grant applications, administrative issues for academic unit heads, and retirement planning.
24.2	Annotated Publication of Faculty Development Resources. To insure that the Faculty of the University may avail themselves of professional development resources, it will be the obligation of the University Faculty Senate, working through its college and library senators and with the academic Vice Presidents and Deans to disseminate an inclusive list of development opportunities available. This will include the types of programs planned, those who may participate, special funding, special focus of awards which are available, etc.
24.3	Faculty Development Programming. Each college and library system will develop a process for planning and implementing annual Faculty development programs. The process will include joint Faculty and administrator involvement. Plans may include workshops, conferences, seminars, or individual counseling to assist Faculty in meeting their professional development goals. Each college and library system will provide information for the resource list compiled by the Faculty Senate.
76
24.4	Cross-College Opportunities. Among the options that should be available for Faculty development, the AAUP and the University endorse the concept of cross-college opportunities and exchanges, involving this University and others. This sharing of academic resources affords new professional experience to individuals and brings new energy and insight into the academic units involved.
24.5	Special Duty Assignment. When it is mutually advantageous to an individual and an academic unit, college, or library system, a Bargaining Unit member may be released from regular duties and assigned special duties in connection with specific research, scholarly, or unit/college/library projects. Bargaining Unit members, academic unit heads, or Deans may initiate a request for Special Duty Assignment; however, in any case, all parties must agree that the proposed Assignment is mutually advantageous.
24.6	Professional Travel. The AAUP and the University encourage Faculty participation in activities sponsored by professional organizations. This includes presenting papers at meetings, serving as officers, and attending and participating in general meetings, seminars, and workshops. Bargaining Unit members receive reimbursement for travel expenses in accordance with procedures and criteria established by the governance structure of the appropriate academic unit or library system. Each academic unit or library system will establish in a democratic manner, the criteria and procedures for the allocation of travel funds. These criteria and procedures will be submitted to the Dean or appropriate Library Administrator for approval and subsequently published and distributed to each member of the academic unit or library system. These approved procedures may include a committee elected from the unit to make recommendations to the unit head. Bargaining Unit members are also encouraged to apply for assistance from other sources beyond the unit's travel budget. They should consult the annotated Faculty development resource list published by the University Faculty Senate. University Rules for Reimbursement of Travel Expenses will apply in all cases.
24.7	Professional Development Funds. The University shall provide $500,000 for each of the three years of this contract to fund professional development. Application guidelines and the disbursement of these funds shall be determined democratically by a Professional Development Committee consisting of three (3)
77
individuals appointed by the Administration, three (3) individuals elected by the Faculty Senate, and the Vice Provost for Faculty Development as ex officio chair. The Committee may also seek advice from others with particular knowledge or expertise, or it may consult with groups such as the University Research Council for advice about decisions.
ARTICLE 25 ACADEMIC LEAVE
25.1	Academic Leave. The following provisions shall govern academic leave for Faculty Members except sections 25.1.3.3 through and 25.1.3.5, which apply exclusively to Librarians.
25.1.1	Academic leave is one of the primary means through which professional development can be encouraged and cultivated for Faculty Members. Academic leave may be granted by the Board on recommendation of the President, for purposes of promoting individual Faculty development that promises to serve the academic interests of the University. Academic interests here mean promotion of excellence in the production and/or dissemination of knowledge. The granting of academic leaves shall not be determined solely by financial considerations.
25.1.2	Filing of Leave Request. Except in emergency or unusual cases, Faculty Members applying for academic leave shall file requests at the academic unit level, or with the Library Administrator, by October 31 of the year preceding the academic year in which the proposed leave will occur.

25.2 Guidelines for Academic Leaves
25.2.1	Upon completion of the academic leave, the Faculty

81
ARTICLE 26 PROFESSIONAL LEAVE
26.1	Professional Leave. Professional Leave without pay may at times be beneficial to both the individual and the University.
26.2	Guidelines for Professional Leave
26.2.1	Filing of Leave Request. Faculty Members may at any time request a Professional Leave of absence without pay from one quarter to one full academic year to participate in work in the field of education, research, or other professional activities related to University responsibilities. Under appropriate circumstances leaves or extensions thereof may continue through a second year. Leave requests shall be submitted in writing to the academic unit head at least ninety (90) days in advance of the date the proposed leave shall begin. The request shall state the reasons for the leave, the period of absence, and the date of return. Upon recommendation of the academic unit head and subject to the concurrence of the Dean or administrator, a leave of absence without pay may be granted by the Provost. The Dean or administrator shall notify the Faculty Member of the Provost's decision within fourteen (14) days after the Provost's receipt of the request. Extensions of Professional Leave shall be handled in a similar manner.
26.2.2	The request for Professional Leave submitted to the academic unit head shall indicate the reasons, if any, why the quarters of Professional Leave should be counted toward those quarters needed to qualify for Academic Leave. Notification from the Dean or administrator that the leave has been granted shall also advise whether the quarters of professional leave may be counted toward qualifying for Academic Leave.
26.2.3	A person on Professional Leave shall receive any salary increase which he or she would have received had he or she not been on leave. A person on Professional Leave shall be eligible to receive any promotion or award of indefinite tenure for which he or she would have been
82
	eligible had he or she not been on leave. However, the individual who receives such leave shall have the option of signing a waiver which would provide that the period of leave would not be considered in counting the years toward tenure. Such waiver by the individual will act automatically to extend the term of the current appointment for a period of time equal to the period of leave, provided that to effect this optional waiver such leave shall not be for a period of less than one year. A person on Professional Leave shall have the right to use University facilities and to apply for academic unit funds or funds from other University sources under the same conditions as if the person were not on leave. 26.2.4 A Faculty Member on Professional Leave shall receive all benefits, except retirement, to which he or she would have been entitled as if the person were not on Professional Leave, unless these are provided through the circumstances of the leave. All benefits which are based on salary, except retirement, shall be calculated on the academic base salary which the person would receive if he or she were not on Professional Leave. The continuation of salary-based benefits is upon payment by the individual of their portion of the costs. Payment arrangements must be made with the Benefits Division. ARTICLE 27 GOVERNANCE OF THE UNIVERSITY
27.1	The variety and complexity of tasks performed by institutions of higher education produce an interdependence among constituent elements of the University. Adequate communication is therefore essential, and there must be full opportunity for appropriate joint planning and effort. Joint effort and shared responsibility for governance will take a variety of forms, as situations require. Initiative may emerge at one time or another from all institutional components, and differences in the weight of each voice will vary according to the matter at hand and the defined responsibilities of each constituent element. Shared responsibility for governance is based upon mutual trust and respect for diverse interests and perspectives and is an iterative and consultative process. To be effective, shared governance clearly defines roles, scope of authority, and responsibility for decision-making among faculty
83
governance bodies and university administrators. Effective shared governance also requires joint responsibility for timely implementation.
27.	2 The Rules of the Board recognize the Faculties of the colleges and other units, vesting in them, subject to the approval of the Board, the power to make their own regulations governing the admission and exclusion of students (including, but not limited to, articulation and scholarship agreements with other institutions), the courses of instruction to be offered, grading policy, recommendations for degrees, honors and prizes, other fundamental areas of curriculum, and such other matters as may be within their jurisdiction. They shall also be entitled to share significantly in the responsibilities for program development, program review, department review, and department and college reorganization. The principles of joint effort and shared responsibility are illustrated, but not limited by, the provisions below:
27.2.	1 The University Faculty shall have the right to consider matters affecting the University and shall be given sufficient time to make available to the Administration, to the Board, and the AAUP, its aid, advice, and counsel in such matters.
27.2.	2 Each college Faculty shall have the right to advise, aid, and counsel the Dean of the college on matters affecting the college and the University, and shall be given sufficient time to do so. Each college Faculty may elect a Faculty committee to exercise the powers of the college Faculty in the interim between its meetings.
27.2.	3 Each unit shall have the right to advise, aid, and counsel the unit head on matters affecting the unit, college, and University and shall be given sufficient time, in such matters, to do so. The unit may, at its option, have an elected committee to exercise the powers of the unit in the interim between its meetings.
27.2.	4 If a question arises as to whether a matter is a unit, college, or University concern, the question shall be resolved by the President after seeking the advice of the Faculty Senate.
84
27.2.	5 The Faculty shall have a voice through Faculty representatives elected for that purpose at the unit, college, and University level in the formulation of long-range plans and in decisions relating to their implementation. Similarly, Faculty representatives elected for that purpose shall have a voice at the unit, college, and University level where decisions relating to the use and creation of existing or prospective physical resources are being made.
27.2.	6 The parties to this Agreement recognize the Faculty Senate and Student Senate, and the by-laws which govern their relationship with the University.
27.2.	7 With respect to Faculty priorities in those areas not specifically dealt with through the collective bargaining process, both parties to this Agreement recognize the Faculty Senate as the primary governance body representing the Faculty which shall have the right to advise the President and the Vice Presidents. Appropriate released time will be arranged for the chair of the Faculty Senate.
27.2.	8 Well in advance, but at least ninety (90) days before the final budget recommendation of the President to the Board, procedures shall be established by the Administration in consultation with the Faculty Senate, for reviewing the existing budget and for reviewing requests of the individual Vice Presidents for changes in their budgets. Upon written request the Faculty Senate shall have access to financial information which is relevant and necessary and can reasonably be made available, including monthly budget summaries.
27.2.	9 Librarians shall have the right to advise, aid, and counsel the appropriate library administrator, supervisor, or head on matters affecting the unit, department, library and library systems, and University and shall be given sufficient time, in such matters, to do so. This right shall include a voice through elected representatives in the formulation of long-range plans and in decisions relating to the use and creation of existing or prospective physical resources. The Librarians in each library system may, at
85
their option, have an elected committee to exercise the powers of the Librarians in the interim between their meetings.
27.2.1	0 It is the intention of both parties to support the role of existing governance bodies in the affairs of the University.
27.	3 Shared governance mechanisms at the college, library system, and university levels will be established, reflecting the principles outlined in 27.1 and 27.2.
ARTICLE 28
RETRENCHMENT UNDER CONDITIONS OF FINANCIAL EXIGENCY
28.1	Should the Administration anticipate a financial exigency (an imminent financial crisis which threatens the institution as a whole) which may result in retrenchment of Faculty (which, as used in this Article, is defined as termination of tenured Faculty or termination of untenured Faculty during the period of their appointment), the data upon which this anticipation is based, including the amount of savings which it deems is necessary to effect, shall be presented to the AAUP. It shall also provide such additional data which may be available and which the AAUP may request within the ten (10) days following that presentation. The Administration and the AAUP shall then agree to submit either a joint recommendation or separate recommendations to the Board as to whether a condition of financial exigency exists. Both the Administration and the AAUP agree not to submit a recommendation to the Board, and the Board shall not accept recommendations from either party, until thirty (30) days after the Administration has presented to the AAUP the data referred to in the first sentence of this Article upon which its anticipation of financial exigency is based, but not sooner than fifteen (15) days after the giving of any additional data the AAUP may have requested as provided above. Discussions by the Board leading to Board action on the question of financial exigency must take place in a public meeting. Retrenchment of Faculty may not take place until the formal declaration of financial exigency has been made by the Board, which must include a statement of the amount of money needed to relieve the exigency.
28.2	Following a declaration of financial exigency, a joint Financial Exigency Committee shall be formed and shall consist of seven
86
members appointed by the Administration and seven members appointed by the AAUP. All appointments shall be made within ten (10) days after the formal declaration of financial exigency. If such appointments have not been made within such a ten (10) day period, the members of the Committee who have been named within the ten (10) days shall constitute the Committee and proceed as set forth hereinafter. The purpose of the Financial Exigency Committee shall be to develop recommendations to provide sufficient savings for relieving the exigency. The Committee shall have sixty (60) days within which to develop recommendations unless such time is extended by the Board.
28.3	In developing recommendations for relieving the exigency, the Committee shall use the following criteria and principles:
28.3.1	The Committee shall first investigate ways to relieve the exigency by means of exhausting the possibilities of immediately initiating mechanisms for raising additional funds or of reallocating current general funds; provided, however, that designated funds generated by a particular college shall not be considered as available for transfer outside the college.
28.3.2	Before retrenchment of Faculty, budgets shall be cut or activities eliminated or reduced that (a) are not selfsupporting (that is gifts, grants, contracts, or income from endowments designated for or other funds produced by that activity are less than the expense of that activity excluding tuition remission), or (b) are not in direct support of academic programs, or (c) are not essential for continued operation of the academic program of the University.
28.3.3	When retrenchment in academic programs becomes necessary, due consideration shall be given to providing for students enrolled in those programs to complete the requirements of the program.
28.3.4	Before the final recommendations are made with respect to the termination of Faculty, the Committee shall first notify the Faculty Members in each academic unit to be affected and shall consider alternate solutions which that academic unit may propose for effecting an equivalent reduction in its budget.
87
28.3.5	As to order of retrenchment, in the event that retrenchment of Faculty is necessary:
28.3.5.1	Normal attrition is the preferred approach to the extent that it will assist in relieving the financial exigency. The teaching of overloads in a particular discipline shall be eliminated, unless this would result in a serious distortion of the academic program in that discipline. Part-time Faculty Members shall be released before any full-time, non-tenured Faculty Member is released, unless this would result in a serious distortion of the academic program in which the part-time or fulltime, non-tenured Faculty Members are engaged. Part-time and full-time, non-tenured Faculty Members shall be released before any full-time, tenured Faculty Member is released, unless this would result in a serious distortion of the academic program in which the part-time, full-time, non-tenured, and full-time, tenured Faculty Members are engaged. The Committee shall also follow the principle that if there is a choice between retaining a full-time Faculty Member or part-time Faculty Member, preference shall be given to the full-time Faculty Member, unless the part-time Faculty Member's contribution is necessary to the educational program of the academic unit and cannot be provided by a full-time Faculty Member.
28.3.5.2	If the recommendation does not involve the discontinuation of a program, academic unit, or college, but would result in the termination of tenured Faculty Members and the retention of non- tenured Faculty Members, such recommendation shall contain those arguments which demonstrate that the specific order of retrenchment is necessary to avoid a serious distortion of the academic program where the non-tenured members are retained and that no serious distortions are created in the program from which the tenured Faculty Members are
88
released.
28.3.5.3	If a recommendation involves the discontinuation of a program, academic unit, or college, the Committee shall investigate at least those issues listed in Subsection 29.5 of Article 29, Termination Because of Discontinuation of a Program, Academic Unit, College, or Library, of the program, academic unit, college, or library it is proposed to terminate, and if the recommendation is to terminate, such recommendation shall set forth the reasons for the recommendation. Such reasons shall include statements regarding each of the issues listed in Subsection 29.5 of Article 29.
28.3.5.4	Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding:
a)	Non-tenured Faculty Members in a particular discipline shall be laid off before tenured Faculty Members in that discipline.
b)	The Committee shall consider an order of retrenchment different from that listed above to take affirmative action goals into account.
c)	The termination of a non-tenured or part-time Faculty Member shall not be required if his or her salary is wholly paid by restricted funds.
28.4	The Committee shall present its recommendations to the Board in writing. Should a recommendation or recommendations represent the majority view of the Committee, the majority view shall be submitted to the Board. Any recommendation or recommendations sponsored by at least five (5) members of the Committee may also go to the Board. If there are no such minority recommendations, then the majority recommendation shall include at least one alternative method of relieving the exigency.
28.5	The Committee may also investigate existing unrestricted funds and existing unrestricted fund balances and may make alternate recommendations for relieving the exigency or phasing out (as
89
contrasted to abrupt discontinuation) of existing activities by use of such funds or fund balances; provided, however, that such alternate recommendations shall not require the transfer of designated funds generated by a particular college to any other college. Such recommendations shall represent an additional alternative to the complete and alternate plan for relieving the exigency as specified in Subsection 28.4.
28.6	The Board shall only consider such recommendations as it receives from the Committee and which have the sponsorship of at least five (5) members of the Committee. The Board may deliberate and accept or reject any or all of the recommendations of either the majority or minority of the Committee, but only at a public meeting at which Faculty Members and students may present their views. Faculty Members and students who wish to make a presentation to the Board on any recommendation of the Financial Exigency Committee prior to a Board decision on the recommendation shall be afforded the opportunity to do so. In its deliberations and in making its final decisions concerning such recommendations, the Board shall apply the criteria and principles specified in Subsection 28.3. A recommendation as to Faculty retrenchment not supported by at least a majority of the Committee shall be made effective only if supported by a majority of the entire membership of the Board.
28.7	The Committee shall make a good faith effort to arrive at its recommendations within the sixty (60) day period, or any extension thereof which may be granted by the Board. Should the Committee not make recommendations as required by Subsections 28.2 and 28.4 and within the time period specified in Subsection 28.2, or the next to the last sentence of this Subsection 28.7, or any extensions of this time period granted by the Board to the Committee, or if the recommendations are not sufficient to relieve the exigency, or if no Committee is appointed as per Sub-section 28.2, the Board shall have the right to act on its own initiative as to Faculty retrenchment but, nevertheless, shall apply the criteria and principles specified in Subsection 28.3 and shall, in any case, conduct its deliberations and arrive at its decisions at a public meeting with interested parties having the right to present their views. Should the Board not be able to relieve the exigency because of its rejection of the recommendations it receives from the Committee which have the sponsorship of at least five (5) members of the Committee, the Board shall return the matter to the Committee which shall then have thirty (30) days to return with further recommendations.
90
Provided that the Committee acts within the time period specified and provided the Committee provides an alternative plan to that presented previously that will relieve the remaining exigency, this procedure shall continue until the Board acts finally to relieve the exigency.
28.8	A terminated Faculty Member shall have the right of review by the UFGC as to whether the criteria and principles of Subsection 28.3 have been properly applied in his or her case. The Grievance Committee shall present its findings to the Board for review.
28.9	If the appointment is terminated, the Faculty Member shall receive salary or notice in accordance with the following schedule: At least three months, if the final decision is reached by March 1 (or three months prior to the expiration) of the first year of probationary service; at least six months, if the decision is reached by December 15 of the second year (or after nine months but prior to eighteen months) of probationary service; at least one year, if the decision is reached after eighteen months of probationary service or if the Faculty Member has tenure but has not been a Faculty Member at the University for ten (10) or more years; at least the balance of the current academic year plus one additional year (but not less than eighteen (18) months) if the member has been a Faculty Member at the University for ten (10) or more years; provided, nevertheless, and regardless of the foregoing, that no salary or notice is required beyond the term to which the Faculty Member has most recently been appointed.
28.10	Before retrenchment of Faculty because of financial exigency, the University shall endeavor to place the affected Faculty Member in another suitable position within the University. The University may not fill a position in a discipline in which a tenured Faculty Member who has been terminated is qualified to teach for a period of five (5) years from the date of termination of service, unless the position is first offered to that Faculty Member and he or she is given at least thirty (30) days to decide whether to accept or decline the position. A Faculty Member thus recalled shall be recalled with full tenure. The University may not fill a position in the discipline in which a non-tenured Faculty Member who has been terminated is qualified to teach for a period of two (2) years from the date of termination of service unless the position is first offered to that Faculty Member and he or she is given at least thirty (30) days to decide whether to accept or decline the position. A Faculty Member thus recalled shall
91
be recalled with the number of years of prior service at the University counting as part of his or her probationary period.
28.11	In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Article and the provisions of any other Article of this Agreement, the provisions of this Article shall prevail; but nothing contained herein shall be construed as authorizing the amendment of this Agreement except by mutual consent of the parties.
28.12	A vacancy in the Financial Exigency Committee shall be promptly filled by the party which made the original appointment.
28.13	Except as otherwise provided herein, the foregoing provisions of this Article 28 shall be applicable to an anticipated financial exigency which may result in the retrenchment of Librarians (which, as used in this Article is defined as termination of Librarians on tenure or of librarians during the period of their appointment).
28.13.1	Subsections 28.3.5.1, 28.3.5.2 and 28.3.5.4 of this Article shall not apply to Librarians. In the event that retrenchment of the Librarians is necessary the order of retrenchment shall be as follows: Normal attrition is the preferred approach, to the extent that it will assist in relieving the exigency. Non-professional members of the library staff shall not be assigned professional tasks and shall not be hired, transferred, or reassigned to fill a professional vacancy created by financial exigency. Volunteer workers shall not be assigned professional tasks and shall not fill a professional vacancy created by Financial Exigency. Part-time Librarians shall be released before full-time Librarians. Librarians shall be released in inverse order of their length of service. Exceptions to this order of retrenchment may be made only if the retention of an individual is necessary to assure the proper functioning of a library.
28.13.2	Subsection 28.10 of this Article shall not apply to Librarians. The University may not fill the position of a Librarian on tenure who has been terminated for reasons of financial exigency for a period of five (5) years from the date of termination of service unless the position is first offered to that Librarian and he or she is given at least thirty (30) days to decide whether to accept or decline it.
92
ARTICLE 29
TERMINATION BECAUSE OF DISCONTINUATION OF A PROGRAM, ACADEMIC UNIT, COLLEGE, OR LIBRARY
29.1	Should the Administration make the judgment that the long-range educational mission of the University as a whole necessitates the discontinuation of a program, academic unit, or college, and that such discontinuation necessitates the termination of Faculty Members with tenure or who hold appointments extending beyond the time of the proposed termination, the Administration's reasons for this judgment shall be put in writing and shall be presented to those Faculty Members in the program, academic unit, or college which the Administration proposes to discontinue, to the Faculty Senate, and to the AAUP at least sixty (60) days before the Administration makes a recommendation for discontinuation to the Board. Should any of these groups wish to have representation, make arguments, or present materials to the Board prior to or at the time of this recommendation, they shall have the right to do so. More specifically:
29.2	The arguments which the Administration shall use in its recommendations, and the reasons which the Board shall consider, shall be based entirely on the consideration that the long-range educational mission of the University as a whole will be enhanced by the discontinuation. These reasons shall not include cyclical or temporary variations in enrollment, nor shall they be primarily based on possible financial advantages which might accrue should the discontinuation occur.
29.3	After receiving the Administration's recommendations and reasons and the response, if any, from the AAUP, Faculty Senate, and/or the Faculty Members in the program, academic unit, or college which it is proposed to discontinue, the Board may either decide to drop the matter, or it may decide that probable cause for discontinuation exists. In the latter case, the Faculty Senate shall be informed and within fourteen (14) days the Senate shall select a committee with full authority to consider the Administration's recommendation. This Committee shall consist of five (5) Faculty Members, at least two of whom shall be members of the Faculty Senate. In addition, the AAUP shall have the right to appoint one non-voting member to the Committee. In addition, the Faculty Members in the program, academic unit, or college proposed for
93
discontinuation shall have right to select one non-voting member to the Committee who shall be outside of such program, academic unit, or college.
29.4	Before final recommendations are made with respect to the discontinuation of a program, academic unit, or college, the Committee shall consult with the Faculty Members in the program, academic unit, or college proposed for elimination.
29.5	The Committee shall investigate at least each of the following issues:
29.5.1	the historical role and contributions of the program, academic unit, or college in the University's educational, scholarly, and service mission, and those long-range circumstances which may have changed to alter that role and those contributions;
29.5.2	the dependence of other programs in the University on the program, academic unit, or college proposed for discontinuation;
29.5.3	duplication elsewhere in the University of courses, research, or services offered through the program, academic unit, or college, and possible organizational arrangements which might serve as alternatives to discontinuation;
29.5.4	arrangements which can be made to allow students enrolled in the program to satisfy degree or certificate requirements;
29.5.5	stature of Faculty in the program, academic unit, or college, and stature of alumni who have been graduated from the program, academic unit, or college, and possible consequences to the academic stature of the University through discontinuation;
29.5.6	the profile of ages, periods of service, and tenure status of members of the Faculty within the academic unit and an estimate of their possible usefulness elsewhere within the University; and
94
29.5.7	possible arrangements for planned phasing out of the program, academic unit, or college as an alternative to abrupt discontinuation.
29.6	The Committee shall have sixty (60) days to complete this investigation and to make a final recommendation to the Faculty Senate. In this final recommendation the Committee shall address itself to the original reasons given by the Administration, and shall also include statements regarding each of the above issues, and any others the Committee shall find relevant. The Board may grant the Committee additional time if it finds it desirable.
29.7	The Faculty Senate shall have twenty-one (21) days within which to consider the recommendation and to vote its acceptance or rejection of the recommendation. The Committee's report and its recommendation shall be written and shall be transmitted to the Board with an indication of the Faculty Senate's vote on acceptance or rejection of the report. Should the Board, upon receipt of this report, wish to proceed with a consideration for discontinuation, it shall both discuss the issues involved and arrive at its decision at a public meeting at which all interested parties shall be afforded the opportunity to express their points of view. A recommendation of discontinuation not supported by the Committee or the Faculty Senate shall be made effective only if supported by a majority of the entire membership of the Board.
29.8	Should the Administration recommend the discontinuation of a program, academic unit, or college, but should this discontinuation not be effected as required in Subsection 29.7, the Administration shall not again commence the procedure set forth in this Article recommending discontinuation of the same program, academic unit, or college, for a period of at least two years from the date of the Board's rejection of the recommendation to discontinue.
29.9	Should discontinuation of a program, academic unit, or college be effected, but over a period of time to allow students entered in the program to complete their requirements, normal attrition should be used to terminate Faculty Members in the first phases insofar as possible. Part-time Faculty in a program, academic unit, or college which has been discontinued shall be released before full-time nontenured Faculty unless this would result in a serious distortion of the academic program. Non-tenured Faculty Members in a program, academic unit, or college which has been discontinued
95
shall be released before tenured Faculty Members in that program, academic unit, or college are released.
29.10	If an appointment is terminated, the Faculty Member shall receive salary or notice in accordance with the following schedule: At least three months, if the final decision is reached by March 1 (or three months prior to the expiration) of the first year of probationary service; at least six months, if the decision is reached by December 15 of the second year (or after nine months but prior to eighteen months) of probationary service; at least one year, if the decision is reached after eighteen months of probationary service; provided, nevertheless, that no salary or notice is required beyond the term to which the Faculty Member has most recently been appointed. A tenured Faculty Member with less than ten (10) years of full-time service will be permitted to complete the current year and, in addition, be given salary or notice for one (1) additional year. A tenured Faculty Member with ten (10) or more years of full-time service at the University will be permitted to complete the current year, and, in addition, be given salary or notice for two (2) additional years. Regardless of any contrary provisions of this Article, no salary or notice shall be required to be paid or given beyond a Faculty Member's normal retirement date.
29.11	Before terminating a tenured Faculty Member or a non-tenured Faculty Member prior to the end of a period of appointment because of discontinuation of a program, academic unit, or college, the University shall endeavor to place the affected Faculty Member in another suitable position in the University. If placement in another position would be facilitated for a tenured Faculty Member by a reasonable period of training available at the University (not to exceed the required notification period referred to in Subsection 29.10 above) such training will be offered provided that no such period of training shall be required if the Faculty Member is within three (3) years of his or her normal retirement age. Such training shall take place within the notification period referred to in Subsection 29.10 above, or at the University's option, after such period, in which event financial support will be proffered.
29.12	If an appointment is terminated before the end of the period of an appointment, or if a tenured Faculty Member is terminated because of the discontinuation of a program, academic unit, or college, the University may not fill a position in a discipline in which a released Faculty Member is qualified to teach for a period of two years from
96
the date of termination of service if the Faculty Member is untenured, or for a period of five years from the date of termination of service if the Faculty Member is tenured and is more than one year below his or her normal retirement age at the time of offer of reappointment, unless the released Faculty Member has been offered reappointment and has been given at least thirty (30) days within which to accept or decline the reappointment. A tenured Faculty Member thus recalled shall be recalled with full tenure rights.
29.13	A Faculty Member may appeal a proposed relocation or termination resulting from the discontinuation of a program, academic unit, or college, pursuant to this Article and shall have the right to a full hearing by the UFGC, subject to ultimate review by the Board.
29.14	Should the Administration make the judgment, based on the recommendation of the Library Administrator, that the long-range service mission of the library systems necessitates the discontinuation of a library and that such discontinuation necessitates the termination of a Librarian(s) with tenure or of a Librarian(s) before the expiration of the term of appointment, the Administration's reasons for this judgment shall be put in writing and presented to the Librarian(s) affected, the Faculty Senate, and to the AAUP at least sixty (60) days before the Administration makes a recommendation for discontinuation to the Board. Should these groups wish to have representation, make arguments, or present materials to the Board prior to or at the time of this recommendation, they may do so.
29.15	The arguments which the Administration may use in its recommendations, and the reasons which the Board shall consider, shall be based entirely on the consideration that the long-range mission of the library systems and the educational mission of the University will be enhanced by the discontinuation. The reasons shall not be primarily based on possible financial advantages which might accrue should the discontinuation occur.
29.16	After receiving the Administration's recommendations and reasons and the response, if any, from the AAUP, the Faculty Senate, and/or the Librarian(s) in the library which it is proposed to discontinue, the Board may decide either to drop the matter, or it may decide that probable cause for discontinuation exists. In the latter case, a committee shall be elected by Librarians who are
97
members of the Bargaining Unit with full authority to consider the Administration's recommendation. The AAUP shall have the right to appoint one non-voting member to the Committee and the Librarian(s) in the library proposed for discontinuation may select one non-voting member to the Committee.
29.17	Before final recommendations are made with respect to the discontinuation of a library, the Committee shall consult with the Faculty Members in the academic unit or college affected by the discontinuation of the library.
29.18	The Committee shall investigate at least each of following issues:
29.18.1	the historical role and contributions of the library in the library system's mission, the circumstances which may have altered that role, and the uniqueness of the collection;
29.18.2	the dependence of academic units and/or other libraries on the services of the library proposed for discontinuation;
29.18.3	the profile of ages, length of service, and terms of appointment of the Librarian(s) affected and an estimate of their possible usefulness elsewhere within the University;
29.18.4	stature of the library and possible consequences to the academic stature of the University through discontinuation; and
29.18.5	possible arrangements for planned phasing out of the library as an alternative to abrupt discontinuation.
29.19	The Committee shall have sixty (60) days to complete this investigation and to make a final recommendation to the Librarians who are members of the Bargaining Unit. In this final recommendation, the Committee shall address itself to the original reasons given by the Administration, and shall also include statements regarding each of the above issues, and any others the Committee shall find relevant. The Board may grant the Committee additional time if it finds it desirable. The Librarians who are members of the Bargaining Unit shall have twenty-one (21) days
98
within which to consider the recommendation and to vote its acceptance or rejection of the recommendation. The Committee's report and its recommendation shall be written and shall be transmitted to the Board with an indication of the vote on acceptance or rejection of the report. Should the Board, upon receipt of this report, wish to proceed with a consideration for discontinuation, it shall both discuss the issues involved and arrive at its decision at a public meeting at which all interested parties shall be afforded the opportunities to express their points of view. A recommendation of discontinuation not supported by the Committee or the Librarians who are members of the Bargaining Unit shall be made effective only if supported by a majority of the entire membership of the Board.
29.20	Should discontinuation of a library be effected, normal attrition should be used to terminate Librarians in the first phases insofar as possible. Librarians with term appointments in a library which has been discontinued shall be released before Librarians in that library who hold tenure.
29.21	If an appointment is terminated, the Librarian shall receive salary or notice in accordance with the following schedule: At least three months, if the final decision is reached by March 1 (or three months prior to the expiration) of the first year of service; at least six months, if the decision is reached by December 15 of the second year (or after nine months but prior to eighteen months) of service; at least one year, if the decision is reached after eighteen months of service; provided, nevertheless, that no salary or notice is required beyond the term to which the Librarian has most recently been appointed. A Librarian with tenure with less than ten (10) years of full-time service will be permitted to complete the current year and, in addition, be given salary or notice for one (1) additional year. A Librarian with tenure with ten (10) or more years of full-time service at the University will be permitted to complete the current year, and, in addition, be given salary or notice for two (2) additional years. Regardless of any contrary provisions of this Article, no salary or notice shall be required to be paid or given beyond a Librarian's normal retirement date.
29.22	Before terminating a Librarian holding tenure or a non-tenured Librarian prior to the expiration of the term of appointment because of the discontinuation of a library, the University shall endeavor to place the affected Librarian in another suitable position in the
99
University. If placement in another suitable position would be facilitated for a Librarian holding tenure by a reasonable period of training available at the University (not to exceed the required notification period referred to in Subsection 29.21 above) such training will be offered provided that no such period of training shall be required if the Librarian is within three (3) years of his or her normal retirement age. Such training shall take place within the notification period referred to in Subsection 29.21 above, or at the University's option, after such period, in which event, financial support will be proffered.
29.23	A Librarian may appeal a proposed relocation or termination resulting from the discontinuation of a library pursuant to this Article and shall have the right to a full hearing by the UFGC subject to ultimate review by the Board.
29.24	If an appointment is terminated before the end of the period of an appointment, or if a Librarian with tenure is terminated because of the discontinuation of a library, the University may not fill a position in the specialty of a Librarian who has been released for a period of two (2) years from the date of termination of service if the Librarian is on a term appointment or for a period of five (5) years from the date of termination of service if the Librarian has tenure and is more than one year below his or her normal retirement age at the time of offer of reappointment, unless the released Librarian has been offered reappointment and has been given at least thirty (30) days within which to accept or decline the reappointment. A Librarian with tenure thus recalled shall be recalled with full rights of tenure.

ACADEMIC UNIT HEADS
31.1	Nomination Process. Academic unit heads, appointed by the Board, serve at the pleasure of the Board and are subject to appointment and reappointment upon the recommendation of the President. All other academic unit heads serve at the pleasure of the President. Nominations to the President shall be made through the Provost, by the Dean (unless the Dean is the academic unit head) or appropriate administrator, following consultation with an ad hoc committee composed of Faculty and students from the academic unit concerned and related academic units. Faculty from the academic unit and no more than two students from the academic unit shall constitute a majority of the committee, and that majority shall include at least two (2) members of the Faculty democratically chosen by the academic unit concerned. The appointee must be mutually acceptable to the Dean and the ad hoc committee. Academic unit heads shall be appointed according to a term designated by the by-laws of the college but to be not less than three (3) nor more than seven (7) years; they shall undergo administrative performance review in the penultimate year of each term before their reappointment.
31.2	General Areas of Responsibility. Academic unit heads, and those serving in an acting capacity, serve by empowerment of the Faculty and designation by the Dean or administrator to represent the Faculty and college administration--each to the other--and to the University community.

	meetings with all the Faculty. If size and scope of the academic unit necessitate, the academic unit head, with approval of the Dean or administrator, may delegate this responsibility to another academic administrator within the unit; 31.2.5	leadership in academic governance, including especially the collaborative development of appropriate procedures for governance within the academic unit (e.g., policies and procedures regarding RPT, leaves, long-range planning, curriculum development, program review, and distribution and utilization of resources); 31.2.6	leadership in promoting a climate where both the spirit and letter of affirmative action prevail; 31.2.7	involvement in personal professional development and scholarship, including the development of necessary administrative skills and knowledge (e.g., administrative leadership workshops); 31.2.8	management and oversight of the academic unit's budget (all funds), class schedules, course offerings, teaching assignments and staff; 31.2.9	implementation of appropriate provisions of the UC/AAUP Agreement, University Rules, and college bylaws (the AAUP and the University will consult in the design and implementation of contract compliance training of academic unit heads).
31.3	Administrative Performance Review. The administrative performance of academic unit heads shall be reviewed periodically as per Subsection 31.1 above. Not later than the end of the penultimate year of an incumbent's term, a review of the academic unit head's performance shall be undertaken which assures appropriate participation by Faculty in the academic unit. The processes and specific criteria for administrative performance review shall be established for each college by an elected Faculty committee in consultation with and subject to the approval of the Dean or appropriate administrator. The process and timetable for administrative performance review of academic unit heads shall be published in order to assure opportunity for every member of the
103
Faculty in the academic unit to contribute.
31.4 Removal. An incumbent academic unit head may be removed because of inadequate administrative performance. A removal decision shall be communicated immediately by the Dean or appropriate administrator to the Faculty of the academic unit involved and the individual prior to formal removal.

Accordingly, it is agreed that the policies of the University set forth in such Rules and applicable to Bargaining Unit members shall be continued during the life of this Agreement; provided, however, that such policies are not in conflict with the provisions of this Agreement.

36.3	Library Faculty. Superfluous language in previous contracts, which referred separately to Library Faculty, is deleted from this contract in recognition of the status of professional Librarians as full members of the University Faculty. Removal of this language is not intended to eliminate any contractual protections of Library Faculty as Members of the Bargaining Unit. Separate references are maintained where necessary to reflect the unique nature of Library Faculty Members' functions.
ARTICLE 37

The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter not removed by law

40.5	Within seven (7) days of such written notification of a request for fact-finding, each party shall designate a person to serve as a member of the fact-finding panel. Those two members of the factfinding panel shall request either FMCS or SERB to select a third member to serve as chairperson, which chairperson shall be appointed within seven (7) days after selection of the initial two members. Unless both parties consent, the chairperson cannot be the same person who served as Mediator.
40.6	The fact-finding panel, within seven (7) days of its appointment, must meet with the parties. The panel may hold hearings, make additional investigations and inquiries, and take other steps as it considers appropriate. The panel is empowered to request SERB to issue subpoenas, pursuant to Section 4117.14 (C) (4) (c), Ohio Revised Code. If the dispute is not settled within fifteen (15) days after the panel is appointed, or within a longer period, if agreed to by the parties, the panel must report its findings to the parties, including its recommendations on the unresolved issues. Fourteen (14) days after submission to the parties, the findings must be made public if no settlement has been reached.
40.7	Notwithstanding the dispute settlement procedures described above:
40.7.1	The AAUP reserves the right to strike, under Section 4117.14 (D)(2) and otherwise, at any time after the expiration of the Agreement, upon giving ten (10) days notice to the Administration and SERB.
40.7.2	The parties may, at any time during the negotiations and by mutual agreement, request either FMCS or SERB appoint a Mediator to assist in the settlement of disputes over negotiation issues.

MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING
M.1 Benefits Study Committee
M.1.1 The Benefits Study Committee shall be a standing committee with four (4) members appointed by the AAUP Board and four (4) members appointed by the Administration. The Committee may create subcommittees, which will have equal representation from each Party, and may include individuals who are not members of the Committee.
M.1.2 The Committee shall explore ways to contain benefits costs to the University and to the individual Bargaining Unit member without reducing the level of benefits available to Bargaining Unit members subject to the terms and conditions listed below. To achieve these ends the Committee may direct the University to get cost estimates, determine accurate estimates of benefits costs, review usage, investigate and compare current and alternate vendors, and make recommendations and other requests consistent with its charge. The University shall provide the Committee with all the information available to it regarding the cost, usage, and nature of benefits provided to all University employees.
M.1.3 Monitoring Quality of Care Date and Payment Expenses: The University shall provide to the AAUP Benefits Study Committee information collected by the Benefits office related to the efficiency and timeliness of payments for health care expenses as requested, but not more than once per quarter.
M.1.4 In addition to the concerns stated above, the Committee specifically shall study the following during the term of this contract, and recommend changes where appropriate:.
a)	the University Wellness Program, and a sick childcare program; and
b)	the effectiveness of the Choice Benefits Plan.
M.1.5 On December 1, 2004 and on December 1 of each subsequent year during the term of this Agreement, the Benefits Study Committee shall issue a written report to the parties documenting the plan budget and actual costs to the parties for the preceding fiscal year as well as a summary of usage data for Bargaining Unit members.
116
M.2 Faculty Representation on the Board of Trustees
Faculty representation on the Board, pursuant to Board of Trustees' Rule 3361:10-1-02, shall include the chairperson of the University Faculty Senate and two elected representatives of the University Faculty. They shall have the right to suggest proposals for consideration by the Board and the President, and to attend with voice, all meetings of the Board, except executive sessions, and Board committees including academic affairs and finance.
M.3 Debt Service
In order to assure Faculty participation in establishing funding priorities and long-term policies on University-wide debt management, policies shall be developed through the joint governance council on the amount of general funds and total revenues (with the exception of University Hospital and Hoxworth revenue) applied to service the debt and on the percent of annual debt expense of annual total revenues in this year and following years. Other policies of this nature should be developed by the joint governance council as appropriate.
M.4 Environmental Oversight Committee
The joint Administration/Faculty Environmental Oversight Committee shall consist of four (4) administrators appointed by the President and four (4) Bargaining Unit members appointed by the Faculty Senate. This Committee is charged with oversight of the University's efforts in removing hazardous and unhealthy conditions from the work environment. Meetings of the Committee will be held at least on a quarterly basis. The Committee will establish its meeting times and administrative procedures. The Committee can receive complaints from Faculty and Librarians concerning alleged hazardous conditions. The Committee may request the presence of anyone who may have a concern or who can be of assistance in considering environmental matters. The Committee shall monitor the University's efforts to remedy the situation leading to the complaint. The Committee shall from time to time report to the Presidents of the University and the AAUP and the Chair of the Faculty Senate on any environmental or health hazard which, in its judgment, represents a major cause for concern and recommend appropriate actions.
117
M.5 Professional Development
Whereas, the AAUP and the University are parties to a collective bargaining agreement to expire on August 31, 2007; and Whereas, under the terms of Article 24.7 of the AAUP/UC Collective Bargaining Agreement, the University has agreed to provide $500,000 per year for faculty professional development, to be administered by a faculty development committee comprised of three Administrators and three Faculty Members elected by the Faculty Senate, with the Vice Provost for Faculty Development as Ex Officio Chair of the committee; and Whereas, in addition to the distribution of professional development funds to Faculty Members, the AAUP and the University have determined that it would be advantageous to use a portion of such funds for an incomeproducing quasi-endowment that will last beyond the August 31,2007 termination of the current AAUP/UC Agreement;
Therefore the AAUP and the University agree to amend and supplement the current Agreement as follows:
(1)	By agreement of November 5, 1997, the AAUP and the University agreed to establish a quasi-endowment for the purpose of receiving, accumulating and disbursing funds for faculty development. The quasi-endowment will continue during the term of the current AAUP/UC contract. Any faculty development funds undistributed at the end of each contract year will be contributed to the quasiendowment. Further, the President will attempt to match yearly contributed amounts through solicitation from outside sources. The faculty development committee will have the authority to withdraw income earned by the quasi-endowment for purposes of making it available for faculty development grants. Otherwise, the quasiendowment will be governed by the quasi-endowment policy of the University of Cincinnati.
(2)	For purposes of implementing the provisions of Article 24.7 and distributing funds both from the initial allotment and from the quasiendowment, professional development will be defined as follows: (A) Professional development shall mean any activity designed to increase a Faculty Member's knowledge or skills in order to further the University's mission of teaching and research. The proposed development plan shall bear a direct relationship to the teaching and research goals of the Faculty Member(s), the department(s), and the college(s). Professional development can be realized by, but is not limited to, the following activities: travel
118
to professional meetings and conferences to promote faculty development, faculty collaborative efforts, participation in workshops or short courses, travel to consult with Faculty Members or professional colleagues at other institutions, purchase of books or computer software used to increase the Faculty Member's knowledge or skills, or the sponsorship of a conference or workshop for the University of Cincinnati academic community. Professional development awards can also be made, up to a combined annual limit of $100,000, for curriculum development, curriculum implementation, or research projects that relate in direct and significant ways to the enhancement of classroom teaching. Faculty development funds are not meant for other research projects.
(B) Professional development funds shall not be used to purchase computers or computer upgrades or accessories, equipment or supplies unless the purchase of equipment is directly related to faculty professional development. Articles 30.1.1, 30.1.2, and 30.1.3 of the 2004 - 2007 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the University of Cincinnati and the American Association of University Professors, University of Cincinnati Chapter covers the acquisition of the aforementioned items. Nor shall any academic, administrative, or instructional positions be funded by the Professional Development Fund. Likewise, this fund shall not be used to support students, student activities or faculty assistants, or research projects other than those directly related to the enhancement of classroom teaching.
M.6 Personnel Records/Files
Each academic year the Contract Administrators will distribute to Deans, Directors and Department Heads:
(1)	The Guidelines on the Maintenance of and Access to Faculty Personnel Files as passed by the Faculty Senate, and as they may be amended from time to time by the Faculty Senate; and
(2)	Administrative Memorandum 118, as it may be amended by the University President, and containing the Guidelines for Administrative Review and Appeal of Disputes Concerning Personnel Records.
119
M.7 AAUP/UC Joint Committee
In order to facilitate communications between the AAUP and the Administration, a joint committee shall be established.
The committee shall consist of six (6) members, three (3) appointed by the AAUP and three (3) appointed by the Administration. The committee shall meet semi-annually at a time and location mutually agreed upon by the University Contract Administrators and the UC AAUP President.
The topics of the meetings shall be issues of mutual interest. The committee may address matters of Agreement implementation and make suggestions for improved Agreement management, however, the committee shall not discuss specific grievances nor shall it be used as a forum for bargaining. The parties shall exchange agenda items no later than seven (7) days prior to a meeting. Additional meetings may be scheduled by mutual agreement.
M.8 Faculty Salary Committee
The AAUP and the University agree to establish an ad hoc joint Faculty Salary Committee, consisting of three (3) individuals appointed by the AAUP and three (3) individuals appointed by the Administration, to determine benchmark universities, to review compensation models, to address issues of salary compression, and to recommend a financial strategy and to explore various mechanisms that would provide funds, above current University funds used to support general faculty salary increases, to augment general salary increases.
The recommendations shall be submitted through the Provosts to the President’s Budget Committee.
The Committee shall be disbanded at the expiration of this Agreement.
M.9 Re-opener on Domestic Partner Benefits
If, by June 30, 2005, the State of Ohio has not adopted legislation prohibiting state universities from providing domestic partner benefits, the negotiations will be reopened solely over the AAUP’s proposal regarding domestic partner benefits.
120
M. 10. ARP Arbitration Settlement
As full, and final complete settlement of the pending ARP arbitration, with the intent to bind individual bargaining unit members to the extent permitted by law, the parties agree as follows:
1.	Commencing June 1, 2003 UC will increase its contributions for STRS-eligible participants in the ARP plan to 10.5%, representing the difference between 14% and the current required University contribution to STRS to fund unfunded liabilities of STRS. The amount of the University’s contribution to STRS-eligible ARP participants will be adjusted from time to time to account for increases and decreases in the University’s unfunded liability contribution to STRS by subtracting the new unfunded liability contribution from 14%.
2.	The University will pay $495,000 to eligible STRS-eligible participants in the ARP plan at the rate of $99,000 per year for five years, commencing July 1, 2003.
3.	The University will pay $25,000 to eligible PERS-eligible participants in the ARP plan at the rate of $5,000 per year for five years, commencing July 1, 2003.
4.	To be eligible for a payment, the ARP plan participants must have been participants during all or some part of the period September 1, 2002 through May 31, 2003. The manner of distributing the payments to such eligible plan participants shall be proportional based on participants’ salaries during the period.
5.	The parties shall issue a joint statement relating to the settlement agreement. No other public statement will be made.
6.	The terms of this agreement are subject to ratification by the Board of the AAUP. When ratified, the terms will be reduced to a definitive agreement and executed by the parties.
