expected to attend the full day, 6 hour, in-service and sign all attendance rosters. (The district is not reimbursed by the state for participants attending less than a full day of in-service).

successful completion of the in-service training. (This stipend will be reviewed annually by the district and the association).
•	This staff development day is not an additional workday on the work
year calendar. Therefore, the leave provisions in the contract, with the exception of article 10.5 (Industrial Accident and Illness Leave), do not apply if an employee is absent.
The continued implementation of this staff development day for classified employees requires sufficient participation by classified employees and sufficient state reimbursement to support the training activities.

15.	LAYOFF
15.1	Definitions (Procedure)
15.1.1	Employee. An employee for the purpose of this article is a permanent or probationary employee who is a member of the classified service.
15.1.2	Layoff Employees shall be subject to layoff for lack of work and/or lack of funds as determined by the governing board. A layoff for purposes of this article shall be considered an involuntary separation of an employee because of lack of work and/or lack of funds. Any voluntary reduction in regularly assigned time in lieu of layoff shall be considered a layoff for purposes of this article.	1	‘
15.2	Order of Layoff (Procedure)	r	.
15.2.1	Whenever an employee is laid off, the order of layoff within the classification (including service within higher classifications) shall be as follows:
15.2.1.1	For employees whose date ofhire is before July 1, 1999, a seniority ranking list (by classification) will be developed. The seniority ranking list shall include all hours in paid status through June 30, 1999, as a probationary or permanent member of the classified service whether during the school year, a holiday, recess, or any period that a school is in session or closed. It does not include any hours compensated solely on an overtime basis, or while on military leave, or unpaid illness leave, or unpaid industrial accident leave. Once the ranking list is established, the individual employee , ranking (seniority) will not change.
15.2.1.2	For employees whose date ofhire is on or after July 1, 1999, seniority will be determined by date ofhire (as a probationary or permanent member) in the classification.
15.2.1.3	Each party shall appoint a representative to meet and discuss the legal implications of the agreement to use date ofhire for purposes of layoff for employees hired after the date of ratification and the ranking of current employees through the use of current contractual provisions.
15.2.2	If two (2) or more employees subject to layoff have equal seniority, the determination as to who shall be laid off shall be made based on the hire date into a probationary status with the employee hired first being retained. If that is equal, the District shall determine if retention of one of the employees would further the goals of the District Affirmative Action Program and shall retain him/her. Otherwise, determination as to
GU 11-01
46
■	i
which employee is laid off shall be made by lot.
15.2.3	An employee who is laid off from a class and who has previous service
in an equal or lower class and who has greater seniority, shall have the right to bump the employee having the least seniority with the closest job profile. (Job profile as defined in this section shall mean assigned hours per day, days per week and months per year.)
15.2.4	If there are two (2) or more positions with the same work profile that will be bumped, placement into the positions will be by employee choice (in order of seniority). Employees who have placement choices will be notified of the placement meeting date, time and location. If an employee fails to report to the placement meeting, or fails to send a representative in his/her place, the human resource department will identify the site placement.
15.3	Notification of Layoff (Procedure)
15.3.1	The District shall transmit a copy of the board agenda to the Association regarding any proposed layoff. This shall constitute notice to the Association of said layoff.
15.3.2	Within a reasonable time of a written request by the Association, the District will provide the Association with a seniority roster and a list of employees to be laid off.
15.3.3	The District shall notify the affected employees in writing a minimum of thirty (30) calendar days prior to the date of any layoffs, except in the event of an actual and existing financial inability to pay salaries to classified employees or for causes not foreseeable or preventable by the governing board, where less than thirty (30) days notice may be given.
15.4	Improper Layoff Rights
15.4.1	Any employee who is improperly laid off and is otherwise entitled to employment shall be re-employed in the same or equal class immediately upon discovery of error.
15.4.2	Accumulated sick leave, prior to layoff plus accumulated sick leave and vacation allowance for time not employed with the District as a result of improper layoff, will be reinstated.
15.4.3	The employee will be reimbursed for all loss of pay from the District, as a result of the improper layoff, less any earnings the employee received from any other employment while on layoff.
15.4.4	If the employee believes that, as a result of layoff, he/she has not been made financially whole by the District under 15.4.3, the employee may file a grievance at Step IV.
GV 11-01

15.5	Separation Benefits
15.5.1	Vacation time earned and unused at the time of layoff shall be
computed and paid off with the final salary warrant due the employee.
15.5.2	Eligibility for District contributions for dental, health, and vision insurance shall not be reduced for six (6) months despite the fact the hour-per-week qualification may change due to a voluntary reduction of hours by the employee to avoid layoff.
15.5.3	The District will provide any laid-off employee the contractual District contribution amount toward health, dental and vision insurance for two (2) calendar months following the affected employee's final scheduled day of employment.
15.5.4	Any employee who has received a layoff notice shall, upon his/her request, be allowed to take any unused accumulated vacation entitlement prior to the effective date of the layoff.
15.6	Re-Employment from Layoff
15.6.1	Employees laid off because of lack of work or lack of funds are eligible
to re-employment for a period of 39 months and shall be re-employed in preference to new applicants. In addition, such persons laid off have the right to participate in promotional placement processes within the District during the period of 39 months.
15.6.2	Employees who take voluntary demotions or voluntary reductions in assigned time in lieu of layoff or to remain in their present positions rather than be reclassified or reassigned, shall be granted the same rights as persons laid off and shall retain eligibility to be considered for reemployment for an additional period of up to 24 months; provided that the same tests for fitness under which they qualified for appointment to the class shall still apply. Employees who take voluntary demotions or voluntary reductions in assigned time in lieu of layoff shall be, at the option of the employee, returned to a position in their former class or to positions with increased assigned time as vacancies become available, and without limitation of time, but if there is a valid re-employment list, they shall be ranked on that list in accordance with their proper seniority.
15.6.3	An employee who is laid off and is subsequently eligible for reemployment shall be notified in writing by the District of an opening. Such notice shall be sent by certified mail to the last address given the District by the employee.
15.6.4	A laid off employee shall notify the District of his or her intent to accept or refuse re-employment within five (5) work days following the delivery/or first notice of certified mailing of the re-employment notice. Failure to respond constitutes a refusal. After three refusals for reemployment, an employee shall be considered unavailable for re-
GU 11-01

15.6.5
employment and shall not be notified of future vacancies until the laid-off employee notifies the Human Resources Department, in writing, that he/she is available for re-employment.
Employees shall be re-employed in the highest rated job classification available in accordance with their length of service in the class from which they were laid off, plus higher classes. Employees who accept a position lower than their former class shall retain their original thirty-nine (39) month rights to the higher paid positions.
15.6.6	Should an employee who had elected retirement in lieu of layoff subsequently accept, in writing, re-employment with the District, the District shall maintain the vacancy until PERS has properly processed the request for reinstatement from retirement.
15.6.7	Upon return to work, eligibility for vacation and sick leave entitlement shall be computed in accordance with seniority.
15.6.8	Unused sick leave benefits, accumulated prior to layoff, will be 	reinstated	upon return to work.

ATTACHMENT F
San Juan Unified School District CSEA, Chapter #127 April 29, 1999
Definition of COLA
The COLA increase to the salary schedule shall be defined as the percent change in the funded revenue limit per ADA. The percentage change will be calculated each year based on the change between the Board-approved revised budget (the one that takes the State Budget Act into account) for the current year and the unaudited actuals for the prior year. This percent change will be adjusted to reflect any change between the Board-approved revised budget (the one that takes the State Budget Act into account) and the unaudited actuals for the prior year. The intent is that any mid-year changes in the funded revenue limit will be reflected in the next year’s settlement.
If the change in the funded Special Education Entitlement per ADA varies by more than 1 % from the percent change in the funded revenue limit per ADA, the COLA increase to the salary schedule will be calculated as the weighted average of the two funding sources (revenue limit and Special Education).
