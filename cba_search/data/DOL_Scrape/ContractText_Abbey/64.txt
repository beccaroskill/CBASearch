ARTICLE 1
Agreement Coverage and Union Recognition
Section 1.	Employees Covered and Union Recognition. This Agreement shall cover all employees in the above factories who, by virtue of duties performed, are eligible for membership in the Union, and the Union is recognized by the Employer as the sole collective bargaining agent for all such employees.
Section 2.	Work and Duties Covered.
a.	General. It will be the continued policy of the Company that the work and job duties, which have customarily been performed by the bargaining unit members, will continue to be performed by them as in the past. It is agreed that these work and job duties shall include the receiving and storing of beets at the plants and yard areas, the processing of beets into sugar and by-products, the storage and shipping of sugar and by-products, the normal repair, maintenance and improvements to the factories which include the plant and yard areas and the duties previously performed in the Agricultural Department except in those cases where the members of the bargaining unit lack the skill or the Company lacks the necessary equipment to carry out such repair, maintenance, and improvement work safely, economically and efficiently within the time available.
b.	Beet Seed Cleaning and Processing. The ordinary cleaning and processing of beet seed at the factory shall be the work of the members of the Union.
c.	Processing By-Products. Processing of all by-products when performed at Employer’s factory shall be deemed to be covered by this Agreement.
Section 3.	Outside Contractors. Where , the members of the bargaining unit lack skill or the Company lacks the necessary equipment to carry out such repair, maintenance and improvement work safely, economically and efficiently within the time available, then the company will give the Bargaining committee at each plant at least fifteen (15) days written notice prior to the time that the contract is let for such work, if reasonably possible under the circumstances. The notice to the Union will set forth the proposed
2
improvements and repairs to be contracted and the reason which necessitates that the work be contracted.
The Union will notify the Company within five (5) days after receiving such notice if they disagree over whether the work should be contracted, in which event, the matter will be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure, but the work of the contractor may proceed. In deciding a grievance based upon a disputed contract or upon a failure notice, the arbitrator shall be free to award pay to members of the bargaining unit who have been deprived of the opportunity to perform the work.
Section 4.	Employment of Outside Skills. In the event situations arise wherein it is necessary to employ temporarily especially skilled labor, such as, but not exclusively, bricklayers for relining of lime kilns, it is agreed that such work is recognized as out of the ordinary sugar workers’ routine, and such work and the employees performing it are exempt from this Agreement.
Section 5.	Exempt Employees. All employees at the above mentioned factories shall be included under the terms of this Agreement with the following exceptions: Factory Manager, Agricultural Manager, Factory Superintendent, Agriculturalists, Warehouse Manager, Maintenance Manager, Shift Superintendents, Assistant Maintenance Managers, Office and Clerical help (except storekeepers), Guards, Factory Chemist, Facility Manager and employees of the Agricultural Department outside the plant or yard area.

1.	Instructing and/or training employees.
2.	Demonstrating the correct use of tools or equipment.
3.	Acting to prevent an accident or injury to an employee or to prevent product or equipment damage.
The Company will have the option to remove the position of Warehouse Leader from the bargaining units after such position is vacated by a present occupant, but there will be no reduction in the number of regular positions.
If, at any time, the Company employs a salaried Warehouse Manager outside the bargaining unit, record keeping and clerical duties may be performed in
3
whole or in part by other than bargaining unit employees. So long as the position of Warehouse Leader remains in a bargaining unit, that position will retain Crew Leader status.

Each assignment executed by an employee for the deduction of monthly Union dues or unpaid initiation fees shall be irrevocable for the period of one year from the date thereof, or until the termination of this Agreement, whichever sooner occurs. If this Agreement shall be continued in full force and effect for a succeeding period or periods after each expiration, then such assignment shall be irrevocable for successive periods of one year each from and after the date thereof, or until the expiration of the continued term of this Agreement, whichever shall be sooner, unless written notice of the revocation of such assignment is given by such employee to the Employer not more than twenty (20) days and not less than ten (10) days prior to the expiration date of each such one (1) year period or the expiration of the continued term of this Agreement, whichever sooner occurs, provided further that if said collective Agreement shall not be continued in accordance with the terms and provisions for any succeeding period after the termination date thereof, then such assignment shall nevertheless remain in effect but shall be revocable upon written notice given by the employee to Employer.

(1)	Michigan Sugar Company (the "Company") and the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers & Grain Millers, Locals 259-G, 260-G, 261-G and 262-G (the "Union") recognize that the presence and influence of drugs and alcohol in the workplace is inconsistent with employee safety and the efficient operation of the factory.
(2)	Company policy prohibits the presence of illegal drugs on Company premises and prohibits employees from selling, using, possessing, working or attempting to work under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol as well as unauthorized selling, transferring, purchasing or abusing prescription or other legal drugs (hereinafter, the term "drug(s)" shall include illegal, prescription, and legal drugs).
(3)	Company policy prohibits the possession of alcoholic beverages in the workplace and the consumption of alcoholic beverages in association with the workplace.
(4)	When an employee is found violating this policy, or when there is reasonable suspicion that an employee is violating this policy, the employee may be disciplined up to and including discharge, subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.
(5)	"Reasonable Suspicion" is the observance of abnormal or unusual on-duty behavior of an individual employee which:
(a)	is observed on-duty by a supervisor trained to recognize the symptoms of drug abuse, impairment or intoxication, and confirmed by another observer (which observations shall be documented by the supervisor); and
(b)	is the type of behavior which is a recognized and accepted symptom of intoxication or impairment caused by controlled substances or alcohol or addiction to or dependence upon said controlled substances.
82
(c)	is not reasonably explained as resulting from causes other than the use of controlled substances (such as, but not by way of limitation, fatigue, lack of sleep, side effect of prescription or over-the-counter medications, reaction to noxious fumes or smoke, etc.)
Reports of drug use or abnormal behavior which are not confirmed by another observer shall not constitute reasonable suspicion.
(6)	“Reasonable suspicion” for drug and alcohol testing shall also exist after an accident when it results in:
(a)	An on-the-job injury as defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration;
(b)	The death of a human being;
(c)	Bodily injury to a person who, as a result of the injury, immediately received medical treatment away from the scene of the accident;
(d)	One or more motor vehicles incurring disabling damage as a result of the accident, requiring the vehicle to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle; or
(e)	Any accident or property damage, when it appears that the employee might reasonably have avoided the accident or minimized the consequences but did not do so.
An employee who is seriously injured, making them unable to provide a urine/blood specimen, shall give to the Company necessary authorization to obtain hospital reports and other documents that would indicate the presence of any controlled substances in their system.
(7)	As an alternative to discipline for violating this policy, the Company, at its discretion, may do one or more of the following:
(a)	counsel the employee,
83
(b)	require the employee to submit a urine specimen to test for the presence of drugs, or
(c)	require the employee to submit a breath sample to test for the presence of alcohol.
"Counsel" shall mean the opportunity to meet with the Factory Manager and the Union Committee.
(8)	The collection of urine samples for drug tests will be conducted in accordance with the procedures of the collection clinic designated by the Company.
(9)	The Company wishes to protect the dignity of the employee. Employees who attempt to, or actually provide adulterated or false samples, or who attempt to or actually circumvent the testing process will be terminated.
(10)	Breath and urine specimens shall be drawn or collected at the laboratory, hospital or medical facility at which the specimen is to be tested or prepared for testing. If requested by the employee, a Union representative, if available, may be allowed to accompany the employee, without a loss of time, to the testing facility. The employee shall not be observed when the urine specimen is given.
(11)	The testing shall be done by a laboratory certified by the State of Michigan as a medical and forensic laboratory which complies with the Scientific and Technical Guidelines for Federal Drug Testing Programs and the Standards for Certification of Laboratories, Engaged in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies issued by the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
(12)	Employees asked to provide samples for drug and alcohol testing pursuant to this policy will be required to cooperate and to sign a consent form (see Attachment 1) as a condition of continued employment. Objections may be raised by the employee or the Union, but will be subject to the "comply now and grieve later" doctrine.
(13)	The Company will direct that split samples be taken with the confirming test to be a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). If the first test and confirmation test on the first sample are
84
positive and the employee elects to have the second sample tested, the Company will pay for the cost of the second test. If the employee elects to have the split sample tested, the Company will advise the laboratory selected by the employee or the Union.
(14)	The Company will determine if the employee asked to take a drug or alcohol test should be permitted to work during the time between providing the sample and the receipt of the test results. If the employee has been directed by the Company not to work during this time, but to remain on an unpaid leave of absence and the reason is solely because of the pendency of the drug or alcohol test and the test results prove to be negative, the employee will be compensated as though he or she had not been suspended.
(15)	The Company will advise the Union if it becomes aware of a change in laboratories in which the testing is done or if it becomes aware of a change in laboratory procedures including any changes in the laboratory's certification. The purpose of this is to permit the Union to understand the procedures. The failure of the Company to advise the Union of these changes will not invalidate an otherwise properly conducted drug or alcohol test.
(16)	In the event an employee tests positive for drugs or at a blood alcohol level of .08% or more, or the employee admits violating this policy after being asked to submit to a drug or alcohol test, the employee must sign a "Last Chance Agreement." (see Attachment 2). If the employee refuses to sign the Last Chance Agreement, the employee will be terminated.
(a)	The Last Chance Agreement requires an employee to participate in a Company and Union approved employee assistance program (EAP) as a condition of continued employment. If the employee does not follow the directions of the rehabilitation professionals, attend all counseling sessions and/or treatment programs, then the employee will be terminated.
(b)	Upon completing the EAP referral, the Company reserves the right to require the employee to submit to periodic drug or alcohol, or drug and alcohol testing, without advanced notice, for a period of one year (the "Follow Up Test") but not to exceed 15 tests. An employee who tests positive in a
85
Follow Up Test will be terminated without recourse, except as to the validity of the test. An employee who refuses to comply with a request to submit to a Follow Up Test will be terminated without recourse.
(17)	Illegal drugs are those drugs defined as illegal under federal, state, or local laws.
(18)	Before any drug test is given, the employee may note the use of any prescription or non-prescription medications. The laboratory procedures will report the significant presence of all prescription and non-prescription drugs.
(19)	An employee may request a written copy of the drug and/or alcohol test results.
(20)	The Company and the Union will strive to maintain the confidentiality of employee drug-related problems.
Agreed this 1st day of August ,2010.
