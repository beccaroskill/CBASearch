A Partner or their designee shall be responsible for ensuring that all allegations of misconduct or other complaints against an employee on which any action is to be taken or a record is to be made shall be investigated by an impartial party.

b.	Investigative Interview
i.	When the employee under investigation is to be interviewed concerning the alleged conduct which could result in dismissal, the employee and their representative shall be notified in writing, at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the interview.

iii.	The interview shall be limited to questions that relate to the allegation(s) and the employee’s fitness for duty in their assignment. Confidentiality of the interview shall be maintained.
c.	If after investigation the employer determines that no discipline is appropriate, the employee shall be informed in writing that a complaint was made against them but was unfounded. Appropriate notification shall be placed in the employee’s personnel file or another agreed location documenting that the employee was investigated and exonerated on the matter.
d.	If an employee is to be interviewed as a witness only, the employee and their representative shall be so informed prior to the interview. If during the course of the interview it becomes apparent that the employee witness may be subject to discipline as a result of conduct that is the subject of the interview, the interview shall be immediately terminated and the employee afforded the protections of this Article. This provision may be waived by consent of the employee and the union representative.
e.	The parties agree that not all investigations that may result in job change or termination are disciplinary in nature. Any person investigated for fitness or competence for duty is
10

also entitled to the protection of this article. Medical and fitness-related action are also subject to the requirement that there be just cause for taking such action.
ARTICLE 5
CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION
The parties acknowledge that problems of general administration (as opposed to individual employee grievances) may arise during the administration of this Agreement which may require Middle Seat and the Union to meet from time to time for the purpose of reviewing the general administration of the Agreement.

v.	dismissal.
The principles of progressive discipline shall be followed.
c.	In extreme circumstances, the above steps of progressive discipline may be skipped in cases of sexual harassment, misconduct, or assault; physical assault; theft of company or client property, including data; and/or breach of the confidentiality, conflict of interest, or intellectual property clauses in hire letters.
d.	No employee covered by this Agreement shall be disciplined or dismissed without first having been given notice in writing of the disciplinary action to be taken. The conduct for which disciplinary action is being imposed and the action to be taken shall be specified in the written notice.
e.	Any employee receiving a discipline or dismissal will be afforded an opportunity to meet with a Partner, or their representative, prior to the action proposed. The employee will be entitled to have a union representative, steward, and/or other member of the bargaining unit present. At that meeting a Partner or their designee will give the employee an explanation of the employer’s evidence against the employee (if that has not already been provided) and offer the employee an opportunity to respond.
f Counseling an employee is not disciplinary, is not subject to the just cause provision, and will not be used for purposes of progressive discipline.
