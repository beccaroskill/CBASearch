Re: 2000 Side Letter
Dear Mr. Gammone:
The parties agree to the following:
1.	Co-mingling of TA and MaBSTOA Work in Bus Maintenance
The following terms apply to the operation of co-mingled central maintenance facilities:
If the OA Maintainers are moved back to the Bronx (out of the East New York (ENY) Shop), the OA Supervisors assigned with them at ENY will also be moved back to the Bronx.
The East New York Revenue Shop will continue to have TSO represented supervisors as long as MaBSTOA hourly employees are assigned to that facility.
To the extent that CMF functions continue to be performed at East New York, SSSA Supervisors will supervise the following functions: engine assembly, machine and fabrication shops, "V" drive converters, and transmissions and units overhauled in the unit assembly area of the shop.
The OA/TA supervisory staffing mix at the Central Maintenance Facility at ENY or at any co-mingled facility will be based upon the mix of the hourly workforce at such facility (i.e. 75% TA Maintainers to 25% OA Maintainers then the supervisory mix will be 75% to 25% OA).
18
Mr. Tony Gammone
July 5, 2000
Page 2
Seniority for the purpose of choosing vacations, other days off (AVA, single vacation days, etc.) and overtime in co-mingled facilities shall be seniority in a supervisory title, whether OA or TA. It is understood that all affected unions will have to agree to this term in order for it to become applicable.
2.	The following applies to all other co-mingled facilities:
To the extent that co-mingling is extended into other areas, job locations and tours of the operation within or outside of the Department of Buses, where it does not already exist, the parties agree to meet to discuss and negotiate the impact of such a decision prior to implementation. If the parties cannot agree, existing contractual provisions will apply to the co-mingled facility or work.
3.	Co-mingling which already exists in other areas of the operation is not modified by this agreement nor are contractual restrictions where they exist.
Agreed:

Re: Employee Recognition Program
Dear Mr. Gammone:
This side-letter will confirm that if the SSSA representative who presently works for the Employee Recognition Program retires or leaves for any reason while this contract's in effect, SSSA will have the right to appoint a new SSSA representative as a replacement.
I agree:
Tony Gammone President SSSA
Stipulation and Agreement
Whereas, NYC Transit (hereafter referred to as "the Authority" and the Subway Surface Supervisors Association (hereafter referred to as "SSSA" or the "Union") have reviewed the health benefit package provided to employees and retirees; and
Whereas, the parties have decided to purchase a new and improved benefit package primarily through a larger group plan and to extend the new benefit plan to future retirees; and
Whereas, the parties have agreed to discontinue the Health Benefit Trust as the vehicle for providing supplemental benefits; and
Whereas, the parties recognize that providing an overall improved benefit package to active employees and future retirees is costly and will require some cost sharing.
Therefore, the parties have agreed to the following:
1.	The parties agree that as soon as practicable, but not later than January 1,2001, active employees and future retirees (i.e. those who retire after the date of the implementation of the new plan) shall receive as their health benefit package the NYSHIP plan. The plan offers participants several different choices of health care providers for the contributions set forth herein. In addition, active employees and future retirees will receive the supplemental benefit package applicable to NYC Transit non-represented Level II supervisors active or retired. The supplemental benefit package will be administered through NYC Transit. Current retirees will continue to be provided the GHt and HIP plans in which they currently participate.
2.	The parties agree that the level of benefits and program elements such as copayments and deductibles are established by NYSHIP and the supplemental plan and are not subject to negotiation by the parties. NYC Transit agrees to provide written notice to the Union of any changes to the plans.
3.	Effective the date when the new plans become effective, all contributions to the HBT shall cease, and the Health Benefit Trust will be eliminated. Any surplus monies in the Trust shall revert to NYC Transit taking into consideration expenses and claims incurred but not reported. It is agreed that all outstanding claims under the Trust must be filed on or before March 31,2001.
4.	Future retirees (provided they have a minimum of 10 years in the pension system or a disability retirement is granted) will receive the plan of benefits at no cost to them. Active employees will make the following payments to NYC Transit through payroll deduction to help defer the cost of the new plan for active employees and future
retirees. If an employee has 10 years or more of service with the NYC Transit and dies or a retiree under this plan dies, his/her spouse will continue all benefits under the plan and children (under the age limits of the NYSHIP plan) will continue all benefits until such time as the spouse remarries. Listed below is the cost to active employees
$6 per two week pay period for an individual plan per active employee $23 per two week pay period for a family plan per active employee
5.	If for whatever reason the NYSHIP plan were no longer available to NYC Transit employees, the parties shall meet to negotiate a new plan.
6.	Wage Progression - The wage progression for employees hired or promoted into titles represented by the Union on or after full and final ratification of this agreement shall be as follows. It is understood that for the purpose of this schedule "hired or promoted into a title" shall mean actually reporting and performing the work of the title:
a.
Employees in the titles, MS I (Signals), MS I (Car Equipment), MS I (Power Cable), MS I (Electrical Power), MS I (Power Distribution), MS I {Power Electronics), MS I (Electronic Equipment) and Assistant Train Dispatcher shall receive during the first three years of employment a percentage of the top rate for the title in accordance with the following schedule:
85% starting salary
85% during the second year of service
85% during the third year of service
100% after three years of service
b.	Employees hired oc promoted into all other titles represented by the Union on or after full and final ratification of this contract extension shall receive during the first three years of employment in the title a percentage of the top rate for the title in accordance with the following schedule:
80% starting salary
80% during the second year of service
80% during the third year of service
100% after three years of service
c.	Employees in the bargaining unit shall not experience a decrease in pay if they accept a promotion to another title within the bargaining unit They shall be slotted into the next highest progression in the new title which grants them a salary increase. Thereafter, they will progress through the progression of the new title.
2
7.	The parties agree to work together to ensure a smooth transition from the present plans to the new plan and agree to utilize a mutually agreed upon accounting firm to assist with the orderly elimination of the Health Benefit Trust
8.	* Upon full ratification and approval, the collective bargaining agreement shall be amended to reflect the provisions of this stipulation and agreement”.
