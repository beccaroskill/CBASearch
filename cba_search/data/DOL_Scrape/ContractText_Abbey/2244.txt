HENRY MILLER
Henry Miller was a lineman who worked for Western Union, the railroads and fledgling utility companies throughout the country. In 1886, while working for one of these earty utilities, the St. Louis Municipal Electric Light and Power Company, he first hit upon the idea of forming a union for workers. Over the next several years he formulated and refined various Ideas for organizing the new electri-
cal Industry. However, It wasn't until the SL Louis Exhibition of 1890 that he
was able to put wings to his dream. The exhibition prominently featured electricity as a new energy source with tremendous potential for the future. It brought together electrical workers from various companies all over the country and gave Miller his first opportunity for mass organizing. Finally, on December 4,1891, on the strength of these early organizing efforts, Miller, along with nine other men were granted a charter by the American Federation of Labor and the IBEW was born.
Henry Miller's goals for the Union were to provide death benefits, a safe workplace for all workers, and training or apprenticeships that would insure quality workmanship and Increased productivity. In addition to serving as President of the International union he continued to work In the field organizing new locals wherever he traveled.
In the era In which he lived, being an electrical worker was extremely hazardous. Fully half of the people who did this work died on the job. And, like so many of his brothers, Henry Miller's life was also cut short. On July 10,1896, he suffered a severe electrical shock and fell from a utility pole. The resulting Injuries caused his death at age 38, only live years after he realized his dream of forming a national union. He died doing the job he loved, working to fulfill his dream of a safe workplace.
IBEW Local 266 was founded In 1940, and In 1941 workers of SRP were organized. As we continue our partnership, we honor Henry Miller by designating our personal business time with his name, tn so doing, we recognize his Ideas of promoting workplace safety, striving to be the best workers In the Industry, and taking great pride In the quality and craftsmanship of our work.
IBEW Local Union 266 and Salt River Project have agreed to allow employees to use up to 8 hours of personal business leave In commemoration of Henry Miller.
