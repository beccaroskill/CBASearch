DRUG TESTING PROGRAM
ARTICLE XXII
The Union and the Association, and/or signatory Employer, hereby agree that the Drug and Alcohol Testing Program (“Program”) administered by the Indiana Union Construction Industry Substance Abuse Trust is incorporated by reference herein and made a part of this Agreement. The Trustees of the Program shall have the authority to amend the terms of the Program to which employees working under this Agreement will be subject. The Program will
31
be funded by contribution to the Trust, which will be established by the Trustees of the Program. The Trustees of the Program shall have the authority to determine the amount to be contributed at any rate up to ten ($0.10) cents per hour depending on the Trustees’ assessment of the amount needed to fund the Program adequately to fulfill its purposes. Once the rate has been set, the Trustees may adjust the rate of contribution from time to time within the parameters set forth above, provided the Trustees give the Employer at least sixty (60) days’ notice of any such adjustment. It is agreed that the Employer contribution to this fund is not part of the wage/fringe package under this Agreement, but it is instead a separate additional contribution made by the Employer solely to fund the Program. Accordingly, the establishment or adjustment of the rate of contribution by the Trustees shall not affect the wage rates or the amounts set forth for contributions to fringes benefit funds under this Agreement. No Employee shall show up for or stay on any job when under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Any Employee found under the influence of alcohol or drugs shall be sent home immediately, without pay. This shall be considered just cause for termination. The Steward shall be notified immediately of this action.
ARTICLE XXIII
Employees covered by this Agreement shall work for only recognized and qualified Employers who supply all materials and labor and who shall carry reliable compensation and liability insurance on their employees, and further shall conform to all municipal and state regulations pertaining to health and safety regulations.
Employees shall not be required to accept work from any individual or Employer who has not abided by the provisions of this Agreement.
The Union agrees not to enter into any agreement with any individual Employer or group of Employers competing in the same type of work which provides for the employee it represents to receive less favorable wages, hours and conditions other than are herein specified without extending the same less favorable wages, hours and conditions to the Employers who are parties to this Agreement.
ARBITRATION
ARTICLE XXIV
Section 1:
A joint Arbitration Board shall be created for promoting harmony, resolving differences as to interpretation or application of this Agreement, or averting disputes and recommending means of settlements or such other problems as may arise.
Section 2:
In the event that a dispute cannot be justified within four (4) working days by the Steward and/or the Business Representative and the Employer’s Representative and/or the Employer, the same shall be referred to a Board of Arbitration. Said Board shall be made up of three (3)
32
representatives of the Employer and three (3) representatives designated by the Union. This Board shall convene not later than ten (10) working days after the dispute has been referred to it.
Section 3:
In the event that the Arbitration Board is unable by majority vote to agree, they shall submit the dispute to an impartial arbitrator chosen by the Board.

Section 5:
All disputes between the parties regarding the interpretation or performance of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, shall be submitted to arbitration in the manner provided herein, except such disputed complaints or grievances as arise out of failure or refusal of the Employer to comply with the provisions of the Recognition and Union Clauses contained in Article II and Article XIV or the failure or refusal of the Employer to pay wage rates as provided for in Article V or any other Article of this Agreement, or fails to pay fringe benefits provided for in this Agreement.
Section 6:
There shall be no strikes or lockouts pending the deliberation and decisions of the Joint Arbitration Board.
JURISDICTION	ARTICLE XXV
The Employer agrees to recognize the Jurisdictional Claims of the Union that have been established by agreement with other crafts as a result of decisions by the National Relations Management Board.
The jurisdiction of work referred to in this Article shall not make it mandatory for the Employer to accept the claims of jurisdiction as being binding upon him. The Employer does not waive any of his rights by permitting the inclusion of the jurisdiction of work in this Agreement.
ARTICLE XXVI
It is stipulated and agreed by and between the parties to this Agreement that the act of the Operative Plasterers and Cement Masons International Association, hereinafter called the International Association, in approving this contract as to form and substance, the International Association, its Officers and Agents, shall not in any manner thereby become a part to this Agreement, nor is there any duty, liability or obligation imposed upon the terms and conditions of this contract in any manner whatsoever.
33
It is further stipulated and agreed that the approval by the International Association as to form and substance is only for the purpose of indicating that the International Association certifies that the said contract is not in violation of the International Constitution and By-Laws and is approved as to form and substance for that purpose only and no other.
WAGE AND/OR PRICE CONTROL CONTINGENCY ARTICLE XXVII
The Contractor and the Union hereby agree that should wage and/or price controls be implemented by the federal or state government or Presidential Executive Order, in whatever form, both parties will abide by the decision as rendered by that government body or Presidential Decree.
