7.2	The normal work hours and work week of patrol officers shall remain within the discretion of the Employer to establish.

patrol officers will be required to work any hours into scheduled days off if the schedule is based on five consecutive eight-hour workdays. No patrol officers will have their schedule changed on less than 24 hours notice, except in cases of manpower shortage due to illnesses or vacation, cases of emergency, or when required to finish an assigned task begun on a previous shift. Additionally, the 24-hour notice provision will apply to patrol officers who request a change in scheduled days off.
7.5	Pay rules promulgated by the Department of Justice and approved by the Department of Administration shall be in effect for all members of the bargaining unit.
7.6	The Division shall pay overtime compensation as follows:
Highway Patrol Officers are in a position for which hours of duty cannot be controlled administratively and which requires a certain amount of irregular, scheduled and unscheduled overtime duty, with the Patrol Officer generally being responsible for recognizing circumstances which require them to remain on duty or be called back to duty during a work day or work week, however, it will be the Highway Patrol officer's responsibility to notify a supervisor, when any overtime is expected to extend beyond two hours. If no supervisor is available, notification of the dispatcher will satisfy this notification requirement. Highway Patrol Officers shall receive overtime compensation for this duty.
1.	Basis for determining periods of work for which overtime compensation is authorized.
a.	An uncontrollable job situation which is required in the normal performance of duty that requires the Patrol Officer to remain on duty or be called back to duty.
b.	The Patrol Officer must remain on duty or be called back to duty not merely because it is desirable, but because of compelling reasons inherently related to continuation of duty and of such a nature that failure to carry out such duty would constitute negligence.
c.	Such remaining on duty, call out, or assignment must be validated by the Patrol Officer's immediate supervisor before such time can be claimed for the purpose of overtime compensation. The immediate supervisor shall notify the employee immediately if any overtime is not validated.
2.	Rates of overtime compensation.
a.	Employees shall be paid at the rate of one and one half times their regular rate of pay for all authorized time they work in excess of the regular scheduled shift as designated by management or over 160 hours per 28-day work period. Authorized holiday leave, sick leave, annual leave or compensatory time off
036 MPEA	Department of Justice Highway Patrol Officers	2005-2007
7
shall constitute time worked when computing overtime or compensatory time credits under this article.
b.	Upon mutual agreement between the officer and the Employer, compensatory time at one and one-half hours for each hour worked may be substituted for overtime pay in this Section.
3.	It is understood that the Division has a limited amount of money to spend for overtime purposes per fiscal year, and that the money in this fund will only be spent for overtime purposes. Should this money be spent prior to the end of the fiscal year for which it was allocated, it is agreed that the employees will continue to perform all duties of their jobs as required, including necessary overtime. It is further understood that overtime earned after the fund is exhausted in any fiscal year will not be paid by the Division or absorbed by funds from other programs.
4.	Upon exhaustion of the monies available for overtime, compensatory time shall be granted at the rate of one and one-half hours for each hour worked in excess of the regular scheduled shift as designated by management or over 160 hours during the officer's 28-day work period.
7.7	Compensation for mandatory education and training sessions ordered by the Division shall be in accordance with policy P-14, Training Hours in the MHP, Regulations, Policies and Procedures Manual.
Compensation for voluntary education and training sessions shall be uniform for all Patrol Officers, but shall be subject to requirements posted at the time of application.
7.8	It is understood the job requires officers to respond to calls outside scheduled work hours consistent with the officer position description and Highway Patrol General Regulations. A call out of an officer while the officer is in “off-duty” status shall be paid for a minimum of three hours at one and one-half time. No more than one three-hour claim in a 24-hour period will be accepted unless prompted by distinct and separate events and the original three-hour paid time has elapsed.
“Court time” is not considered a call-out for purposes of the three-hour minimum unless 24 hour notice was not provided to an officer. Officers who have been provided more than 24 hours notice will be paid a two-hour minimum at one and one-half times their regular rate of pay if required to report for “court time” while on “off-duty status.”

9.1	Seniority means an employee's length of continuous service, as a Highway Patrol Officer, with the Highway Patrol Division since his/her last date of hire.
When more than one patrol officer is hired on the same date, seniority shall be determined by graduation order from patrol school.
9.2	Seniority shall be computed from the date the patrol officer began regular uninterrupted service, as a Highway Patrol Officer, within the Division:
1.	To be absent from the job due to layoffs will be considered lost time for the purpose of longevity and seniority, however, previous employment shall count toward seniority and longevity.
2.	To be absent from the job due to an approved leave of absence without pay that exceeds 30 calendar days, excepting leave for active military duty or authorized leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act or the Montana Maternity Leave Act, will be considered lost time for the purposes of longevity and seniority; however, previous service upon reemployment shall count toward seniority and longevity.
3.	If an employee terminates state service due to being drafted into the military, and returns to state service within 90 days following separation from the military, he/she will receive credit toward longevity for both the state service prior to entering the military and for time in the military. Military service of more than five years will not be counted for computing longevity. After completion of military service, the Employer shall rehire such patrol officers at the same or a similar position.
4.	A patrol officer's continuous service for purposes of longevity and seniority shall be broken by voluntary resignation, including voluntary military service, discharge and retirement.

11
2005-2007
5.	Time spent in a job with the Division outside the bargaining unit shall be considered lost time for purposes of seniority, however, upon an employee’s return to the bargaining unit, previous time spent in the bargaining unit shall count toward the employee’s seniority.
9.3	Layoffs caused by reduction in force shall be in order of seniority within the bargaining unit; that is, the patrol officer last hired shall be the first released. Permanent and probationary patrol officers who are scheduled to be released shall be given at least 10 working days notice. All recalls to employment shall likewise be in order of seniority within the bargaining unit; that is, the last patrol officer released as a result of a reduction in force shall be the first rehired when the Employer needs additional patrol officers. The Employer shall notify such patrol officers who meet the minimum qualifications in Section 44-1-401. M.C.A., to return to work; and if the patrol officers fail to notify the Employer within 10 calendar days of his/her intention to return to work, or does not meet the qualifications provided in Section 44-1-402, M.C.A., the patrol officer shall be considered as having forfeited his/her right to reemployment.
1.	No permanent patrol officer shall be laid off while there are probationary patrol officers serving in the bargaining unit.
2.	After a general layoff, any patrol officer whose position is to be abolished and who has more seniority than a patrol officer of equal rank, may replace that patrol officer provided he/she meets the minimum occupational qualifications referred to in 9.3. Such transfer shall be considered a voluntary transfer for the purposes of Article 17.
If the Employer determines that it is necessary to reduce the hours of officers or initiate a layoff, the Employer agrees to meet and confer with the Association prior to implementing the reduction in hours of layoff. The seven district chairmen shall be allowed to "patrol" to and from the meeting, which shall be held during work time. No other expenses shall be borne by the Employer.
9.4	Longevity means a patrol officer's length of continuous service with the Employer, irrespective of classification and/or assignment.
9.5	Longevity shall be counted from the date a patrol officer joined the service of the Employer. Longevity raises shall be computed from a patrol officer's anniversary date as provided by the State Personnel Classification and Pay Plan.

ARTICLE 10.
UNIFORMS AND EQUIPMENT
10.1	The Employer shall furnish all patrol officers with uniforms and equipment necessary for the performance of their respective duties, with the approval of the captain of their respective districts, provided that any such equipment and uniforms shall remain the property of the State of Montana, and provided that the Employer shall have authority to destroy, sell, or dispose of any and all obsolete equipment or uniforms in whatever manner it deems appropriate.
10.2	Uniforms and equipment furnished all patrol officers as stated above will be replaced at no charge to the patrol officer unless lost or destroyed through the carelessness or neglect of such employee. The Employer shall take all precautions necessary to insure all uniforms are properly fitted to each individual patrol officer at the time of delivery. For the purpose of this Article, equipment does not include vehicles.
10.3	Montana Highway Patrol Officers covered by this agreement are eligible for the statutory meal allowance (per diem) provided in 2-18-501 MCA when traveling within the state of Montana. Officers must also meet the eligibility requirements provided in 2-18-502 MCA regarding travel time, including being in a travel status for more than three continuous hours during specific time periods in order to claim the allowed meal allowances. Meal allowances and time periods include:
Morning meal	$5.00 -	between the hours of 12:01	a.m. and 10:00 a.m.
Midday meal	$6.00 -	between the hours of 10:01	a.m. and 3:00 p.m.
Evening meal	$12.00 -	between the hours of 3:01 p.m. and 12 midnight
State employee travel rules (Chapter 1-0300, MOM V. I,	Employee Travel) have
been written to reflect the type of travel circumstances most office-based state employees encounter. Application of these rules to Highway Patrol Officer duties and work situations is difficult. Due to the unique nature and type of duties Highway Patrol Officers perform, including being at their work station when they enter their patrol cars, and working or performing job duties while in a travel status, Highway Patrol Officers will be deemed in a travel status when the officer, during a work shift, is away from the officer’s home for more than three consecutive hours in one of the time periods specified above. In addition, an officer’s home shall be deemed to mean headquarters for per diem purposes.
Highway Patrol Officers who are called out or work overtime will be eligible for additional meal allowances, as established in statute, if they begin work more than one hour before or terminate work more than one hour after their normally assigned work shift. Officers who travel on overnight assignments, away from their duty stations, will be eligible for meals and lodging as provided in statute.

11.3	Whenever a patrol officer's scheduled day off falls on a recognized holiday, the Employer shall allow the patrol officer to take a day off at another date as holiday leave to equalize the recognized legal holiday. Should any holiday not be used due to scheduling or other reasons, then that patrol officer shall be allowed to accrue holiday leave, provided that all such days shall be taken in the calendar year in which accrued. If necessary, an officer may carry up to maximum of 60 hours of holiday leave over until June 30th.
