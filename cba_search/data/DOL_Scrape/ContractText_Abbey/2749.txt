If UAPD elects to protest, the State shall meet and confer with UAPD in an effort to reach agreement on the unit assignment for the class. If the parties are unable to reach agreement, the dispute shall be submitted to the PERB for resolution. If UAPD does not protest the unit assignment within the 30-day notice period, the unit assignment of the new class shall be deemed agreeable to the parties and PERB shall be so advised.
B.	The State agrees to notify UAPD of classification proposals that impact employees in Unit 16 prior to their submission to the State Personnel Board.

C.	State employees in Unit 16 are excluded from the FLSA and Unit 16 employees are assigned to work week group “SE” and are salaried, not hourly, workers. Consistent with the professional status of these employees, they are accountable for their work product, and for meeting the objectives of the agency for which they work.
Following is the State's policy for all Unit 16 employees in work week group “SE”:

6.	Unit 16 employees shall not be charged paid leave nor docked for absences in less than whole-day increments. Less than full time employees shall be charged time proportionate to their scheduled hours of work.

physician or physicians designated by the Director of the Employment Development Department for the purpose of evaluating the capacity of the employee to perform the work of his or her position.
H.	If an employee refuses to return to work in a position offered by the employer under the State's Injured State Worker Assistance Program, ENDI benefits will be terminated effective the date of the offer.

An employee will be eligible for ENDI payments on the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of 960 hours of compensated work.
J.	All other applicable Department of Personnel Administration laws and regulations not superseded by these provisions will remain in effect.
K.	Upon approval of ENDI benefits, the State may issue an employee a salary advance if the employee so requests.

For periods of disability commencing on or after October 1, 1984, eligible employees shall receive NDI payments at 60% of their full pay, not to exceed $135 per week, payable monthly for a period not exceeding 26 weeks for any one disability benefit period. An employee is not eligible for a second disability benefit due to the same or related cause or condition unless they have returned to their regular time base, and work for at least ten (10) consecutive work days. Paid leave shall not be used to cover the ten (10) work days.

The definition of hospital and nursing home is the same as defined by Sections 2627.5 and 2627.7 of the Unemployment Insurance Code.
D.	If the employee elects to use vacation, annual leave, personal leave or sick leave credits prior to receiving NDI payments, he or she is not required to exhaust the accrued leave balance.

This does not qualify the employee for a new disability period under B, of this article. The appointing power may require an employee to submit to a medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the Director of the Employment Development Department for the purpose of evaluating the capacity of the employee to perform the work his or her position.
G.	If an employee refuses to return to work in a position offered by the employer under the State’s Injured State Worker Assistance Program, NDI benefits will be terminated effective the date of the offer.

10.6	Classification
As used in this article, terms are defined as follows:
a.	“Salary range” is the range of rates between, and including, the minimum and maximum rate currently authorized for the class;
b.	“Step” for employees compensated on a monthly basis is a 5 percent differential above or below a salary rate rounded to the nearest dollar and for employees compensated on a daily or hourly basis is a 5 percent differential above or below a rate rounded to the nearest dollar and cents amount. One step higher is calculated by multiplying the rate by 1.05 (e.g., $2,300 x 1.05= $2,415). One step lower is calculated by dividing the rate by 1.05 (e.g., $2,415 /1.05= $2,300);
c.	“Rate” for employees compensated on a monthly basis is any one of the full dollar amounts found within the salary range and for employees compensated on a daily or hourly basis is any one of the dollar and cents amounts found within the salary range.
d.	“Range differential” is the difference between the maximum rate of two salary ranges;
e.	“Substantially the same salary range “ is a salary range with the maximum salary rate less than two steps higher than or the same as the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
f.	“Higher salary range” is a salary range with the maximum salary rate at least two steps higher than the maximum salary rate of another salary range;
g.	“Lower salary range” is a salary range with the maximum salary rate any amount less than the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
Unless otherwise provided, the lowest salary range currently authorized for the class is used to make salary comparisons between classes except for deep classes. Any rate falling within the salary range for a class may be used to accomplish appropriate step differentials in movement between classes and salary ranges.

71
BU 16
03-06
F.	REDUCING THE ADVERSE AFFECTS OF LAYOFF. Whenever the State determines it necessary to layoff employees, the State and the Union shall meet in good faith to explore alternatives to laying off employees such as, but not limited to, voluntary reduced work time, retraining, early retirement, and unpaid leaves of absence.

16.3	Medical Staff/Hospital Management Committees
To facilitate communications and to provide quality client/patient care, hospital management shall, upon written request, meet on a quarterly basis with representatives of the organized medical staff to discuss clinical issues and problems which would result in increasing quality medical care.

One UAPD steward and one departmental labor relations officer may attend the meetings of the committees. The State will record and distribute minutes of these meetings. By mutual agreement there can be departmental level meetings between the parties on these items. Participants shall attend without loss of compensation.

16.5	Legislation
The Union will endeavor to notify the Department of Personnel Administration, and the Department of Personnel Administration will endeavor to notify the Union, on any legislation it sponsors which, to its knowledge, has an effect on the Unit 16 collective bargaining agreement.
16.6	Contracting Out
A.	Purpose
The union has presented evidence that the State departments are presently contracting out work appropriately done by Unit 16 employees, and that said contracting results in unnecessary additional costs to the State. Thus, the purpose of this section is to guarantee that the State does not incur unnecessary, additional costs by contracting out work appropriately performed at less expense to the State by Unit 16 employees, consistent with the terms of this section. In achieving this purpose the parties do not intend this section to expand the State’s ability to contract out for personal services. The parties agree that this section shall not be interpreted or applied in a manner which results in a disruption of services provided by state departments.
B.	Policy Regarding Personal Services Contracts and Cost Savings
Except in extremely unusual or urgent, time-limited circumstances, or under other circumstances where contracting out is recognized or required by law, Federal mandate, or court decisions/orders, the State must make every effort to hire, utilize and retain Unit 16 employees before resorting to the use of private contractors. Contracting may also occur for reasons other than cost savings as recognized or required by law, Federal mandate, or court decisions/orders.
C.	Information Regarding Contracts to Be Let
1.	Departments will provide UAPD’s designated representative with copies of Request for Proposals (RFPs) and Invitations for Bid (IFBs) for personal services contracts when released for publication if they call for services found in Unit 16 class specifications.
2.	To the extent that a department is preparing to enter into a contract (or amend a contract) and it does not require an RFP or IFB, the department shall provide UAPD’s designated representative with a copy of the Standard Form 215 (or its departmental equivalent) if and when the Form 215 is completed (but no less
74
BU 16
03-06
than five (5) calendar days thereafter) provided the contract is or will be for services found in Unit 16 class specifications. If the Form 215 contains confidential or proprietary information, it shall be redacted as discussed below in subsection D(2).
3.	The purpose of this subsection (C) is to provide UAPD with notice and an opportunity to present alternatives which mitigate or avoid the need for contracting out, while still satisfying the needs of the State to provide services. Directors (or their designee) shall therefore meet with UAPD for this purpose, if requested by UAPD.
D.	Labor/Management Committee to Review Personal Service Contracts In Existence
1.	A State Joint labor/management committee shall be established. It shall consist of representatives of UAPD, the Department of Personnel Administration, the Department of Finance and affected departments. The first meeting of this committee shall occur no later than 10 working days from ratification of the MOU, and shall be for purposes of determining the procedures by which the committee will operate. An initial review of all currently existing contracts as requested by the committee shall be completed within six (6) months from ratification of this agreement. However, if this deadline cannot be met due to the number or complexity of existing contracts for review, the committee may mutually agree to extend this deadline.
2.	Upon request of the committee (or either party on the committee) each department shall submit copies of any or all personal services contracts that call for services found in Unit 16 class specifications. For each contract, departments shall provide additional documents establishing the number, scope, duration, justification, total costs of all such contracts, and payment of all overhead and administrative costs paid through each contract, provided it does not disclose confidential or proprietary information, in which case it shall be redacted as discussed below. The requested contract and related information shall be provided as soon as reasonably possible. The parties expect that this shall be provided no more than 21 calendar days following the request by the joint labor/management committee, or longer if approved by the committee. This shall include contracts that may otherwise be protected from public disclosure, if they provide for services found in Unit 16 class specifications. However, the State may redact those portions of protected contract(s) that are proprietary, necessary to protect the competitive nature of the bid process, and that which does not pertain to the costing of personnel services found in Unit 16 classes. The goal shall be to protect against disclosure of information which should remain confidential, while at the same time providing the committee with sufficient information to determine whether unnecessary, additional costs are being incurred by contracting out work found in Unit 16 class specifications. Costing information provided to the committee for protected contracts shall include total personnel costs for personnel services found in Unit 16 classifications plus any overhead charges paid to the contractor for these services, provided such disclosure does not breach confidentiality requirements or include proprietary information.
3.	Within 10 workdays after receipt of the personal service contracts and associated documents as provided for in paragraph D(2) above, the committee shall begin reviewing the contracts. The committee shall examine the contracts based on
75
BU 16
03-06
the purpose of this section, the terms of the contracts, all applicable laws, Federal mandates and court decisions/orders. In this regards, the committee will consider which contracts should and can be terminated immediately, which contracts will take additional time to terminate, which contracts may continue (for how long and under what conditions) and how (if necessary and cost effective) to transition contract employees or positions into civil service. All determinations shall be through express mutual agreement of the committee. Committee determinations regarding contracts let by the Department of Corrections shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in subsection F below.
4.	The committee will continue to meet as necessary to examine personal services contracts which have been let.
5.	If savings are generated by the termination of personal service contracts under this provision, it is the intent of the State to implement findings of the committee for utilization of said savings. Such findings may include:
a.	Contributing toward position reductions which would otherwise be accomplished by the layoff, salary reduction or displacement of Unit 16 employees;
b.	Enabling the employment of Unit 16 employees for services currently performed by contractors;
c.	Enabling of the conversion to Unit 16 civil service employment of qualified contract employees who wish to become State employees, as otherwise permitted by law, regulations, provisions of the contracts and resolutions by the State Personnel Board.
d.	Providing timely, adequate and necessary recruitment efforts. These efforts may include focused recruitment, publicizing in professional journals, use of the media, job fairs, expedited hiring, expedited background checks, spot testing authorized by the SPB, State employee registries, and recruitment and retention incentives.
e.	Such other purposes as may be mutually agreed upon by the joint labor/management committee.
E.	Displacement Avoidance
1.	The objective of this subsection is to ensure that Unit 16 employees have preference over contract employees consistent with, but not limited to the following principles.
a.	The duties at issue are consistent with the Unit 16 employee’s classification;
b.	The Unit 16 employee is qualified to perform the job, and;
c.	There is no disruption in services.
2.	To avoid or mitigate Unit 16 employee displacement for lack of work, the appointing power shall review all existing personal services contracts to determine if work consistent with the affected employee’s classification is being performed by a contractor. Displacement includes layoff, involuntary demotion, involuntary transfer to a new class, involuntary transfer to a new location requiring a change of residence, and time based reductions. If the joint labor/management committee that reviews personal services contracts
76
BU 16
03-06
determines that the terms and purpose of the contract permit the State to assign the work to a Unit 16 employee who would otherwise be displaced, this shall be implemented consistent with the other terms of this section. The State and UAPD shall meet and confer for purposes of entering into an agreement about the means by which qualified employees are notified and provided with such assignments. This shall include developing a process that ensures that savings realized by terminating the contract and reassigning the work to a Unit 16 employee to avoid displacement, are utilized to offset that employee’s moving and relocation costs, the amount of which shall be consistent with Section 10.3 of the parties’ collective bargaining agreement.
F.	Department of Corrections
1.	This section shall not be applicable to the Department of Corrections until such time as it has been approved by the Federal court special master(s). Nothing in this section shall be interpreted or applied in such a manner as to interfere with Federal court orders, the authority of the Federal court or the authority of the special masters.
2.	The Department of Corrections shall present this section to the special master(s) immediately in writing upon ratification of this agreement. The parties agree to make themselves immediately in writing upon ratification of this agreement. The parties agree to make themselves immediately available to meet with the special master, on a schedule determined by the special master.
3.	No contract for services by the Department of Corrections shall be prohibited, modified, restricted or terminated by virtue of this memorandum of understanding or by operation of the joint labor management committee established by this memorandum of understanding without approval of the Special Masters in Madrid v. Alameida et al (as it pertains to contracts effecting Pelican Bay State Prison), and/or the Special Master in the Coleman litigation (as it pertains to contracts affecting Coleman class members), and/or counsel for the parties in the Plata litigation or the Plata court (as it pertains to contracts affecting medical care for Plata class members).
4.	If this section is not approved by the special master the parties agree to reopen negotiations for the purpose of agreeing on an alternative contracting out provision, with the goal of satisfying the concerns of the Federal court and UAPD.
G.	Relationship Between This Section and Related Statutes
The State is mindful of the constitutional and statutory obligations (e.g. Govt. Code § 19130) as it pertains to restriction on contracting out. Thus, nothing in this section is intended to interfere with pursuit of remedies for violation of these obligations as provided by law (e.g. Public Contract Code § 10337).

•	MC full-time Equivalent availability in the Branch falls below 75% of the allocation.
•	Workload exceeds 125% of expected workload in a given month (based on federal projected workload estimates for DAPD prorated to the Branch level).
95
BU 16

•	Persistent backlog, despite appropriate actions, as determined by the following formula: Number of closures plus number of backlogged cases for four weeks, exceeds the number of MC Full Time Equivalents times 90 times 125% for four weeks.
4.	The trigger can be limited to either Medical Consultant I, or Medical Consultant I (Psychiatrist), if conditions warrant.
5.	The pay per case above baseline when the bonus plan is invoked is $27.00.
6.	For mixed impairment cases that required both a physical MC and psychiatrist or pediatrician MC review, each MC who signs the case will receive full case credit.
7.	MC participation in the bonus plan will be voluntary.
8.	Use of the Plan is contingent on availability of funding for this purpose.
9.	MCs are expected to maintain program requirements with regard to accuracy of case adjudication.
10.	Permanent Part-Time MCs may participate in the Bonus Plan. The baseline productivity level will be prorated consistent with the Part-Time MC’s time base.

Sideletter 5 - Employee Retirement Contribution Reduction
Employee Retirement Contribution Reduction for Miscellaneous Members
If the Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) informs the parties in writing that it has determined that the recent temporary arrangement whereby state employees were relieved of paying into their retirement fund may be extended for 12 months and that such an extension would be fiduciarly sound and meet the Board’s established actuarial standards, which in turn provides temporary cash flow relief to the State, the parties will agree to the following:
1.	Effective the first of the pay period following approval by the CalPERS Board and ratification of the legislature and continuing for 12 monthly pay periods thereafter, the State agrees to the following:
• Employees who are Miscellaneous/Industrial members under the Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), shall have their employee retirement contribution rate reduced from 5.0% of monthly compensation in excess of five hundred and thirteen ($513) dollars each month to 0.0% of compensation in excess of five hundred and thirteen ($513) dollars each month.
2.	After 12 months, the employee’s retirement contribution rate shall be restored to levels in effect on August 30, 2001.
3.	The State employer will continue to ensure that pension benefits are properly funded in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices. In accordance with the provisions of the June 20, 2001 communication to DPA from CalPERS’ Actuarial & Employer Services Division, effective the date referenced in paragraph 1 above, the State Employer’s CalPERS retirement contribution rate shall incorporate the impact resulting from the temporary reduction in the employee retirement contribution rate. As indicated in the above referenced letter, “10% of the net unamortized actuarial loss shall be amortized each year.” However, if the CalPERS Board of Administration alters the amortization scheduled referenced above in the manner that accelerates the employer payment obligation, either party to this agreement may declare this section of the Contract and all obligations set forth herein, to be null and void. In the event this Contract becomes null and void, the employee retirement contribution rate shall be restored to levels in effect on August 30, 2001 and the parties shall be obligated to immediately meet and confer in good faith to discuss alternative provisions.
Employee Retirement Contribution Reduction for Safety Members
If the Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) informs the parties in writing that it has determined that the recent temporary arrangement whereby state employees were relieved of paying into their retirement fund may be extended for 12 months and that such an extension would be fiduciarily sound and meet the Board’s established actuarial standards, which in turn provides temporary cash flow relief to the State, the parties will agree to the following:
1.	Effective the first of the pay period following approval by the CalPERS Board and ratification of the legislature and continuing for 12 monthly pay periods thereafter, the State agrees to the following:
• Employees who are Safety members under the Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) shall have their employee retirement contribution rate
98
BU 16
03-06
reduced from 6.0% of monthly compensation in excess of three hundred and seventeen ($317) dollars each month to 1.0% of compensation in excess of three hundred and seventeen ($317) dollars each month.
2.	After 12 months, the employee’s retirement contribution rate shall be restored to levels in effect on August 30, 2001.
3.	The State employer will continue to ensure that pension benefits are properly funded in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices. In accordance with the provisions of the June 20, 2001 communication to DPA from CalPERS’ Actuarial & Employer Services Division, effective the date referenced in paragraph 1 above, the State Employer’s CalPERS retirement contribution rate shall incorporate the impact resulting from the temporary reduction in the employee retirement contribution rate. As indicated in the above referenced letter, “10% of the net unamortized actuarial loss shall be amortized each year.” However, if the CalPERS Board of Administration alters the amortization scheduled referenced above in the manner that accelerates the employer payment obligation, either party to this agreement may declare this section of the Contract and all obligations set forth herein, to be null and void. In the event this Contract becomes null and void, the employee retirement contribution rate shall be restored to levels in effect on August 30, 2001 and the parties shall be obligated to immediately meet and confer in good faith to discuss alternative provisions.
Sideletter 6 - Monthly Recruitment and Retention Differential to be Added to Base Pay
Upon ratification of the entire Agreement, the Department of Personnel Administration and UAPD will meet to review monthly R&R’s of Unit 16 employees to determine in which classifications monthly R&R’s, or portion thereof, may be added to the base salary. The resulting salary adjustment(s) will be effective July 1, 2004. It is understood by the parties that any salary adjustment must result in the same base salary for each position in a given classification.
Sideletter 7 - Mitigation
Section 4.10 of the Budget Act recognizes that the Budget Bill approved by the Senate does not provide funds for employee compensation increases that may become effective during the 2003-04 fiscal year, and grants the Director of Finance authority to reduce and reallocate appropriations in the Budget Act in order to ensure the integrity of the 2003 Budget.
The savings achieved in employee compensation for fiscal year (FY) 03/04 that have been agreed to by the parties shall first be applied to mitigate layoffs during FY 03/04 for Bargaining Unit 16, consistent with the provisions of Section 4.10 of the Budget Act of 2003.
In applying these savings, the following principles will govern: (a) it is understood that these savings will not be applied to any program reductions beyond the requirements of Section 4.10 of the Budget Act and (b) the union understands that this provision does not obligate the employer to retain any position that is not supported by the work to be done or the organization structure of the affected State agency.

2.	The State and UAPD, as the exclusive representative for Bargaining Unit 16 shall meet and confer over the method of improving the salary and benefits or other forms of compensation, but to the extent no agreement is reached, the improved compensation shall be provided by increasing the employer contribution for Bargaining Unit 16 members’ medical benefits.

If State Bargaining Units 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20 or 21 receive an economic package beyond that provided to Bargaining Unit 16 by virtue of entering into new agreements (those that replace the 2001-03 MOUs), then UAPD, as the exclusive representative for Bargaining Unit 16 may reopen related economic provisions of its MOU and meet and confer in good faith with the State over similar or equivalent increases to be provided to BU 16 members.
C.	The terms of this article shall only apply to immediate successor agreements of the bargaining units listed in (B) above.
Sideletter 9 - Dependent Care
The State and the Union recognize the importance of dealing with Work and Family issues.

ATTACHMENT B - Goldsmith Letter
June 23, 1983
Cesar Bacal
Union of American Physicians & Dentists
1730 Franklin Street, Suite 200
Oakland, CA 94612
Dear Mr. Bacal:
In response to your recent inquiry with respect to the manner in which professional negligence actions involving medical personnel are handled by this office, set forth below is a summary of our basic policies as they relate to physician input.
At the outset, it should be noted that in the vast majority of cases, the individual physician is a party (along with the State) in the lawsuit. In all such cases, the physician has been personally served with the complaint and has expressly requested legal representation by the Office of the Attorney General. We thus have an attorney-client relationship with the physician defendant.
With respect to settlements of such cases, it is our policy to consult with and fully apprise the individual physician defendant of both the terms of any proposed settlement and the ramifications to the physician, e.g., reporting requirements to BMQA, etc. This is, of course, done prior to the culmination of any settlement.
It should also be emphasized, moreover, that pursuant to the terms of the California Tort Claims Act, the State is required to pay any damage award for medical malpractice and thus, the individual physician has no personal liability exposure (absent a prayer for punitive damages).
With respect to those cases in which there is no individual physician named as a defendant, i.e., where the State itself is the only defendant, there is substantially less direct consultation with the physicians who may have been involved in the incident. In these latter type of cases, while physicians may be witnesses in the proceeding, they are not parties and therefore are not involved in the settlement procedure per se.
We do, of course, fully consult with our State agency clients, including their supervisory medical staff, in all such cases and we expect that they receive direct input from their staff physicians in evaluating settlement offers.
Please feel free to contact this office if additional information is requested.
Very truly yours,
MARVIN GOLDSMITH
Assistant Attorney General

ATTACHMENT B-1 - Clarification of Goldsmith Letter
Subject: Clarification of Goldsmith letter of June 23, 1983 regarding defense of physician defendants where punitive damages are part of the prayer for relief.
1.	When a doctor is named as a party to a lawsuit; as a result of any action or omission occurring in the performance of their duties and within the scope of employment, the doctor may request legal representation by the 1. Office of the Attorney General. In all such cases where representation takes place the Attorney General has an attorney-client relationship with the doctor defendant.
2.	If there is a prayer for punitive damages, the doctor involved has the option of hiring private counsel to defend said doctor on the punitive damage aspect of the case. In the event that the doctor does not wish to hire private counsel, the Attorney General will defend said doctor on all issues involved in the case including the prayer for punitive damages. As regards representation, the Office of the Attorney General will vigorously conduct such representation toward defeating all claim including the prayer for punitive damages.
3.	Under the California's Tort Liability Law, the State of California is obligated to pay any judgment against said doctors for compensatory or general damages but is not required to indemnify them for any award of punitive damages. According to Section 3294 of the Civil Code, in order to be awarded punitive damages, the plaintiff must prove that the doctor was guilty of either express or implied malice or oppression.
4.	In the event of a judgment for punitive damages, a doctor defendant has the right to file a claim with the State Board of Control seeking indemnification from the State of California for any such liability.
5.	Prior to the culmination of any settlement, the attorney representing the individual physician defendant will consult with and freely appraise the doctor defendant of both the terms of any proposed settlement and the ramification to the doctor.
6.	This attachment is not grievable or arbitrable.
