Section 2	Bargaining Representatives
A.	Union's Recognition of Collective Bargaining Representative of Employer.
The Union hereby recognizes and acknowledges that the Collective Bargaining Representative of Employer includes in its membership a majority of the Individual Employers in the highway, general building and heavy construction industry, and said Individual Employers are performing the greater percentage of work therein. By reason of such facts the Union hereby recognizes that the Collective Bargaining Representative of the Employer, as herein-above referred to, is the collective bargaining representative for all Individual Employers who authorize the Employer to represent them with respect to Collective Bargaining with the Northern California District Council of Laborers. A list of said Individual Employers shall be furnished to the Union at the commencement of negotiations and the Employer shall furnish the Union with a complete monthly report of any additions and deletions to the list of Individual Employers represented by the Employer.
In the event the Union (District Council) enters into any other agreement with other employers or employer associations concerning the type of work covered hereby in the area which shall have terms more favorable to such employers or employer associations and the members thereof than this Agreement, then such more favorable provisions shall become a part of and apply to this Agreement only in the geographical area where such other agreement is in effect.
The Union has requested recognition as the Section 9(a) representative of the employees performing Laborers’ work covered by this Agreement and has demonstrated or offered to demonstrate through authorization cards that it has the support of the majority of these employees. The Employer and each Individual Employer expressly acknowledge that they and each of them have satisfied themselves that the Union and/or each of its local affiliates represents a majority of the employees employed to perform Laborers’ work and agrees that the Union and/or each of its constituent Locals is the collective bargaining representative of such employees. The Employer on behalf of itself and each of its members and each Individual Employer specifically agrees that it and they are establishing or have established a collective bargaining relationship by this agreement within the meaning of Section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act of 1947, as amended. The Union is recognized as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for itself, the Northern California District Council of Laborers and all of its affiliated Local Unions.
Any dispute concerning this Section shall be resolved by a mutually agreed upon neutral Arbitrator, either during the term of this Agreement or anytime thereafter, whenever the issue is raised by either party. The Employer, on behalf of itself and each of its members and each Individual Employer, specifically agrees that the neutral Arbitrator may order (as the Arbitrator deems appropriate) the parties to bargain in good faith for any period following a written notice of termination of the Agreement unless and until a lawful impasse occurs or until a successor Agreement is negotiated.
B.	Employers' Recognition of Union as Collective Bargaining Representative of Employees.

There shall be no formal organized rest periods during working hours and as far as practicable the break will be taken as near to the middle of each four (4) hour work segment as possible. Rest periods shall be scheduled in a manner so as not to interfere with workflow or continuous operations and Individual Employers shall be able to coordinate the timing of each ten (10) minute rest break with their Employees to assure the continuity of work. Employees shall be required to remain in their respective work area, or to take their rest period in a specific area designated by the Individual Employer. The second rest period may be added to the end of the meal period or workday when working conditions so dictate as determined by the Individual Employer. Employees who work more than ten (10) hours shall be authorized and permitted three ten (10) minute rest periods.
It is understood that the Employee will take his/her appropriate rest period unless the Individual Employer specifically directs the Employee not to take this rest break due to operational requirements. Employees are required to notify their supervisor whenever they are unable to take their rest periods.
If an Individual Employer fails to authorize and permit an Employee with a rest period as provided herein, the Employee shall be paid a penalty payment equal to one (1) hour at his/her applicable hourly wage rate excluding fringe benefits for all missed rest periods that day.

the air or provided with ventilation or cooling or provided for a period of no less than five minutes. Such access to shade shall be permitted at all times. Cooling measures other than shade (e.g., use of misting machines) may be provided in lieu of shade if the Individual Employer can demonstrate that these measures are at least as effective as shade in allowing employees to cool.
Employees should not discount any discomfort or symptoms they are experiencing. They should immediately report any problems they are experiencing to a supervisor and coworker. Employees must notify their supervisors immediately if they believe they require access to shade, or alternative cooling measures and/or a preventative recovery period.
If an Individual Employer fails to provide an Employee a preventative recovery period in accordance with this Section, the Individual Employer shall pay the Employee one additional hour of pay at the Employee’s regular rate of compensation, excluding fringe benefits, for each work day that a requested preventative recovery period is not provided. No employee shall be discriminated against for exercising his/her rights pursuant to this Section.
D.	All disputes concerning meals, rest periods and/or heat illness preventative recovery periods are subject to the Grievance Procedures in Section 9 of the Agreement and must be brought to the attention of the Employer, in writing, by the Union or Employee within ten (10) working days of the alleged violation. Decisions resolving disputes arising out of the Grievance Procedures shall be final and binding upon both parties.
Section 7	Records
A.	Each Individual Employer shall provide a proper means for registering the reporting, quitting time, and as supplied by the employee, the address and telephone number of all employees covered by this Agreement.

It is mutually agreed and understood that during the period when this Agreement is in force and effect, the Union or any Local Union will not authorize any strike, slow down, or stoppage of work in any dispute, complaint, or grievance arising under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, except such disputes, complaints, or grievances as arise out of the failure or refusal of any Individual Employer to comply with the provisions of the hiring clause, Section 3A or B hereof, or as permitted under Section 28B and C hereof or whenever an Individual Employer pays Laborers improperly with checks which do not clear for collection. As to any Individual Employer who shall fail or refuse to comply with the provisions of the sections specified herein, so long as such failure or refusal continues it shall not be a violation of this Agreement if the Union or any Local Union withdraws its members who are subject hereto from the performance of any work for such Individual Employer, and such withdrawal for such period shall not be a strike or work stoppage within the terms of this Agreement. In the event that any employees of any Individual Employer should be withdrawn by reason of any dispute, complaint, or grievance arising out of the violation of any similar hiring clause in any agreement between Employer and any other Union, then the Union or any Local Union may respect such withdrawal and for the

16.	If failure of a Board of Adjustment to meet on a discharge case within fifteen (15) working days is due to the unavailability of the Union, the wage payment and Trust Fund contribution liability shall be limited to the above fifteen (15) working days.

At the discretion of the Trustees of said Trust, contributions to the Contract Administration Trust Fund may be increased up to an additional four ($.04) cents per hour during the term of this Agreement.

and two cents ($.02) per hour is earmarked for the Construction Industry Force Account Council (CIFAC).

Section 10	Payment of Wages

B.	Each employee shall be given a statement with the Individual Employer's name and address, itemizing the employee's gross amount earned, hours worked, Social Security tax, withholding tax and all other deductions, also a statement of hours applicable to Health and Welfare, Pension/Annuity, Vacation Holiday Dues Supplement and Training-Retraining/Apprenticeship Plans.
Section 11	Subcontractors
The terms and conditions of this Agreement insofar as it affects Employer and the Individual Employer shall apply equally to any subcontractor of any tier under the control of, or working under oral or written contract with such Individual Employer on any work covered by this Agreement to be performed at the job site or job yard, and said subcontractor with respect to such work shall be considered the same as an Individual Employer covered hereby. Subject to the provisions of this Section and any other Section of this Agreement applicable to subcontractors, if an Individual Employer shall subcontract work herein defined, such subcontract shall state that such subcontractor agrees to be bound by and comply with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. A subcontractor is defined as any person, firm or corporation who agrees under contract with the Employer, or any Individual Employer, or a subcontractor of the Employer, or any Individual Employer to perform on the job site any part or portion of the construction work covered by the prime contract, including the operation of equipment, performance of labor and installation of materials. The Individual Employer has the primary obligation for performance of all conditions of this Agreement. This obligation cannot be relieved, evaded or diminished by subcontracting. Should the Individual Employer elect to subcontract, the Individual Employer shall continue to have such primary obligation. Said primary obligation shall be deemed conclusive evidence of the Union’s majority status for the purpose of establishing the obligation of the Individual Employer to bargain collectively pursuant to Section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act as amended with the Union upon expiration of this Agreement, but for no other purpose, statute or law.
An Individual Employer who provides in the subcontract that the subcontractor will pay the wages and benefits and will observe the hours and all other terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be liable for any delinquency by such subcontractor in the payment of any wages or fringe benefits provided herein, including payments required by Section 28 (Health and Welfare, Pension/Annuity, Vacation Holiday Dues Supplement and Training-Retraining/Apprenticeship Funds), except as follows:

The Individual Employer will give written notice to the Union of any subcontract involving the performance of work covered by this Agreement within five (5) days of entering such subcontract, and shall specify the name and address of the subcontractor. Written notice at a pre-job conference shall be deemed written notice under this provision for those subcontractors listed at the pre-job only. Notification to the Union of any subcontractor not listed in writing at the pre-job must still be given in accordance with this paragraph.
If thereafter such subcontractor shall become delinquent in the payment of any wages or benefits as above specified, the Union shall promptly give written notice thereof to the Individual Employer and to the subcontractor specifying the nature and amount of such delinquency.
If such notice is given, the Individual Employer shall pay and satisfy only the amount of any such delinquency by such subcontractor occurring within seventy-five (75) days prior to the receipt of said notice from the Union, and said Individual Employer may withhold the amount claimed to be delinquent out of the sums due and owing by the Individual Employer to such contractor.
In the event the Individual Employer fails to give written notice of a subcontract as required herein such Individual Employer shall be liable for all delinquencies of the subcontractor on that job or project without limitation.
The Individual Employer shall not be liable for any such delinquency if the Local Union where the delinquency occurs refers any employee to such subcontractor after giving such notice and during the continuance of such delinquency. The provisions of this Section 11 shall be applied only to the extent permitted by law and, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no aspect of the subcontractors' clause, including its enforcement, may be enforced by or subject to strike action.
Section 12	Conflicting Contracts
Any oral or written agreement between Employer or any Individual Employer and an individual employee, which conflicts or is inconsistent with this Agreement, or any supplemental agreements hereto, disestablishes or tends to disestablish relationship of Employer and employee, or establishes a relationship other than that of Employer and employee, shall forthwith terminate. No oral or written agreement which conflicts or is inconsistent with this Agreement, or any supplemental agreements thereto, shall hereafter be entered into by and between Employer, or an Individual Employer, and any individual employee performing work covered by this Agreement. Any practice of the Employer or Individual Employer contrary to this Agreement shall forthwith terminate. Any such future practice shall not be binding on the Union or effect the interpretation of this Agreement unless specifically authorized by the Union in writing.
Section 13A Elimination of Restrictions on Production
No rules, customs or practices shall be permitted that limit production or increase the time required to do any work. There shall be no limitation or restriction of the use of machinery tools or other labor saving devices.
The Union and Employer recognize that drug and alcohol abuse by employees shall not be tolerated for safety reasons.
The Union agrees to cooperate with the Employer and the Individual Employer in establishing drug and alcohol abuse policies to the extent legally possible.

Such tests may include, in the discretion of the Individual Employer, such tests of the employee's bodily fluids as the Individual Employer may reasonably believe will elicit evidence of the employee's use of substances which are reasonably likely to alter or impair the employee's ability to perform his/her duties in a prompt, competent and safe manner.

An Individual Employer who initiates random testing shall specifically state in its notice to the Union and its notice to employees that employees will be subject to random testing. The Individual Employer shall give thirty (30) days notice to the Union and employees prior to implementing a random drug testing program.
(4)	Implementation of a voluntary employee assistance program, to provide counseling, therapy and monitoring of those employees who request employer assistance in controlling and overcoming problems related to the use of drugs and alcohol.

If the worker so desires, worker shall be given a written notice of reduction in force, stating that the classification that the worker was originally hired for is no longer available; or the worker may have the choice of a lesser rate of pay.

LABORERS’ APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM
CALIFORNIA
1.	TERM OF APPRENTICESHIP: New applicants for union membership, who cannot demonstrate a minimum of 3,600 hours of experience as a Construction Craft Laborer shall enter the Laborers Apprenticeship Program (Apprenticeship Program). If an applicant is designated a journey-level Laborer by a referring Individual Employer who states in writing that the applicant’s knowledge and experience warrants journey-level status, such Employees shall be considered provisional journey-level Laborers and may retain that status so long as they are employed by the designating Individual Employer. Any provisional journey-level Laborer who is laid-off or otherwise discharged prior to working 3,600 hours may not be placed on a journey-level out of work list until assessed by the Apprenticeship Program.
2.	RATIO: Individual Employers shall participate in the Apprenticeship Program by accepting apprentices for employment upon referral by the Union. When four (4) journey-level Laborers are employed on a project for a particular Individual Employer, the next employee hired to perform Laborers’ work must be an apprentice and this ratio will be continued for every four (4) additional Laborers being employed on the Project. On projects with fewer than four (4) journey-level Laborers an Individual Employer may employ one (1) apprentice per project with at least one (1) journey-level Laborer.
3.	The Apprenticeship Standards approved by the Division of Apprenticeship Standards of the State of California are hereby incorporated by reference as part of this Agreement.
4.	All apprentices shall be properly dispatched through the appropriate Local Union’s hiring hall. The Individual Employer must secure a dispatch from the appropriate Local Union for any apprentices employed by the Individual Employer.
5.	Entry into the Apprenticeship Program shall be controlled by the Laborers Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee (JATC), which shall employ appropriate screening procedures. An apprentice in good standing advances from one level to another only upon determination of satisfactory performance by the JATC, which shall have the authority to grant accelerated credit where warranted by the performance of an individual apprentice. The JATC may also grant credited hours to an apprentice who received work experience and/or training prior to entry into the Apprenticeship Program. The JATC will not unreasonably withhold entry and advancement in the Apprenticeship Program for provisional journey-level Laborers after their employment with a referring Individual Employer is terminated.
6.	An apprentice should, whenever possible, be rotated by the Individual Employer through different types of work so as to become trained in a variety of operations and work skills. Where the Individual Employer is unable to provide an apprentice with experience in the full range of craft skills causing the apprentice to exceed the number of hours allotted to a given work process, the JATC may coordinate with the Local Union to reassign the apprentice to other employment in order to provide that experience. For so long as the Individual Employer is able to provide the necessary range of employment experience, the Individual Employer may choose to retain the apprentice from job to job but shall notify the Local Union and JATC of all reassignments. An apprentice shall not work on the jobsite unless supervised by a journey-level Laborer.
7.	The Individual Employer shall release the apprentice to enroll in Related and Supplemental Instruction (RSI) when the apprentice is notified of mandatory training. An apprentice shall

not be penalized for taking time off from work to receive RSI as required by the Apprenticeship Program. The Laborers Apprenticeship Program shall endeavor to notify the Individual Employer of any upcoming RSI requirements the apprentice must satisfy. The Laborers Apprenticeship Program will assist the Individual Employer in meeting its apprentice ratio requirements.
8.	An apprentice who fails to maintain his/her apprenticeship status shall not be eligible for employment as a journey-level Laborer unless he/she successfully completes the Apprenticeship Program after reinstatement by the JATC. Reinstatement is at the sole discretion of the JATC. If reinstatement is denied, an apprentice may reapply for entry into the Apprenticeship Program after waiting one (1) year from the date he/she was terminated from the Apprenticeship Program. The failure of any apprentice to maintain his/her apprenticeship status shall obligate the Individual Employer to discharge such person upon written notice from the Apprenticeship Program.

SUPPLEMENT TO THE MASTER AGREEMENT REGARDING LABORERS WORK FOR THE CONCRETE SAWING, DRILLING, CORING AND BREAKING INDUSTRY
TRAVEL & DRIVING TIME
TRAVEL RATES PER HOUR:
EFFECTIVE DATE	1/01/14	1/01/15	6/27/16	6/26/17	6/25/18
	$17.91	$18.16	$18.66	$18.91	$19.16
1.	Time and one-half the travel rate shall be paid on travel during work time after the employee has worked a total of forty (40) hours work in a week or eight (8) hours work in a day on prevailing wage project. Any employee operating or responsible for the control of a company vehicle being used to transport personnel, equipment and/or supplies from the Individual Employer's regularly established shop or yard to a jobsite shall be compensated at the travel rate. No employee shall suffer a reduction in rate as a result of this agreement.
2.	The employee's working time starts at the jobsite, yard or shop where he or she is required to report for work or begin driving a vehicle. Those who, as a matter of convenience, travel as passengers in company provided transportation shall not be paid travel time to the first site of employment or from the last site of employment during the workday. Employees assigned company vehicles that are provided primarily for the employee’s convenience will be paid a driving stipend based on the travel rate for travel time spent driving in excess of sixty (60) miles to and from the first and last project in a workday where the project is located in excess of sixty (60) miles from the regularly established shop or yard.
CALIFORNIA
3.	Travel & Driving time is not subject to Section 28 (Fringe Benefits) in the Agreement except as set forth herein. However, an Individual Employer shall be required to contribute one hundred ten (110) hours to the Health & Welfare Trust Fund on behalf of an employee in any month where the employee’s travel time work hours and non-travel work hours equal or exceed one hundred ten (110) hours for the month and the employee’s non-travel time work hours are less than one hundred ten (110) hours. The Individual Employer will designate on the Trust Fund report form those hours which represent travel time work hours. (Example: Employee works ninety [90] non-travel time hours and twenty-five [25] travel time work hours in January. The Individual Employer will remit one hundred ten [110] hours of contributions to the Health & Welfare Trust Fund.) When an employee’s non-travel time work hours for an Individual Employer in a given calendar year are not sufficient to earn a year of pension service credits, an Individual Employer will be required to contribute the additional hours an employee would need to earn a year of pension service credit where the employee’s travel time and non-travel work hours would equal or exceed the number of hours necessary to earn a year of pension service credit. (Example: One thousand [1,000] hours are needed for a year of service credits. Employee works nine hundred [900] non-travel time hours and one hundred twenty-five [125] travel time hours in calendar year 2013. Individual Employer reports an additional one hundred (100) hours to the Pension Trust Fund for the month of December 2013 to enable an employee to earn a year of service credits.)
