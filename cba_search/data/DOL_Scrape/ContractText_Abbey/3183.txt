AGREEMENT
between
THE COLUMBUS BOARD OF EDUCATION
and
THE COLUMBUS EDUCATION ASSOCIATION
To be effective until
August 27,2008
Dear CEA Members:
This is your copy of the new Master Agreement between the Columbus Board of Education and the Columbus Education Association. We have come a long way from the first 20-page document that was agreed to more than 30 years ago. It represents another solid step forward. Please read it and use it so that it may be of professional and personal benefit to you.
This was one of our most difficult rounds of bargaining. We must not take the results for granted. The agreement represents thousands of hours ofworkby the officers, representatives, staff and team members. Also, we must never forget the many members who sacrificed in the past to get us to this level today. It has not been easy and will not get easier in the future. Public education and a teacher’s livelihood are threatened as never before in the history of our nation. CEA remains a bulwark defending our local public schools.
We should be very proud of this agreement. Even in difficult times, we have moved forward. This contract contains substantive language changes to improve the working conditions for teachers and students. It also maintains benefits for teachers.
A special note of thanks goes to all team members, especially Chief Negotiator Rick Logan and Negotiations Chairperson Dorothy G. Wilson. They have demonstrated their dedication to create and maintain a strong Association.
In addition to the staff and leadership who contribute so much to our success, we also owe much to the thousands of individual members who made themselves heard throughout the negotiations process. This united effort has produced a contract that keeps CEA and Columbus as national leaders in the field of education.
Any good contract must be enforced to have value. The Board and CEA have made the commitment to support this agreement. Every teacher and administrator is obligated to enforce it.
Thank you for your support.
Sincerely,
CEA Negotiations Team

COLUMBUS EDUCATION ASSOCIATION
This Agreement entered into at Columbus, Ohio, this tenth day of June 2005, between the Columbus Board of Education of the Columbus City School District (hereinafter referred to as the “Board”) and the Columbus Education Association (hereinafter referred to as the “Association”).
Chapter 100
Article 101
Recognition
The Board recognizes the Association as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative for all teachers of the District. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “teachers” shall mean the certificated teaching employees of the Columbus City School District including, but not limited to, certificat-ed/licensed teachers, nurses, occupational therapists, physical therapists, dental hygienists, and full-time (minimum of six (6) hours per day and a minimum of thirty-seven (37) weeks per year) hourly-rated teachers, hourly-rated tutors who work regularly during the majority of the school year, latchkey teachers and instructional support substitutes. “Teachers” shall also mean other regular full-time professional staff members except classified and civil-service type personnel and except instructional assistants and educational media aides. Members of the bargaining unit as defined above may hereinafter be referred to as “teachers” or “members of the bargaining unit.” However, only those provisions of this Agreement which are specifically identified as applicable to hourly-rated tutors, latchkey teachers and instructional support substitutes shall apply to such employees. The bargaining unit shall include a person hired as a regular contract teacher who (a) fails to pass the appropriate PRAXIS test(s) within the first sixty (60) work days and (b) serves in the same assignment for more than forty-five (45) days so long as the person is continued in that same assignment. All employees herein defined as teachers shall be members of the bargaining unit, but said bargaining unit shall exclude the Superintendent, Deputy Superintendent, assistant superintendents, principals, assistant principals, and other administrative or supervisory personnel. “Other administrative or supervisory personnel” shall include any certificated or professional employee having the authority to responsibly direct other certificated or professional employees and the authority to hire, transfer, assign, promote, discharge, or discipline
1
other certificated or professional employees, or to responsibly recommend such action. If the Board of Education reassigns or removes the work of student safety specialists from the bargaining unit, the Board of Education shall have the obligation to bargain with the Association about the effect(s) of the Board’s decision.
Article 102
Responsibility of the Board
It is recognized by the parties that the Board is invested by the laws of the State of Ohio with the management and control of all the public schools in the Columbus City School District. The authority shall include, but shall not be limited to the right to hire, discharge or discipline teachers, subject to the terms of this Agreement and applicable law, and the authority to make such rules and regulations, subject to the terms of this Agreement and applicable law, as are necessary for the government of the public schools, the employees of the Board, and the pupils of the schools. Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a derogation or transfer of the authority of the Board as established by the laws of the State of Ohio.
Article 103
Authority of the Superintendent
The administrative authority of the Board shall be implemented by the Superintendent, Deputy Superintendent, assistant superintendents, principals, assistant principals, and other administrative or supervisory personnel employed by the Board. The Superintendent shall have the sole authority to direct, assign and transfer teachers, subject to the terms of this Agreement and applicable law.
Article 104
Responsibility of the Association
The Association shall represent all teachers of the Columbus City School District equally and without discrimination, regardless of their membership or non-membership in the Association.
Article 105
Equal Employment Rights

The Board and administration will comply with all federal, state and local fair employment laws.
Article 106
Continuous Performance Pledge
106.01 The Association agrees that it will neither cause nor sponsor any strike, “study day,” “professional holiday,” or
2
other work stoppage during the period of this Agreement. In the event that the Association violates this provision, it shall be subject to appropriate legal penalties and the Board shall be entitled to any other appropriate relief available under law.
106.02 Any teacher who initiates or participates in a strike or other act prohibited by this article will be subject to appropriate legal penalties and the Board shall be entitled to any other appropriate relief available under law.
106.03 The Association will make every reasonable effort to prevent or terminate violations of the pledge.
Article 107
Present Policies
To the extent that any provision of the Administrative Guide, other Board policy, regulation or procedure, or building level policy, regulation or procedure conflicts with an expressed provision of this Association/Board Agreement, the provisions of the Association/Board Agreement shall have precedence.
Article 108
Board-Association Consultation
108.01 During the term of this Agreement, the Board or its administrative agents shall make it a practice to advise the Association President or his/her designees prior to the adoption of new or substantially revised citywide policies, programs, or procedures of significant importance to and directly involving teachers.
108.02 During the term of this Agreement, the Superintendent and designees shall meet on a regular basis, generally once a month, with not more than five (5) representatives of the Association to discuss matters of policy, procedure, and program of the school district. In order to promote a free exchange of views, all matters discussed in such meetings shall be considered confidential by all parties unless otherwise noted in the meetings.
108.03 All administrative forms provided by this Agreement shall be mutually acceptable to the Board and the Association, subject to binding arbitration in case of dispute. The development of such mutually acceptable forms shall include discussion between the parties of the procedures for the use of such forms. In the event mutual agreement on a form does not occur, the Board shall be free to utilize its preferred form until an arbitrator renders a decision.
108.04 All school forms developed by the school district shall be free of sexual stereotyping. The school system may continue to use supplies of forms presently in stock. The Association may advise the administrator of Labor Relations of any forms in need of revision. No form that

Article 110
Grievance Procedure
110.01 During the course of this Agreement, problems may arise concerning the alleged violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of the provisions of this Agreement. When such problems arise, an attempt should be made to settle them informally by the teacher or teachers involved and the immediate administrative supervisor. During the effort to settle such a problem at the informal level, the teacher or teachers involved shall advise the supervisor of the section or sections of the Agreement which relate to the problem. A problem which cannot be resolved informally will be processed as a grievance. The grievant(s) shall not be confined to the section(s) referred to in this section when a formal grievance is filed.
10
110.02 Each grievance shall be processed in the following manner:
Step 1.
A.	Within ten (10) school days after the occurrence of the incident, which is the subject of the grievance, the teacher involved will reduce the grievance to writing, on a form provided by the Board, and will present it to the building principal. Upon receipt, the principal will place a copy of the grievance in the Association faculty representative’s school mailbox.
B.	Within four (4) school days after the grievance is submitted, the building principal will discuss the grievance with the teacher involved and attempt to resolve it.
C.	Within four (4) school days after this meeting, the principal shall notify the grievant of the decision in writing on the grievance form.
Step 2.
If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision concerning the grievance at Step 1, the teacher may, within four (4) school days of receipt of such decision, request the principal to forward the grievance to the Superintendent. Upon such requests being made, the principal will forward the grievance to the Superintendent within two (2) school days. The Superintendent shall schedule a hearing within ten (10) school days of receipt of the grievance, and shall notify the grievant and the Association of the time and place of such hearing. Within five (5) school days after such hearing, the Superintendent, or the Superintendent’s designated representative at such hearing, shall notify the grievant of the decision in writing.
110.03 The failure of a grievant to appeal any decision to the next Step within the time set forth for such appeal shall constitute a waiver of the right of further appeal, and a final disposition of the grievance shall be made on the basis of the last decision given. Any of the time limits established in this grievance procedure may be waived by mutual agreement of the parties.
110.04 All grievance hearings shall be held outside of the normal teaching hours of the grievant or grievants involved so as not to interfere with their teaching responsibilities. A representative of the Association shall have the right to be present and may, at the option of the grievant, represent the grievant at all steps of the grievance procedure and arbitration. A teacher shall not be represented or accompanied by a representative of any other employee organization at any grievance or arbitration hearing.
110.05 In the event there is a grievance which involves a number of teachers in one school, it may be submitted as
11
a group grievance. The teachers involved in the grievance will be named on the grievance form.
110.06 The Association may file a grievance at Step 1 on behalf of an individual or on behalf of a group of teachers in one school, or it may file a group grievance at Step 2 on behalf of itself or on behalf of a group of teachers in more than one school.
110.07 As used above in this grievance procedure, the term “school day” shall mean a day when school is in session for students and teachers. If a grievance occurs in such a way that timelines would take the process beyond the end of the normal school year, or if a grievance arises during the summer break beyond the normal school year, the term “school day” shall mean a weekday (Monday through Friday) excluding legal holidays.
Article 111
Arbitration
111.01 If a grievance is not resolved to the satisfaction of the grievant at Step 2 of the grievance procedure above, the Association may make a written request for arbitration within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the decision of the Superintendent or his/her designated representative.
111.02 Within three (3) days after this written request for arbitration, the Board and the Association shall attempt to agree upon a mutually acceptable arbitrator and shall obtain a commitment from said arbitrator to serve. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator or to obtain such a commitment within the specified period, a request for a list of arbitrators shall be made jointly to the American Arbitration Association. An arbitrator shall be selected from the list submitted by alternately striking names from the list.
111.03 The arbitrator so selected shall be requested to hold a hearing on the earliest date available, and, unless such time is extended by mutual agreement, shall issue his/her decision not later than thirty (30) days from the date of the hearing. The arbitrator’s decision shall be in writing and shall set forth his/her findings of fact, reasoning, and conclusions on the issue submitted.
111.04 The parties recognize that the Board of Education is legally charged with the responsibility of operating the school system. The sole power of the arbitrator shall be to determine whether the terms of this Agreement have been violated, misinterpreted or inequitably applied, and the arbitrator shall have no power or authority to make any decision which modifies, alters, or amends any terms of this Agreement or which is violative of the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall not substitute his/her
12
judgment for that of the Board, except in the following circumstances:
A.	Where an issue to be determined by the arbitrator is an issue of fact;
B.	Where the issue before the arbitrator involves the interpretation of the terms of this Agreement.
111.0	5 The decision of the arbitrator shall be submitted to the Board and to the Association and, subject to law and the foregoing stipulations of this Agreement, shall be final and binding in respect to the interpretation, meaning, or application of any provision of this Agreement. Other recommendations of the arbitrator shall be advisory only and no judgment may be entered thereon.
111.0	6 The costs for the services of the arbitrator, including per diem expenses, if any, and actual and necessary travel and subsistence expenses, as well as the related cost of the American Arbitration Association services, shall be borne totally by the loser. The arbitrator shall designate in his/her award the prevailing party, or the predominately prevailing party, and shall submit all charges to the other party for payment. Such charges shall not be divided by the arbitrator between the parties in any manner or under any circumstances without prior approval of both parties. The expenses of witnesses and other representatives shall be borne by the party they represent. A stenographic record of the arbitration proceedings shall be made. Each party shall pay for its own copy of such record, and the parties shall share equally the cost of the arbitrator’s copy. The parties may mutually agree to forego a stenographic record.
Article 112
Agency Fee
112.01 All teachers who are not members of the Association shall pay a monthly agency fee equivalent to the monthly dues uniformly required of such members, not including initiation fees, fines or assessments, as certified by the Association to the Treasurer before each school year and as further necessary to be accurate. Such payment shall be subject to a rebate procedure provided by the Association meeting all requirements of applicable state and federal law.
112.02
A.	Agency fees shall be automatically deductible in twelve (12) equal installments beginning with the first pay date after January 15.

Article 201
Academic Freedom
201.01 Teachers shall be guaranteed academic freedom. Such freedom shall be exercised within the bounds of general standards of professional responsibility, and shall not prohibit consultation and direction by Board representatives. The right to academic freedom herein established shall include the right to support or oppose political causes and issues outside of the teaching role and the teacher’s school-related activities and relationships.
201.02 During the term of this Agreement there shall be no general expansion of the citywide standardized testing program prior to discussion with representatives of the Association as provided in Article 108.

Teachers shall conduct testing and student assessment as required for the teacher’s particular assignment.
201.03 In the event the school administrator changes a student’s nine-week grade, the administrator will, as promptly as practical, notify the teacher who gave the original grade.

204.01 Elementary school teachers shall normally be on duty thirty (30) minutes before classes begin, and middle and high school teachers shall normally be on duty fifteen (15) minutes before classes begin. Teachers shall normally remain on duty until they have completed their professional duties, but in no event shall they leave the school prior to fifteen (15) minutes after the close of the scheduled student school day. It is understood that when split sessions are in operation, teachers will leave the schools after their students as soon as possible after 6 p.m.

Full-time hourly-rated teachers and those members of the bargaining unit not assigned to a regular school staff shall have a regular workday not to exceed eight (8) hours. In no event shall a teacher’s workday begin before 7:00 a.m. or end after 6:00 p.m. except as specifically provided elsewhere in this Agreement, unless the teacher so elects from time to time, or unless the teacher elected employment for, or chose assignment to, a position with a posted work day beginning before 7:00 a.m. or ending after 6:00 p.m. Kindergarten teachers employed on a half-time contract shall have their responsibilities as established in this article reduced as nearly as practical by fifty (50) percent, recognizing that the student day in a.m. kindergarten classes in many elementary schools has a duration of three (3) hours.
204.05 In schools that vary their schedules from the normal teacher work day of 8:15 a.m. to 3:45 p.m. or from the normal student day of 8:45 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. in elementary schools and 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. in middle and high schools, teachers shall be provided lunch periods, conference periods, and other released-time periods stipulated by this Agreement for various assignments approx
17
imately equal in minutes per week to those periods provided teachers in schools on normal schedules. Nothing in this provision shall prohibit the Board from developing innovative programs and schedules in certain schools so long as the staff in such a school, by secret ballot, votes approval of such innovation, provided no teacher is required to work in excess of the provisions of Section 204.04 above and provided no teacher is required to work in excess of the teacher’s regular contract year. Prior to any such secret ballot vote the Association Building Council shall study the proposed innovative programs and schedules and shall make recommendations to the staff.
204.06
A.	The lunch schedule for each elementary school shall be developed (if possible) by agreement between the principal and the Association Building Council. Absent an agreement, the final determination shall be made by the principal.
B.	No teacher shall be deprived of at least a thirty (30) minute uninterrupted, duty-free lunch period.
C.	Notwithstanding paragraph B above, the thirty (30) minute duty-free lunch period may be interrupted if the Administration determines that it is feasible, and an elementary school staff, by majority in a secret ballot vote, elect a forty-five (45) minute lunch period. Such forty-five (45) minute lunch period shall remain in effect for the remainder of the school year and shall continue the following school year unless the Administration determines such continuation is not feasible or the staff elects not to continue the forty-five (45) minute lunch period the following school year.
204	.07 It is understood by the parties that during the term of this Agreement, elementary school schedules may be adjusted in order to accommodate transportation needs provided the normal pupil day shall not begin before 8:30 a.m. nor later than 9:00 a.m. In addition, the normal teacher work day, as provided in Section 204.04 and the normal length of the school day, as provided in Section 204.02 shall not be exceeded.
204	.08 In the event a court-ordered pupil reassignment plan is implemented, the starting times for schools will be staggered as needed by the Office of Management Services in order to provide for the efficient utilization of buses. It is expected that schools may begin operation as early as 7:30 a.m. or as late as 9:30 a.m. The lunch schedule for elementary schools may vary between 45 minutes and 1 hour and 15 minutes and may be modified by the
18
Office of Management Services. Such modification by the Office of Management Services shall only be made on a school-by-school basis where the need exists to accommodate bus schedules. No teacher shall be deprived of at least a thirty (30) minute uninterrupted duty-free lunch period. The thirty (30) minutes before classes and fifteen (15) minutes after classes provided in Article 204.01 will normally be changed to forty-five (45) minutes before classes and fifteen (15) minutes after classes in elementary schools with a one-hour lunch period established as a result of this provision.
Article 205
Building Staff Meetings
205.01 All teachers assigned to a school building will be required to attend two (2) regular building level staff/inservice meetings per month if called by the principal of that school. In-service meetings tied to the early release of students shall not count as one (1) of these two (2) meetings. In-service meetings will include topics related to multicultural education. Except in the case of emergency, or as provided below, such required staff/in-service meetings will not extend beyond forty-five (45) minutes after the teacher’s scheduled workday.
205.02 In addition to the regular building level staff/inservice meetings, the principal, in consultation with the Association Building Council, may schedule two (2) forty-five (45) minute building level staff meetings per month and/or extend one (1) required building level staff/in-service meeting per month a maximum of thirty (30) minutes beyond the limitations in 205.01 above for purposes of staff development. Attendance at such additional meetings or extension will be voluntary unless a majority of the staff has voted by secret ballot to require attendance at a particular meeting. In the case of such meeting, at which attendance is required, the Association Building Council shall assist the principal in developing the program and agenda.
205.03 Announcements concerning Association activities may be made by the Association’s faculty representative at the conclusion of staff meetings.
205.04 Regular building level staff/in-service meetings will normally be scheduled on Mondays. If, due to unusual circumstances, there is a need to hold a meeting on a different day, the staff will be advised as far in advance as is practical and reasonable. Except in the case of emergency, the principal shall not schedule building level staff/inservice meetings in the afternoon of the first Thursday of each month during the regular school year.
205.05 The principal shall designate one full day at the
19
beginning of the school year as being for the teacher’s own professional utilization at his/her assigned building.
205.06 Notwithstanding Sections 205.01 and 205.04 above, city-wide program teachers who are assigned to school buildings may be required to attend one (1) city-wide program after-school staff/in-service meeting on a pupil attendance day during the school year. Announcement of this meeting shall clearly state that attendance is mandatory. This meeting shall not exceed one and one-half (1 1/2) hours in length.
205.07 The parties agree that, in the event the Board determines to pilot a longer school year and/or longer school day during the term of this contract, the parties will bargain this issue in good faith recognizing that time is of the essence. Such pilot programs will not be implemented without agreement of the Association.
Article 206
Teaching Environment and New Buildings
206.01 Copying machine(s) (or technologically more advanced equipment) and computers shall be made available in the teacher’s workspace, classrooms and/or teachers’ lounges and reasonably maintained in a timely manner in each school for the use of teachers in carrying out their professional tasks. The district shall continue to implement secure, advanced technology for teacher access to enter school and student information.
206.02 Each classroom shall have sufficient chalkboard/ whiteboard and bulletin board space to complement the teacher’s instruction.
206.03 Teachers shall be permitted to have coffee-making devices and coffee and soft drink vending machines in the teacher’s lounges as space permits.

All such devices and equipment shall be maintained by the faculty. Teachers shall not be required to perform the custodial duties in the staff lounge and shall not be required to prepare food, clean tables or perform other significant custodial chores in connection with the lunch programs. Teachers who use the staff lounge or use the appliances in the staff lounge may be required to share in the cleaning of the appliances, to keep their personal property cleaned and stored, and to leave their eating area in a clean and orderly condition. The expenditure of any profits realized from the above-mentioned vending machines shall be in accordance with guidelines established by the principal in consultation with the Association Building Council where the development of such guidelines are requested
20
by the Association Building Council.
206.04 Classroom interruptions by the public address system shall be permitted only in the case of an emergency. Regular announcements shall be made only at the beginning and the close of the school day. Other classroom interruptions for administrative or other purposes shall be held to a minimum.
206.05 The parties agree that consistent with Board appropriations, building budgets and the district facilities plan(s), all school buildings should be provided with adequate resources and equipment in a safe infrastructure.

Such telephones may not be locked during the normal school day, or teachers otherwise unreasonably inconvenienced in their use.
206.08 The Board recognizes that clerical responsibilities detract from the effectiveness of the classroom teachers; therefore, a continued effort shall be made, with this Agreement, to avoid substantive increases in such clerical work. However, the parties recognize that, in the event reductions in school personnel are necessary, such reductions may adversely impact the Board’s effort.
206.09 The following shall be provided in each school built or substantively remodeled as a result of the passage of the November 2002 bond issue:
A.	A lunch area for teachers separate from that of pupils;

206.	11 Upon request, any teacher shall be advised in a rea
21
sonably prompt manner of the status of the various school fund accounts.
206.	12 It shall be the responsibility of the building principal to see that the Board of Education’s adopted expulsion, suspension, and removal regulations are prominently posted in each respective building. This section is not subject to the grievance procedure.
206.	13 Elementary classroom teachers required to permanently change classrooms on or after the workday prior to the first student attendance day during a school year, shall be provided one (1) school day without pupils to accomplish such move.
206.	14 New and renovated elementary buildings will be designed with rooms for art and music classes. The Board shall make reasonable efforts to designate specific rooms for both art and music in elementary buildings for the particular school year and physical facility.
Article 207
Guidelines for Classroom Visitations and Teacher Conferences
The Association and the Board wholeheartedly support parent and community involvement in schools and encourage members of the community to visit the schools and confer with teachers. However, because of the potential interruption and disruption of children’s education posed by uncontrolled classroom visitations and conferences, the Board hereby adopts as its policy the following guidelines for public or parental visitations in classrooms in order to minimize disruption of the educational process.
A.	All visitors must check in at the office upon entering the school.
B.	The visitor shall be escorted to the classroom unless the teacher is expecting the visitor and directions to the visitor will be sufficient. In the latter case the teacher should be advised by the office so the teacher will know the office is aware of the visitor’s presence.
C.	Where practical, visitations should be by prior arrangement with the teacher. Visitors should inform the teacher of the general purpose of the classroom visitation or conference in advance.
D.	Teachers shall have the right to reschedule a visitor when prior arrangements have not been made.E. Where practical, the visitor and teacher should arrange a conference to discuss a classroom visitation.
E No electronic devices will be used to make any record of the visit or conference except by agreement of the teacher.
G.	Every effort will be made to minimize the amount of disruption caused by such visits. In the event a prob
22
lem develops in a given school with regard to application of the guidelines provided in this article, an effort shall first be made by the teachers involved to resolve the problem directly with the principal before the filing of a grievance.
H.	The parties agree and acknowledge being responsive to parental requests for information or a conference is a high priority. If a parent is present at a building and is not being disruptive, the teacher shall make every effort to attend and participate in a conference with the parent if the principal or designee so arranges. If reasonably possible, the conference shall occur outside the student instructional day.
Article 208
Classroom Atmosphere
208.01 The Administration recognizes its responsibility to give all reasonable support and assistance to teachers with respect to the maintenance of control and discipline in the classroom. It is the responsibility of the teachers and Administration to provide an atmosphere within the classroom and within the school building that is conducive to learning. Administrators are to administer the discipline policy for their school or program and are to provide appropriate administrative support to teachers that is legal and consistent with Board policy (currently including the Guide to Student Conduct). Teachers and administrators are to abide by such specific Board adopted disciplinary policy as may now be in existence or may be replaced or modified.
208.02 Teachers shall not administer corporal punishment. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to abridge the rights of teachers provided in Section 3319.41(G) of the Ohio Revised Code.
208.03 The principal, in consultation with his/her Association Building Council, will establish procedures for the administration of all forms of discipline within the school. Such will include procedures related to suspension and recommendation for expulsion. Written building discipline plans shall be in place at the beginning of the school year. Failure of a principal to establish a building discipline plan by the first day of student attendance is grievable at Step 2 of the grievance procedure. In the event the principal is newly appointed, transferred or assigned, such failure must first be brought to his/her attention in writing at least ten (10) calendar days before the grievance is filed in order for the principal to develop or finalize a building plan. Nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted as a restriction on the right of the Board or Superintendent to establish future
23
policy or guidelines related to disciplinary procedures, provided such right is exercised without specific violation of this Agreement or law.
208.04 The removal of a student from a curricular or extracurricular activity by a teacher shall be processed according to the provisions set forth in Section 3313.66 of the Ohio Revised Code. A teacher removing a student according to this provision shall communicate such action on a mutually developed form.
208.05 Teachers shall be given released time as required for appearances at administrative hearings and court proceedings arising out of their professional activities, upon as much advance notice as possible to the supervisor or principal.
208.06 When a pupil is initially assigned to a class as a result of a central office decision to change the building assignment of a pupil for disciplinary reasons, teachers who will be regularly assigned to instruct such pupil shall be so advised.
208.07 If a student inflicts bodily injury on a teacher, the student, after required due process, will be expelled and may, if proper circumstances exist, be permanently excluded from school under Section 3313.662 of the Ohio Revised Code, except as provided in federal and state special education laws. However, expulsion is not required in cases of incidental or accidental physical contact. “Bodily injury” for the purposes of this section means physical injury requiring treatment by a medical doctor for a broken bone or sprain, laceration with stitches, or other serious bodily injury. The teacher must promptly report his/her injuries in writing to the Office of Human Resources, if possible, and upon request release his/her medical records of the injury(ies) to that office. Nothing in this Article alters the rights of the administration, Board of Education, parents or guardians under federal or state law.
208.08 If a teacher initiates student discipline which results in a legally required hearing, the teacher shall be sent a copy of all written notices sent to the student’s parent or guardian with respect to the hearing and appeal process.
208.09 Generally, students will not be transferred to a different building more than once in a school year for disciplinary reasons. Exceptions are unusual circumstances, such as threat of personal injury or damage to a person; or physical injury to a person, as a result of an assault or battery; or where the best interests of the pupil and schools compel a transfer in unusual circumstances. Completion of an assignment to the I-PASS Center is not considered a transfer to a different building.

208.10 Each principal shall keep a copy of the 190-Corrective Measures Forms that he/she deems to involve Level 3 behaviors separate from other 190 forms. Upon request, such copies shall be made available in a timely manner for the senior faculty representative for review.

209.02 In the event volunteers cannot be secured for the necessary supervision of school events which take place outside the teachers’ regular work day, teachers may be assigned to supervise at such activities by the school principal, provided such teachers shall be notified of the assignment two (2) weeks in advance where possible. These assignments will be rotated equally among the entire teaching staff of the school so that no teacher will be required to supervise more than five (5) such activities per school year. Such required supervisory assignments shall not extend more than three (3) hours in length or the length of a normal school-related evening activity.
209.03 Teachers may voluntarily use their personal automobiles for the purpose of transporting students on field trips, transporting athletic teams, or other business of the Columbus Public Schools, but may not be required to do so.
209.04 When any member of the bargaining unit is absent for a full school day and no substitute is available, the assignment shall, in elementary schools be divided, and in middle and high schools rotated among the teaching staff at the school involved. In the event no substitute is available:
A.	Elementary teachers who are assigned students from the absent teacher’s class shall be compensated at the rate of six times three-quarters of the supplemental hourly rate [6 x (3/4) x supplemental hourly rate] per day divided equally among the teachers receiving the students.
25
B.	Middle school and high school teachers who are assigned during their conference periods to cover the assignment of the absent teacher shall be paid at the rate of three-quarters (3/4) of the supplemental hourly rate for each forty-five (45) minute period.
In the event a self-contained middle school assignment is divided among teachers of other self-contained classes, compensation shall be in accordance with A above.
In cases of a sudden illness or an emergency which requires a teacher to leave after the work day has started and said teacher is charged sick leave as defined in Article 701 of this Agreement, teachers receiving the students shall be compensated as in A or B above, except that the six (6) in the formula in A above will be reduced to the number of hours such students were divided during the day.
209.05 Except in an emergency, the Board shall provide a substitute teacher for the classes of a teacher out of school for a full school day in order to attend approved functions such as athletic events, tournaments, club activities, Association leave, and other professional leave.
209.06 Nothing in these provisions shall prohibit members from voluntarily assisting each other or from temporarily rearranging assignments for purposes of team teaching or other professional activity with the approval of the school principal.
209.07 No teacher shall be required to join any organization, participate in the activities of any organization or contribute to or support any charity. Nothing in this provision is intended to relieve teachers of their required participation in an annual open house and/or an annual parent grade level meeting where scheduled, provided such required participation shall be counted towards the number of supervisory activities that may be required in Section 209.02 above.
209.08 Teachers shall not be required to sell or process school pictures, tickets of any kind, candy, insurance, or other like items if school aides or volunteers are available to perform these functions.

Article 210
Teacher-Parent Conferences and
Reports to Parents
210.01 Each elementary classroom teacher and middle school “self-contained” classroom teacher (self-contained is not intended to suggest a middle school with full-day self-contained classrooms) shall attempt to conduct a minimum of two (2) personal conferences per school year with each of his/her pupil’s parents. Elementary and middle schools shall utilize the two (2) designated school calendar days in connection with such conferences. Other middle school teachers (those teachers who do not have “self-contained” classrooms) may hold small group parent conferences in lieu of individual conferences; however, an attempt shall be made by such teachers to have personal conferences where a need exists.
210.02 If a high school pupil or a middle school pupil in an academic course has been given a failing grade in a teacher’s subject area during any grading period and/or the pupil has been designated as a disciplinary problem by a teacher, the teacher involved shall make a concerted effort to conduct at least one (1) personal conference with the pupil’s parents during the current grading period or the following interim reporting period. In addition, all middle and high school teachers are encouraged to conduct further personal conferences during the school year, as possible, with the parents of the other pupils in their teaching area. Such conferences with parents shall be conducted during the school day, at school, or in the home, and shall be reported to the principal on a form mutually approved by the Board and the Association.
210.03 The grade reporting system shall be based on four (4) grading periods per school year, with each grading period covering approximately nine (9) weeks. Reports to parents under the nine-week grade report system shall also include certain interim progress reports (outlined below) to be issued approximately in the middle of the grading periods. During the first two grading periods, elementary teachers shall complete such interim progress reports for each student. During the first grading period of each course, middle and high school teachers shall complete such interim progress reports for each student. Thereafter, interim progress reports shall be required for elementary students and for middle and high school stu
27
dents for one or more of the following reasons: A. Unsatisfactory academic performance B. Discipline problems
C. Irregular attendance
Elementary and middle school teachers may utilize conferences occurring on the parent conference day provided in Section 210.01 in place of required interim reports during such grading periods.
210.04 The form(s), procedures, and timelines used for interim progress reports to parents shall be primarily the same ones used during the 1991-92 school year unless modified by mutual agreement of the parties. Minor adjustments to the software that produce non-substan-tive changes are not considered modifications.
210.05 Pursuant to implementation of a uniform elementary grade card format, the District will phase in implementation of a secure electronic advanced technology for teacher access to entering school and elementary student information between the 2005-06 and 2007-08 school years.
Article 211
Assignments and Transfers
211.01 Posting and Filling Vacancies
A.	All known teacher vacancies for the following school year shall be posted by the first teacher workday in April. Vacancies to be identified shall be those vacancies after reorganization of the existing staff based on the anticipated needs of the following year. Such postings shall describe the vacant position, including special factors. Examples of such factors are: special knowledge, skills or training, and extra duties. The posting shall include the deadline and directions for making application. They shall be posted in each school during the school year, and in each high school summer school center during the summer recess. Supplemental postings shall be made as needed.
B.	Teachers desiring to be considered for such vacancies shall apply by timely submitting a cover letter, copy of current certification for the position, and resume. Such application^) shall be made to the appropriate administrator describing relevant information about their qualifications for the known vacancy for which they wish to interview. Applicants who are not yet certified in Ohio shall provide written information about their intended certification.
C.	Teachers whose applications are to be submitted to the Human Resources Department, will be notified by the Human Resources Department, of the receipt of their
28
applications.
D.	Vacancies will be filled utilizing the interview/selection process. The interview/selection panel in a building will consist of the principal, the senior faculty representative and one elected member of the Association Building Council, and two parents/members of the school community, or an alternative panel as agreed at the building between the principal and Association. The administrator shall determine which applicant is selected for the position. If his or her selection does not follow the panel’s recommendations, the administrator shall send written notice of the selection to members of the interview panel and to the Association President. The interview/selection panel can utilize subcommittees or delegate any of its responsibilities.
1.	Only persons who have completed the joint program training on Article 211 and interviewing may participate on an interview/selection panel. Such training shall remain valid until the parties jointly make significant changes in the Article 211 process.
2.	A majority of the interview/selection panel of a building must participate in the interview/selection process. Members of the panel must make themselves reasonably available to participate in the process.
3.	The two most senior applicants qualified by certifica-tion/licensure for the posted position shall be interviewed. The panel may rely on the seniority dates specified on the applications from applicants.
E.	In the case of assignments to multiple buildings and/or city-wide programs, a similarly constituted interview/selection panel shall be created. A position involving multiple building assignments shall not be treated as a vacancy because of a change in building assignment(s) unless over one-half of the total assignment is changed.
E An applicant who accepts an offer to fill a vacancy must complete and sign a selection agreement form.
G.	An applicant who accepts an offer to fill a vacancy is committed to the building or program assignment for three (3) years unless released.
H.	A joint committee, co-chaired by the Executive Director for Human Resources and the President of CEA or their designees, shall be appointed to improve the efficiency of and streamline the procedures for the selection process described in 211.01(D). The joint committee shall implement any procedural changes on which agreement is reached by December 2004.
I.	Complaint Review Procedure
1.	If a teacher, CEA or the administration has a com
29
plaint about how the procedures of Sections 211.01 are carried out, the person or entity must file a written complaint within ten (10) calendar days of the occurrence. The complaint must be served promptly on the administration (Labor Relations) and on CEA, and must set forth a specific description of the complaint and the facts surrounding the process to which the complaint is addressed. Complaints must relate directly to an alleged violation of the process contained in Section 211.01, not to the merits of the staff member selected. The complaining person shall have the burden of proving a violation(s).
2.	A representative of the CEA and of Labor Relations shall meet promptly, review the complaint and decide whether the complaint moves to a neutral conciliator.
3.	Within thirty (30) calendar days of such decision, a hearing will be held before a neutral conciliator agreed upon by the CEA and Board. The conciliator will hold an informal hearing at which the CEA and the administration may introduce evidence and documents, cross-examine witnesses and make arguments. Based on what he/she has heard and seen at the hearing, the conciliator will issue a decision within ten (10) calendar days. He/she will determine whether there has been a violation of Section 211.01 and what the remedy will be. The cost of the conciliator will be borne equally by the CEA and the Board. The conciliator’s decision will have the force and effect of a final and binding arbitration award, and no grievance may be filed, separate from this Complaint Review Procedure, alleging a violation of Section 211.01.
4.	If a final selection on a candidate to fill the vacancy in question has been made, the conciliator has no authority to change or overturn the selection.
HlXYl Involuntary Transfers
Transfers will be on a voluntary basis, whenever possible. However, correct and proper operation of the school district will necessarily require that involuntary transfers be made. In making involuntary transfers, the convenience and wishes of the individual teacher will be honored to the extent that these considerations do not conflict with the instructional requirements and best interests of the school district and the pupils. If the teacher so elects, involuntary transfers will only be made after a conference between the teacher, principal, and administrator of Human Resources, or his/her designated representative from the Human Resources Department, concerning the basis for this transfer. The teacher involved
30
may be accompanied by an Association representative of his/her choice at such conference. After the date the above conference has been made available by the Personnel Office, teachers shall be given a minimum of two (2) school days’ notice before receiving students in their new assignment if the transfer is to be carried out. Teachers transferred involuntarily during the school year, after students have initially reported, shall be provided two (2) school days without pupils to work in the school they are leaving and to work in their newly-assigned school in preparation for their new teaching duties. At least one of the two such days shall be in the newly-assigned school.
211.03 Staff Reductions
A.	Staff reduction transfers which occur because of declining enrollment or because of other personnel reductions at a given school or in a given program shall be based on seniority as provided herein. Seniority shall be measured from the first day of paid status resulting from the most recent employment by the Board as a member of the Association bargaining unit. In case of a tie, the date of Board action to employ shall determine seniority. Except as provided elsewhere, the staff member(s) to be transferred shall be the least senior teacher(s) within the given elementary school’s grade level category to be reduced or within the given middle or high school’s teaching area to be reduced.
B.	Grade level categories in an elementary school shall be kindergarten and grades 1 through 5. Identification of staff reduction teachers shall be based upon grade level assignment prior to reorganization for the following school year.
C.	The staffing level in each teaching area shall be based upon organizational needs in the given school for the following school year. Identification of staff reduction teachers in middle and high schools shall be based upon the teaching area assignment prior to reorganization for the following school year. Seniority shall be the basic criterion for identification of staff reduction teachers within each teaching area. However, the parties recognize that important organizational and staffing needs in a given middle or high school and the complexities created by and the need to utilize multiply-certificated teachers will not constructively permit a rigid adherence to the basic seniority concept. In the event seniority is not followed in the identification of the staff reduction teacher in a given middle or high school, the teacher
31
being transferred shall, upon request, receive written explanation of the major specific considerations leading to such a decision.
D.	In all cases where a staff reduction will occur, a more senior teacher in the grade level category or the teaching area may elect to volunteer for the staff reduction status.
E.	A teacher shall not be designated for staff reduction transfer if such teacher’s transfer would result in a racial balance less than the minimum racial balance practiced in the school system during recent years.
E The parties agree that the assignment of staff in middle and high schools in a manner which provides a range of staff skills and interests needed for the various extra-duty assignments is an important responsibility of the Administration. In the event, in a given middle or high school, no teacher on the staff is interested in and qualified to perform the duties and functions of a given extra-duty assignment, then a teacher on the staff may be transferred on a staff reduction basis. Seniority shall be the basic criterion for identification of the staff reduction teacher. In the event seniority is not rigidly followed in the identification of the staff reduction teacher, the teacher being transferred shall, upon request, receive written explanation of the major specific considerations leading to such a decision.
G. Beginning with and during the term of this Agreement, in the event the Administration determines that staff reduction is necessary in the citywide programs listed below, and as further delineated in a September 1, 1983, memo (amended June 3, 1992) from the Office of Labor Relations to the Association, teachers who are staff reduced and continue on paid status shall have reassignment rights to such city-wide programs for thirty-six (36) months. Reassignment shall be on the basis of seniority as measured from the most recent date of employment by the Board as a member of the Association bargaining unit without regard for unpaid leaves since such date.

211.04 Job Fair
Any positions remaining vacant after August 15 will be staffed with unassigned personnel. One or more job fairs may be held before the start of the school year. Persons may bid for vacancies on the basis of certification and seniority. The Human Resources Department shall make the final assignment decisions. Vacancies filled through job fair(s) and assignment shall be considered filled for two school years. At the end of the second school year those teachers shall be considered staff reduced.
211.05 Miscellaneous
A.	Vacancies that occur on or after the first day of student attendance during the first semester of the school year shall be filled with contract teachers. Vacancies that occur during the second semester may be filled with substitute teachers.
B.	Teachers may express their preferences related to their teaching assignment for the following school year at their assigned building by submitting such preferences in writing to the building principal prior to March 1.
C.	Teachers under contract during a school year will be notified in writing of their teaching assignment for the following school year not later than the close of the current school year. Such notification shall include the teacher’s proposed salary, school assignment and subject assignment. Any change in such assignment required by the needs of the school district will be made known to the teacher, in writing, as soon as possible.
D.	Teachers shall not be involuntarily assigned outside the scope of their teaching certificates or their major or minor field of certification, except in an emergency situation. Such emergency assignment shall not continue beyond the remainder of the contract year.
E.	Involuntary transfers resulting from the evaluation process will be made in compliance with Section 211.02 above.
E Any position filled by a procedure other than the interview/selection process shall be posted as a vacancy on the first teacher workday the following April.
G. A six-member joint Association/Board committee shall be appointed to oversee implementation of Article 211. The joint committee may consider delaying the interview/selection process for teachers in multiple buildings
33
or in city-wide positions, in whole or in part, until 1999.
211.06 Inter-School Travel
In arranging schedules for teachers who are assigned to more than one school, every effort shall be made to limit the amount of inter-school travel.
Article 212
Residence
During the term of this Agreement, the Board will not adopt a policy requiring teachers who are members of the bargaining unit at the time of ratification of this Agreement to reside within the Columbus City School District.
Article 213
Job Sharing
213.01 Teachers may be granted job sharing opportunities annually subject to approval of the building principal, Superintendent/designee and the Board. The costs for job sharing a (1) position shall not exceed the cost of 1.0 FTE position.
213.02 A joint committee of two (2) persons appointed by the President of the Association and two (2) persons appointed by the Superintendent will review and modify, if appropriate, the existing guidelines for a Memorandum of Agreement, which shall be implemented when signed by the President of the Association and the Superintendent.
213.03 Job share agreements approved in writing by the teacher(s), principal(s) and Superintendent/designee shall be recommended to the Board of Education for consideration. Approved job share agreements can be altered by mutual written agreement of the parties (job share teachers, principal(s) and Superintendent/ designee). □

Chapter 300
Article 301
Class Size
301.01 Classes shall be organized and maintained in compliance with the Administrative Policy on Class Size and the class size limitations provided in such policy dated August 31, 1992, or as modified in compliance with the provisions included in such policy as shown below:
Administrative Policy on Class Size Effective August 1,1997
The following shall constitute the Administrative Policy on Class Size of the Columbus Public Schools:
1.	All school and grade level regular elementary classes (kindergarten and grades 1-5) will be organized in each school building on the basis of approximately 25 pupils per classroom teacher. Variations will be necessary because of different grade level enrollment totals. Classes which exceed 30 pupils on October 1 will be reduced so that no class will exceed 30 pupils except that if the teacher(s) involved so elect and the principal so elects, a given class(es) may exceed 30 pupils as an alternative to reorganization of the classes within the given school (29 pupils rather than 30 pupils beginning in 1998-1999 for grades K-3). For class size purposes, mainstreamed special education students shall be counted the same as the percent of the pupil day they spend in a regular classroom.
2.	All middle school academic classes will be organized in each school building on the basis of approximately 30 pupils per classroom teacher. Variations will be necessary because of different grade level enrollment totals. Classes which exceed 35 pupils on October 1 and class loads which exceed an average of 30 pupils per academic period for an individual teacher on October 1 will be reduced so that no class will exceed such maximums, except that if the teacher(s) involved so elect and the principal so elects, a given class or a given teacher’s class load may exceed such maximums as an alternative to reorganization of the classes within the given school. For class size purposes in self-contained classes, mainstreamed special education students shall be counted the same as the percent of the pupil day they spend in a regular classroom.
3.	All high school academic classes will be organized in each school building so as to have an average class size in each departmental area of approximately 28 pupils per class. Classes which exceed 36 pupils on October 1 will be reduced so that no class will exceed 36 pupils, except that if the teacher(s) involved so elect
35
and the principal so elects, a given class(es) may exceed 36 pupils as an alternative to reorganization of the classes within the given school.
4.	All middle and high school nonacademic classes will be organized in each school building so as to have a class size not in excess of the number of pupil stations in each subject area.
5.	Except in certain activity type classes such as keyboarding, physical education, and music, no high school teacher is to instruct more than 180 pupils per day exclusive of study halls. The reorganization necessary to comply with this standard will be completed by October 1.
6.	When a class exceeds the above limits after October 1, the Administration will investigate the specific circumstances and determine the most constructive course of action to reduce, where feasible, the number of pupils to the October 1 class size limits. The investigation will include consideration of enrollment and organizational factors at the building level and will provide for input from the principal and the teacher(s). In cases where a reduction to the October 1 class size limit does not occur, a written explanation will be provided the teacher upon request.
7.	The Administration shall notify the Association at least sixty (60) days prior to any change in this administrative policy, except that such notification shall not occur prior to April 15 of the year in which the Agreement expires. If such notification is made while negotiations for a successor agreement is in progress, the Association may introduce a class size proposal for negotiations even though a negotiations agenda may have been set, unless the issue “class size” is already on said agenda.
30	1.02 The maintenance of equitable class size is a matter of proper concern to the teachers, and to the extent that class sizes create substantial inequities in staffing in relation to comparable courses in the same school, such substantial inequities shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
30	1.03 The Association Building Council shall study and make recommendations to the principal in each middle and high school concerning the number of pupil stations in nonacademic classrooms.
301	.04 The Administration will make a concerted effort to complete the initial class size adjustments within the first eighteen (18) pupil attendance days of the school year.
301	.05 This article is subject to possible modification as
36
a result of the following:
1.	Either party may reopen negotiations using the procedure of Section 1401 if the General Assembly enacts legislation during the term of this Agreement mandating lower class size ratios and providing the funding for class size reductions.
2.	The Superintendent or designee(s) and the Association President or designee(s) shall meet and confer after the 1997-1998 school year to discuss the results of a pilot emphasis project with grades K-3 at specified schools and to consider modification of administrative policy or of this article with respect to class size limits at those grade levels in light of those results.
Article 302
Teacher Class Load
302.01 The class load for middle and high school teachers shall not exceed six (6) academic class periods per day and/or thirty (30) academic class periods per week. The class load for high school English teachers shall not exceed five (5) class periods per day and/or twenty-five (25) class periods per week.
302.02 Elementary Planning-Preparation Time
A.	Full-time teachers in elementary school shall have planning-preparation time averaging approximately forty-five (45) minutes per day. Such planning-preparation time shall be considered to be a portion of the unassigned time during the teacher’s regular work day.
B.	The District shall continue to provide elementary teacher preparation time (averaging 45 minutes/day) consistent with 302.02A. During the 2000-2001 school year, the Superintendent/designee shall designate some elementary schools to pilot forty-five (45) minute staff-collaboration periods per week. Staff collaboration periods may be by grade levels (pri-mary/intermediate) or grades. The Superintendent/designee shall solicit input from the ABC at each school, recommended to be included in the pilot. The building principal and the ABC shall jointly author the final Elementary School Collaboration Time Report, including a school recommendation from each school. A copy of the final Elementary School Collaboration Time Report shall be distributed to the Superintendent/designee, the CEA President/designee and the Director of Labor Relations on or before June 1, 2001.
302.03 Full-time teachers in regular elementary schools teaching kindergarten through fifth grade shall be
37
assured a daily ten (10) to fifteen (15) minute break. Such break shall be free of pupil supervision and other assigned duty responsibilities and shall occur approximately mid-morning or mid-afternoon, as determined by the building principal. Regular or chronic violation of this provision shall be subject to the grievance procedure, provided the building principal and central Administration have been advised of the claimed violations and given a reasonable period of time in which to correct the problem.
302.04 Where unusual scheduling exists the daily average of a teacher’s weekly schedule shall approximate the above time distributions.
302.05 Each elementary staff shall conduct a written ballot to determine whether there shall be one (1) or two (2) fifteen (15) minute recesses per day. The results of such ballot shall be posted on the school’s bulletin board. In the event of a tie, the issue shall be decided by the principal. That status quo shall remain in effect in future school years unless the ABC or the principal calls for reconsideration. Reconsideration can only be called for once per school year. However, a change in that status quo can only be implemented after the first two work days of the regular school year with the principal’s concurrence.
302.06 The parties recognize that a large number of preparations for high school teachers in the academic areas may detract from their teaching effectiveness. Therefore, high school administrators will make an effort, where practical with the assigned staff in relation to the school program, to make teaching assignments to such teachers in a manner that will limit the necessary preparations to three (3) or fewer for distinctively different courses. The parties recognize that certain teaching areas, such as diversified English and foreign language, may tend to have more exceptions to this goal than other teaching areas. The parties also recognize that the financial condition of the school system may negatively impact the Administration’s effort in this regard.
302.07 Kindergarten through seventh grade classroom teachers who determine that a student may be retained, shall develop and submit a Diagnostic Performance Summary plan to the principal prior to June 1. This Diagnostic Performance Summary form and procedures will be mutually developed. The parties shall use the draft form discussed during bargaining on May 25, 2000, as a guide for content. The form to be used shall be in a computerized format (if possible). At the elementary level, the form shall replace the fourth interim
38
report for failing students, technology permitting.
Article 303
Ability Grouping
The Association Building Council in elementary schools shall discuss the matter of ability grouping and make appropriate recommendations to the principal.
Article 304
Study Halls
304.0	1 The Board shall continue efforts to reduce the number and size of study halls which have mandatory pupil attendance.
304.0	2 In academic assist programs in middle schools, the number of pupils under the supervision of a teacher shall not exceed the maximum class size for a middle school academic class. Such supervision by a teacher shall count as an assigned duty.
Article 305
Special Education
305.01 A teacher who objects to the decision of an Individualized Educational Program team may appeal such decision to the appropriate special education supervisor by submitting the objection, in writing, on a mutually agreed upon form, to the building principal for transmittal to such supervisor within three (3) school days. The written objection shall include the specific reasons which formed the basis for the objection. In such an event, the special education supervisor will conduct a conference with the teacher in a reasonably timely manner but not to exceed fifteen (15) school days, unless extended by mutual agreement, after receipt of the objection. If the teacher is not satisfied with the disposition of the conference, the principal will, within three (3) school days after the conference, submit the objection to the Director of Special Education. In such an event, the Director of Special Education will conduct a conference with the teacher in a reasonably timely manner but not to exceed fifteen (15) school days, unless extended by mutual agreement after receipt of the objection. The director shall make a final determination with regard to the objection and shall communicate such decision, in writing, to the teacher in a reasonably timely manner but not to exceed ten (10) school days after the conference. In the event the Director of Special Education determines that the volume of appeals makes it impractical for the director to conduct all such conferences, the director may utilize a designee other than the special education supervisor involved in the previous conference.
305.02 Teachers at Alum Crest, Clearbrook, and Beatty
39
Park schools will continue to be assigned the services of school instructional assistants at present assignment levels through the term of this Agreement.
305.03 The Association Building Councils at Alum Crest, Clearbrook, and Beatty Park schools shall develop and recommend to the principal a training program for their school instructional assistants.
305.04 Elementary, middle, and high school special education teachers will be given one (1) release day each school year to facilitate the completion of the lEPs in a timely manner. The released day is a regular work day and will be scheduled by the Administration with prior notification of the date to the special education teachers. In addition, special education teachers shall be paid four (4) hours annually at the supplemental hourly rate for attendance at IEP meetings or to complete IEP paperwork outside regular work hours. This amount will be paid on the 21st pay date after the office of special education has verified that the teacher has completed and turned in lEPs for all of the teacher’s students. In the event annual lEPs are no longer required, such supplemental compensation shall not be paid.
Article 306
Foreign Language
During the term of this Agreement, the high school citywide course selection sheets shall include French, Spanish, German, and Latin.
Article 307
Elementary Art, Vocal Music and Physical Education Programs
307.01 Regular classroom teachers will not normally be required to be physically present when classes are being instructed by an elementary art, vocal music or physical education teacher.
307.02 Elementary art, music and physical education teachers will provide regular classroom teachers with grades for pupils in their respective classes.
307.03 The Board will provide a sufficient number of elementary art, vocal music, and physical education teachers to staff the following schedule in regular elementary schools:
A.	Art once a week for thirty (30) minutes for one (1) semester in kindergarten; once a week for sixty (60) minutes for one (1) semester in grades one (1), two (2), and five (5), and once a week for sixty (60) minutes for the full year in grades three (3) and four (4).
B.	Vocal music once a week for forty (40) minutes in grades one (1) through five (5) for all year and once a week for thirty (30) minutes for all year in kindergarten.	4q

Chapter 400
Article 401
Teacher Evaluation
401.01
A.	The following number of evaluations shall be conducted by the building administrators based upon continuous experience in the Columbus Public Schools*:
1st and 2nd years ... .2 evaluations
3rd year ...........1 or 2 evaluations at
................administrator’s option
4th and 5th years ... .1 evaluation
Subsequent years ... .1 evaluation every second ...................year, commencing with the ...................seventh year
*“Continuous experience” shall not include the consideration of a school year during which there was a leave of absence in excess of sixty-one (61) days.
B.	The second regular evaluation required in this section shall not be required as long as PAR is in operation.
401.02 The following directives outlined in paragraphs A, B, and C below shall serve as guidelines to the joint committee on evaluation as described in paragraph D below: A. Evaluations provided for in Section 401.01 of this article shall be for the major purpose of assisting the teacher toward improved instruction. “Goals for Improvement,” “Professional Growth Activities,” and “General Statements” sections must be completed by the professional and the evaluator if one or more of the ratings of unsuccessful are recorded.
B.	If the evaluator recommends performance improvements^) for a teacher or professional development consistent with the school’s All School Improvement Plan (ASIP), the teacher must utilize professional development at the teacher’s next opportunity or otherwise within a specified time period.
C.	If a teacher is identified by the district as needing to make progress towards becoming a Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT), the teacher must, as a priority, utilize and complete professional development towards attainment of HQT status.
D.	Any recommendations of the Joint Committee on Evaluation created in the 2003-04 CEA contract shall be consistent with this section (401.02) and shall be implemented for the 2006-07 school year, or such earlier time that is feasible. Such recommendations shall become effective upon execution of a written Memorandum of Agreement by the Superintendent
43
and President of the Association.
401.03 Special Evaluation
A.	When the Board or any of its administrative agents deem that a teacher’s performance may be seriously unsatisfactory and it is their intention to recommend involuntary transfer, non-renewal of contract, or termination of contract or investigate further with the possibility of making any of the aforementioned recommendations, the building administrator shall notify such teacher of his/her intent in writing on a form mutually agreeable to the Board and the Association. Such notification shall set forth the specific areas of alleged unsatisfactory performance. Following such notification the administrator shall evaluate the teacher’s performance, observing all stipulations of this article except Section 401.01. The administrator will observe the teacher at least twice. Each observation will be for at least thirty (30) minutes. A conference shall be held between the administrator and the teacher to discuss the teacher’s performance prior to any final action by the administrator. The teacher may be accompanied or represented by an Association representative at such conference and shall have three (3) days prior notification of the conference. In such conference the principal may be accompanied by a Board representative if the teacher is accompanied in such conference. Final administrative action in regard to the alleged unsatisfactory performance shall not conflict with any provision of this Agreement.
B.	Unusual Condition -Written evaluations provided in Section 401.01 above, except the second evaluation for first and second year teachers, shall be performed before any special evaluation as required by this Agreement, except when conditions threaten the physical or emotional well-being of pupils or when conditions result in a significant disruption of, or threat to, the educational program or the well-being of the school. When such an unusual condition exists: (1) the classroom observations provided in Sections 401.03-A and 401.04 shall not be required if such observations would not substantively contribute to an evaluation of such unusual condition; (2) the Notice of Special Evaluation issued as a part of the special evaluation process shall be accompanied by a written statement identifying the unusual condition, and if applicable, indicating the reason(s) classroom observations would not substantively contribute to an evaluation of such Condition.
44
401.04 Classroom observations of the work performance of a teacher for the purpose of a formal written evaluation shall be conducted openly with the observer visible to the teacher. A minimum of one (1) and a maximum of three (3) such observations shall be accomplished through prior arrangement with the teacher. In addition, a maximum of three (3) such observations may be accomplished at the convenience of the building administrator provided the number of such observations does not exceed the number of observations accomplished through prior arrangement. At least one (1) such classroom observation shall be for a minimum of fifteen (15) minutes in duration.
401.05 A pre-evaluation conference may be requested by either the teacher or evaluator and shall occur if requested by either party. If held, the primary purpose of the conference shall be to discuss procedural matters related to the evaluation process and questions related to that process. The conference may provide the teacher and the evaluator an opportunity to discuss their philosophies as educators, and to give the teacher and the evaluator an opportunity to discuss their short- and long-term goals. No written requirements may be attached to this conference but either party may summarize the conference in writing and may provide a copy of such summary to the other party. Failure to request a pre-evaluation conference does not constitute a procedural violation of the evaluation process.
401.06 A teacher shall be given a copy of any written evaluation or report on an observation. No evaluation or report on an observation will be placed in the teacher’s permanent file or otherwise acted upon without a prior conference with the teacher.
401.07 All evaluations or reports on an observation must be dated and signed by the teacher. Such signature shall not necessarily indicate agreement with the evaluation.
401.08 Teachers shall be permitted to affix comments to any evaluation or report on an observation prior to placement of the evaluation or report in the teacher’s permanent file.
401.09 The factors to be used in evaluations conducted by the building administrators shall be jointly developed by the Association and the Board.
401.10 The factors, forms, and procedures used in all evaluations of teachers shall be mutually developed and agreed to by the Board and the Association. The parties recognize that standardized test scores, by themselves, are not a sound basis for evaluating a teacher’s performance.
401.11 A teacher shall not be represented or accompanied
45
by a representative of any other employee organization at any conference required in Section 401.03-A of this article.
401.12 No member of the bargaining unit shall have his/her limited contract non-renewed without accomplishment of a special evaluation and without accomplishment of such regular evaluations as are required by this article, provided that nothing in this Agreement shall require accomplishment of such evaluations in order (1) to non-renew limited contracts or to suspend limited contracts and/or continuing contracts, in accordance with Article 704 entitled “Reductions in Personnel”; (2) to terminate a limited contract or continuing contract, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code; (3) to non-renew a limited contract teacher providing service under a temporary certificate unless such teacher possesses a regular certificate in another teaching area and has previously provided service under such regular certificate in the Columbus Public Schools; (4) to non-renew a limited contract teacher advised prior to employment that such non-renewal may occur due to the special nature of the specific assignment for which such teacher is being employed.
401.13 No member of the bargaining unit shall be denied a positive recommendation by the administrator of Human resources, to the State Department of Education for the renewal or upgrading of a teaching certificate as a result of an evaluation rating given on an evaluation conducted within the provisions of Article 401.01.
401.14
A.	The evaluation and any related actions involving teachers during the period of assignment to the Peer Assistance and Review Program (PAR Program) shall be in accordance with the procedures established by the PAR Program Panel rather than in accordance with the provisions contained in this Article 401. Such related actions shall include action by the Board based on recommendations by the PAR Program Panel regarding intern teachers and action by the Board based on reports by the PAR Program Panel regarding teachers who have been previously assigned to the PAR Program for intervention.
B.	The provisions of this Article 401 shall apply to teachers assigned to the PAR Program only in the event of administrative action which is not in accordance with the PAR Program Panel procedures. Such administrative action shall only be initiated where the basis for such action is primarily related to concerns other than classroom teaching performance.
46
C.	Any teacher may request to be assigned to the PAR Program by submitting a written request to the Association President. If the teacher requesting assignment to the PAR Program has been given a Notice of Special Evaluation and has more than five (5) years of continuous Columbus teaching experience, such teacher shall be accepted into the intervention phase of the PAR Program. The final determination of whether to admit a teacher with five (5) or less years of continuous Columbus teaching experience to the PAR Program will be made by the PAR Panel.
D.	Teachers who have all successful ratings on their most recent evaluation form shall not be recommended for PAR Intervention by an administrative-initiated referral unless the following has been provided: (1) A serious concern(s) has been identified by the principal or evaluating supervisor and a conference has been held with the affected teacher where the serious concern(s) is identified and discussed with said teacher.
(2)	The principal or evaluating supervisor has provided suggestions and/or assistance to the affected teacher to correct the serious concern(s).
(3)	If the serious concern(s) has not been resolved, a follow-up conference has been held with the affected teacher to so inform said teacher and, if it is the intention of the principal or evaluating supervisor to recommend the teacher for PAR Intervention, to so inform the teacher during this conference.
(4)	A teacher shall not be represented or accompanied by a representative of any employee organization in any conferences required in 401.14D above.
401.15 In the event a teacher performs work under the supervision of more than one (1) supervisor, one (1) supervisor shall be designated as the evaluating supervisor.
401.16 Teachers eligible for continuing service status shall be those teachers qualified as to certification, who within the last five years have taught for at least three years in the District, and those teachers who, having attained continuing contract status elsewhere, have served two years in the District, but the Board upon the recommendation of the Superintendent, may at the time of employment or at any time within such two-year period, declare any of the latter teachers eligible.
Continuing contracts shall be granted only to a teacher
47
with the following certification or licensure status: 1) Any teacher holding a professional, permanent, or life teachers certificate;
2) Any teacher holding a professional educator license who has completed the applicable one of the following:
a)	If the teacher did not hold a master’s degree at the time of initially receiving a teachers certificate under former law or an educator license, thirty (30) semester hours of coursework in the area of licensure or in an area related to the teaching field since the initial issuance of such certificate or license, as specified in rules which the state board of education shall adopt;
b)	If the teacher held a master’s degree at the time of initially receiving a teacher’s certificate under former law or an educator license, six (6) semester hours of graduate coursework in the area of licensure or in an area related to the teaching field since the initial issuance of such certificate or license, as specified in rules which the state board of education shall adopt.
Upon the recommendation of the Superintendent that a teacher eligible for continuing service status be reemployed, a continuing contract shall be entered into between the Board and such teacher unless the Board by a three-fourths (3/4) vote of its full membership rejects the recommendation of the Superintendent. The Superintendent may recommend reemployment of such teacher, if continuing service status has not previously been attained elsewhere, under a limited contract for not to exceed two years, provided that written notice of the intention to make such recommendation has been given to the teacher with reasons directed at the professional improvement of the teacher on or before April 30, and provided that written notice from the Board of its action on the Superintendent’s recommendation has been given to the teacher on or before April 30, but upon subsequent reemployment only a continuing contract may be entered into. If the Board does not give such teacher written notice of its action on the Superintendent’s recommendation of a limited contract for not to exceed two years before April 30, such teacher is deemed reemployed under a continuing contract at the same salary plus any increment provided by the salary schedule. Such teacher is presumed to have accepted employment under such continuing contract unless the teacher notifies the Board in writing to the contrary on or before June 1, and a continuing contract shall be executed accordingly.
A teacher eligible for continuing contract status employed under an additional limited contract for not to exceed two years pursuant to written notice from the Superintendent of the Superintendent’s intention to make
48
such recommendation is, at the expiration of such limited contract, deemed reemployed under a continuing contract at the same salary plus any increment granted by the salary schedule, unless the Board, acting on the Superintendent’s recommendation as to whether or not the teacher should be reemployed, gives such teacher written notice of its intention not to reemploy the teacher on or before April 30. Such teacher is presumed to have accepted employment under such continuing contract unless the teacher notifies the Board in writing to the contrary on or before June 1, and a continuing contract shall be executed accordingly.
A limited contract may be entered into by the Board with each teacher who has not been in the employ of the Board for at least three years and shall be entered into, regardless of length of previous employment, with each teacher employed by the Board who holds a provisional or temporary certificate
Any teacher employed under a limited contract, and not eligible to be considered for a continuing contract is, at the expiration of such limited contract, deemed reemployed under the provisions of this section at the same salary plus any increment provided by the salary schedule unless the Board, acting on the Superintendent’s recommendation as to whether or not the teacher should be reemployed, gives such teacher written notice of its intention not to reemploy the teacher on or before April 30. Such teacher is presumed to have accepted such employment unless the teacher notifies the Board in writing to the contrary on or before June 1, and a written contract for the succeeding school year shall be executed accordingly. The failure of the parties to execute a written contract shall not void the automatic reemployment of such teacher.
The failure of the Superintendent to make a recommendation to the Board under any of the conditions set forth in this section, or the failure of the Board to give such teacher a written notice pursuant to this section shall not prejudice or prevent a teacher from being deemed reemployed under either a limited or continuing contract as the case may be under the provisions of this section.
401.17 Supercession/Applicability of117th Ohio
General Assembly Am. Sub. H.B. No. 330
A.	Subject to Section 401.17(B) of this article, because of the terms of this and other articles of this Agreement, all provisions of 117th Ohio General Assembly Am Sub. H.B. No. 330, and any subsequent law amending those provisions, shall be superseded by this Agreement and inapplicable to members of the bargaining unit.
49
B.	Notwithstanding Section 401.17(A), and subject to Section 401.17(C), of this article, from the time that any cancellation of the PAR Program by the Board becomes effective (1) Am. Sub. H.B. No. 330 and any subsequent law amending the provisions of same shall be fully applicable to the Board except as manifestly inconsistent with this Agreement, and (2) Sections 401.01, 401.02,401.03, 401.04, 401.05, 401.06, 401.12, 401.14, and 401.16 of this article and Sections 404.04 and 404.05 of Article 404 shall be negated and inoperative.
C.	In the event that Section 401.17(B) of this article becomes operative, then, notwithstanding Sections 3319.11(B)(3), 3319.11(C), 3319.11(D), 3319.11(E), 3319.11(G), and 3319.111 of the Ohio Revised Code as enacted by Am. Sub. H.B. No. 330, or any subsequent amendment thereto, the limited or extended limited contract of a teacher may be nonrenewed by the Board without evaluations, hearing, or written Board decision or order thereafter if the written statement describing the circumstances that led to the intention of the Board not to reemploy the teacher provided to the teacher pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Section 3319.11(G)(2) or otherwise recites as a basis for non-renewal (1) a reason for a reduction in personnel or the non-renewal of a limited contract set forth in Article 704 of this Agreement, (2) that the teacher’s current contract entails service being provided under a temporary certificate without the teacher’s possessing a regular certificate in another teaching area under which the teacher has previously provided service in the Columbus Public Schools, or (3) that the teacher has been advised prior to employment that such nonrenewal may occur due to the special nature of the specific assignment for which such teacher was employed.
Article 402
Teacher Contract Forms
402.0	1 Regular Teacher Contracts
All bargaining unit members shall be offered an appropriately worded individual teaching contract.
402.0	2 Supplemental Contracts
A.	Teachers who have supplemental contracts to perform extra duty assignments provided in Article 906, shall be notified by April 30 if such contract is not to be renewed for the following school year. All other supplemental contracts shall automatically be nonrenewed following the performance of the service
50
authorized by the Board, and no action or notification by the Board shall be required in connection with such non-renewal.
B.	The regular distribution of supplemental contracts shall be on or before June 15 of each year.
C.	Supplemental contracts shall contain language which clearly establishes the right of the Board to declare such contracts null and void in the event the school where the service was to be provided is closed. In the event a school is closed, all such contracts for service at the closed school shall be declared null and void, but the Step will not change if the teacher is reemployed in the same supplemental position but at a different school within the District within two years.
D.	Supplemental contracts shall not be awarded until there is sufficient evidence available to the administration of adequate participation. This provision specifically applies to situations where the supplemental contract was not issued the previous year or where participation the previous year was not adequate.
E.	(1) Teachers who have completed three (3) or more consecutive years of service in a school in the extraduty position of senior head coach, football, basketball, baseball, track, volleyball, softball, or wrestling shall be eligible for a three (3) year supplemental contract upon the expiration of their contract. Such three (3) year supplemental contracts shall be offered to such eligible teachers by June 15. No teacher shall be eligible for such three (3) year supplemental contract for more than one (1) such coaching position.
(2) Teachers who are eligible for such three (3) year supplemental contracts shall be offered written reasons for a decision leading to a recommendation not to initially issue or not to renew such a supplemental contract. Any failure to observe this provision in regard to the offering of written statements relative to the non-issuance or non-renewal of such a three (3) year supplemental contract shall be subject to the grievance procedure set forth in this Agreement.
E The parties agree to maintain the past practices regarding the discontinuation of supplemental contracts and prorating of pay when there are insufficient participants for the activity to either begin or continue. This practice has been the most common with freshman and reserve coaching positions and least common with head coaching positions.
402.03 All teacher contracts, provided in Sections 402.01 and 402.02 of this article, shall have language mutually
51
agreed to by the Association and the Board.
Article 403
Professional Personnel Records
403.01 When a complaint is made by the parent of a student or any other member of the public concerning a teacher’s conduct, service, character, or personality, which is deemed serious enough to become a matter of formal record, the teacher shall be informed of the complaint by the principal, and the teacher and principal shall attempt to resolve the complaint of the complaining party.
403.02 When a principal or other administrator finds it necessary to make a notation in a teacher’s file which reflects adversely upon the teacher’s conduct, service, character, or personality, the teacher shall be offered an opportunity to read such notation. The teacher shall acknowledge having read such notation by signature on the actual document filed, with the understanding that such signature does not indicate agreement with its contents. The teacher shall also have the right to answer such notation and said answer shall be attached to the file copy.
403.03 Each teacher or his/her designee shall be guaranteed the right to examine and review his/her personnel file. Prior arrangements for such examination shall be made with the administrator of Human Resources, or his/her designee.
403.04 Upon written request from a teacher, the administrator of Human Resources shall give consideration to removing a notation which reflects adversely upon the teacher from the teacher’s file provided the notation has been in said file for a minimum of two (2) years. If sustained demonstrated improvement in the area noted has occurred such removal shall generally be granted. In the event the request for removal is denied, the written reasons for denial shall be provided to the teacher, and the basis for the denial shall not be arbitrary or capricious. The parties understand that it is unlikely that notations that result from very serious circumstances will be removed. Nothing in this section pertains to ratings or comments on evaluations.
Article 404
Professional Behavior
404.01 A teacher shall be entitled, upon his/her request, to have present an Association faculty representative or other representative of the Association when the teacher is being given a formal reprimand or warning, is being disciplined for any alleged infraction of rules, delinquency, or unprofessional performance, or is being given a
52
recommendation that such teacher resign or take a leave of absence without pay. The request for the presence of a representative of the Association shall not delay such proceedings for more than five (5) school days. A teacher also shall be entitled, upon his/her request, to have present an association faculty representative or other representative of the association when board personnel in authority seek information which that teacher reasonably could believe may lead to his/her discipline. The request for the presence of a representative of the association shall not delay such inquiry by the building administrator(s) for more than one (1) school day, or by central office or external district authority for more than two (2) school days.
404.02 A teacher shall not be given a formal written reprimand or warning, or be disciplined for any alleged infraction of rules, delinquency, or unprofessional performance, without just cause. Any such action shall be subject to the grievance procedure set forth in this Agreement, except that any such action taken in connection with Article 401 shall not be grieved with noncompliance with this paragraph cited as a claimed violation.
404.03 The termination of the contract of a teacher shall not be subject to the grievance procedure set forth in this Agreement. Teachers whose contracts are terminated shall have recourse to their rights under Section 3319.16 of the Ohio Revised Code of Ohio or any successor section.
404.04 The reasons for a decision leading to a recommendation not to reemploy a non-tenured teacher shall be made available in writing to the affected teacher at his/her option.
404.05 Any failure to observe the provisions of Section 404.04 of this article in regard to the giving of written statements relative to reemployment shall be subject to the grievance procedure set forth in this Agreement.
404.06 In general, direct, verbal criticism of a teacher by an administrator in front of students or parents tends to reduce the teacher’s effectiveness in maintaining an orderly teaching environment. As a result, the parties agree that this practice should be avoided where reasonably practical. Agreement to avoid such criticism where reasonably practical is in no way intended to limit the right of the administrator to give direction to members of the teaching staff. In the event a teacher believes that such criticism has occurred, the teacher may request a conference with the administrator to discuss the incident. Following such a conference, in the event the
53
teacher believes that such criticism has again occurred, the teacher may request a conference with the administrator and a representative of the Superintendent. In either conference, the teacher may be accompanied and represented by a representative of the Association, and the administrator may be accompanied by a Board representative if the teacher elects representation.
404.07 Members of the bargaining unit shall not be subjected to repeated and/or extreme verbal abuse by administrators or other agents of the Board. □

601.01 The employment and use of instructional assistants shall also be in accordance with Section 3319.088 of the Ohio Revised Code, guidelines established by the State Board of Education, and guidelines established by the Board. If it becomes necessary to revise the guidelines established by the Board during the term of this Agreement, such revisions will be made only after consultation with the Association in keeping with Article 108.01 of this Agreement. During the term of this Agreement, the number of instructional assistants employed shall be left to the judgment of the school administration, except as provided elsewhere in this Agreement.
601.02 In addition to the system-wide guidelines established by the Board, guidelines, written job descriptions and the assignment of instructional assistants to provide assistance to teachers, nurses, librarians, and other school personnel will be established in each school building by the principal with the advice of the local Association Building Council.

601.04 In those schools in which there are sufficient instructional assistants available, the supervision of all study halls, school yards, lunchrooms and school halls shall be performed by instructional assistants under the direction of a teacher. Therefore, to the extent feasible, the use of teachers will be directed toward the fullest possible utilization of their professional training and capabilities, and their non-teaching duties correspondingly minimized.

Article 701
Sick Leave
701.01 General Rules Pertaining to Sick Leave
A.	Unused sick leave shall be cumulative without limit. For contract teachers, sick leave shall accumulate at a rate of fifteen (15) days per year. All such teachers shall be credited with one and one-half (1.5) days on the second payday of each month. The accruals will occur September through June. The effective date for deducting sick leave credit shall be the final day of each pay-reporting period.
B.	Each new full-time teacher shall be credited with five (5) days of sick leave, which may be used in case any such employee is unable to work because of personal illness or illness or death in his/her immediate family, after beginning his/her employment but before he/she has accumulated that amount of sick leave in the manner provided in paragraph A above. If any of said five (5) days of sick leave is used, it shall be deducted from the total sick leave which he/she may accumulate during the first year of service as provided in Section 701.01A above.
C.	Sick leave for regular teachers employed on other than a full-time basis shall be credited and deducted at the proportionate rate set forth in their contract of employment.
D.	It shall be the responsibility of each teacher to transfer any unused sick leave from a previous employer to the office of the Treasurer of the Columbus Board of Education. When a former teacher in the Columbus School system returns to the employ of the Board, his/her unused accumulated sick leave, if any, shall be automatically reinstated. Such transfer or reinstatement of sick leave will be accepted by the Board provided the teacher’s most recent employment takes place within ten (10) years of the date of the last termination from Ohio public service and provided such sick leave was earned in Ohio public service.
701.02 Sick leave with pay may be used only for the purposes provided in paragraphs A, B, and C below: A. For absence of the teacher due to personal illness, pregnancy, injury or exposure to contagious disease which could be communicated to others. Up to fifteen (15) consecutive school days, or up to thirty (30) consecutive school days if the teacher is required to travel to another country for the adoption, may be taken as sick leave at the time of legal adoption of a child.
B. For absence of the teacher due to illness or injury of someone in the teacher’s immediate family. Immediate family is defined as father, mother, broth
61
er, sister, son, daughter, wife, husband, grandmother, grandfather, grandson, granddaughter, father-in-law, mother-in-law, legal guardian, or foster or step-parents of said teacher; and all dependents as defined by IRS living in the home or any person living in the home to whom a teacher becomes the primary caregiver. A physician must certify the primary caregiver.
(1)	If a teacher is absent not more than three (3) consecutive school days because of the illness of a member of the teacher’s immediate family, the teacher need only make the report of absence required by Section 701.06-A of this Agreement in order to be eligible for sick leave with pay for such absence.
(2)	If a teacher is absent in excess of three (3) consecutive school days for this reason, the teacher must provide the administrator of Human Resources, with a doctor’s certificate setting forth the identity of the patient, the nature of the illness involved and the need for the absence of the teacher in order for the teacher to be eligible for sick leave with pay for such absence.
C.	For absence due to death in the immediate family of a teacher. Death in the immediate family of a teacher is defined to mean the death of the father, mother, brother, sister, son, daughter, husband, wife, grandmother, grandfather, grandson, granddaughter, aunts, uncles, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, legal guardian or foster or step-parents of the said teacher; or dependents as defined by IRS. Absence due to death in the immediate family shall not exceed five (5) consecutive school days.
D.	Assault Leave

(2)	The building administrator or other appropriate administrator was notified as soon as possible of the occurrence.
(3)	The teacher submits to the Human Resources Department the certificate required in case of sick leave absence, accompanied by the physician’s statement required in paragraph (4) below.
(4)	The teacher provides a physician’s statement describ
62
ing the nature and duration of the resulting disability and the necessity of absence from regular employment, with the findings of the physician subject to review by the Board physician.
(5)	In the event the foregoing conditions are satisfied, none of the first forty (40) days of absence resulting from such occurrence shall be deducted from the teacher’s accumulated sick leave or personal leave.
(6)	Workers’ Compensation cannot be received simultaneously with sick leave benefits.
(7)	Any assault leave request that is in dispute will be determined by a joint committee of three administrators and three Association representatives. The three administrators shall not include the administrator who made the initial decision to deny the request, and the three Association representatives shall not include the requesting teacher. The initial decision may be reversed by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the full committee. The joint committee’s decision shall be final and binding.
701.03 Use of Sick Leave Notification
A.	When any member of the bargaining unit is to be absent for a full school day, or a longer period, such absence shall be reported to the principal or to the Substitute Employee Management System, if designated by the principal, at least one hour and thirty minutes prior to the teacher’s normal required reporting time or as soon as possible thereafter by any teacher who wishes to use sick leave in accordance with the above procedures. The teacher shall not be required to state, during this notification, the cause or type of illness involved. If possible, however, the teacher will estimate the duration of his/her absence.
B.	In the event the estimated duration of the absence is expected to be continuous for a period in excess of two weeks (10 school days), or when an absence has been continuous for such a period, the teacher shall advise the administration of the estimated duration of disability by submitting the designated form to Human Resources by the tenth (10th) day of absence and include a physician’s statement. The teacher will provide the Office of Human Resources with written notice at least three (3) school days before intending to return to work.
701.04 A teacher who has been absent on a Monday through Thursday shall inform his/her principal or school clerk by 2:00 p.m. on the day before he/she wishes to return. The administrator shall assume that a teacher who is absent on Friday or the day before the
63
start of a vacation period will return on the next Monday or the first working day after the vacation unless the teacher notifies the principal or his/her designee on Sunday or the last vacation day not later than 7:00 p.m. that he/she will not return to duty on the next day. Whenever it can be determined by the teacher on a Friday or the school day prior to the starting of a vacation that he/she will not be returning to duty on the next scheduled school day, the teacher should let the principal or school clerk know by 2:00 p.m. that he/she will not be returning so that the same substitute teacher can be continued.
701.05 Absence on Saturdays, Sundays, paid holidays, and paid non-work days shall not be charged against sick leave.
701.06 Certificates Required in Case of Sick Leave Absence A. When a teacher is absent, a report for such absence, signed by the teacher, shall be completed by such employee on a form supplied by the Board. Such form shall be filed with the principal or immediate supervisor within three (3) school days following the last day of such absence or three (3) days after the close of a school year, whichever occurs first.
B.	If medical attention was required, the teacher shall list the name and address of the attending physician and the dates when the physician was consulted on the form provided in Section 701.06A above.
C.	Such report shall be made in a manner which will satisfy the requirements of Section 3319.141 of the Ohio Revised Code. The filing of any willfully false statement by a teacher shall be considered by the Board as grounds for disciplinary action in such form and manner as the Board may deem advisable.
D.	Teachers who have been out of school because of serious illness, extending over a period of three or more weeks, must have the approval of the Superintendent before returning to regular school work. The Superintendent or designated central office administrator may require medical or psychological verification of the teacher’s ability to return to work and any limitations on the teacher’s return. In meeting the medical (or psychological) verification requirement, generally the written certification of the teacher’s physician or psychologist is sufficient. In circumstances where the Superintendent or central office designee requires additional explanation, the teacher shall provide a written report from his or her physician or psychologist to the Superintendent or central office designee.
64
E.	Members of the bargaining unit shall not be asked or required to sign a statement authorizing a doctor or hospital to release medical records unless the absence due to illness, injury or pregnancy of the member of the bargaining unit has been challenged, in which case the teacher shall be furnished with the written reasons for such a challenge and the need to examine medical records.
E The purpose of this section is to provide tools for management to curb sick leave abuse. These tools shall not be utilized in an arbitrary, capricious, or harassing manner.
1.	If the principal or supervisor has a question about a teacher’s use of sick leave, the principal or supervisor shall hold a conference with the teacher, at which the teacher shall be represented by the senior faculty representative at that building or Association designee. This step must precede (2) and/or (3) below.
2.	The Superintendent may (but need not always) require written certification to justify use of sick leave from the teacher’s physician when:
a.	There is a pattern of use, such as but not limited to workdays before or after a holiday or vacation period, on Mondays or Fridays, or a certain time of year; or
b.	There is reasonable suspicion of sick leave abuse; or
c.	The teacher has been absent using sick leave for consecutive workdays; or
d.	The teacher has been absent using sick leave for more than ten (10) days total during the same school year; or
e.	The teacher is on an extended absence and the Superintendent has reasonable grounds to question the continued absence, once every thirty (30) calendar days.
3.	The Superintendent may (but need not always) require the teacher to be examined at Board expense by a physician or psychologist designated by the Superintendent when:
a.	The Superintendent wishes to verify the teacher’s fitness for return to work; or
b.	There is reasonable suspicion of sick leave abuse; or
c.	The teacher is on duty but there is a reasonable question whether the teacher is able to perform essential functions of the job; or d. Where the teacher’s personal physician or
65
psychologist certification under (2) above requires additional explanation. The Board-designated physician or psychologist shall provide a written report to the Superintendent.
4.	Under this Section (F) the Superintendent includes the Superintendent or his/her designated central office administrator.

Failure to comply with this regulation shall be deemed an automatic resignation.

703.03 Teachers approved for a sabbatical leave will be notified of their approval by April 30 or as soon thereafter as possible. Teachers on a sabbatical leave shall be entitled to a salary equal to the difference between the teacher’s regular contract salary in effect at the time the sabbatical leave is approved and the minimum bachelor’s degree salary in effect at the time the sabbatical leave is approved.
703.04 A teacher on sabbatical leave will be given an employment contract for the year of leave.
703.05 In order to be eligible for a sabbatical leave, a teacher must have been employed in the Columbus Public Schools for at least five (5) years.

703.09 All such sabbatical leaves shall be granted in conformity with the provisions of Section 3319.131 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Article 704
Reductions in Personnel
704.01 In the event a reduction in the number of teachers is necessary which requires the Board to suspend contracts, such reductions shall be implemented in conformity with paragraph A below, whether in its present form or as revised in compliance with paragraph B below.
A.	When by reason of decreased enrollment of pupils, return to duty of regular teachers after leaves of absence, or by reason of suspension of schools or territorial changes affecting the District, a Board of Education decides that it will be necessary to reduce the number of teachers, it may make a reasonable reduction. In making such reduction, the Board shall proceed to suspend contracts in accordance with the recommendation of the Superintendent who shall, within each teaching field affected, give preference to teachers on continuing contracts and to teachers who have greater seniority.
Teachers, whose continuing contracts are suspended, shall have the right of restoration to continuing service status in the order of seniority of service in the District if and when teaching positions become vacant or are created for which any of such teachers are or become qualified.
B.	During the term of this Agreement, any change to Section 3319.17 of the Ohio Revised Code shall automatically and simultaneously change paragraph A in precisely the same manner without any consultation or agreement by the Board and Association.
704.02 The non-renewal of limited contract teachers resulting from program cancellations or other cutbacks not related to the evaluation or performance of personnel in the bargaining unit shall be accomplished on the basis of seniority in the system within the areas of certification affected by the reduction. Such teachers shall be considered in a layoff status and shall be recalled in the order of seniority as positions are available in their areas of certification. Seniority shall be measured from the first day of paid status as a member of the bargaining unit resulting from the most recent employment by the Board of Education without regard for unpaid leaves since such date. In case of tie the date of Board action to employ shall further determine seniority for layoff only. The Board shall recall all teachers on layoff status in the vari
77
ous areas of certification prior to employment of any new teachers in such certification areas.
Stipulations:
A.	In the event two or more teachers have equal seniority, all determinations in the order of non-renewal and recall within the equal group shall be made by the Administration. In such event the Administration may give consideration to areas of certification, to past Columbus teaching assignments, to past teaching experience in other Districts, and to race or sex where staff balance is a consideration.
B.	As teaching positions become available, teachers who have been reassigned as a result of the reductions of other personnel, may again be reassigned at the discretion of the Administration to a teaching position more closely conforming to their assignment prior to the reduction transfer. More closely conforming is not intended to include geographical location of assignment.
C.	Teachers on layoff status with multiple certifications who are needed to fill an existing vacancy requiring such multiple certifications may be considered on a recall list of the teachers on layoff status who have such needed multiple certifications. Male and female physical education teachers may be considered separately for layoff and recall purposes. Music teachers shall be considered as vocal and instrumental for purposes of layoff and recall (as well as assignment) based upon their election. Current music teachers shall make their election during the fall of 1979 and new employees shall make their election during the first year of employment. Election shall be made on a form which indicates the purposes of the election and which provides for the election of instrumental, vocal or both.
D.	Teachers on a layoff status shall be responsible for keeping the administrator of Human Resources, informed as to their current address and telephone number. Notification of recall by the administrator of Human Resources, shall be to such address and failure to contact the administrator of Human Resources, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the date of mailing shall remove the teacher from layoff status. The administrator of Human Resources, will also attempt a telephone contact of the teacher. Further, failure to accept the offered assignment shall remove the teacher from layoff status. Acceptance of an extra duty assignment shall not be required as a part of such offered assignment. Teachers on layoff status
78
may work as substitute teachers in the Columbus Public Schools without jeopardizing their layoff status.
E.	Teachers who are reemployed from a layoff status shall have all seniority rights restored to their status which were in effect on their last date of employment including but not limited to salary, transfer, and evaluation rights. As an example, a teacher with one year of experience prior to layoff would be given credit for one year of teaching experience on the salary schedule at the time of recall.
E All rights provided in this provision for teachers on a layoff status shall be limited to thirty-six (36) months.
G.	It is understood by the parties that it may be necessary to non-renew a larger number of teachers in various areas of certification than will ultimately be required. In practice, because non-renewal must occur prior to April 30 for the following school year, and because many resignations and retirements do not occur until after that date, many of the staff members who are notified of non-renewal may be recalled prior to the beginning of the following school year. However, the administration shall have the right to utilize substitute teachers in a limited number of positions during September before determining that such positions will be permanently needed and filled by teachers on a layoff status. In addition, substitute teachers may continue to be utilized in the same manner as in the past. In particular, this would include the use of substitute teachers:
(1)	for teachers who are on sick leave;
(2)	for the balance of the school year in vacancies occurring during the second semester; and
(3)	for the balance of the school year in vacancies occurring throughout the school year provided there is a reasonable expectation that layoffs may be necessary the following September.
H.	A teacher on an unpaid leave of absence shall be considered on layoff status if during the period of such unpaid leave the teacher would have been laid off under the provisions of this article had the teacher been on paid status. Further, such teacher shall be returned to paid status after the completion of such leave on the same basis as other teachers on layoff status as provided in this article.
I.	A six-member joint Association/Board committee shall be appointed to advise the administration on problems which may result from the implementation of this provision as such problems are identified by the
79
administrator of Human resources, or the Association.
704.03 The non-retention in employment or the reduction of assignment below six (6) hours per day on a regular basis of Full-Time Hourly Professional Employees (teachers) resulting from program cancellations or other cutbacks shall be accomplished on the basis of seniority among Full-Time Hourly Professional Employees in the system within the program and area of certification affected by the reduction with the following stipulations: A. Seniority shall be measured from the first day of paid status in the earliest year of continuous employment by the Board of Education. To qualify as a year of continuous employment the employee must have worked a minimum of 37 weeks with a minimum of six (6) hours per day on a regular basis during the year.
B.	Such teachers shall be considered in a layoff status and shall be recalled in the order of seniority as contract or full-time hourly positions are available for which they are certified. Such teachers as may be recalled to contract teaching positions may, at the option of the Board, be reassigned at the end of the school year to a full-time hourly teaching position.
C.	All provisions of Section 704.02 of this article not in conflict with Section 704.03 shall also apply to FullTime Hourly Professional Employees.
D.	Any Full-Time Hourly Professional Employee whose assignment is reduced to less than six (6) hours per day on a regular basis shall be considered on layoff status; however, such employee may elect to remain in the less than full-time position without prejudicing his or her rights under 704.03-B above. □

To provide a control mechanism in regard to healthcare cost growth, the parties shall utilize an annual objective accounting of actual claims paid per member per month cost growth in conjunction with an actuarial projection of future cost growth as compared to an agreed upon comparative growth factor. Should the actual or projected annual cost growth exceed the comparative growth rate, the Joint CEA/Board of Education Committee shall be utilized to immediately address such increase to bring the plan into conformity with the comparative growth rate. The following components and process shall be utilized by the committee and the parties:
1.	The district’s Third Party Administrator (TPA) shall provide annually rate renewal information based on an accurate accounting of actual claims paid for the CEA bargaining unit approximately sixty (60) days prior to the close of each benefit year. Such accounting shall be conveyed to the district and the CEA simultaneously and be provided in a format reflecting both a total cost for the unit and an average cost per unit member(s) as adjusted allowing for fluctuations in the size and demographics (single vs. family, spousal coverage, etc.) of the workforce.
2.	The parties shall utilize a health care cost growth rate that is applicable to the timeframe corresponding with the claims benefit year. The rate shall be provided by a third party agreed upon by the parties in a Memorandum of Agreement executed within thirty (30) days of Board approval of this Agreement.
3.	Annually, a mutually selected actuary specializing in health insurance cost analysis shall conduct an actuarial analysis of the plan given the bargaining unit’s demographics, plan design, and actual claims experience. Such study shall be conducted and provided to the parties approximately thirty (30) days prior to the close of the benefit year. Such study shall project for the coming plan year the estimated ‘actual claims paid’ for both single
88
and family bargaining unit members by plan design, and establish the trend to be compared against the comparative growth factor.
4.	Should the district TPA or agreed to actuary convey a report to the parties that the actual or projected increase in average bargaining unit cost of claims paid exceed the comparative growth rate from one plan year to the next, the parties shall take immediate action through the Joint CEA/Board of Education Insurance Committee. Not later than ten (10) business days following the receipt of the adverse actuarial report or claims paid data, the Joint Committee shall meet with the TPA and Insurance Consultant to develop options that address the rising costs. Such options may include but are not limited to plan design changes, changes in service co-pays, changes in premium co-pays, changes in deductibles, mandatory and voluntary wellness initiatives, such other innovative solutions as may be available.
5.	Should the parties fail to agree to a solution within thirty (30) days of receipt of the actuarial report or claims data, the parties shall utilize the following dispute resolution process to resolve which option(s) shall be used to address the growth. Each party shall identify a single option (or preferred combination of options) and submit such to a neutral arbitrator experienced in health benefit administration and labor relations. The arbitrator shall be mutually agreed to for the term of the agreement, or if not mutually agreed to in advance of such dispute, appointed pursuant to Article 111.02.
6.	The arbitrator as described in (#5) above shall expedite a single day of hearing, two days of study and the rendering of a decision within thirty (30) days of appointment. Cost of the proceeding shall be born equally by the parties and not exceed $3,000 in total cost of the proceeding and decision. Such decision shall be final and binding.

Article 811
Voluntary Employee
Separation Assistance Plan (VESA)
811.01 The Board of Education shall solicit the written interest of eligible teachers in participating in the voluntary employee separation assistance plan (VESA). The purpose of a separation program is to reduce the average number of years of service for as many employees as possible in order to reduce cost. The program must not add additional costs to the existing budgets. This program can only be offered once in a five (5) year period. This is a special period certain, dollar certain guaranteed annuity. A teacher is eligible to participate if his or her regular teaching salary for the 1997-1998 school year is at least $46,000. By November 10, 1997, the Board of Education shall send a letter inviting each eligible teacher to indicate in writing whether he or she wishes to participate in VESA.
811.02 Individual teachers shall provide their expression of interest in participating in the VESA plan by filing the signed form provided by the Board of Education with the administrator of Human resources by December 1, 1997. Only eligible participants who file timely completed forms expressing their interest in participating in VESA may participate in the VESA plan. Only eligible participants who file timely completed forms expressing their interest in participating in VESA may participate in the VESA plan workshop(s) given between December 1, 1997 and January 15, 1998.
811.03 A consultant jointly retained by the Association and the Board of Education then shall analyze the cash flow and cost-saving data which will be derived from the timely filed statements of interest and shall provide its analysis to the Association and the Board of Education by December 15, 1997. If that analysis shows a net savings over the next five fiscal years (1999-2003) equal to at least $5,000,000, the Board of Education shall proceed to implement VESA.
811.04 If the Board proceeds to implement VESA, the Board of Education shall notify eligible employees who timely filed expressions of interest in participating in VESA a written notice containing the following elements on approximately January 15, 1998: (a) confirming the
95
teacher’s eligibility to participate in VESA; (b) the Board of Education’s intention to proceed to implement VESA; (c) the deadline for the teacher to complete and file the election form for participation in VESA; and (d) that the election to participate in VESA shall include an irrevocable statement of resignation, subject only to Subsection 811.07 below. The notice shall be accompanied by a form to be completed by the employee. The form shall include a statement of the deadline by which the form must be filed with the administrator of Human resources (that deadline being February 1, 1998), and the fact that filing of the form will constitute an irrevocable resignation, subject only to Subsection 811.07 below.
811.05 The filing of the individual teacher’s form electing participation in VESA plan by February 1, 1998 constitutes an irrevocable resignation effective at the conclusion of the 1997-1998 regular teacher work year, unless the Superintendent or designee elects the District’s option to extend VESA participation into the 19981999 school year under Subsection 811.07 below.
811.06 The Board may limit the number of participants in VESA in the 1997-1998 school year (that is, those whose resignations are effective at the conclusion of the 19971998 regular teacher work year) to a total of four hundred (400) teachers. Within that total, the Superintendent may further limit the number of teachers from assigned teaching fields during the 1997-1998 school year who may participate in VESA, after consultation with the Association.
811.07 The Superintendent, by written notice to the Association on or before March 1, 1998, may elect to extend the option for teachers to participate in VESA into the 1998-1999 school year. Teachers eligible to participate in VESA during the 1998-1999 school year shall be those who: (a) filed a timely completed intent to participate form by December 1, 1997; (b) filed a completed election to participate form with the administrator of Human resources by February 1, 1998; (c) who remained eligible to participate by having a regular teaching salary in 1998-1999 of at least $46,000; and (d) who are precluded from participating in VESA in the 1997-1998 school year because of numerical limits. Such teachers electing to participate in VESA in 1998-1999 must submit a completed election to participate in 1998-1999 form to the administrator of Human resources by February 1, 1999. The Superintendent may elect to limit participation in VESA to a specified number of teachers from assigned teaching fields in 1998-1999, after consultation with the Association.

This change in procedure will be of no cost to the Board and is solely for the purpose of reducing current tax for members of the bargaining unit and will remain in effect so long as Revenue Ruling No. 77-462 remains substantially unchanged.

The Board will have no liability to the members of the bargaining unit for the tax treatment of such employee payroll deductions, and is assuming no additional portion of the cost of such benefits. This Cafeteria Premium Payment Plan will continue to be sponsored by the Board only to the extent that Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code or the
97
regulations promulgated thereunder remain substantially unchanged.

The Board shall pay a proportionate amount of the cost of such insurance as set forth in Section 109.03 (I) (18) of this Agreement. The eligible tutor shall pay the balance of the monthly premium by the payroll deduction schedule.
1009.02 In order to be eligible for such insurance, a tutor must have assigned work averaging fifteen (15) hours per week and must continue to be a member of the bargaining unit. Except for tutors newly employed after October, eligibility will be determined during October and November of each year. Initial coverage shall be effective January 1.
1009.03 Election of the coverages must be made during the annual open enrollment period, not to end before November 30 for tutors. A tutor may not change coverages except during the annual enrollment period. If a tutor drops out of a program or misses his/her share of a monthly premium payment to the Board’s Treasurer, that tutor cannot re-enroll until the next annual enrollment period.
1009.04 Tutors who are eligible to purchase insurance shall also be eligible to utilize payroll reductions for the purpose of purchasing annuities. The Board Treasurer may establish such rules as he/she deems necessary to govern these reductions.
1009.05 The phrase “assigned work averaging fifteen (15) hours per week” means: to be eligible for insurance, the tutor (except for a tutor newly employed after October) must attain fifteen (15) hours per full work week sometime during the period October and November and most likely will continue to render instruction as a tutor for at least fifteen (15) hours per full work week for the balance of the school year. It does not mean the tutor must average a full fifteen (15) hours per week for all work weeks during the school year. If a tutor is deemed eligible for insurance and later slips below fifteen (15) hours per full work week, that tutor may continue to be provided insurance as set forth in this Article 1007 for the balance of that school year (through August), provided the reduction in hours was not through the tutor’s choice, i.e., he/she chooses to drop pupils or declines additional pupils. To be eligible for and to continue such insurance, the tutor must continue to be a member of the bargaining unit as defined in Article 1001. Tutors who avail themselves with insurance coverage provid-
119
ed in Article 1008 and who then become a category of bargaining unit membership other than an hourly rated tutor will not be subject to Article 806B of the Association/Board Agreement.
1009.06 To be eligible for a seventy-two (72) percent Board contribution to insurance as provided in Section
109.03(I)(18), the tutor (except for a tutor newly employed after October) must attain more than twenty-five (25) hours per full work week sometime during the period October and November and most likely will continue to render instruction as a tutor for more than twenty-five (25) hours per full work week for the balance of the school year. It does not mean the tutor must average a full twenty-five (25) hours per week for all work weeks during the school year. If a tutor is deemed eligible and later slips to twenty-five (25) or fewer hours per full work week, that tutor may continue to be provided insurance as set forth in this Article 1008 for the balance of that school year (through August), provided the reduction in hours was not through the tutor’s choice, i.e., he/she chooses to drop pupils or declines additional pupils. To be eligible for and to continue such insurance, the tutor must continue to be a member of the bargaining unit as defined in Article 1001. Tutors who avail themselves with insurance coverage provided in Article 1008 and who then become a category of bargaining unit membership other than an hourly rated tutor will not be subject to Article 806B of the Association-Board Agreement.
1009.07 Effective January 1, 1995, the Board shall provide, at Board expense, $20,000 group term life insurance for tutors eligible for enrollment in the Comprehensive Major Medical Insurance Program as defined in Sections 1008.02 and 1008.05 of this Agreement.

By majority vote of full-time teachers assigned to a building, with the concurrence of the building principal, the date(s) and schedule for Parent-Teacher conferences may deviate from this schedule (with an equal total amount of time). If so, all teachers in that building must comply with selected schedule and date(s). Once the schedule has been determined, that practice shall continue until changed by majority vote with concurrence of the principal.
*Schools will close 1/2 hour early. Members of the bargaining unit assigned to school buildings shall be permitted to leave immediately following pupil dismissal. All other members of the bargaining unit shall be dismissed one hour early. Early dismissal shall not be a reason for reduction in compensation.
NOTE: August 29 and August 30 shall be used for staff meetings and preparation for the initiation of the new school year and the new semester. October 21 is set aside as a day when each school principal and staff may plan for a staff development activity. Staff members would have an opportunity to plan, confer, consult or interact as a means of establishing an improved school atmosphere. Individual staff members are free, however, to attend the Capital Day rather than their own school staff function if they so choose. In schools where no staff development program is planned, the individual staff member must choose to participate in a staff development activity at the local building or some other designated place, approved by the principal, or to attend the Capital Day.

A Professional Meeting/Records Day (pupils not in attendance)
□ Days of no School
O Parent Conference Day, all schools
135
By majority vote of full-time teachers assigned to a building, with the concurrence of the building principal, the date(s) and schedule for Parent-Teacher conferences may deviate from this schedule (with an equal total amount of time). If so, all teachers in that building must comply with selected schedule and date(s). Once the schedule has been determined, that practice shall continue until changed by majority vote with concurrence of the principal.
*Schools will close 1/2 hour early. Members of the bargaining unit assigned to school buildings shall be permitted to leave immediately following pupil dismissal. All other members of the bargaining unit shall be dismissed one hour early. Early dismissal shall not be a reason for reduction in compensation.
NOTE: August 28 and August 29 shall be used for staff meetings and preparation for the initiation of the new school year and the new semester. October 20 is set aside as a day when each school principal and staff may plan for a staff development activity. Staff members would have an opportunity to plan, confer, consult or interact as a means of establishing an improved school atmosphere. Individual staff members are free, however, to attend the Capital Day rather than their own school staff function if they so choose. In schools where no staff development program is planned, the individual staff member must choose to participate in a staff development activity at the local building or some other designated place, approved by the principal, or to attend the Capital Day.

Article 1403
Reform Panel
1403.0	1 The Reform Panel shall facilitate the implementation of (a) initiatives directed at the improvement of teaching and learning conditions in the District, (b) requests for variances that may be submitted by school based shared decision-making cabinets, and (c) instructional and curricular recommendations that may be made by committees created by the panel. The panel shall operate as a joint committee as provided in Article 506 of this Agreement.
1403.0	2 The panel shall have the authority to grant and cancel variances to this Agreement and shall have the authority to require variances in practice in one or more schools. The panel may grant variances for a specific period of time; if not, the variances shall continue until
152
changed. School based shared decision-making cabinets may apply for renewal of variances which are scheduled to expire. Approval by the panel shall require a majority vote of the panel membership. Such approval shall not be unreasonably denied. Variances from this Agreement shall also require the approval of the Superintendent and Association President.
1403.03 All new programs or other initiatives approved by the panel which may result in variances in practice and all variances and all cancellations of variances approved by the panel shall be in writing and shall be signed by the panel chairperson, the Association President and the Superintendent. Any internal processing requirements by the separate parties prior to panel approval shall be left to the separate parties.
1403.04 The panel shall establish application forms and procedures for requesting variances. Such procedures must not require a majority vote by teachers in a building in support of the variance exceeding two-thirds (2/3). Such procedures must be consistent with this Agreement. In addition, to assist in the work of the panel, it shall form and direct committees, including a committee on state-mandated Competency Based Education. If a request for a variance has sufficient support from the building, the requested variance shall be added to the Reform Panel agenda for the next meeting.
1403.05 Notwithstanding Section 202.02 of this Agreement, if there is a panel-authorized shared decision-making cabinet in a school, the Association Building Council shall continue to perform the duties and functions of the ABC as provided in this Agreement, except when any of those duties and functions are assumed by such cabinet and the ABC has been so advised by the cabinet. In such a school the ABC shall be made up of the elected teacher members of the cabinet and the senior faculty representative, who shall serve on both. The cabinet shall have no authority with regard to the PAR Program.
1403.06 The panel shall begin operations with the ratification of this Agreement and shall continue in effect with full authority as provided herein and without regard to the term of this Agreement, until either party notifies the other in writing of its desire to terminate the panel. In the event of such notification, as with the PAR Panel, the authority of the Reform Panel shall be terminated thirty (30) days after such notification. All variances to this Agreement in effect at the time of termination shall be automatically canceled as shall all variances in practices required by the panel except those related to the
153
implementation of state-mandated Competency Based Education or other legally mandated programs.
1403.07 During the thirty (30) day period between notification of cancellation and termination, the panel shall make every effort to provide for an orderly transition period by attempting to minimize problems resulting from the cancellation of variances. The parties recognize that educational sensibility and personnel considerations will not permit some variances to be phased out during this thirty (30) day transition period. No later than the date of termination of the panel, the Board will provide the Association with a timeline for completing the cancellation of any variances that cannot sensibly be completed during the thirty (30) day transition period. In addition, representatives of the Board and Association shall meet promptly and as necessary to discuss such orderly transition and to determine if the parties wish to retain any of the variances. Any variances to this Agreement which the parties wish to maintain must be processed as amendments to this Agreement.
1403.08 The Reform Panel shall be co-chaired by the Association President, or designee, and the Superintendent, or designee. The Reform Panel shall be made up of an equal number of teacher representatives and administration representatives. □

Article 811
Limited Separation Plan (LSP)
811.01 The Columbus Public Schools Board of Education is offering a Limited Separation Plan to staff in order to address budgetary and operational needs going into Fiscal Year 2007. Eligibility, timing requirements, and plan design benefits are contained in the LSP Plan Document as approved by the Board of Education, except as modified in Article 811.02-811.08. The Board's adoption and offering of the LSP is not an on-going contractual obligation.

811.07 In teaching areas where the number of participants exceed the number identified to be released by June 30, 2006, the most senior employees will have preference with
159
the exception of those participants identified in 811.06.
811.08 By mutual agreement, Administration and CEA can identify eligible participants for early departure outside of the limits and other parameters identified in this memorandum.
Memorandums of Agreement Elementary Lunchroom Duty (September 29,1986) (Amended May 29, 2003)
Based on the recommendations of the Joint Committee formed to conduct a study and feasibility of utilizing the supplemental contract approach to elementary school lunchroom supervision, the following guidelines and stipulations are accepted:
A.	The duties and responsibilities of the lunchroom duty teacher shall continue to be the general supervision of pupils in the lunchroom. Lunchroom duty is exercised under the general supervision of the principal.
B.	A supplemental contract shall be issued for one school year or the balance of a school year. The supplemental service may be provided by two teachers on a 50 percent basis for each. The lunchroom duty supplemental contract shall be administered in a manner consistent with Article 905 of the current Board/CEA Agreement. Pay shall be at the 8.00 % rate and shall be paid in two equal amounts on the thirteenth and twenty-first pay dates. The number of lunch periods necessary to accommodate the students in a building shall be determined by the principal. There shall be one supplemental contract for each lunch period (which may be shared by two teachers).
C.	An Instructional Assistant(s), if assigned to lunchroom duty, will work in cooperation with and under the supervision of the lunchroom duty teacher. The number of assistants assigned will be determined by the principal. This program is not intended to reduce the assignment of assistants in the lunchroom.
D.	Teachers accepting the lunchroom duty supplemental contract shall not claim a violation of Section 302.02 as a result of duties connected with such supplemental service.
E.	Lunchroom duty teachers shall be included equally in number on the roster for duties assigned to other staff members. Supplemental contract lunchroom duty teacher(s) shall not be assigned other duties during the regularly scheduled lunch period.
E Lunchroom supervision shall be rotated equally among the staff as a regular duty without extra pay when the paid lunchroom duty teacher is absent. In the event of 160
extended absence by the lunchroom duty teacher where there is not a shared contract, a second contract can be issued for the prorated amount with a corresponding reduction in the original contract. An extended absence is one that lasts or is expected to last 167 beyond one rotation of the staff on lunch duty.
G. Elementary principals will be promptly provided with a description of this program and directions regarding the securing of volunteers for the lunchroom duty supplemental contract. Principals will select a teacher(s) from among the volunteers and forward the name(s) for appointment. In the event there are no volunteers in a school, lunchroom supervision will continue to be assigned as an unpaid duty.
H. During the 1986-1987 school year, the Joint Committee will continue to monitor the program and will make whatever changes they determine are needed. Late in the school year, the Joint Committee will make recommendations to the Superintendent and the CEA President regarding any changes that should be made and specifically recommending continuation or termination of the lunchroom duty supplemental contractprogram. The Superintendent will discuss these recommendations with the CEA President prior to makinga decision regarding the continuation or termination of the program.

Signed by Greg B. Scott for the Board Signed by Richard L. Logan for CEA
Memorandum of Agreement
In connection with the settlement of a new Agreement between the Board of Education and the Columbus Education Association effective August 25, 1986, certain table agreements and commitments were made. They are as follows:
A.	The objection filed with the State Employment Relations Board on behalf of the Columbus Board of
Education with regard to the inclusion of tutors in the CEA bargaining unit will be withdrawn and no further objections, in any form, will be filed on behalf of the Board of
162
Education. Should SERB, at a future date, include tutors in the current teacher bargaining unit, the Board and CEA agree that bargaining after such inclusion between the Board and CEA will establish whatever contractual provisions are applicable to tutors and that none of the provisions of the August 25, 1986, Board/CEA Agreement will automatically apply to tutors.
B.	The six full-time hourly professional employees currently teaching at the North Education Center in the daytime high school program will be offered regular teaching contracts for the 1986-87 school year. The board will not establish new full-time hourly positions in this program. The parties recognize that the work year for teachers in this program will be somewhat different from the regularly adopted school calendar.
The total number of work days will not exceed the number in the adopted calendar.
Memorandum of Agreement
The President of CEA and the Superintendent will appoint committees made up of an equal number of teachers and administrators for the purposes outlined below. The size, specific responsibilities, and any time line expectations of each committee will be determined by the President and the Superintendent and communicated to each committee.
A.	A professional leave committee will be formed to develop and administer a professional leave program for the members of the bargaining unit. The Board will provide up to $100,000 per year for FY 1987, 1988 and 1989. The purpose of this leave program is to improve the professional performance of teachers. The funds provided shall be used to support activities directed toward this purpose. As an example, the funds may be used to pay for registration at a conference, related out-of- town travel expenses and the cost of classroom substitute teachers but shall not be used to pay the teacher for attending a conference.
B.	A committee will be formed to conduct a study and a pilot program designed to assess the desirability and feasibility of utilizing the supplemental contract approach to elementary school lunchroom supervision.
C.	A committee will be formed to study the feasibility and desirability of providing tape recorded, telephone answering service for the use of teachers in reporting their expected absence from work.

Memorandum of Understanding
Discussions within the bargaining process during August, 1983, provided the following clarifications of the
Board/CEA Agreement of September 1, 1983:
A.The Agreement does not provide just cause protection for a teacher who is nonrenewed in accordance with the procedures provided in Section 401.03.
B. With regard to the interpretation of Article 101, a cadet principal, released full time from a regular classroom teaching assignment, is not a member of the bargaining
164
unit.
C.Section 204.04 provides that full-time hourly-rated teachers and those members of the bargaining unit not assigned to a regular school staff shall have a regular work day not to exceed eight (8) hours. This language is interpreted to mean that full-time hourly-rated teachers do not have a lunch period included in such eight (8) hours. Teachers not assigned to a regular school staff have a lunch period included in such eight (8) hours so that such teachers’ actual required work day shall not exceed seven and one-half (7 1/2) hours.
DThe change in Section 901.03 permits the combining of two (2) half-time years for one (1) year of salary experience credit, provided the years being combined occur after July 1, 1983. Such years may be combined even if they are separated by a leave, a break in service, or by a year of full-time service. Previously, the two years being combined had to be consecutive years of service.

Article 1403
Reform Panel
1403.05 Notwithstanding Section 202.02 of this
181
Agreement, if there is a panel-authorized shared decisionmaking cabinet in a school, the Association Building Council shall continue to perform the duties and functions of the ABC as provided in this Agreement, except when any of those duties and functions are assumed by such cabinet and the ABC has been so advised by the cabinet. In such a school the ABC shall be made up of the elected teacher members of the cabinet and the senior faculty representative, who shall serve on both. The cabinet shall have no authority with regard to the PAR Program.
Values of Association Building Council
Building Councils will only be as good as their members make them. If the teachers in a given building assume that they have such a council, that it meets regularly and that it deals with matters of real concern and value to the teachers, they have an effective vehicle for democratic involvement in the decision-making process of their school. On the other hand, in a school where teachers rely on others to make the council work, they may find that they have a democratic council on paper only, or that they have no council at all. Any school that does not develop such a council will be in violation of board policy as well as the negotiated agreement. □

SYLLABUS for use with Appraisal of the Professional Revised - July, 1986
(Note: This Agreement calls for the redesign of the evaluation instrument and process described below.)
Philosophy
The philosophy underlying the development of the Appraisal of the Professional, A Step to Professional Growth, is inherent in the title itself
The essence of this philosophy is evident in the following list of statements:
1.	The appraisal system allows for the development of a close working relationship between the professional and the evaluator. The goal of professional and evaluator must be an authentic attempt to assist in professional growth and development.
2.	The professional appraisal system is linked to professional growth or improvement in the assigned area of responsibility-
3.	Focus of the professional appraisal system is to be on professional performance.
4.	The professional fills many roles, some of which are not limited to the classroom.
5.	Appraisal is to be conducted by the building administrator or other designated evaluator.
6.	The use of the evaluation instrument is flexible enough to meet the needs of all professional staff, regardless of assignment.
7.	Standards of effective performance should be established which are credible to the professional, undiminished by vague and loosely defined terms.
8.	The appraisal system provides a reasonable means with appropriate due process for terminating the employment of personnel who are not performing successfully.
General Procedures
The “appraisal of the professional” must be viewed as a process through which professional performance is evaluated, plans for improvement of performance are formulated and recognition of success is formalized as a part of professional evaluation.
In order to be responsive to the varied assignments of professional educators, the evaluation instrument must be interpreted as it relates to the professional’s assignment. “Teaching Performance,” for professionals performing their responsibilities in areas other than in the classroom, should reflect the effectiveness with which the individual carries out his specific assignment.
In the evaluation of guidance counselors both the counselor and the evaluator should give due consideration to the unique role of the counselor. The document entitled “Guidance Services, K-12 Written Guidance Program Plan,” dated August, 1985, will be useful in understanding the role of the counselor.
Professional personnel who are not assigned to a specific school on a full-time basis will be evaluated by their supervisor and/or other professional who is knowledgeable about the individual’s per
235
formance in a given program or assignment. If the evaluator is a person other than the building administrator, the evaluator shall be identified to the professional at the time of assignment or prior to October 1 of the initial year of assignment of the professional in the position.
The Major Activities Which Must Take Place Under Normal Conditions
1.	The evaluator arranges visitations and/or observations with each professional staff member for whom he/she is responsible for purposes of gather information needed for appraisal of performance.
A.	The following number of evaluations shall be conducted by the building administrators based upon continuous experience in the Columbus Public Schools*:
1st and 2nd years ...........................2 evaluations
3rd year ..............................1 or 2 evaluations at
administrator’s option
4th and 5th years............................1 evaluation
subsequent years ......................1 evaluation every
second year, commencing with the seventh year
‘"Continuous experience” shall not include the consideration of a school year during which there was a leave of absence in excess of sixty-one (61) days
(Under normal conditions where two evaluations are provided above they should be spaced approximately two or more months apart.)
B.	Evaluations provided for in paragraph A shall be for the major purpose of assisting the professional toward improved instruction.
C.	Where a building administrator deems that a professional’s performance is seriously unsatisfactory and it is the evaluator’s intention to recommend involuntary transfer, nonretention of Full-Time Hourly Professional Employees, non-renewal of contract, termination of contract, or investigate further with the possibility of making any of the aforementioned recommendations, the administrator shall notify such professional of his/her intent in writing on the Notice of Special Evaluation form (see attachment). Such notification shall set forth the specific areas of alleged unsatisfactory performance. Following such notification the administrator shall evaluate the professional’s performance, observing all stipulated activities except paragraph A. A conference shall be held between the administrator and the professional to discuss the professional's performance prior to any final action by the administrator. The professional may be accompanied or represented by an Association Representative at such conference and shall have three (3) days prior notification of the conference. Regular evaluations provided for in paragraph A shall be performed before such Special Evaluations except the second evaluation for 1st and 2nd year teachers, or when an unusual condition is deemed to exist.
D.	Classroom observations of the work performance of a pro
236
fessional for the purpose of a formal written evaluation shall be conducted openly with the observer visible to the professional. A minimum of one (1) and a maximum of three (3) such observations shall be accomplished through prior arrangement with the professional. In addition, a maximum of three (3) such observations maybe accomplished at the convenience of the building administrator provided the number of such observations does not exceed the number of observations accomplished through prior arrangement. When unusual conditions are deemed to exist, observations are not required if such observations would not substantively contribute to an evaluation of the unusual condition.
2.	Appraisal conferences are arranged for professionals who are identified in A or C above.
3.	Goals for improvement, professional growth activities and the general statements section must be completed by the professional and the evaluator if one or more ratings of unsuccessful are recorded except when an unusual condition is deemed to exist.
4.	The direct involvement in the evaluation process of persons other than building administrators or immediate supervisors shall be only under the following circumstances: A. The Teacher Personnel Office may determine to become involved in cases where the building administrator or immediate supervisor (1) recommends an involuntary transfer, non-renewal of contract, termination of contract, or non-retention of a Full-Time Hourly Professional Employee as a result of the Special Evaluation; or (2) when an unusual condition is deemed to exist; or (3) upon the professional’s request.
B.	Area Principals, Supervisors (other than the professional’s immediate supervisor) and other personnel shall be involved upon a professional’s request or at the request of the building administrator or immediate supervisor. The role of area principals and supervisors directly involved in evaluation shall be to make recommendations for improvement to the professional being evaluated and such recommendations may also be communicated to the evaluator..
C.	When an evaluation is being conducted as a result of a Special Notice and other personnel do observe the professional’s performance and make any type of report to the evaluator or other administrator, such report shall be provided in full to the professional in a conference among the professional, the evaluator or other administrator, and the observer. The professional shall be entided to Association representation at such a conference.
D.	Final decisions as to a professional’s evaluation shall remain with the building administrator or immediate supervisor, except as provided in the PAR Program.
E.	Nothing in this section 4 is intended to restrict the evaluator from consulting with the Teacher Personnel Office about evaluation practices or procedures in general or to review the practices and procedures related to a specific evaluation of a professional.
F.	When the professional is in the PAR Program.
237
Completing the Appraisal of the Professional Form Background Information
“Grade / subject / position” should be used because not all professional staff are assigned to the classroom. This piece of information can also be used as a check to see if the person is assigned to duties related to his/her major field of study and areas of certification.
“Degrees held” gives some indication of the efforts of the individual toward professional improvement and professional preparation.
“Areas of certification” gives an indication of whether the person is assigned to an area in which he/she has professional competence, and should perform satisfactorily without undue stress.
“Years of continuous Columbus service” can be used as a cross check for the type of contract held and whether to appraise one time or two times a year.
"Service in present school" indicates familiarity with the school staff, pupils, community, and administration.
“Total years of experience” indicates prior professional experience regardless of the system and helps the appraiser form a picture of expected level of performance.
Observation Record
The administrator shall record the observations he/she has made prior to a conference with the professional. The instrument may be dated and initialed by both professional and administrator at the time of observation. In the case of professional personnel performing duties other than in a classroom, the administrator may write “N” for not-applicable. Notations made during or resulting from an observation shall not be placed in the professional’s personnel file.
Verification of Conference
This portion of the instrument complies with Article 401.07 of the negotiated contract, which states, “All evaluations or reports on an observation must be dated and signed by the teacher. Such signatures shall not necessarily indicate agreement with the evaluation.” This signature and date of the conference should be affixed upon completion of the instrument and termination of the conference.
Contents of the Evaluation
The “code” to be used in making the evaluation is as follows: S = Successful - The professional who is meeting acceptable standards of performance.
U = Unsuccessful - The professional who is not meeting the minimal levels of performance or competence expected.
N = Not Applicable - For the professional who is performing duties for which all eight categories or individual categories would not or should not apply.
The professional shall be given a facsimile of the official appraisal instrument and may consider each of the eight items and code in his/her response prior to the conference. Each of the applicable items may be discussed during the conference and the evaluator may transfer the responses from the facsimile on to the official
238
appraisal instrument at the option of the professional.
Goals for Professional Improvement
This portion of the instrument may be filled in at the option of the professional and/or administrator, except when ratings of unsuccessful have been received. In the latter cases, one or more goals for improvement must be recorded by both the professional and the evaluator.
Proposed Professional Growth Activities
This portion provides space for both the evaluator and the professional to suggest specific activities for professional improvement. If one or more ratings of unsuccessful are recorded both the professional and the evaluator must participate in the completion of this section.
General Statements
This portion is provided to meet the following two objectives: 1. Completion of this section by the professional and the evaluator is required if one or more ratings of unsuccessful have been recorded. This provides an opportunity for both parties to comment constructively in regard to those areas marked unsuccessful. Comments in this space should be related to the factors being evaluated. This space is not provided for either party to introduce additional factors or to get in a “final word.”
2. The professional and/or evaluator are encouraged to comment on outstanding levels of performance by the professional.
Evaluator’s Recommendation
An evaluator’s recommendation is to be recorded only in cases in which the evaluation is a Special Evaluation.
Distribution
Following completion of the conference and validation of the appraisal form by both professional and administrator signatures, one copy is to be given to the professional, one is to be sent to the Teacher Personnel Office, and one is to be retained by the building administrator.
PAR
Nothing in this syllabus will prevent the PAR Panel from adopting Intern Evaluation Procedures and Intervention Assistance Procedures as said Panel deems appropriate.
