TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION (T&D) AGREEMENT BETWEEN
CENTRAL HUDSON GAS & ELECTRIC CORPORATION
(hereinafter called the Company) and
LOCAL UNION 320 OF THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS A.F. OF L.-C.I.O.
(hereinafter called the Union)
This agreement is made for the purpose of establishing stabilized conditions of employment, including rates of pay, and working conditions, facilitating the peaceful adjustment of differences that may arise between the parties hereto from time to time, and of promoting harmony and efficiency, to the end that the Company and the Union and the general public may mutually benefit.
In the event the Company should change its name or its ownership, or should sell, lease or transfer its business, or any substantial part thereof, this Agreement shall be binding on its successors and assigns. An absolute precondition to the sale, lease, or transfer of any of the business, or any substantial part thereof, is that any purchaser, transferee, or lessee thereof shall agree to, and become party to, and bound by all the terms, conditions, and obligations of this Agreement including, but not limited to, immediately providing the same wages, benefit plans, level of benefits and all terms and conditions of employment to which such employees were entitled as employees of Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation. Upon satisfaction of the preconditions in the previous sentence, the Company shall be released from any and all future obligations and liabilities under this Agreement, and shall be obligated only for an event which occurred prior to the date of any such sale, lease or transfer (“Preclosing Event”); however, the Company’s liability for any Preclosing Event shall expire thirty-six months after the date of such sale, lease or transfer, or on the expiration of the term of this Agreement, whichever is later (“Open Period”). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, any claim by an employee that relates to a Pre-closing Event which has been brought to the attention of the Company during the Open Period shall be allowed

T&D Agreement (cont’d) - Article I
to be brought forward in the applicable forum to a final determination and remedy, if applicable, subject, however, to applicable limitations in this Agreement and in law. The Company shall provide for a provision in any acquisition agreement that will obligate the prospective buyer(s) to assume this Agreement in its entirety as provided for in this paragraph. The Company shall provide notice of the terms of this Agreement to any prospective successor entity(s). Such notice shall be in writing with a copy to the Union.
ARTICLE I
REPRESENTATION AND RECOGNITION
A.	The Union, having been certified by the National
Labor Relations Board as the bargaining agent for all employees engaged in the transmission and distribution of gas and electricity, and Commercial Representatives, as more specifically set forth in said certifications, is hereby recognized by the Company as the exclusive bargaining agency for all employees in said bargaining unit in all matters respecting rates of pay, wages, hours of work and other conditions of employment; said Bargaining Unit is herein called the “Transmission and Distribution Bargaining Unit” or the “T&D” Bargaining Unit. The Company and Local 320 of the I.B.E.W. have also entered into a collective bargaining agreement dated May 1,2008, covering fulltime bargaining unit employees known as the “Technical, Office and Clerical Bargaining Unit”, or the “TOC” Bargaining Unit. The Company and Local 320 of the I.B.E.W. have also entered into a collective bargaining agreement dated May 1,2008 covering parttime bargaining unit members known as the “Part-Time Bargaining Unit” or the “PT” Bargaining Unit.
B.	A list of the T&D Bargaining Unit job classifications
presently covered hereby and the pay rates applicable thereto are attached hereto and made a part hereof.
C.	The Union shall certify to the Company a list of all
those employees in the T&D Bargaining Unit who are members in good standing in the Union as of May 1, 2008, and from time to time thereafter, shall certify the names of any such employees who thereafter become members. If the Union presents to the Company an authorization signed by each such employee, the Company will deduct from the wages due the amount of Union dues as certified by the Union and will promptly remit the amount so deducted to the Financial Secretary of the Union.
T
&
D
Article I (cont’d) - Article II 3
Such deduction shall, where possible, be made on a weekly basis.
In the event of a dispute as to whether an employee is a member in good standing of the Union, such dispute, so far as it affects the Company’s obligation to deduct for Union dues shall be subject to arbitration as herein provided.
The Company, in making the deduction hereunder, acts only as agent for the Union, and shall not be responsible for errors, negligence, or failure to make deductions if it has acted in good faith.
ARTICLE II
UNION-COMPANY RELATIONSHIP
A.	The management of the Company and the direction of
the working forces, including the right to hire, suspend, discharge for proper cause, promote, demote, transfer, relieve employees from duty because of lack of work, or for other proper and legitimate reasons, and to determine the number and qualifications of employees required to perform the work, are recognized to be in the Company, except as otherwise provided for in this agreement. The Company will give the Union a week’s notice before discharging an employee except in cases where such notice is impracticable.
B.	The Company agrees that during the period of this
agreement there shall be no lockout of members of the Union or the equivalent and the Union agrees that there shall be no strike or the equivalent, it being the desire of both parties hereto to provide an uninterrupted and continuous service to the public.
C.	There shall be no discrimination, interference,
restraint or coercion by the Company or any of its agents against any employee because of the employee’s membership in the Union, or because of any lawful activities on behalf of the Union; and the Union, its members and its agents, shall not unlawfully coerce employees into membership in the Union. No Union activities, which shall interfere with the performance of work, shall be carried on during working time without the consent of the Company.
D.	All employees within the T&D Bargaining Unit who,
on the date of the signing hereof, are members of the Union in good standing in accordance with the Constitution and Bylaws of the Union, or hereafter become members of the Union, shall as a condition of employment, remain members of the Union in good
4
Article II (cont’d)
standing during the period of the agreement. The Union shall be the sole judge of whether or not its members are in good standing. All persons hereafter hired for job classifications within the T&D Bargaining Unit or transferred to job classifications within the T&D Bargaining Unit, shall, as a condition of employment, be required to affiliate with the Union no later than the thirty-first (31st) day after the date of their employment or transfer or no later than the thirty-first (31st) day after the effective date of this section, whichever date is later, and shall maintain membership in the Union during the period of this agreement. In the event that a new employee refuses to join the Union, as required by this section, the Company, upon five days’ written notice from the Union, shall discharge such employee or transfer such employee to a job classification not within the T&D Bargaining Unit, and thereafter such employee shall not be eligible for a job classification within the T&D Bargaining Unit without the consent of the Union. If an employee who is a member of the Union fails to maintain such membership, as required by this section, the Company shall, upon thirty days’ written notice from the Union, discharge such employee or transfer such employee to a job classification not within the T&D Bargaining Unit, the TOC Bargaining Unit or the Part Time Bargaining Unit, and thereafter such employee shall be eligible for a job classification within the T&D Bargaining Unit only if the employee reinstates the employee’s membership in the Union.
E.	Neither the Company nor the Union, through their
officers, members, representatives, agents or committees, shall engage in any subterfuge of any kind for the purpose of defeating or evading the terms of this agreement.
F.	The posting of Union notices on Company bulletin
boards shall be permitted, and definite space shall be allotted for this purpose.
G.	It is the Union’s responsibility to require its members
in the T&D Bargaining Unit to be available to meet the emergency operating needs of the Company. (See 1962+16)
H.	The Company and the Union agree that the operation
or application of various provisions of this agreement shall be subject to all applicable laws prohibiting discrimination against any individual with respect to the status of employment including compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. Whenever the masculine gender is referred to herein, it shall be construed to include the female gender wherever appropriate.

Schedules shall be posted and so arranged that the work periods and days off shall be rotated provided there are sufficient employees to do so. Where employees normally working on shift jobs are scheduled for nonshift work they shall, while so scheduled, conform to the hours and conditions of work of nonshift employees.

T
&
D
Article III (cont’d)7
If any such observed holiday falls on a shift or special schedule worker’s first regularly scheduled day off, the day previous to the employee’s first day off shall be treated as the holiday; and if it falls on the employee’s second regularly scheduled day off, the day following will be treated as the holiday except that if any observed holiday falls on a regularly scheduled day off, such holiday or holidays shall be observed pursuant to the Chart(s) set forth either as an attachment hereto or immediately preceding any index to this Agreement.
Two floating holidays will be granted to be taken during each calendar year. These holidays will be granted if the employee was employed on or before October 1 of such calendar year and notification is given to the employee’s supervisor not less than five working days in advance of such holiday, provided, however, any such holiday cannot be taken on a workday which either coincides with, precedes or follows a holiday referred to in this Article III F and further provided such two floating holidays cannot be taken consecutively.
G.	Employees regularly scheduled to work on the above
holidays and who do work will receive one and one-half times pay for all hours worked and shall receive, in addition, pay for the holiday.
Employees not regularly scheduled to work and who do not work on the above holidays shall receive pay for the holiday at straight time.
Employees called out in an emergency will receive overtime pay at the applicable rate for all time worked in addition to the holiday pay, but the minimum time paid for such holiday work shall be three hours at the applicable overtime rate.
H.	Employees with Sunday as a regularly scheduled day
off in any calendar week shall be paid double time for work on that Sunday, and at time and one-half for work on the other regularly scheduled day off in that calendar week. Employees regularly scheduled to work on Sunday in any calendar week shall receive time and one-half for work on the first regularly scheduled day off and double time for work on the second regularly scheduled day off in that calendar week.
Shift or special schedule employees scheduled for work on Saturday or Sunday between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. will be paid an hourly premium of 5% of Pay Group 19.1 effective May 1,2008, effective May 1,2009, such hourly premium will be increased to 5% of Pay Group 19.1, effective November 1, 2009, such hourly premium will be increased to 5% of Pay Group
8
Article III (cont’d)
19.1, effective May 1,2010, such hourly premium will be increased to 5% of Pay Group 19.1, and effective November 1, 2010, such hourly premium will be increased to 5% of Pay Group 19.1; provided, however, such premium shall not be paid for any work performed for which overtime is paid.
I.	Overtime shall be distributed equitably among
qualified employees in each job classification if they are available. (See +Exhibit M17)
J.	Employees who have worked overtime shall not be
given time off without pay on a regularly scheduled workday to equalize that overtime.
K.	Shift and special schedule employees, the majority of
whose regular scheduled basic workday hours in any workday occur within the period from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m., shall be paid a night differential of 5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour effective May 1, 2008, and effective May 1, 2009, 5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour and effective November 1, 2009, 5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour, effective May 1,2010,5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour, and effective November 1, 2010, 5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour for the total basic hours worked. However, when the basic hours worked in any workday are less than the majority of total hours worked then the night differential shall be paid only for those basic hours worked within the period from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. The night differential shall not be paid for any work performed for which overtime is paid. (See 1969-7)
L.	Shift schedules, including schedules for special
schedule employees, shall be posted four weeks in advance. Shift schedules may be changed as required. However, if a shift or special schedule employee’s posted schedule is changed so that the employee is required to begin work on the revised schedule with less than forty-eight hours’ notice, in the case of shift workers or, in the case of special scheduled workers, either twenty-four hours’ notice if the reason making the notice necessary is within the Company’s control or twelve hours’ notice if the reason making the notice necessary is outside the Company’s control, in advance of the new starting time, the employee shall be paid one and one-half times the applicable rate for the first shift of the revised schedule. However, where a shift worker’s shift is changed to start on an employee’s third consecutive day off and a notice of change is given less than 72 hours in advance, the employee shall be paid one and one-half times the applicable rate for the first shift of the revised schedule. Premium payment for a change of schedule without sufficient
Article III (cont’d)
9
T
&
D
notice will not be paid to an employee who is absent from work on the scheduled day for which such premium would have been payable.
If a shift employee is required to work two consecutive shifts for which the employee would normally be paid straight time, the employee shall receive an additional four hours’ pay at straight time.
Shift employees may exchange workdays or hours within a scheduled workweek provided forty-eight hours’ written notice is given to their supervisor and provided that such exchange will not result in premium payment.
M.	(Reserved)
N.	An employee required to work 16 or more consecutive
hours, shall be allowed a rest period of 8 hours after the termination of said work. If the rest period runs into the beginning of the regularly scheduled basic workday within the basic workweek, such employee shall not lose pay by reason thereof. If the employee does continue working after 16 or more consecutive hours and the period of work extends into the beginning of the regularly scheduled basic workday, the employee shall receive pay at time plus double time instead of straight time for the time worked during the employee’s basic work period which the employee would otherwise have been entitled to take off.
If an employee who has worked 16 or more hours consecutively and thus became entitled to sleep time is asked to report for work again before the commencement of the employee’s next basic workday, the hours actually worked prior to the commencement of the employee’s next basic workday shall be added to the hours of sleep time to which the employee is entitled. (See +Exhibit M10)
An employee who works overtime between the seventh and the fourth hours preceding the commencement of the employee’s next regularly scheduled basic work period, if such overtime is not part of a period of 16 or more consecutive hours of work, shall be entitled to time off at the beginning of the employee’s next regularly scheduled basic work period without loss of pay, equivalent to the number of overtime hours actually worked during the 7 hours immediately preceding the commencement of such basic work period. An employee who becomes entitled to time off under the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence may work the balance of the remaining hours of the employee’s basic work period at the beginning of the next scheduled basic work period. However, the
10
Article III (cont’d)
Company may request the employee to waive the time off to which the employee is entitled under this paragraph and to continue working. If the employee does continue working pursuant to such request, the employee shall receive pay at double time instead of straight time for the time worked during the employee’s basic work period which the employee would otherwise have been entitled to take off.
O.	1. An employee who is called out to work shall be paid for a minimum of three hours’ time at the applicable rate except that if such call-out occurs ninety minutes or less prior to the beginning of the employee’s basic workday or scheduled work period, the employee shall be paid for a minimum of two hours’ time at the applicable rate. (See 1971-3 and 1971+15)
2.	An employee who is scheduled to report to work outside of the employee’s regularly scheduled basic workday or basic workweek shall be paid for a minimum of three hours’ time at the applicable rate with the exception that if such work is immediately before or after the basic workday within the basic workweek, such employee shall be paid at the applicable rate only for the actual time worked. If the Company decides it does not want the employee to work as scheduled, no payment shall be made if the notice of such decision not to work is given before the employee leaves work on the basic workday within the basic workweek immediately preceding the day on which the job was to have been done.
P.	No employee shall be requested or required at any
time to be on call or to stand by except when such employee is paid at the prevailing overtime rate.
Q.	Employees who, at the request of the Company, are sent outside of the existing Central Hudson franchise area to work on the property of another utility shall receive double time.
An employee will be paid double time from the time Central Hudson begins billing the requesting company for the employee’s services. The double time will cease when Central Hudson stops billing the requesting company for the employee’s services.
All other pay provisions except for pay on a recognized holiday shall be suspended during the time such employee is being paid double time in accordance with this section Q. The maximum pay rate on a recognized holiday shall be double time plus 8 hours straight time regardless of the other company’s holiday pay provisions.
Article III (cont’d) - Article IV
11
T
&
D
With respect to a holiday celebrated by the host utility and not celebrated by Central Hudson, pay will be at 8 hours straight time plus double time for all hours worked.
All other provisions and conditions, except as to the double time rate contained in this Agreement, shall apply to such work.
R.	Double time shall be paid for time worked in excess of
16 consecutive hours, except as may otherwise be provided in Article III-N hereof. (See 1973-67)
ARTICLE IV
SENIORITY IN PROMOTION, TRANSFER, LAYOFF AND REEMPLOYMENT
A.	Length of continuous employment in the Company in
job classifications included in Local 320 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers A.F. of L.-C.I.O. shall be known as “seniority” except as provided in Sections C and H of this Article; provided that if the period of continuous employment of any employee extends to a date prior to the establishment of this bargaining unit, such continuous prior employment in any capacity shall be included in that employee’s seniority.*
*See memorandum dated January 13, 1967 regarding former Ellenville Electric Company employees and memorandum dated August 16, 1990 regarding Saugerties Gas Company. (See +Exhibit M2)
B.	1. Service shall be the length of continuous employment with the Company.
2.	On all promotions, seniority shall be applied as provided in this Article.
C.	The provisions of this Article IV shall apply to regular
employees. It shall not apply to temporary employees. Regular employees are engaged without time limitations. Temporary employees may be engaged for work only if it will not result in the layoff of regular employees, and if it is anticipated that the work will not continue for more than six months. If continued beyond six months, temporary employees shall become regular employees with seniority and service starting from the date of employment.
12
Article IV (cont’d)
The provisions of this Article IV shall apply to the classifications of Customer Service Representative-Part-Time and to all job classifications included under the “Part-Time Agreement” by and between the Company and Local 320 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers A.F. of L.-C.I.O. except as follows: Seniority for all employees in such “part-time” classifications shall commence only when such employees are assigned to a classification covered by this Agreement or assigned to a classification covered by the TOC Agreement, and such seniority shall accrue only during the period when such employees are assigned to any classification covered by this Agreement or the TOC Full-time Agreement. Seniority for Customer Service Representatives -Part-Time shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of the CSR - Part-Time Agreement which is part of the TOC Full-Time Agreement. The application of any Customer Service Representative Part-Time and any employee covered by such “part-time” classification, for any vacancy or new position in a classification covered by this Agreement which is posted, shall only be processed if no “full-time” applicant qualifies who is covered by this Agreement or said TOC Full-time Agreement. (See * Exhibit 54, 1985-M*33)
D.	When an employee is to be transferred or demoted,
the Company agrees to confer in advance with the President and Business Manager of the Local Union or an alternate in his absence.
E.	When a vacancy occurs or when a new position is
created within the T&D Bargaining Unit, the Company shall post a notice on its bulletin boards for a period of six working days setting forth the classification, job duties and requirements, hours and days of work, and wage rates. Employees desiring to be considered shall make application to Human Resources setting forth their qualifications. Employees who do not make application within the period of posting the notice shall have no right to consideration for the job. The Local Union shall be supplied with copies of the notice and applications. An employee who has qualified by exam, but has neither withdrawn from the posting nor elected a holding mark only (“HMO”) status, may be assigned to the position and any refusal at the time of assignment will be considered as a return to a former position under Article IV F 6. In addition, any employee who has a holding mark, bids for a position and does not withdraw prior to being assigned to the position, may be assigned to the position and any refusal at the time of such assignment will be considered as a return to a former position under Article IV F 6. The transfer to the new position will be effective within 30 calendar days after acceptance unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Company and the Union.

When the vacancy(s) has been filled for 10 working days the posting will be closed. (See Exhibit M24)
F.	1. The Company shall have the right to determine the classification of a job when it is posted and the minimum qualifications required for any job. Qualifications for any position within Local 320 shall be demonstrated by an examination. The Company shall select from the applicants the number that will take an exam. If no one qualifies, the Company will continue the examination until a qualified individual is selected or the bid list is exhausted. Such selection shall be made in order of seniority. In the event that more than one person receives a passing mark on such examination, seniority among the persons passing shall govern; if two or more employees who qualify for a posted job have equal seniority, length of service in the Company shall govern. If two or more employees of equal seniority and equal service pass an examination for promotion, the employee receiving the highest mark on the examination shall be entitled to the position; except that as between probationary employees the selection will be made based on service from those who qualify by examination.
2.	The examination shall be prepared, given and graded by a committee composed of one representative of the Company and one representative of the Union; except that with respect to the selection of Working Foremen/Forewomen, Chiefs or Commercial Specialists, two examiners from the Company and two from the Union may be appointed. The representatives shall be appointed within six working days after expiration of the posting period. When a personal appraisal is required in connection with job promotion, two representatives of the Union and two representatives of the Company shall prepare and submit their appraisals. Such representatives of the Union for the purposes of this section shall be appointed by the President and Business Manager or other acting executive officer of the Union from individuals presently employed in the highest level of the occupation available. In the event that such representatives are unable to agree upon any question concerning the examination, the dispute shall be referred to the President of the Company whose decision shall be final. (See Exhibits M3 and +M15)
3.	An employee who has passed an examination for any classification shall not be required to take another examination (other than physical) for the same classification within a period of sixty months after the employee has passed such examination, unless the employee’s mark has been voided as specifically provided in this agreement or unless, in the opinion of the Company, the employee’s ability to perform the work has changed or the job content has changed in the interval. Notwithstanding
14
Article IV (cont’d)
the preceding sentence, an employee’s mark for the aptitude portion of a Working Foreman/Forewoman, Chief or Commercial Specialist classification test would not expire at the end of such 60-month period, but would continue so long as such employee is in and remains in the series such employee is attempting to qualify for. However, an applicant wishing to be considered for a position must, regardless of previous qualifications, submit an application for a vacancy each time it is posted.
Applicants who have marked their bid form to indicate that they are applying for the posted position only for the purpose of achieving a “holding mark only” (“HMO”) status shall not be offered such position. Each employee shall be allowed to apply for a posted position for a holding mark only (“HMO”) status once during a calendar year, with the following exception. Applicants who are applying for positions covered under Exhibit 3 (Chief, Working Foreman/Forewoman or Commercial Specialist) shall be allowed to bid for these positions on an HMO status and such applications shall not count as the one HMO allowance during the calendar year.
4.	Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Working Agreement, an employee who receives a mark of 60% or less on an examination for any classification shall not be eligible to take an examination for the same classification within a period of six months unless, in the opinion of the Company, there is a demonstrated need to waive this requirement. However, this sixmonth disqualification shall not apply to the senior applicant.
5.	The following selection and training procedures shall apply only to the following job classifications:
Protective Equipment Tester
Gas Production Man/Woman - Second Class
Stock Handler
General Maintenance Man/Woman - Second Class
Field Clerk/Storekeeper
a.	The selection of a candidate to train for the posted position will be made from those who apply through the use of a general ability examination on which the passing mark shall be 75%. If the applicant for training is transferring to a job in a higher pay group, the employee will be continued at the employee’s present pay and will be trained for the position. If the applicant for training is transferring to a job in a lower pay group, the employee shall go to the highest pay step of the lower pay group or stay at the employee’s existing rate of pay, whichever is lower.
Article IV (cont’d)
15
T
&
D
b.	If the selection of a trainee is made from employees with more than six months’ service with the Company, the seniority provisions applicable to promotions shall apply. In the event the selection is made from employees with less than six months’ service, the selection will be made based on service from those who qualify by examination.
c.	The Company will predetermine the length of time necessary for training in each classification below the posted classification and in the posted classification for which the individual is being trained and so notify the Union. Such training shall be of no less than three nor more than six months’ duration, except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in the job specifications. The trainee’s classification will be increased as progress is demonstrated by passing an appropriate job knowledge examination(s) on which the passing grade shall be 75%. Upon completion of such predetermined training period(s), the trainee will be required to pass such job knowledge test before being assigned to the posted classification and the pay applicable thereto.
If the trainee does not qualify or meet the job requirements within a reasonable qualifying period, such trainee will be returned to the employee’s former classification or the employee’s training period may be extended by agreement between the Company and the Union President and Business Manager.
6.	If the employee selected does not qualify or meet the job requirements within a reasonable qualifying period, the employee will be returned to the employee’s former classification. The employee’s training period may be extended by agreement between the Company and the Union President and Business Manager. If the employee requests in writing to Human Resources to return to the employee’s former position within two weeks of the employee’s transfer, the employee will be reassigned within two weeks to the position from which the employee was transferred (and any person who is filling that position must also return to that person’s former position), and the next senior qualified bidder will be transferred to the vacancy. If on two separate occasions within a three-year period an employee elects to return to the employee’s former position after assignment to another position, the employee shall be ineligible to bid for any position for a period of twenty-four months (measured from the date of the second election to return to the employee’s former position). (See Exhibit 26 and 1987-24)
16
Article IV (cont’d)
In addition, once during the 24-month period an employee may exercise his/her rights to laterally transfer within his/her job classification without, however, any 2-week returnable rights.
7.	In the event no employee passes the job knowledge examination for the vacant position and the classification is not included in the training program listed above, or if the classification is included in the training program but, in the opinion of the Company, the position must be filled before the training program can be completed, the Company in such cases reserves the right to bring in qualified persons from outside the Union. (See 1983-10B)
8.	All applicants outside the T&D Bargaining Unit, the TOC Bargaining Unit and the PT Bargaining Unit will be excluded from the foregoing examination procedures described in this Article until all applicable provisions with respect to selection are exhausted for members of such Units; however, persons from outside the T&D Bargaining Unit, the TOC Bargaining Unit and the PT Bargaining Unit may be included in the exam procedure by mutual agreement. This exclusion, however, shall not apply to the arrangement with respect to the transfer of disabled employees as set forth in Article IX.
9.	A job applicant’s final mark on the examination will be made available to the employee upon the employee’s specific request to the employee’s supervisor; however, marks of other applicants will not be divulged. Furthermore, upon request of an employee, the supervisor, in the interest of employee selfbetterment, shall discuss an applicant’s lack of specific job knowledge or aptitude as demonstrated by the examination with the applicant so that the applicant may have an opportunity to improve the applicant’s knowledge of a job for future opportunities which may arise.
10.	In no event will the specific marks attained be given on individual parts of the examination or individual questions. The results as determined by the examiners shall be final.
G.	When a vacancy occurs or when a new position is
created in the first level of supervision outside of the T&D Bargaining Unit, unless the vacancy is to be filled by the transfer of an unclassified employee, the Company shall post a notice on its bulletin boards for a period of six days setting forth the job duties and requirements and hours of work. When a vacancy occurs or when a new position is created in those unclassified
Article IV (cont’d)
17
T
&
D
positions other than first level supervision which the Company may reasonably expect can be filled by qualified personnel from within the T&D Bargaining Unit, unless the vacancy is to be filled by the transfer of an unclassified employee, the Company shall post a notice on its bulletin boards for a period of six days setting forth the job details and requirements. Employees desiring to be considered shall make application to Human Resources setting forth their qualifications. Upon receipt of such application, the Human Resources division shall immediately forward to the qualified applicant the following information: rate of pay, job duties, hours of work and starting date. The provisions of Article X shall not apply to these promotions to the first level of unclassified positions. (See Exhibit M117)
H.	In the event it becomes necessary to reduce in rank
an employee from an unclassified position, any time within two years after the time of the employee’s promotion and provided the employee has continued to pay Union dues and assessments, the employee shall be returned to the T&D Bargaining Unit, if the employee was promoted from such Unit, and shall assume in it the employee’s seniority, plus seniority equivalent to the time accumulated in the unclassified position. If the employee cannot perform the work to which assigned, the employee’s assignment within a classification covered by this Agreement shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Union. While in the unclassified position, the employee shall have no bidding rights on other jobs within the T&D Bargaining Unit, the TOC Bargaining Unit, or the PT Bargaining Unit; during such time, the employee may continue Union membership, but is not compelled to do so. If the employee was not promoted from the T&D Bargaining Unit, the employee shall not be included in it except by mutual agreement.
Any employee returned to the T&D Bargaining Unit from an unclassified position pursuant to this paragraph shall have such a return considered as a return to a former position under Article IV F 6 hereof.
I.	New employees shall have no seniority for the first six
months of their employment. During such period new employees will be considered probationary and the Company may dismiss them at any time without regard to the other provisions of this agreement. Employees transferring during the probationary period shall have their probationary period extended to six months from the date of transfer, unless the Company is satisfied that it has had the ability thoroughly to appraise an individual’s performance, in which event, the individual, if not to be dismissed as permitted in the prior sentence, will be transferred to regular status and no extension of the probationary period will be
18
Article IV (cont’d)
required. In no event shall such probationary period exceed a period of one year from date of employment.
J.	1. When it becomes necessary to select candidates for beginning jobs in the automatic progression series, an appropriate general ability examination will be given. Of those who pass such an examination, the candidate with the greatest amount of seniority in Local 320 will be selected. (See Exhibit M117)
2.	(Reserved)
3.	When the Company has a need at a particular headquarters for an additional employee(s) in a first-class classification in the automatic progression series, the Company will place a notice on its bulletin boards announcing such need and will consider requests from (1) those employees presently in the same first-class classification in a different headquarters who may want to laterally transfer, (2) those employees who were transferred pursuant to Article iX-D and who retain a first-class rating in such classification, and (3) those second-class and third-class employees presently in the same classification who request a lateral transfer; and any such transfer will be made according to seniority.
4.	When the Company desires to start an applicant in a job subject to automatic progression, the lowest job classification in the progression series shall be posted and the proposed headquarters shall be designated. At any time, or upon completion of the progression, the Company may assign those in the progression series to any headquarters within the T&D Bargaining Unit.
However, before assigning an employee to a headquarters at the first-class level, if no prior notice has been made as provided in Paragraph 3 above, the Company will place a notice on its bulletin boards stating the proposed headquarters and will consider requests as provided in Paragraph 3. (See 1981-M34, 1987+30, and 1987+M27)
5.	An employee who fails to qualify for promotion within the maximum time in grade stated for the particular classification will be reassigned to the classification, pay group and pay step from which such employee entered the program and will be considered ineligible for future training in the craft in which such employee failed to qualify for a minimum of 60 months from the date of such failure, except that an employee who is entitled to an additional opportunity to qualify under Article IV J 6 hereof and who fails such additional opportunity shall have no such reentryright. This reentry-right after 60 months can be exercised once
Article IV (cont’d)
19
T
&
D
only for the craft in question. If there is no vacancy in the classification, pay group and pay step to which such employee is reassigned, the Company shall reassign an employee within that classification pursuant to the provisions of Article IX-D 3 hereof. However, if the employee who fails the test had no such classification because such employee was hired directly into the automatic progression series, such employee may be discharged.
6.	Employees who are on automatic progression at the second-class level and who fail to qualify for a first-class rating will be given one additional opportunity to qualify. The second qualifying examination will be given at the option of the Company any time between six months and one year following the first examination. If such employee fails the second time, such employee will be returned to the job classification, pay group and pay step which such employee held before entering the program and will be considered ineligible for future training in the craft in which such employee failed to qualify. If there is no vacancy in the classification, pay group and pay step to which such employee is reassigned, the Company shall reassign an employee within that classification pursuant to the provisions of Article IX-D 3 hereof. However, if the employee who fails the test had no such classification because such employee was hired directly into the automatic progression series, such employee may be discharged.
7.	A practical qualifying examination covering basic skills required for Linemen/Linewomen - Third Class, the content of which shall be subject to mutual agreement between the Company and the Union, will be given after the first nine months of third-class training. An employee who fails the practical qualifying examination will be reassigned to the job classification and pay step from which the employee entered the program and will be considered ineligible for future training in the Lineman/Linewoman progression series.

K.	An employee who is promoted or transferred shall be
given a reasonable qualifying period in which it shall be determined whether or not the employee can meet the job requirements. During this period the employee shall be instructed and trained in the job. An employee failing to meet the job requirements within this period shall be reassigned to the classification from which the employee was promoted or transferred and the employee’s exam mark will be voided. The foregoing provisions do not apply to job classifications in the automatic progression series.
L.	Employees will be laid off in reverse order of their
seniority when curtailment of activities makes a reduction of the working force necessary. If the employees to be laid off have equal seniority, they shall be laid off in the reverse order of their service with the Company. For purposes of this paragraph only, the term “employees” shall mean all Company employees represented by Local 320 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers A.F. of L.-C.I.O. (excluding those employees under the “part-time” contract) so that layoffs shall be so affected pursuant to a combined list of such employees. (See 1983-M29)
M.	Lists showing service and seniority shall be supplied
to the Union quarterly. The Union shall be given notice of the hiring of new employees within 10 days of their employment. (See 1979-48 and 1981-M21)
N.	1. Employees who are laid off for lack of work and as of the date of layoff have completed one year or more of continuous service, shall be given an allowance of one week’s base pay for each full year of continuous service. If the employee accepts a separation allowance, the Company shall not be obliged to rehire such employee. Such separation allowance must be accepted or rejected, in writing within four weeks after the affected day of layoff. If such separation allowance is rejected, the employee’s rights to reemployment shall be governed solely by the provisions of Article IV-N 2.
2.	If after completion of the post and bid procedure additional employees are needed, employees who have not elected the separation allowance referred to in Article IV-N 1 hereof and who shall, within the applicable “recall” period noted below, by written notice, be offered a position on the basis of “last out - first in” in the classification to be filled:
22
Article IV (cont’d)
Years of Service
Less than 6 months
More than 6 months to 1 year
More than 1 year but less than 2 years
More than 2 years but less than 5 years 5 or more years
Period of Recall Right From Layoff Date No recall 6 months
18 months 24 months 36 months
provided that each such laid-off employee meets the minimum qualifications, the physical condition of the laid-off employee is no worse than at the time of separation and such employee accepts such position by making a written acceptance to the Company within 14 days of either the employee’s written acknowledgment of receipt of the Company’s notice or the date which the U.S. postal authority indicates that it was unable to deliver such notice at the employee’s address last supplied to the Company by the employee. The Company’s notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to such employees, at such employees’ latest mailing address supplied to the Company by the employee and a copy of such notice shall be supplied to Local 320. The employee’s acceptance shall also be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Company’s Human Resources Department.
O.	1. Seniority shall accumulate during the period when an employee is temporarily in the military service, maritime service or merchant marine. When such employee returns from service, the employee shall be placed in the employee’s old classification.
2.	Should a promotion be made while an employee is temporarily in military service, maritime service or merchant marine for which the employee would have been eligible and to which such employee would have been entitled by reason of seniority if the employee had been working at the time, such employee shall, upon return from such service, be placed in the higher classification provided that the employee is able to perform the work and demonstrate qualifications by examination.
3.	In either of the above cases the employee with the least time in the classification that the veteran is eligible for shall be returned to the lower classification from which the employee came. If a surplus is thereby created in the lower classification, the provisions of Article IX, Section D shall be applied.
P.	1. The following shall apply to any returns or reassignment to a classification/position as permitted or required by Article IV thereof:

a.	After the 30th day from the award of the winning bid for the sale/transfer of either of the Plants, no such return or reassignment shall be permitted or required if the result would be that the employee would return or be reassigned to the Production Plant Bargaining Unit.
b.	With respect to any such return or reassignment precluded by paragraphs a and c hereof, the employee shall be assigned to a classification within the T&D Bargaining Unit as the Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine; however, the employees’ wages shall not be less than the pay group and pay step of the classification from which such employee entered the position from which the employee is being assigned.
c.	In all other cases, transfers/assignments to and from the T&D Bargaining Unit shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Exhibit M117.

VACATION - LEAVES OF ABSENCE
A.	1. During the term of this agreement regular employees who have completed the following continuous years of service requirements shall be entitled to vacations in that calendar year as follows:
6 months’ service on or before October 1 1 year’s service on or before October 1 5 years’ service on or before October 1 10, 11, 12 years’ service on or before October 1	1 week 2 weeks 3 weeks 16 days

2.	Pay for each week of vacation shall be five days at the
rate of eight hours of straight time. All vacations will be granted, so far as possible, in accordance with the desires of the employees in the order of their seniority. Any days in excess of ten may be taken within the normal vacation period only if operating conditions permit it; otherwise they must be taken outside of the normal vacation period. The normal vacation period shall be between May 1 and September 1. (See *Exhibit M125)
3.	Employees may elect to take their vacations at any other time to suit their plans, provided that it is possible for them to do so without adversely affecting the operation of the Company’s business.
4.	Employees may in any year defer up to the equivalent of ten days of the vacation to which they are entitled and may use those days during any subsequent year. The time of taking such days shall be subject to the approval of the employee’s supervision and must be taken in units of not less than one day. The maximum accumulation shall be no more than ten days. A regularly scheduled vacation for any current year will in scheduling take precedence over a carry-over vacation proposed to be taken in that year. (See 1981-43)
B.	Should a holiday be observed while an employee is
on vacation, the employee shall be entitled to an additional day off with pay at the beginning or end of the employee’s vacation.

2.	Vacation schedules shall be established and posted on bulletin boards a reasonable time in advance of the normal vacation period. All changes or selections made after May 1 in any year will be made only with the approval of the employee’s supervisor and the agreement of any employee whose vacation is affected thereby.

D.	Reserved
E.	Any employee who leaves the Company for any reason shall
be granted a vacation if taken before the date of separation or given vacation pay if the employee works up to the date of separation; provided, however, that an employee who resigns without giving the proper notice shall not be granted a vacation or given vacation pay. By “proper notice” is meant that the employee shall have informed the Company sufficiently in advance so that the employee shall work at least two weeks before the termination of the employee’s employment with the Company. The vacations granted in these cases shall, for regular employees with more than six months of continuous employment, be one day (eight hours) for each completed month of employment, for regular employees with five or more years of continuous employment shall be one and one-half days (twelve hours) for each completed month of employment, for regular employees with 10, 11 or 12 years of continuous employment shall be 12.8 hours for each completed month of employment, for regular employees with 13 or 14 years of continuous employment shall be 13.6 hours for each completed month of employment, for regular employees with 15 years or more of continuous employment, shall be two days (sixteen hours) for each completed month of employment, for regular employees with 22 years or more of continuous employment, shall be two and one-half days (twenty hours) for each completed month of employment, and for regular employees with 30 years or more of continuous employment, shall be three days (twenty-four hours) for each completed month of employment, starting in each case with the preceding July 1.

F.	The Company will apply the following rule so long as
it is not abused:
In the event that an employee is or becomes ill prior to the employee’s scheduled vacation or is admitted to a legally constituted hospital during the employee’s scheduled vacation and it is determined that the illness or injury was in no way attributable to the employee’s reckless or willful action while on vacation, the period of the employee’s illness or hospital confinement, and any subsequent period of confinement to bed, will be processed in accordance with Section H of this Article. Any remaining vacation will be rescheduled in accordance with this Article. (See 1969-13)
G.	(Reserved)
H.	Payments for personal noncompensable disability
shall be made in accordance with the Disability Benefits Plan filed under the New York State Disability Law. (See Exhibit M82)
In cases involving compensable disability, the Company will for employees having at least six months of continuous service pay the difference between regular take-home pay and the amount received as compensation for the first two weeks.
Payments beyond those above enumerated may be continued in the discretion of the Company. The Company reserves the right to have its own doctor check on claims of disability.
In no case shall the Company be obligated to pay any amounts for a disability with respect to which the employee is entitled to receive insurance proceeds covering lost wages as provided under Article XVIII (“No Fault”) of the Insurance Law of New York.

Upon termination of the employee’s duties the employee shall be reinstated in the employee’s former position provided the
34 Article VIII (cont’d)
employee is physically able to perform the work and it has not been eliminated.
If the position has been eliminated, or the employee is physically unable to perform the work, the employee shall, by agreement with the Union, be placed in a classification for which the employee is qualified, and the employee with the least seniority in that classification shall be returned to the lower classification from which the employee came. If a surplus is thereby created in the lower classification, the provisions of Article IX, Section D, shall be applied. The number of employees on leave of absence for this purpose shall not at any time exceed one unless increased by mutual agreement. (See Exhibit 111).
3.	Employees who have had at least six months of continuous service will be permitted to be absent without loss of pay for not more than five working days, which need not be taken consecutively, because of the death of a father, mother, brother, sister, husband, wife, child, father-in-law or mother-in-law, and not more than three days because of the death of a grandparent or grandchild. (See 1971-M55)
If an employee is on vacation and a death in the family occurs during such vacation, such allowable absence shall not be considered as vacation time.
4.	Regular employees who are members of the National
Guard or Reserve Corps will be allowed up to four weeks’ leave of absence without pay except as hereinafter provided for military duty. If such military duty is required of such members to maintain their status in the National Guard or Reserve Corps and such service is paid for by the Government, and the rate paid for such service is less than the employee’s normal daily compensation, the Company will pay the difference for each day while on military duty, but not in excess of ten days.

6.	Employees who have had at least one year of continuous service will, with the consent of the Supervisor, be permitted to be absent without loss of pay for not more than two working days in any year in the event of sickness in the family or for personal business of a nature that cannot be taken care of in

other than normal working hours. Such time may be taken in increments of not less than two hours with the exception of one hour increments at the beginning or end of the work day. Notification of the need for absence for this reason shall be given to the Supervisor as far in advance as possible. (See 1969-44 and +Exhibit 40)
J.	A regular employee shall be granted a leave of
absence without pay after reasonable notice to the Company, provided that the conditions of work at the time are such that the employee’s services can be spared. Leaves of absence shall accumulate at the rate of one week for each full year of consecutive service with the Company subject to no limitation as to the aggregate weeks of leaves of absence which can be accumulated. Leaves of absence may be taken in whole or in part; provided, however, no employee during the employee’s employment career with the Company may take leaves of absence, which in the aggregate exceed the total leaves of absence accumulated during the employee’s working career with the Company. Leaves of absence taken prior to July 1, 1977, will not be subtracted from an employee’s entitlement on and after July 1, 1977. During these leaves of absence, seniority shall accumulate.
If an employee overstays such leave or if the employee accepts employment elsewhere during such leave without the consent of the Company, the employee’s employment with the Company shall be deemed to have terminated. If a leave of absence is extended by the Company, seniority shall continue to accumulate during such extended leave. (See 1975-16 and 1983-18)

2.	The Company shall have the right to transfer or reassign any employee during the term of this contract due to a layoff or lack of work situation, provided that the Company will not transfer or reassign such employee to a job classification which at the time of transfer has a greater rate of pay than the classification from which the employee is being transferred, excepting therefrom transfers or reassignments resulting in a greater rate of pay due to the operation of the provisions of Article IX-D 3. Any such transfer or reassignment may be made without regard to any provisions of this Agreement other than the provisions of this Article IX-D.
3.	Any transfer or reassignment under this Article IX-D shall be effected by the Company as set forth below and where such transfer or reassignment is to be made based upon consideration of seniority, health, ability, residence and other factors (“SHAROF”), the Company’s decision shall be final after review of such decision with the Union President and Business Manager or an alternate in his absence:
a.	The selection and placement of the employees to be transferred or reassigned from a non-automatic progression series classification shall be made by the Company on the basis of SHAROF. An employee transferred or reassigned pursuant to the provisions of such Article IX-D 3 a, shall be offered the classification from which the employee was transferred or reassigned if a vacancy arises in such classification and if such employee continues to be qualified and physically capable to fill such classification. Such classification shall be offered on the basis of seniority to those employees so transferred or reassigned.
b.	1) The selection of employees to be transferred or reassigned from an automatic progression series classification shall be made (a) from the employees in the first-class level or higher solely on the basis of system-wide seniority where there are no second-class or third-class in progression below the first-class level, and (b) from the second-class or third-class in progression on the basis of SHAROF taking into account all such

second-class or third-class and excluding employees in the first-class level or higher.
2)	An employee, other than an employee in the first-class level or higher, to be transferred or reassigned from an automatic progression series classification shall be returned to the job classification, pay group and pay step from which such employee entered the automatic progression series classification. And, in the event there is no vacancy in the classification to which such employee is transferred or reassigned, the Company shall have the right to make a further transfer or reassignment of any employee in that classification pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (b) or paragraph (a) above, whichever is then applicable.
An employee to be transferred from an automatic progression series in the first-class level or higher with less than ten years’ continuous employment with the Company shall be transferred or reassigned to such classification as the Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine. However, the employee’s wages shall not be less than the pay group and pay step of the classification from which such employee entered the automatic progression series.
An employee to be transferred from an automatic progression series in the first-class level or higher with ten or more years of continuous service with the Company shall be transferred or reassigned to such classification as the Company, in its sole discretion shall determine.
3)	Any employee transferred or reassigned from any automatic progression series classification, below the first-class level and who meets the minimum qualifying standards for testing and who is not discharged pursuant to Article IX-D 3 b 4, shall be given a test to qualify for the next highest rating relating to such employee’s then current classification. Such test opportunity shall not result in any delay in implementing such employee’s transfer or reassignment under this Article IX-D. If the employee fails to so qualify, the employee shall be ineligible for future training in that craft except if
38
Article IX (cont’d)
the failure to qualify is for the first-class rating and is not the employee’s second failure, the employee shall be eligible for future training in that craft and within six months to one year after reentry to that automatic progression classification, such employee shall be given a second qualifying test, failure of which shall result in the consequences set forth in Article IV-J 6 hereof.
4)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, any employee to be transferred or reassigned from the second or third-class level in an automatic progression series classification under this Article IX-D 3 b, who had no prior classification because such employee was hired directly into the automatic progression series, may be discharged.
4.	Any employee transferred or reassigned under this Article IX-D who at the time of such transfer or reassignment has been continuously in the employ of the Company for 10 years or more will not have a reduction in pay during the term of this Agreement by reason of such transfer or reassignment to a job below such employee’s pay group and such employee will be entitled to any general increases applicable to such employee’s retained pay group. All others so transferred or reassigned will be paid the rate of the job to which transferred or reassigned except as may otherwise be provided in this Article IX-D.
(See +Exhibit M43, 1981-11)
5.	The provisions of this Article IX-D shall not apply to employees transferred or reassigned because of physical disability.
E.	Employees who are partially disabled so that they
cannot perform all of the duties of their classification may be transferred from time to time to any job they are capable of performing without compliance with usual examination procedure and without regard to seniority.
Such disability transfer shall not be considered a permanent transfer and any employee so transferred will not be reimbursed for the mileage allowance or moving expenses as described in Article V-P of this Agreement.

In cases not involving Workers’ Compensation or not caused by or contributed to by the negligence or voluntary act of the employee where an employee with ten years or more of continuous service is demoted because of physical disability rendering the employee unable to perform the work required of the employee’s job classification and is transferred to a job carrying a lower rate of pay than the existing rate of pay of the employee, the rate of pay of such employee until retirement, death, resignation or discharge for cause shall not be reduced below the percentages of the employee’s existing pay as shown below at the time of such demotion and the employee will remain in the Plan Class for Group Life Insurance and the Retirement Income Plan that is determined by the base pay of the job classification at the time of the employee’s transfer due to disability, subject to the following sentence: For purposes of the Retirement Income Plan and the Group Life Insurance Plan, the employee shall accrue benefits at the Plan Class level so determined subject, however, to being placed in a higher Plan Class to reflect general wage increases. An employee whose rate of compensation is affected by the provisions of the disability clause will receive one-half of the general increase for the employee’s compensation each year of the contract until the rate for that job equals the employee’s then pay. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any employee, who becomes disabled and is transferred to a job carrying a lower rate of pay under this Article IX E will receive 100% of any general wage increase placed in effect on and after the date when such employee has completed 30 years of continuous service with the Company. (See 1983-M6C and 1985-M37)

54
Article III (cont’d)
J.	An employee required to work 16 or more consecutive
hours shall be allowed a rest period of 8 hours after the termination of said work. If the rest period runs into the beginning of the regularly scheduled basic workday within the basic workweek, such employee shall not lose pay by reason thereof. If the employee does continue working after 16 or more consecutive hours and the period of work extends into the beginning of the regularly scheduled basic workday the employee shall receive pay at time plus double time instead of straight time for the time worked during the employee’s basic work period which the employee would otherwise have been entitled to take off. An employee who works overtime between the seventh and fourth hours preceding the commencement of the employee’s next regularly scheduled basic work period, if such overtime is not part of a period of 16 or more consecutive hours of work, shall be entitled to time off at the beginning of the employee’s next regularly scheduled basic work period without loss of pay equivalent to the number of overtime hours actually worked during the 7 hours immediately preceding the commencement of such basic work period. An employee who becomes entitled to time off under the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence may work the balance of the remaining hours of the employee’s basic work period at the beginning of the next scheduled basic work period. However, the Company may request the employee to waive the time off to which the employee is entitled under this paragraph and to continue working. If the employee does continue working pursuant to such request, the employee shall receive pay at double time instead of straight time for the time worked during the employee’s basic work period which the employee would otherwise have been entitled to take off.
K.	1. An employee who is called out to work shall be paid for a minimum of three hours’ time at the applicable rate except that if such call-out occurs ninety minutes or less prior to the beginning of the employee’s basic workday or scheduled work period, the employee shall be paid for a minimum of two hours’ time at the applicable rate. If an employee who has worked 16 or more hours consecutively and thus becomes entitled to sleep time is asked to report for work again before the commencement of the employee’s next basic workday, the hours actually worked prior to the commencement of the employee’s next basic workday shall be added to the hours of sleep time to which the employee is entitled.
(See 1971-3)
2. An employee who is scheduled to report to work outside of the employee’s regularly scheduled basic workday or basic workweek shall be paid for a minimum of three hours’ time at the applicable rate with the exception that if such work is
Article III (cont’d)
55
immediately before or after the basic workday within the basic workweek such employee shall be paid at the applicable rate only for the actual time worked. If the Company decides it does not want the employee to work as scheduled, no payment shall be made if the notice of such decision not to work is given before the employee leaves work on the basic workday within the basic workweek immediately preceding the day on which the job was to have been done.
L.	No employee shall be requested or required at any
time to be on call or to stand by except when such employee is paid at the applicable rate.
M.	Shift schedules, including schedules for special
schedule employees, shall be posted four weeks in advance. Shift schedules may be changed as required. However, if a shift or special schedule employee’s posted schedule is changed so that the employee is required to begin work on the revised schedule with less than forty-eight hours’ notice, in the case of shift workers or, in the case of special schedule workers, either twenty-four hours’ notice if the reason making the notice necessary is within the Company’s control or twelve hours’ notice if the reason making the notice necessary is outside the Company’s control, in advance of the new starting time, the employee shall be paid one and one-half times the applicable rate for the first shift of the revised schedule. However, where a shift worker’s shift is changed to start on an employee’s third consecutive day off and notice of change is given less than 72 hours in advance, the employee shall be paid one and one-half times the applicable rate for the first shift of the revised schedule. Premium payment for a change of schedule without sufficient notice will not be paid to an employee who is absent from work on the scheduled day for which such premium would have been payable.
If a shift employee is required to work two consecutive shifts for which the employee would normally be paid straight time, the employee shall receive an additional four hours’ pay at straight time.
Shift employees may exchange workdays or hours within a scheduled workweek provided forty-eight hours’ written notice is given to their supervisor and provided that such exchange will not result in premium payment. This section shall not apply to employees occasionally assigned to chauffeur duty, while so assigned.

Article III (cont’d)
N.	Shift and special schedule employees, the majority of whose regular scheduled basic workday hours in any workday occur within the period from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m., shall be paid a night differential of 5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour effective May 1, 2008, and effective May 1, 2009, 5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour and effective November 1,2009,5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour, effective May 1, 2010, 5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour, and effective November 1, 2010, 5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour for the total basic hours worked. However, when the basic hours worked in any workday are less than the majority of total hours worked then the night differential shall be paid only for those basic hours worked within the period from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. The night differential shall not be paid for any work performed for which overtime is paid. (See 1969-M7)
O.	Employees who, at the request of the Company, are sent outside of the existing Central Hudson franchise area to work on the property of another utility shall receive double time.
An employee will be paid double time from the time Central Hudson begins billing the requesting company for the employee’s services. The double time will cease when Central Hudson stops billing the requesting company for the employee’s services.
All other pay provisions except for pay on a recognized holiday shall be suspended during the time such employee is being paid double time in accordance with this section O (Section Q in T&D). The maximum pay rate on a recognized holiday shall be double time plus 8 hours straight time regardless of the other company’s holiday pay provisions.
With respect to a holiday celebrated by the host utility and not celebrated by Central Hudson, pay will be at 8 hours straight time plus double time for all hours worked.
All other provisions and conditions, except as to the double time rate contained in this Agreement, shall apply to such work.
Article III (cont’d) - Article IV

A.	Length of continuous employment in the Company in
job classifications included in Local 320 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers A.F. of L.-C.I.O. shall be known as “seniority” except as provided in Section B of this Article; provided that if the period of continuous employment of any employee extends to a date prior to the establishment of this bargaining unit, such continuous prior employment in any capacity shall be included in that employee’s seniority. (See *Exhibit M2)
T O
C
Service shall be the length of continuous employment with the Company.
B.	The provisions of this Article IV shall apply to regular
employees. It shall not apply to seasonal employees or, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, to employees previously employed by the Company, and in the services of the United States, who return to work. Regular employees are engaged without time limitations. Seasonal employees may be engaged for work only if it will not result in the layoff of regular employees and if it is anticipated the work will not continue for more than six months. If the work continues more than six months, the job will be filled in accordance with the procedures specified in Section D of this Article IV.
The provisions of this Article IV shall apply to the classifications of Customer Service Representative-Part-time and to all job classifications included under the “Part-time Agreement” by and between the Company and Local 320 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers AFL-CIO except as follows: Seniority for all employees in such “part-time” classifications shall commence only when such employees are assigned to a classification covered by this Agreement or assigned to a classification covered by the T&D Agreement, and such seniority shall accrue only during the period when such employees are assigned to any classification covered by this Agreement or the T&D Agreement. Seniority for Customer Service Representatives-
58
Article IV (cont’d)
Part-Time shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of the CSR-Part-Time Agreement. The application of any Customer Service Representative-Part-Time and any employee covered by such “part-time” classification for any vacancy or new position in a classification covered by this Agreement which is posted, shall only be processed if no “full-time” applicant qualifies who is covered by this Agreement or the T&D Agreement. (See *Exhibit M54)
C.	When an employee is to be temporarily or
permanently transferred within the employee’s classification, or demoted, the Company agrees to confer in advance with the President and Business Manager of the Local or an alternate in his absence, and in selecting the person to be transferred shall give consideration to seniority, health, ability, residence, individual preferences of employees and similar considerations; however, the Company’s decision as to who shall be transferred shall be final.
If an individual has been transferred to a new headquarters under this Article IV C and is still assigned to such new headquarters one year following the original transfer, the Company will post for such position seeking to assign an individual to such headquarters. In the event no one bids for such posting, the individual transferred will remain temporarily assigned to the headquarters under this Article IV C.
Where a vacancy exists which is to be filled by posting, no transfer to that vacancy will be made prior to such posting at the request of, or solely for the convenience of, any employee. Nothing herein shall derogate from the right of the Company to make transfers in good faith under the provisions of the preceding paragraph.
D.	When vacancies occur or when new positions are
created within the TOC Bargaining Unit the Company shall post a notice on its bulletin boards for a period of six working days, setting forth the classification, job duties and requirements, hours and days of work, and wage rate of said vacancies, and whether the job to be filled is a vacancy or a new position. Where the Company knows the number of such vacancies or new positions, it shall state such number in the posting; but if the number is indefinite, the Company shall state that “one or more” vacancies
Article IV (cont’d)
59
or positions are open. The transfer to the new position will be effective within 30 calendar days after acceptance unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Company and the Union; but this provision shall not apply to examinations to qualify for future vacancies. When the vacancy(s) has been filled for 10 working days the posting shall be closed. Employees desiring to be considered shall make application to Human Resources setting forth their qualifications. Employees who do not make application within the period of posting of the notice shall have no right to consideration for the job. The Union shall be supplied with copies of the notices. (See Exhibit M24, *Exhibit M86 and 1981*27)
E.	1. The Company shall have the right to determine the classification of a job when it is posted and the minimum qualifications required for any job. Qualifications for any position within the bargaining unit shall be demonstrated by an examination. In the event that more than one person receives a passing mark on such examination, seniority among the persons passing shall govern. If two or more employees who qualify for a posted job have equal seniority, length of service in the Company shall govern. If two or more employees of equal seniority and equal service pass an examination for promotion, the employee receiving the highest mark on the examination shall be entitled to the position, except that as between probationary employees the selection will be made based on service from those who qualify by examination.
2.	The examination shall be prepared, given and graded by a committee composed of one representative of the Company and one representative of the Union; except with respect to the selection of Chief, two examiners from the Company and two from the Union may be appointed. The examination for Customer Service Representative - E.H., Customer Service Representative (3/C, 2/C and 1/C) and the examination for Customer Service Representative - Part-time (3/C, 2/C and 1/C) shall, in addition, require a personal appraisal on which the passing grade shall be 75%. When a personal appraisal is required in connection with job promotion, two representatives of the Union and two representatives of the Company shall prepare and submit their appraisals. Such representatives of the Union shall be appointed by the President and Business Manager or other acting executive officer of the Union. In the event that such representatives are unable to agree upon any question concerning the examination including time, place and content, the dispute shall be referred to the President of the Company whose decision shall be final. (See Exhibits M3 and *M125)

Article IV (cont’d)
3.	An employee who has passed an examination for any classification, shall not be required to take another examination (other than physical) for the same classification within a period of sixty months, unless the employee’s mark has been voided as specifically provided in this agreement or unless, in the opinion of the Company the employee’s ability to perform the work has changed or the job content has changed in the interval. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an employee’s mark for the aptitude portion of a Chief classification test would not expire at the end of such 60-month period, but would continue so long as such employee is in and remains in the series such employee is attempting to qualify for. However, an applicant wishing to be considered for a position must, regardless of previous qualifications, submit an application for a vacancy each time it is posted. (See Exhibit M3 and 1973*M35)
Applicants who have marked their bid form to indicate that they are applying for the posted position only for the purpose of achieving a “holding mark only” (“HMO”) status shall not be offered such position. Each employee shall be allowed to apply for a posted position for a holding mark only (“HMO”) status once during a calendar year, with the following exception. Applicants who are applying for positions covered under Exhibit M3 (Chief, Working Foreman/Forewoman or Commercial Specialist) shall be allowed to bid for these positions on an HMO status and such applications shall not count as the one HMO allowance during the calendar year.
4.	Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Working Agreement, an employee who receives a mark of 60% or less on an examination for any classification shall not be eligible to take an examination for the same classification within a period of six months unless, in the opinion of the Company, there is a demonstrated need to waive this requirement.

a.	The selection of a candidate to train for the posted position will be made from those who apply through the use of a general ability examination on which the passing mark shall be 75%. If the applicant for training is transferring to a job in a higher pay group, the employee will be continued at the employee’s present pay and will be trained for the position. If the applicant for training is transferring to a job in a lower pay group, the employee shall go to the highest pay step of the lower pay group or stay at the employee’s existing rate of pay, whichever is lower. Examinations for customer contact positions shall in addition require a personal appraisal on which the passing grade shall be 75%.
b.	If the selection of a trainee is made from employees with more than six months’ service with the Company, the seniority provisions applicable to promotions shall apply. In the event the selection is made from employees with less than six months’ service, the selection will be made based on service from those who qualify by examination.
c.	The Company will predetermine the length of time necessary for training in each classification below the posted classification and in the posted classification for which the individual is being trained and so notify the Union. Such training shall be of no less than three nor more than six months’ duration, except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in the job specifications. The trainee’s classification will be increased as progress is demonstrated by passing an appropriate job knowledge examination(s) on which the passing grade shall be 75%. Upon completion of such predetermined training period(s), the trainee will be required to pass such job knowledge test before being assigned to the posted classification and the pay applicable thereto.
62
Article IV (cont’d)
If the trainee does not qualify or meet the job requirements within a reasonable qualifying period, such trainee will be returned to the employee’s former classification or the employee’s training period may be extended by agreement between the Company and the Union President and Business Manager.
d.	If in the opinion of the Company the position must be filled before training can be completed, the Company reserves the right to bring in qualified persons from outside Local 320.
8.	(Reserved)
9.	In the event no employee passes the examination(s)
for a posted position, the Company, in such cases reserves the right to bring in qualified persons from outside Local 320. (See 1983-10B)
10.	If the successful applicant for any position within the TOC Bargaining Unit desires to return to the employee’s former position, the employee must within two weeks after the employee’s assignment to the new position forward the employee’s request in writing to Human Resources through the employee’s supervisor. The employee will be reassigned within two weeks to the position from which the employee was transferred (and any person who is filling that position must also return to the employee’s former position), and the next senior qualified bidder will be transferred to the vacancy. If on two separate occasions within a three-year period an employee elects to return to the employee’s former position after assignment to another position, the employee shall be ineligible for a period of twenty-four months (measured from the date of the second election to return to the employee’s former position) to bid for any position within the classification within the work group designated in the posting applicable to the position from which the employee returned. An employee who has qualified by exam, but has neither withdrawn from the posting nor elected a holding mark only (“HMO”) status, may be assigned to the position and any refusal at the time of assignment would be considered as a return to a former position under this paragraph. In addition, any employee who has a holding mark, bids for a position and does not withdraw prior to being assigned to the position, may be assigned to the position and any refusal at the time of such assignment will be considered as a return to a former position under this paragraph. (See Exhibit 26 and 1987-M24)
Article IV (cont’d)

11.	All applicants outside the TOC Bargaining Unit, the T&D Bargaining Unit and the PT Bargaining Unit will be excluded from the foregoing examination procedures described in this Article until all applicable provisions with respect to selection are exhausted for members of such Units; however, persons from outside the TOC Bargaining Unit, the T&D Bargaining Unit, and the PT Bargaining Unit may be included in the exam procedure by mutual agreement. This exclusion, however, shall not apply to the arrangement with respect to the transfer of disabled employees as set forth in Article IX.
12.	A job applicant’s final mark on the examination will be made available to the employee upon specific request to the employee’s supervisor; however, marks of other applicants will not be divulged. Furthermore, upon request of the employee, the supervisor, in the interest of employee self-betterment, shall discuss such employee’s lack of specific job knowledge or aptitude as demonstrated by the examination with the employee so that the employee may have an opportunity to improve the employee’s knowledge of the job for future opportunities which may arise. (See 1981*M25)
13.	In no event will the specific marks attained on individual tests or questions be given. The results as determined by the examiners shall be final.
F.	When a vacancy occurs or when a new position is
created in the first level of supervision outside of the TOC Bargaining Unit, unless the vacancy is to be filled by the transfer of an unclassified employee, the Company shall post a notice on its bulletin boards for a period of six days setting forth the job duties and requirements and hours of work. When a vacancy occurs or when a new position is created in those unclassified positions other than first level supervision which the Company may reasonably expect can be filled by qualified personnel from within the TOC Bargaining Unit, unless the vacancy is to be filled by the transfer of an unclassified employee, the Company shall post a notice on its bulletin boards for a period of six days setting forth the job details and requirements. When such a vacancy is to be filled by the transfer of an unclassified employee, the Company will notify the Union in advance of filling such vacancy. Additional information with respect to job requirements and rate of pay may be obtained from Human Resources. Employees desiring to be considered shall make application to Human Resources setting forth their qualifications. The foregoing provisions shall not apply to positions which the Company feels must be filled by employing college graduates from outside the Company. When a vacancy for
T O

Article IV (cont’d)
Procedures Analyst occurs which is not to be posted, the Company will notify the Union in advance of filling such vacancy. The provisions of Article X shall not apply to these promotions. (See Exhibit M117)
G.	In the event it becomes necessary to reduce in rank
an employee from an unclassified position, any time within two years after the time of promotion and provided the employee has continued to pay Union dues and assessments, the employee shall be returned to the classification within the TOC Bargaining Unit if the employee was promoted from such Unit and shall assume in it the employee’s seniority, plus seniority equivalent to the time accumulated in the unclassified position. If the employee cannot perform the work to which assigned, the employee’s assignment within a classification covered by this agreement shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Union. While in the unclassified position, the employee shall have no bidding rights on other jobs within the T&D Bargaining Unit, the TOC Bargaining Unit or the PT Bargaining Unit; during such time, the employee may continue Union membership, but is not compelled to do so. If the employee was not promoted from the TOC Bargaining Unit, the employee shall not be included in it except by mutual agreement.
Any employee returned to the TOC Bargaining Unit from an unclassified position pursuant to this paragraph shall have such a return considered as a return to a former position under Article IV E 10 hereof.
H.	New employees shall have no seniority for the first six
months of their employment. During such periods new employees will be considered probationary and the Company may dismiss them at any time without regard to the other provisions of this agreement. This probationary period shall not extend beyond six months unless the Company and the Union agree that the circumstances of the case warrant an extension.
I.	An employee who is promoted or transferred shall be
given a reasonable qualifying period in which it shall be determined whether or not such employee can meet the job requirements. During this period such employee shall be instructed and trained in the job. An employee failing to meet the job requirements within this period shall be reassigned to the classification from which such employee was promoted or transferred and the employee’s exam mark will be voided. The foregoing provisions do not apply to classifications in the automatic progression series.
Article IV (cont’d)
65
J.	Employees will be laid off in reverse order of their
seniority when curtailment of activities makes a reduction of the working force necessary. If the employees to be laid off have equal seniority, they shall be laid off in the reverse order of their service with the Company. For purposes of this paragraph only, the term “employees” shall mean all Company employees represented by Local 320 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers A.F. of L.-C.I.O. (excluding those employees under the “part-time” contract) so that layoffs shall be so affected pursuant to a combined list of such employees. (See 1983-M29)
K.	Lists showing service and seniority shall be supplied
to the Union quarterly. The Union shall be given notice of the hiring of new employees within 10 days of their employment. (See 1979-48 and 1981-M21)
L.	1.	Employees who are laid off for lack of work and as of
the date of layoff have completed one year or more of continuous service, shall be given an allowance of one week’s base pay for each full year of continuous service. If the employee accepts a separation allowance, the Company shall not be obliged to rehire such employee. Such separation allowance must be accepted or rejected in writing within four weeks after the effective day of layoff. If such separation allowance is rejected, the employee’s rights to re-employment shall be governed solely by the provisions of Article IV-L 2.
2.	If after completion of the post and bid procedure additional employees are needed, employees who have not elected the separation allowance referred to in Article IV-L 1 hereof and who shall, within the applicable “recall” period noted below, by written notice, be offered a position on the basis of “last out, first in” in the classification to be filled:
T O
C
Period of Recall Right
Years of Service	From Layoff Date
Less than 6 months	No	recall
More than 6 months to 1 year	6	months
More than 1 year but less than 2	years	18	months
More than 2 years but less than	5 years	24	months
5 or more years	36 months
66
Article IV (cont’d)
provided that each such laid-off employee meets the minimum qualifications, the physical condition of the laid-off employee is no worse than at the time of separation and such employee accepts such position by making a written acceptance to the Company within 14 days of either the employee’s written acknowledgment of receipt of the Company’s notice or the date which the U.S. postal authority indicates that it was unable to deliver such notice at the employee’s address last supplied to the Company by the employee. The Company’s notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to such employees, at such employees’ latest mailing address supplied to the Company by the employee and a copy of such notice shall be supplied to Local 320. The employee’s acceptance shall also be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Company’s Human Resources Department.
M.	1. Seniority shall accumulate during the period when an employee is temporarily in the military service, maritime service or merchant marine.
2.	Should a promotion be made while an employee is temporarily in military service, maritime service or merchant marine to which such employee would have been entitled if working at the time, such employee shall, upon return from such service, be placed in the higher classification provided that such employee is able to perform the work, and the employee with the least seniority in that classification shall be returned to the lower classification from which the employee came. If a surplus is thereby created in the lower classification, the provisions of Article IX, Section D shall be applied.
N.	1. When it becomes necessary to select candidates for beginning jobs in the automatic progression series an appropriate general ability examination will be given. Of those who pass such an examination, the candidate with the greatest amount of continuous seniority in Local 320 will be selected. (See Exhibit M117).
2.	When the Company has a need at a particular headquarters for additional employee(s) in a first-class classification in the automatic progression series, the Company will place a notice on its bulletin boards announcing such need and will consider requests from (1) those employees presently in the same first-class classification in a different headquarters who may want to laterally transfer, (2) those employees who were transferred pursuant to Article IX-D and who retain a first-class
Article IV (cont’d)
67
rating in such classification, and (3) those second-class and third-class employees presently in the same classification who request a lateral transfer; and any such transfer will be made according to seniority.
3.	When the Company desires to start an applicant in a job subject to automatic progression, the lowest job classification in the progression series shall be posted and the proposed headquarters shall be designated. At any time, or upon completion of the progression, the Company may assign those in the progression series to any headquarters within the TOC Bargaining Unit. (See 1987*56)
However, before assigning an employee to a headquarters at the first-class level, if no prior notice has been made as provided in Paragraph 2 above, the Company will place a notice on its bulletin boards stating the proposed headquarters and will consider requests as provided in Paragraph 2. (See 1981-M34b)
4.	An employee who fails to qualify for promotion within the maximum time in grade stated for the particular classification will be reassigned to the classification, pay group and pay step from which such employee entered the program and will be considered ineligible for future training in the craft in which such employee failed to qualify for a minimum of 60 months from the date of such failure, except that an employee who is entitled to an additional opportunity to qualify under Article IV N 5 hereof and who fails such additional opportunity shall have no such reentryright. This reentry-right after 60 months can be exercised once only for the craft in question. If there is no vacancy in the classification, pay group and pay step to which such employee is reassigned, the Company shall reassign an employee within that classification pursuant to the provisions of Article IX-D 3 hereof. However, if the employee who fails the test had no such classification because such employee was hired directly into the automatic progression series, such employee may be discharged.
T O
C
5.	Employees who are on automatic progression at the second-class level and who fail to qualify for a first-class rating will be given one additional opportunity to qualify. The second qualifying examination will be given at the option of the Company any time between six months and one year following the first examination. If such employee fails the second time, such employee will be returned to the job classification, pay group and pay step which such employee held before entering the program and will be considered ineligible for future training in the craft in which such employee failed to qualify. If there is no vacancy in
68
Article IV (cont’d)
the classification, pay group and pay step to which such employee is reassigned, the Company shall reassign an employee within that classification pursuant to the provisions of Article IX-D 3 hereof. However, if the employee who fails the test had no such classification because such employee was hired directly into the automatic progression series, such employee may be discharged.
6.	a. The following selection procedures shall apply only to the job classifications set forth below. (See 1989-16B)
b.	Accounting Clerk - Third Class

b.	With respect to any such return or reassignment precluded by Article IV M paragraph 2 hereof, the employee shall be assigned to a classification within the TOC Bargaining Unit as the Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine; however, the employee’s wages shall not be less than the pay group and pay step of the classification from which such employee entered the position from which the employee is being assigned.
c.	In all other cases, transfers/assignments to and from the TOC Bargaining Unit shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Exhibit M117.

WORKING CONDITIONS
A.	1. The safety rules and regulations established by the Company or governmental authority shall be strictly adhered to by both the employees and the Company, and the Company shall enforce these rules and regulations uniformly. The representatives of the Company and the Union shall meet at the request of either to discuss the reasonableness of safety rules and regulations. Proposed changes in safety rules and regulations shall be submitted to the Union for full discussion before becoming effective.(See 1969-10, 1973-27, 1977-M21, 1979-M51)
2.	A Union Representative may at the option of the Union be present while accident investigators are interviewing members of the bargaining unit to determine the facts involved in accidents.
B.	In emergencies, employees will perform any work for
which they are qualified. However, employees in a lower classification will be used for work in a higher classification only
72
Article V (cont’d)
when those in the higher classification are unavailable or exhausted. Emergencies shall be defined as unforeseen circumstances. Unclassified employees shall not do any work being done by members of the bargaining unit, except in an emergency, or when qualified employees from within the bargaining unit are not available.
The above provisions are not intended to prevent unclassified employees from performing their normal clerical recording and general office functions provided the performance of such work does not cause the elimination of any employee of the bargaining unit.
C.	An employee may be assigned temporarily to perform
the duties of a higher classification for which the employee is qualified. When so assigned for periods of one hour or more, the employee shall be paid two pay steps above the employee’s present pay or the starting rate in the higher classification, whichever of these two is the highest. If replacing a higher classification that is only one pay step higher, the employee shall be paid one pay step above the employee’s present pay. If the employee previously was a regular occupant of the higher classification, the employee shall be paid the pay step of the pay group currently applicable to a person having service in the higher classification equal to the employee’s former service in that classification. If replacing an unclassified employee for one hour or more, the employee shall receive two pay groups above the employee’s present pay.
D.	When the Company requires any employee to work at
a point remote from such employee’s normal headquarters, such employee shall be transported between the normal headquarters and the location of the work at the Company’s expense and on Company time at the beginning and end of the job. When such work lasts over a weekend, the Company will, at the end of the working week, furnish transportation back to the employee’s normally designated headquarters and, at the beginning of the next working day, from the normally designated headquarters to the temporary location, but such transportation is to be on the employee’s own time. No transportation allowance will be paid to those who do not use the transportation provided by the Company. The Company will pay such employee, as additional wages, an amount of $80.00 per day. (See +Exhibit M68 and 1987-M23)

E.	An employee required to continue to work for a period of two hours or more beyond the scheduled quitting time shall be entitled to a meal furnished by the Company or a meal paid for by the Company and to an additional meal provided by the Company or meal paid for by the Company for each five hours worked thereafter.

11am to 1pm 4pm to 7 pm
An employee called out for immediate duty outside of the employee’s basic workweek shall be entitled to a meal furnished by the Company or a meal paid for by the Company after the first two hours, provided that the call occurs within or runs into the time periods described above, and another meal or meals provided by the Company or meal or meals paid for by the Company for every five hours thereafter. If the call does not occur within the time periods described above, the employee will be entitled to a meal provided by the Company or a meal paid for by the Company at five hours and every five hours thereafter.
An employee scheduled to report for work more than one hour in advance of the employee’s regular working hours and misses a meal or meals within the time periods described above, thereby, shall be entitled to a meal provided by the Company or a meal paid for by the Company.

F.	No regular full-time employee, except probationary
employees, shall be laid off without two weeks’ prior notice. This provision, however, shall not apply to discharges.
G.	The Company will not increase the hours of work
beyond those now worked in order to reduce the working force, unless required to do so by governmental orders.
H.	Whenever the Company makes a permanent
reassignment of an employee from one headquarters to another, the Company will for a period of eighteen months after such reassignment protect the employee against additional cost for transportation and if the employee moves to the new location within an eighteen-month period after such reassignment, the Company will pay the employee’s moving expenses. When an existing headquarters is physically relocated a distance of more than 10 miles, the employees assigned thereto will be reimbursed for any additional mileage in accordance with the mileage rate set forth. Mileage reimbursement for transportation shall be paid at the rate of 50.5^ (effective 7/1/08 5850)per mile provided, however, if during the term of this Agreement, the Internal Revenue Service increases the “non-taxable” limitation for employees paid mileage allowance, the Company will adjust such 50.5^ (effective 7/1/08 58.5^) per mile allowance accordingly. After said eighteen months, if the employee has not moved, the employee will be required to provide the employee’s own transportation. After said eighteen months, if the employee has not moved, any moving expenses incurred after said eighteen-month period will not be subject to such reimbursement.
I.	The Company shall continue its present practice with
respect to the replacement in kind of tools furnished by the employee and required for the employee’s job, which are lost, worn out or broken while in use on Company property.

J.	Whenever it is necessary to bring together for a
period of more than one hour a group of four or more employees to work together as a crew at maintenance mechanic’s work, and none of the group is a Chief Working Mechanic, then the qualified employee of the highest classification in such group who has seniority shall be in charge of the group and shall be paid for the time when so in charge at the rate of a Working Foreman/Forewoman.

K.	When any work of the type customarily performed by
the members of the bargaining unit is to be contracted out, preference shall be given to qualified contractors employing members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, provided that nothing herein shall require the Company to violate Federal, State or Municipal regulations, to delay the work, or to employ a contractor either not readily available or not equipped to do the work. It is further stipulated and agreed that if the Company is unable to obtain a qualified contractor under the specifications outlined above or feels that it is called upon to bear costs not reasonable by comparison with the Company’s estimates, the matter shall become the mutual concern of the President of the Company and the International President of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers who shall cooperate to adjust the matter with due regard to all factors involved.

Where an employee transfers from one job classification to another, if such transfer is to a job in the same pay group, the employee shall go to the step in the pay group for the new classification equal to the employee’s present pay. Where the transfer is to a job in a higher pay group, the employee shall go to the step in the new pay group one pay step higher than the employee’s present pay or to the lowest step of the new pay group if that is higher.
76
Article VI (cont’d) - Article VII - Article VIII
Where an employee voluntarily transfers to a job in a lower pay group, the employee shall go to the highest pay step of the lower pay group or stay at the employee’s existing rate of pay, whichever is lower. Where an employee is demoted by the Company, the employee shall go to the highest pay step of the lower pay group or to the employee’s existing pay, whichever is lower.
ARTICLE VII

An employee who is selected or appointed to serve as Business Manager for the Local Union shall after reasonable notice to the Company, be granted a leave of absence without pay during the employee’s term of office and shall continue to accumulate seniority throughout the leave of absence. Upon termination of the employee’s duties, the employee shall be reinstated in the employee’s former position provided the employee is physically able to perform the work and it has not been eliminated. If the position has been eliminated, or the employee is physically unable to perform the work, the employee shall, by agreement with the Union, be placed in a classification for which the employee is qualified, and the employee with the least seniority in that classification shall be returned to the lower classification from which the employee came.

Leaves of absence may be taken in whole or in part; provided, however, no employee during the employee’s employment career with the Company may take leaves of absence which in the aggregate exceed the total leaves of absence accumulated during the employee’s working career with the Company. Leaves of absence taken prior to July 1, 1977, will not be subtracted from an employee’s entitlement on and after July 1, 1977. During these leaves of absence, seniority shall accumulate.
If an employee overstays such leave or if the employee accepts employment elsewhere during such leave without the consent of the Company, the employee’s employment with the Company shall

Article IX (cont’d)
the operation of the provisions of Article IX-D 3. Any such transfer or reassignment may be made without regard to any provisions of this Agreement other than the provisions of this Article IX-D.
3.	Any transfer or reassignment under this Article IX-D shall be effected by the Company as set forth below and where such transfer or reassignment is to be made based upon consideration of seniority, health, ability, residence and other factors (“SHAROF”), the Company’s decision shall be final after review of such decision with the Union President and Business Manager or an alternate in the absence of him:
a.	The selection and placement of the employees to be transferred or reassigned from a non-automatic progression series classification shall be made by the Company on the basis of SHAROF. An employee transferred or reassigned pursuant to the provisions of this Article IX-D 3 a, shall be offered the classification from which the employee was transferred or reassigned if a vacancy arises in such classification and if such employee continues to be qualified and physically capable to fill such classification. Such classification shall be offered on the basis of seniority to those employees so transferred or reassigned.
b.	1) The selection of the employees to be transferred or reassigned from an automatic progression series classification shall be made ( a ) from the employees in the first-class level or higher solely on the basis of system-wide seniority where there are no second-class or third-class in progression below the first-class level, and (b) from the second-class or third-class in progression on the basis of SHAROF taking into account all such second-class or third-class and excluding employees in the first-class level or higher.
2)	An employee, other than an employee in the first-class level or higher, to be transferred or reassigned from an automatic progression series classification shall be returned to the job classification, pay group and pay step from which such employee entered the automatic progression series classification. And, in the event there is no vacancy in the classification to which such employee is transferred or reassigned, the Company shall have the right to make a further transfer or reassignment of any employee in that classification pursuant to the
Article IX (cont’d)
83
provisions of this paragraph ( b ) or paragraph ( a ) above, whichever is then applicable.
An employee to be transferred from an automatic progression series in the first-class level or higher with less than ten years’ continuous employment with the Company shall be transferred or reassigned to such classification as the Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine. However, the employee’s wages shall not be less than the pay group and pay step of the classification from which such employee entered the automatic progression series.
An employee to be transferred from an automatic progression series in the first-class level or higher with ten or more years of continuous service with the Company shall be transferred or reassigned to such classification as the Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine.
3)	Any employee transferred or reassigned from any automatic progression series classification, below the first-class level and who meets the minimum qualifying standards for testing and who is not discharged pursuant to Article IX-D 3 b 4, shall be given a test to qualify for the next highest rating relating to such employee’s then current classification. Such test opportunity shall not result in any delay in implementing such employee’s transfer or reassignment under this Article IX-D. If the employee fails to so qualify, the employee shall be ineligible for future training in that craft except if the failure to qualify is for the first-class rating and is not the employee’s second failure, the employee shall be eligible for future training in that craft and within six months to one year after reentry to that automatic progression classification, such employee shall be given a second qualifying test, failure of which shall result in the consequences set forth in Article IV-N 5 hereof.
4)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, any employee to be transferred or reassigned from the second or third-class level in an automatic progression series classification under this Article IX-D 3 b, who had no prior classification because such employee was hired directly into the automatic progression series, may be discharged.

All others so transferred or reassigned will be paid the rate of the job to which transferred or reassigned except as may otherwise be provided in this Article IX-D. (See +Exhibit M43 and 1981-11)
5.	The provisions of this Article IX-D shall not apply to employees transferred or reassigned because of physical disability.
E.	Employees who are partially disabled so that they
cannot perform all of the duties of their classification may be transferred from time to time to any job represented by the Union that they are capable of performing without compliance with usual examination procedure and without regard to seniority.
Such disability transfer shall not be considered a permanent transfer and any employee so transferred will not be reimbursed for the mileage allowance or moving expenses as described in Article V-H of this Agreement.
In cases not involving Workers’ Compensation or not caused by or contributed to by the negligence or voluntary act of the employee where an employee with ten years or more of continuous service is demoted because of physical disability rendering the employee unable to perform the work required of the employee’s job classification and is transferred to a job carrying the lower rate of pay than the existing rate of pay of the employee, the rate of pay of such employee until retirement, death, resignation or discharge for cause shall not be reduced below the percentages of the employee’s existing pay as shown below at the time of such demotion and the employee will remain in the Plan Class for Group Life Insurance and the Retirement Income Plan that is determined by the base pay of the job classification at the time of the employee’s transfer due to disability, subject to the following sentence: For purposes of the Retirement Income Plan and the Group Life Insurance Plan, the employee shall accrue benefits at the Plan Class level so determined subject, however, to being placed on a higher Plan Class to reflect general wage increases. An employee whose rate of compensation is affected by the provisions of the disability clause will receive one-half of
Article IX (cont’d)
85
the general increase for the employee’s compensation each year of the contract until the rate for that job equals the employee’s then pay. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any employee, who becomes disabled and is transferred to a job carrying a lower rate of pay under this Article IX E will receive 100% of any general wage increase placed in effect on and after the date when such employee has completed 30 years of continuous service with the Company. (See 1983-M6C and 1985-M37)

HOURS OF WORK, OVERTIME AND HOLIDAYS
A.	1. The payroll week shall begin at 12:01 a.m. Sunday and end at 12:00 midnight on the following Saturday.
2.	The employees covered hereby are special schedule employees, the character of whose work requires specially scheduled hours. Such employees may be placed on special schedule not to exceed forty (40) hours per week.
3.	There shall be two regularly scheduled days off in each payroll week which need not, however, be consecutive. Neither of these days shall be considered as part of the basic workweek.
4.	For employees whose basic workweek consists of forty (40) hours, overtime shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1%) times for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours per day, with the exception of overtime work on the regularly scheduled days off (See Section C) or on a holiday (See Section B). Subject to Article VIII C, employees whose basic workday consists of less than eight (8) hours per day shall be paid at the rate of straight time for all hours worked up to eight (8) hours per day and at the rate of one and one-half (1%) times for overtime in excess of eight (8) hours per day, or work on their regularly scheduled days off, with the exception of certain overtime worked on regularly scheduled days off (See Section C) or on a holiday (See Section B). Notwithstanding the foregoing, double time shall be paid for time worked in excess of sixteen (16) consecutive hours, except as may be otherwise provided in Article III-F hereof.
P T
98 Article III (cont’d)
B.	The following days during the contract year shall be
observed as holidays:
Independence Day Labor Day Columbus Day Thanksgiving Day The Day After Thanksgiving The Day Before Christmas Christmas Day New Year’s Day Good Friday Memorial Day and President’s Day
If a holiday falls on an employee’s regularly scheduled working day, the employee shall be given the day off with pay. If the employee works on a holiday, the employee shall receive time and one-half for the hours actually worked in addition to holiday pay as provided. All holidays falling on Sunday shall be treated as though falling on the succeeding Monday and all holidays falling on Saturday shall be treated as though falling on the preceding Friday; except if Christmas Day falls on a Sunday or Monday, the day before Christmas holiday shall be observed on the preceding Friday; and except if Christmas Day shall fall on Saturday, the day before Christmas holiday shall be observed on the preceding Thursday. Holiday pay shall be computed at straight time or one-fifth of the regularly scheduled weekly hours of the employees.
If any such observed holiday falls on a shift or special schedule worker’s first regularly scheduled day off, the day previous to the employee’s first day off shall be treated as the holiday; and if it falls on the employee’s second regularly scheduled day off, the day following will be treated as the holiday except that if any observed holiday falls on a regularly scheduled day off, such holiday or holidays shall be observed pursuant to the Chart(s) set forth either as an attachment or immediately preceding any index to this Agreement.
Two floating holidays will be granted to be taken during each calendar year. These holidays will be granted if the
Article III (cont’d)
99
employee was employed on or before October 1 of such calendar year and notification is given to the employee’s supervisor not less than five working days in advance of such holiday, provided, however, any such holiday cannot be taken on a workday which either coincides with, precedes or follows a holiday referred to in this Article III B and further provided such two floating holidays cannot be taken consecutively.
Employees called out in an emergency will receive overtime pay at the applicable rates for all time worked in addition to the holiday pay, but the minimum time paid for such emergency work shall be three hours at the applicable overtime rate.
C.	Employees with Sunday as a regularly scheduled day
off in any calendar week shall be paid double time for work on that Sunday and at time and one-half for work on the other regularly scheduled day off in that calendar week.

qualified employees if they are available, having regard, however, to the special type of work to be performed during such overtime.
E.	Employees who have worked overtime shall not be
given time off without pay on a regularly scheduled workday to equalize that overtime.
F.	Any employee required to work 16 or more
consecutive hours shall be allowed a rest period of 8 hours after the termination of said work. If this rest period runs into the beginning of the regularly scheduled basic workday within the basic workweek, such employee shall not lose pay by reason thereof. If the employee does continue working after 16 or more consecutive hours and the period of work extends into the beginning of the regularly scheduled basic workday the employee shall receive pay at time plus double time instead of straight time for the time worked during the employee’s basic work period which the employee would otherwise have been entitled to take off. An employee who works overtime between the seventh and fourth hours preceding the commencement of the employee’s next regularly scheduled basic work period, if such overtime is not part of a period of 16 or more consecutive hours of work, shall be
100
Article III (cont’d)
entitled to time off at the beginning of the employee’s next regularly scheduled basic work period without loss of pay, equivalent to the number of overtime hours actually worked during the 7 hours immediately preceding the commencement of such basic work period. An employee who becomes entitled to time off under the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence may work the balance of the remaining hours of the employee’s basic work period at the beginning of the next scheduled basic work period. However, the Company may request the employee to waive the time off to which the employee is entitled under this paragraph and to continue working. If the employee does continue working pursuant to such request, the employee shall receive pay at double time instead of straight time for the time worked during the employee’s basic work period which the employee would otherwise have been entitled to take off.
G.	1. An employee who is called out to work shall be paid for a minimum of three hours’ time at the applicable rate except that if such call-out occurs ninety (90) minutes or less prior to the beginning of the employee’s scheduled workday or scheduled work period, the employee shall be paid for a minimum of two hours’ time at the applicable rate. (See 1971-3)
2.	An employee who is scheduled to report to work outside of the employee’s regularly scheduled workday or basic workweek shall be paid for a minimum of three hours’ time at the applicable rate with the exception that if such work is immediately before or after the scheduled workday within the basic workweek such employee shall be paid at the applicable rate only for the actual time worked. If the Company decides it does not want the employee to work as scheduled, no payment shall be made if the notice of such decision not to work is given before the employee leaves work on the scheduled workday within the basic workweek immediately preceding the day on which the job was to have been done.
H.	No employee shall be requested or required at any
time to be on call or to stand by except when such employee is paid at the applicable rate.
I.	If on any one or more of the regularly scheduled
workdays within an employee’s basic five-day workweek, the employee’s regularly scheduled hours of work are changed and notice of less than forty-eight hours is given prior to the time the employee starts work under the new schedule of hours for which
Article III (cont’d) - Article IV
101
only straight time is to be paid, the employee shall be given four hours’ pay at straight time at the employee’s own regular rate in addition to the employee’s regular pay except, however, that in the case of employees assigned to relief duty they shall be entitled to such additional payment only if they are given less than twenty-four hours’ notice of change of schedule if the reason making the notice necessary is within the Company’s control or twelve hours’ notice if the reason making the notice necessary is outside the Company’s control. This section shall not apply to employees occasionally assigned to chauffeur duty while so assigned.
J.	Employees, the majority of whose regular scheduled
basic workday hours in any workday occur within the period from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m., shall be paid a night differential of 5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour effective May 1,2008, and effective May 1, 2009, 5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour and, effective November 1, 2009, 5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour and effective May 1,2010,5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour and effective November 1,2010, 5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour for the total basic hours worked; except that with respect to Cleaning Workers such night differential shall be applicable only to those Cleaning Workers who were in that position on July 1, 1985. However, when the basic hours worked in any workday are less than the majority of total hours worked then the night differential shall be paid only for those basic hours worked within the period from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. The night differential shall not be paid for any work performed for which overtime is paid. (See 1969-M7)

SERVICE IN PROMOTION, TRANSFER, LAYOFF AND REEMPLOYMENT
A.	Length of continuous employment in the Company in
job classifications included in Local 320 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers AFL-CIO shall be known as “service”; provided that if the period of continuous employment of any employee extends to a date prior to the establishment of this bargaining unit such continuous prior employment in any capacity shall be included in that employee’s service. Other factors being equal, the Company in considering promotions, transfers, layoffs, or reemployment will give first consideration to length of service.
102
Article IV (cont’d)
B.	Consideration as to length of service shall not,
however, apply to seasonal employees or, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, to employees previously employed by the Company and now in the services of the United States or on leave of absence who return to work.
C.	When an employee is to be temporarily or
permanently transferred within the employee’s classification, or demoted, the Company agrees to confer in advance with the President and Business Manager of the Local or an alternate in his/her absence, and in selecting the person to be transferred shall give consideration to seniority, health, ability, residence, individual preferences of employees and similar considerations; however, the Company’s decision as to who shall be transferred shall be final.
D.	Lists showing service shall be supplied to the Union
quarterly. The Union shall be given notice of the hiring of new employees within ten days of their employment. (See 1979-48 and 1981-M21)
E.	1. Service shall accumulate during the period when an employee is temporarily in the military service, maritime service or merchant marine.
2.	Should a promotion be made while an employee is temporarily in military service, maritime service or merchant marine or on leave of absence for which such employee would have been entitled if working at the time, such employee shall, upon return from such service or leave of absence be placed in the higher classification provided that such employee is able to perform the work, and the employee with the least service in that classification shall be returned to the lower classification from which the employee came.
F.	Where a vacancy exists in any “full-time”
classification covered by the TOC Bargaining Unit or the T&D Bargaining Unit, any employee covered by this Agreement may make application therefore (see Exhibit 24) to Human Resources setting forth his or her qualifications; however, employees’ applications, returns or reassignments, will be subject to the provisions of Article IV of the “Full-time” Agreement under which they make application. (See Exhibit M117).
Article V

ARTICLE V
WORKING CONDITIONS
A.	1. The safety rules and regulations established by the Company or governmental authority shall be strictly adhered to by both the employees and the Company, and the Company shall enforce these rules uniformly. The representatives of the Company and the Union shall meet at the request of either to discuss the reasonableness of safety rules and regulations. Proposed changes in safety rules and regulations shall be submitted to the Union for full discussion before becoming effective. (See 1969-10, 1973-27, 1977-M21 and 1979-M51)
2.	A Union Representative may at the option of the Union be present while accident investigators are interviewing members of the bargaining unit to determine the facts involved in accidents.
B.	In emergencies, employees will perform any work for
which they are qualified. However, employees in a lower classification will be used for work in a higher classification only when those in the higher classification are unavailable or exhausted. Emergencies shall be defined as unforeseen circumstances. Unclassified employees shall not do any work being done by members of the bargaining unit, except in an emergency, or when qualified employees from within the bargaining unit are not available.
The above provisions are not intended to prevent unclassified employees from performing their normal clerical recording and general office functions provided the performance of such work does not cause the elimination of any employee of the bargaining unit.
C.	1. An employee may be assigned temporarily to perform the duties of a higher classification for which the employee is qualified. When so assigned for periods of one hour or more, the employee shall be paid two pay steps above the employee’s present pay or the starting rate in the higher classification, whichever of these two is the highest. If replacing a higher classification that is only one pay step higher, the employee shall be paid one pay step above the employee’s
P T
104
Article V (cont’d)
present pay. If the employee previously was a regular occupant of the higher classification, the employee shall be paid the pay step of the pay group currently applicable to a person having service in the higher classification equal to the employee’s former service in that classification. If replacing an unclassified employee for one hour or more, the employee shall receive two pay groups above the employee’s present pay.
2. When the Company requires any employee to work at a point remote from such employee’s normal headquarters, such employee shall be transported between the normal headquarters and the location of the work at the Company’s expense and on Company time at the beginning and end of the job. When such work lasts over a weekend, the Company will, at the end of the working week, furnish transportation back to the employee’s normally designated headquarters and, at the beginning of the next workday, from the normally designated headquarters to the temporary location, but such transportation is to be on the employee’s own time. No transportation allowance will be paid to those who do not use the transportation provided by the Company. The Company will pay such employees, as additional wages, an amount of $80.00 per day. (See 1987-M23)
D.	An employee required to continue to work for a period of two hours or more beyond the scheduled quitting time shall be entitled to a meal furnished by the Company or a meal paid for by the Company and to an additional meal provided by the Company or meal paid for by the Company for each five hours worked thereafter.
An employee called out to work outside of the employees scheduled working hours, within the basic workweek, shall be entitled to a meal furnished by the Company or meal paid for by the Company for each five hours worked or meals missed if the call occurs within or runs through the following time periods:
5am to 9am
11am to 1pm
4pm to 7 pm
An employee called out for immediate duty outside of the employee’s basic workweek shall be entitled to a meal furnished by the Company or a meal paid for by the Company after the first two hours, provided that the call occurs within or
Article V (cont’d)
105
runs into the time periods described above, and another meal or meals provided by the Company or meal or meals paid for by the Company for every five hours thereafter. If the call does not occur within the time periods described above, the employee will be entitled to a meal provided by the Company or a meal paid for by the Company at five hours and every five hours thereafter.
An employee scheduled to report for work more than one hour in advance of the employee’s regular working hours and misses a meal or meals within the time periods described above, thereby, shall be entitled to a meal provided by the Company or a meal paid for by the Company.
Overtime meals shall be eaten on Company time and only such time shall be taken as reasonably necessary to obtain and eat the meal. (See Exhibits M32 and M61)
If a shift or special schedule employee is scheduled to report for overtime work on the employee’s regularly scheduled day off more than one hour in advance of the regular starting time of the shift to be worked, and the job extends beyond the next normal meal within the time periods described above, the Company shall provide a meal provided by the Company or a meal paid for by the Company.
E.	No regular employee, except probationary employees,
shall be laid off without at least two weeks’ prior notice. This provision, however, shall not apply to discharges.
F.	The Company will not increase the hours of work
beyond those now worked in order to reduce the working force, unless required to do so by governmental order.
G.	Whenever the Company makes a permanent
reassignment of an employee from one headquarters to another, the Company will for a period of eighteen months after such reassignment protect the employee against additional cost for transportation and if the employee moves to the new location within an eighteen-month period after such reassignment, the Company will pay the employee’s moving expenses. When an existing headquarters is physically relocated a distance of more than 10 miles, the employees assigned thereto will be reimbursed for any additional mileage in accordance with the mileage rate set forth. Mileage reimbursement for transportation shall be paid at the rate of 50.5# (effective 7/1/08 58.5#)per mile provided,
P T
106 Article V (cont’d) - Article VI
however, if during the term of this Agreement, the Internal Revenue Service increases the “non-taxable” limitation for employees paid mileage allowance, the Company will adjust such 50.5^ (effective 7/1/08 58.5^) per mile allowance accordingly. After said eighteen months, if the employee has not moved, the employee will be required to provide the employee’s own transportation. After said eighteen months, if the employee has not moved, any moving expenses incurred after said eighteenmonth period will not be subject to such reimbursement.
H.	(Reserved)
I.	When any work of the type customarily performed by
the members of the bargaining unit is to be contracted out, preference shall be given to qualified contractors employing members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, provided that nothing herein shall require the Company to violate Federal, State or Municipal regulations, to delay the work, or to employ a contractor either not readily available or not equipped to do the work. It is further stipulated and agreed that if the Company is unable to obtain a qualified contractor under the specifications outlined above or feels that it is called upon to bear costs not reasonable by comparison with the Company’s estimates, the matter shall become the mutual concern of the President of the Company and the International President of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers who shall cooperate to adjust the matter with due regard to all factors involved.

Each employee shall move to the next pay step within the pay group applicable to the employee’s classification as of the date on which the employee’s length of service in the classification qualifies the employee for the next pay step.
(See 1985 M*33)
Article VI (cont’d) - Article VII - Article VIII
107
Where an employee transfers from one job classification to another, if such transfer is to a job in the same pay group, the employee shall go to the step in the pay group for the new classification equal to the employee’s present pay. Where the transfer is to a job in a higher pay group, the employee shall go to the step in the new pay group one step higher than the employee’s present pay or to the lowest step of the new pay group if that is higher.
Where an employee voluntarily transfers to a job in a lower pay group, the employee shall go to the highest pay step of the lower pay group or stay at the employee’s existing rate of pay, whichever is lower. Where an employee is demoted by the Company, the employee shall go to the highest pay step of the lower group or to the employee’s existing pay, whichever is lower.
P T
ARTICLE VII
JOB SPECIFICATIONS
The Company shall continue the job specifications which have been agreed upon between the Company and the Union as of the date of this agreement.

ARTICLE VIII VACATIONS - LEAVES OF ABSENCE
A.	During the term of this agreement, regular employees
whose basic workweek consists of forty (40) hours and who have completed one year or more of continuous service on or before October 1 shall be entitled to two weeks’ vacation in that calendar year with ten days’ pay of eight hours each and such employees who have completed six months but less than one year of continuous service on or before October 1 shall be entitled to one week’s vacation in that calendar year with five days of eight hours each. Such employees who will have attained five years or more
108
Article VIII (cont’d)
of continuous service on or before October 1 shall be entitled to three weeks’ vacation in that calendar year. Such employees who have completed 10, 11, or 12 years’ of service on or before October 1 shall be entitled to 16 days’ vacation in that calendar year. Such employees who have completed 13 or 14 years’ of service on or before October 1 shall be entitled to 17 days’ vacation in that calendar year. Such employees who have completed 15 years of continuous employment on or before October 1 shall be entitled to four weeks’ vacation in that calendar year.

Pay for each week of vacation shall be for five days at the rate of straight time for one-fifth of the regularly scheduled weekly hours. Any days in excess of ten may be taken within the normal vacation period only if operating conditions permit it. Otherwise they must be taken outside of the normal vacation period. Vacation schedules shall be established a reasonable time in advance of the normal vacation period. On selections made before May 1 in any year, service shall govern the choice of vacations except where operating conditions do not permit such selection. All changes or selections made after May 1 in any year will be made only with the approval of the employee’s supervisor and the agreement of any employee whose vacation is affected thereby. Employees whose basic workweek consists of less than forty (40) hours will receive such proportion of the vacation pay above specified as the number of their regularly scheduled hours of work in each week bears to 40 hours. Full weeks of vacation shall take precedence over individual days of vacation for scheduling purposes.
Employees may in any year defer up to the equivalent of ten days of the vacation to which they are entitled and may use those days during any subsequent year. The time of taking such days shall be subject to the approval of the employee’s supervision and must be taken in units of not less than one day. The maximum accumulation shall be no more than ten days. A regularly scheduled vacation for any current year will in scheduling take precedence over a carry-over vacation proposed to be taken in that year. (See 1981-43)
Article VIII (cont’d)
109
B.	Should a holiday be observed on one of the
employee’s regularly scheduled workdays and within the employee’s basic workweek while on vacation, such employee shall be entitled to an additional day off with pay which shall be taken at the beginning or end of the vacation unless otherwise arranged with the employee’s supervisor.
The Company will apply the following rule so long as it is not abused:
In the event that an employee is or becomes ill prior to the employee’s scheduled vacation or is admitted to a legally constituted hospital during the employee’s scheduled vacation and it is determined that the illness or injury was in no way attributable to the employee’s reckless or willful action while on vacation, the period of the employee’s illness or hospital confinement, and any subsequent period of confinement to bed, will be processed in accordance with Section H of this Article. Any remaining vacation will be rescheduled in accordance with this Article. (See 1969-13)
P T
C.	For Group A employees whose basic workday
consists of less than eight hours per day, in any week in which one or more days are not worked because of vacation or jury duty, overtime shall commence after the employee has worked time in excess of eight hours per day, counting as worked for this purpose the hours regularly scheduled on the vacation days and on any holiday occurring during said week.
D.	Except for the third, fourth or fifth week of vacations,
vacations will normally be taken within a single period. If an employee desires to separate vacation into periods of not less than one day, application should be made to the Division Manager, and the request will be approved where schedules permit. The normal vacation period shall be between May 1 and September 1, but employees may elect to take their vacations at any other time to suit their plans provided it is possible for them to do so without adversely affecting the operation of the Company’s business.

Article VIII (cont’d)
F.	An employee who leaves the Company for any reason
shall be granted a vacation if taken before the day of separation or given vacation pay if such employee works up to the date of separation; provided, however, that an employee who resigns without giving the proper notice shall not be granted a vacation or given vacation pay. The vacations granted in these cases shall, for regular employees whose basic workweek consists of forty (40) hours and who have more than six months of continuous employment, be one day with pay (eight hours) for each completed month of employment, for such employees who have five or more years of continuous employment shall be one and one-half days (twelve hours) for each completed month of employment, for such employees with 10, 11 or 12 years of continuous employment shall be 12.8 hours for each completed month of employment, for such employees with 13 or 14 years of continuous employment shall be 13.6 hours for each completed month of employment, for such employees with 15 years or more of continuous employment, shall be two days (sixteen hours) for each completed month of employment, for such employees with 22 years or more of continuous employment, shall be two and one-half days (twenty hours) for each completed month of employment, and for employees with 30 years or more of continuous employment, shall be three days (twenty-four hours) for each completed month of employment, starting in each case with the preceding July 1. Employees whose basic workweek consists of less than forty (40) hours shall receive prorated pay based on their regular weekly hours of work.
By “proper notice” is meant that the employee shall have informed the Company sufficiently in advance so that such employee shall work at least two weeks before the termination of service with the Company. An employee who elects to take a separation allowance shall not be entitled to vacation provision in addition thereto. In no case shall an employee who leaves the Company’s employ be given a greater vacation allowance than the employee would have been entitled to had the employee remained with the Company through the ensuing vacation period.
G.	Group B employees include all employees covered by
this unit in job classification numbers 138.6 and 139.1. Group A employees shall include all other part-time employees covered by this unit.

Payments beyond those above enumerated may be continued at the discretion of the Company. The Company reserves the right to have its own doctor check on claims of disability.
In no case shall the Company be obligated to pay any amounts for a disability with respect to which the employee is entitled to receive insurance proceeds covering lost wages as provided under Article XVIII (“No Fault”) of the Insurance Law of New York.
I.	1. Group A employees who have had at least one year of continuous service will, with the consent of the Supervisor, be permitted to be absent without loss of pay for not more than five working days in any year in the event of sickness in the family or for personal business of a nature that cannot be taken care of in other than normal working hours, provided that in cases of sickness in the family, payment for absence in excess of five days may be allowed at the discretion of the Company. Notification of intended absence for this reason shall be given to the Supervisor as far in advance as possible. Each of such five working days may be taken in increments of not less than two hours.
2.	Employees who have had at least six months of continuous service will be permitted to be absent without loss of pay for not more than five working days, which need not be taken consecutively, because of the death of a father, mother, brother, sister, husband, wife, child, father-in-law or mother-in-law, and not more than three days because of the death of a grandparent or grandchild. (See 1971-M55)
If an employee is on vacation and a death in the family occurs during such vacation, such allowable absence shall not be considered as vacation time.

Article VIII (Cont’d)
3.	Members of the National Guard or Reserve Corps will be allowed four weeks’ leave of absence without pay for military duties. If such military duty is required by law and the rate paid for such service is less than the employee’s normal daily compensation, the Company will pay the difference for up to two weeks of such leave period, but this provision shall not apply to military service required in any organization which the employee has joined voluntarily. (See Exhibit 47, 1971-M60,1989-M7B and 2003-17)
4.	Employees serving on jury duty shall be given leave of absence for those days during their normal workweek when they are serving on jury duty. If the jury rate paid for jury service is less than the employee’s normal daily compensation, the Company will pay the difference. (See Exhibit M9 and 1981+M24)
J.	A regular employee shall be granted a leave of
absence without pay after reasonable notice to the Company, provided that the conditions of work at the time are such that the employee’s services can be spared. Leaves of absence shall accumulate at the rate of one week for each full year of consecutive service with the Company subject to no limitation as to the aggregate weeks of leaves of absence which can be accumulated. Leaves of absence may be taken in whole or in part; provided, however, no employee during the employee’s employment career with the Company may take leaves of absence which in the aggregate exceed the total leaves of absence accumulated during the employee’s working career with the Company. Leaves of absence taken prior to July 1, 1977, will not be subtracted from an employee’s entitlement on and after July 1, 1977. During these leaves of absence, service shall accumulate.
If an employee overstays such leave or if the employee accepts employment elsewhere during such leave without the consent of the Company, the employee’s employment with the Company shall be deemed to have terminated. If leave of absence is extended by the Company, service shall continue to accumulate during such extended leave. (See 1975-16 and 1983-18)
K.	Employees who are selected by their Local Union to
serve as accredited delegates to conventions or similar meetings shall, after reasonable notice to the Company, be granted a leave of absence without pay for sufficient time for this purpose. (See Exhibit 111)

ARTICLE IX
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
A.	For the duration of this agreement, but without
commitment or liability thereafter, regular employees, other than employees placed on pension, who have completed one year or more of continuous service and who are laid off for lack of work shall be given an allowance of one week’s base pay for each full year of continuous service. If the employee accepts a separation allowance, the Company shall not be obligated to rehire such employee, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.
B.	The Company will continue its present Retirement
Income Plan (subject to amendment to reflect Items 40 and 41 of the 2008 Memorandum of Agreement), Group Life Insurance Plan (subject to amendment to reflect Item 40 of the 2008 Memorandum of Agreement), the Disability Plan, and the Savings Incentive Plan (subject to Amendment to reflect Item 40 of the 2008 Memorandum of Agreement) as long as it is entitled under applicable law to a deduction for income tax purposes of amounts contributed thereto.
P T
C.	The Company agrees to continue in effect the present
Health Benefit Plan, Dental Plan, Flexible Spending Account Plan, and Vision Care Plan except that such plans will be amended in accordance with Item 40 of the 2008 Memorandum of Agreement.
D.	The Company shall not hire temporary employees if
such hiring will result in the layoff of regular, including part-time, employees.
E.	No employee, who at any given time has been
continuously in the employ of the Company for ten years or more will be reduced in pay during the term of this contract by reason of layoff or demotion due to lack of work.
F.	Employees who are partially disabled so that they
cannot perform all of the duties of their classification may be transferred from time to time to any job represented by the Union that they are capable of performing without compliance with usual examination procedure and without regard to seniority.
114
Article IX (cont’d)
Such disability transfer shall not be considered a permanent transfer and any employee so transferred will not be reimbursed for the mileage allowance or moving expenses as described in Article V-G of this Agreement.
In cases not involving Workers’ Compensation or not caused by or contributed to by the negligence or voluntary act of the employee where an employee with ten years or more of continuous service is demoted because of physical disability rendering the employee unable to perform the work required of the employee’s job classification and is transferred to a job carrying a lower rate of pay than the existing rate of pay of the employee, the rate of pay of such employee until retirement, death, resignation or discharge for cause shall not be reduced below the percentages of the employee’s existing pay as shown below at the time of such demotion and the employee will remain in the Plan Class for Group Life Insurance and the Retirement Income Plan that is determined by the base pay of the job classification at the time of the employee’s transfer due to disability, subject to the following sentence: For purposes of the Retirement Income Plan, and the Group Life Insurance Plan, the employee shall accrue benefits at the Plan Class level so determined subject, however, to being placed in a higher Plan Class to reflect general wage increases. An employee whose rate of compensation is affected by the provisions of the disability clause will receive one-half of the general increase for the employee’s compensation each year of the contract until the rate for that job equals the employee’s then pay. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any employee, who becomes disabled and is transferred to a job carrying a lower rate of pay under this Article IX F will receive 100% of any general wage increase placed in effect on and after the date when such employee has completed 30 years of continuous service with the Company. (See +Exhibit M43, 1983-M6C and 1985-M37)
Article IX (cont’d) - Article X

	ARTICLE X		
GRIEVANCES
A.	If any dispute arises between the Union and the
Company as to the rights of either party under this Agreement, both parties shall endeavor to settle such issue in the simplest and most direct manner. The procedure, unless any step thereof is waived, combined or extended, by mutual consent, shall be as follows:
1. a. The aggrieved employee(s), with the Union Steward, will discuss the issue with the immediate Supervisor of the aggrieved employee(s), who will endeavor to settle the issue.
b. If mutual agreement is not reached, the aggrieved employee(s) and the Union Steward shall present the grievance in writing to the immediate Supervisor no later than ten working days after the above discussion. The grievance will set forth the provision(s) of the Agreement on which the grievance is based and should include pertinent names, dates and other relevant factors. The Supervisor shall give the aggrieved employee(s) a written decision within five working days.
116
Article X (cont’d)
2.	If the Supervisor’s decision is not accepted in Step 1 b., the aggrieved employee(s), with the Local Union Representative, shall present an appeal in writing to Division Management within fifteen working days after the first Thursday of the month following the month in which the Supervisor’s reply is received. The appeal shall set forth the provision(s) of the Agreement still in dispute. Copies of the grievance including the second step appeal shall be sent to the Union President and Business Manager, Recording Secretary and Human Resources.
The grievant(s), Local Union Representative, usually two, and Management will discuss the issue in an attempt to settle the grievance. The aggrieved employee(s) at the employee’s option may elect to participate in this Step 2 of the Grievance Procedure but will not be required to do so.
Division Management shall give the Local Union Representative a written answer to the grievance no later than ten working days after the above discussion.
If the Company does not meet with the Union Representatives to discuss the issue as provided above within 30 calendar days after receipt of the written appeal, unless a postponement is mutually agreed to, the grievance shall automatically be processed to the next step. If the Local Union cannot meet on the day selected by the Company within said 30-day period, unless a postponement is mutually agreed to, then the grievance will be considered withdrawn.
3.	If Division Management’s decision in Step 2 is not accepted, the President and Business Manager of the Union shall present a written appeal to Human Resources no later than ten days after Division Management’s Step 2 reply is received.
A Joint Committee consisting of:
a.	A minimum of three representatives of the Company plus at the discretion of the Company, the Supervisor involved and a member of Human Resources.
Article X (Cont’d)
117
b.	A minimum of three representatives of the Union who are employees or local union officials plus at the discretion of the Union, the grievant shall endeavor to settle the grievance on a factual basis.
At the meeting of the Joint Committee, an International Representative of the Union may be present but only to assist the Union. The Union may also have one (1) attorney present, at its cost, to advise the Union if the grievance involves the discharge of an employee.
4.	If the grievance is a dispute involving the interpretation, application, or violation of any provision of this Agreement and if the grievance is not settled by the Joint Committee as provided for in Step 3 under sub-part 3 of this Article A, either the Union or the Company by written notice to the other party given within 15 working days of the failure to settle the grievance in said Step 3, may elect to submit the grievance to an impartial arbitrator for final settlement. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement between the Union and the Company; however, in the event they cannot agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator, the Company and the Union may either jointly or either such party may independently initiate the grievance before the American Arbitration Association under the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The parties further agree to accept the arbitrator’s award as final and binding upon them for the duration of the contract. The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, detract from, alter, amend, or modify any provision of this Agreement. The expenses of the Arbitrator shall be borne equally by the Company and the Union.
P T
B.	Should an employee be discharged, the employee
shall be entitled to a hearing, starting with the second step above and the case shall be disposed of promptly. Any request for such a hearing shall be presented in writing to Division Management by the discharged employee and the Local Union Representative within thirty (30) working days from the date of discharge. The Company shall not be required to hear any such grievance if the request is not made in accordance with the time limitation as stated above. If it is determined that the discharge is in violation of the terms of this Agreement, the employee shall be restored to the employee’s former position and status without loss of pay.
118
Article X (cont’d) - Article XI
C.	The Company may submit complaints to the Executive Board of the Local Union involved and if not settled they may be submitted to a grievance procedure starting with the second step above.
D.	In all cases where, in accordance with the job specifications, the Company requires an employee to submit to physical examination by a doctor designated by the Company, if the employee does not agree with the findings of said doctor, the employee may consult with any doctor of the employee’s own choice. If the conclusions of the doctor consulted by the employee disagree with the conclusions of the doctor designated by the Company, the two doctors shall select a third doctor whose conclusions shall be binding upon both the Company and the employee. The fee of the third doctor shall be borne by the Company.
ARTICLE XI

B.	Those separate written agreements between the
parties to this Agreement (including grievance settlements other than those below the second step of the grievance procedure), collectively called “Supplemental Agreements”, which by their terms are currently applicable to this Agreement, are by reference considered to be part of this Agreement subject, however, to their terms and provisions. Any such Supplemental Agreement that is physically attached to the Agreement shall be done so only for administrative convenience and shall not be deemed to have any greater significance than those Supplemental Agreements which by their terms are still applicable but have not been physically attached to the Agreement.
All future such Supplemental Agreements shall be deemed to be so incorporated by reference in this Agreement when executed by the parties.

This policy regulates coffee stops for crew or individuals who customarily work away from a headquarters building. Its intent is to permit such employees to pick up coffee in route to a job site and to consume coffee in route to or at the work location, without taking an excessive time from work or adversely affecting customer or public relations.
1.	Employees will be permitted to drink coffee throughout the day that they have brought along to work.
2.	Whenever possible the number of vehicles in the vicinity of one coffee establishment shall not exceed two. However, where alternate coffee establishments are not available on the route to a job, the maximum number of personnel and vehicles permitted in the vicinity of a coffee establishment at one time shall be those assigned to one job.
3.	There are occasions (i.e. switching orders, scheduled shut downs) when crews will be unable to make a stop at a coffee establishment and observe all the provisions of this policy. In such cases if a worker and a vehicle can be spared without impeding the work, the person in charge* may send one employee a reasonable distance to the nearest place to obtain coffee for the crew.

I.	“Job Know How” Examination designed to measure an applicant's knowledge of the job for which the employee is attempting to qualify and/or the employee’s demonstrated ability to perform all phases of such work. This examination shall be prepared by the Company and the Union examiners and will consist of questions which may require either written answers and/or a demonstration of the applicant's ability to perform the work. The examiners will assign a point value to each question according to agreed importance.
II.	Supervisory Aptitude Tests which are designed to measure
the applicant's ability to effectively get work done through the efforts of the people he/she supervises. Tests for this portion of the program will vary according to the type of job for which the applicant is being considered and may include tests such as the following:
( a)	General Intelligence
( b ) Match Comprehension
( c)	Practical Judgment
( d ) Supervisory Knowledge
( e ) Reading Comprehension
( f)	Safety Knowledge
Examiners will agree upon the characteristics to be measured, the tests to be used, and the point value to be assigned to each test.
III.	Applicant Appraisal is designed to appraise certain qualities which cannot be measured by tests or examinations, such as: attitude, expression, initiative, organization and planning, interest, and so forth. The examiners will agree on the number of appraisals to be used and will designate the persons to complete them. An equal number will be prepared by the Company and the Union Representatives and the average of all appraisals will be used in determining the final score. A point value will be placed on the degree each characteristic is measured and an agreed passing grade determined before the applicant is appraised.
An applicant must have had at least three years’ experience as a first-class employee in the craft for which such employee is attempting to qualify as a Working Foreman/Forewoman, Chief, or Commercial Specialist. However, if an applicant who does not have such three years’ experience qualifies by examination, the senior employee of those who do qualify will be selected.

Time Limitations
Every effort shall be made to hold the length of an examination within reasonable time limits. It is further agreed that Human Resources will review examinations to insure time limits are reasonable and consistent for the type and complexity of the position being filled.
Instructions for Examiners
The attached instructions will be sent to each examiner prior to the preparation of an examination.
Instructions for Examiners
Introduction
The basis for promotion of employees under our Working Agreements is an examination jointly prepared by examiners appointed to represent the Union and the Company and designed to measure an employee’s ability to do the work for which such employee is attempting to qualify. It is, therefore, most important that the examiners know their responsibilities and duties in order to carry out the wishes and intent of the Company and the Union as set forth in the Working Agreement.
Preparing the Examination
(1)	During the preparation of the examination, examiners may jointly review previous examinations given for the job. Although the same format does not necessarily have to be followed, it may be helpful in maintaining consistency in both content and form. Copies of prior examinations may be obtained through Human Resources.
(2)	Questions used must relate to the job for which applicants are attempting to qualify and should measure an applicant’s ability to handle the job efficiently and safely. Questions should be clearly stated.
(3)	Passing grades, point values, and a general understanding with respect to correct answers should be agreed upon before the examination is given.
(4)	After an agreement is reached, a signed copy of the examination must be forwarded to Human Resources where it will be reviewed for consistency and to see that it is in keeping with the provisions and intent of the Working Agreement.
E X H
158
* Exhibit M4 (Cont’d)
After such review, if any changes are recommended, the copy will be returned to the examiners for their further consideration. If changes are made by the examiners, a revised, approved copy will be sent to Human Resources for file. If there are no changes recommended, the initial approved copy will be retained in Human Resources’ files.
Administering the Examination
(1)	Arrangements for giving the examination should be made by the department or division where the vacancy exists with the concurrence of the examiners. This includes time, place and notification of applicants.
(2)	Prior to the examination, arrangements should be made for pencils, paper, reference materials (if needed) and demonstration equipment (if used), etc.
(3)	The examiners shall decide who is to give instruction to the applicants. Instructions which should be given to the entire group should be clearly stated and include such items as:
( a) Introduction of examiners
( b ) Location of drinking fountains and toilet facilities
( c) Use and limitations of handbooks or other materials
( d ) Time limitations
NOTE:	Whenever an applicant asks a question relating to the
examination which the examiners feel can be answered, both the question and answer must be given to the entire group.
After the Examination
The examiners may grade the results by one of three methods: (1) They may be graded independently and the results averaged; (2) examiners may jointly agree on the value to be awarded to each answer; or (3) a combination of both methods.
The findings of the examiners shall be final.
After the exam has been graded, the results will be forwarded to Human Resources which will promptly notify the applicants of the results.
*Exhibit M4 (Cont’d)-+Exhibit 6
159
Under no circumstances are examiners to discuss the results of their grading with any of the applicants. An applicant’s request for information about the results of the examination should be referred to their supervisor.
Conclusion
The role of the examiners is an important one, since the success of the job posting and examination procedure depends upon the examiner’s sincerity and ability to fulfill their responsibilities to the Company and the Union. Every effort, therefore, should be made to insure that all employees are given a fair and equal opportunity to prove their ability and knowledge of the job for which they are attempting to qualify.

TO ALL EMPLOYEES:
As a result of a recent serious injury to an employee engaged in work for another employer, the following statement is being sent to all employees and is being added to the booklet, “Working With Central Hudson”:
Outside Employment
The Company cannot sanction its employees engaging in outside employment. If any such employment is found to interfere with an employee's regular job with the Company or tends to damage the Company's public relations, such employment will not be permitted. Also, all employees are cautioned that their jobs and various Company benefits may be jeopardized as a result of injuries sustained in outside employment.

Re: Clarification of Holidays and the Basic Workweek for Shift Workers
A.	Shift workers assigned to work schedules that provide for seven day a week 24 hour a day coverage will be scheduled to work when holidays fall within their basic scheduled workweek.
B.	Shift workers assigned to work schedules that may not necessarily require seven day a week or 24 hour a day coverage, may be scheduled off on holidays falling within their workweek and the holiday shall not be considered a basic workday. If an employee is scheduled off on such a holiday and is subsequently required to work that day, the work assignment shall be considered as an overtime assignment and all provisions covering overtime assignments will apply. If an employee is scheduled to work on such a holiday and it is subsequently found that such employee is not required to work that day, the cancellation of such employees work assignment shall be considered as a cancellation of overtime work and the appropriate provisions shall apply.
C.	Shift employees who perform maintenance or construction work normally are assigned to work from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. When so assigned these employees are considered as day workers and are usually not required to work on a holiday that occurs during the workweek. If it is necessary for an employee so assigned to work on a holiday that falls within the workweek, such assignment will be considered as overtime and treated in the same manner as overtime for a non-shift worker.
D.	When it is necessary to set up special schedules for maintenance work, emergency repairs, etc. any holidays falling within the work schedule shall be considered as overtime days and treatment shall be the same as covered by Paragraph A above.

2.	If an employee's rest period extends into the employee's basic workday, the employee will be allowed to complete this period without loss of pay; but if the employee is required to work, the employee will be paid “time plus double time instead of straight time for the time worked during the employee's basic work period which the employee would otherwise have been entitled to take off.”
3.	If the rest time does not extend into the employee's basic workday and occurs during weekends, holidays, or other scheduled days off, no payment will be made.

+ Exhibit M10 (Cont’d)- +Exhibit 11
4.

5.	If an employee who works 16 hours has sufficient time to complete 8 hours rest, even though they may not be consecutive, before the employee is asked to report for work again or before the commencement of the employee's regular workday, no payment will be made.
6.	An effort will be made to allow an employee to complete this time off. However, due to the nature of our business, occasionally there may be circumstances or emergencies which make this impossible.
7.	The foregoing understanding does not change the interpretation or administration of the so-called “7th to 4th hour” rule.

Section 501 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law presently requires a driver to hold a Class 3 Chauffeur's License to operate a truck having a maximum gross weight in excess of 18,000 lbs. We have interpreted the Utility Worker classification to require a Class 3 Chauffeur's License.
All Utility Workers are required to obtain the Class 3 license during the first four months of their probationary period. The responsibility for obtaining the necessary application forms and taking the preliminary tests will rest with the employee. However, local supervision will provide a truck for one road test. If the employee fails to pass such test, it will be the employee's responsibility to make the employee's own arrangements for any future test at the employee's own expense.

(2)	Prior to the examination, arrangements should be made for pencils, paper, reference materials (if needed) and demonstration equipment (if used), etc.
(3)	The examiners shall decide who is to give instruction to the applicants. Instructions which should be given to the entire group should be clearly stated and include such items as:
(	a) Introduction of examiners
(b)	Location of drinking fountains and toilet facilities (c) Use and limitations of handbooks or other materials
( d ) Time limitations
NOTE: Whenever an applicant asks a question relating to the examination which the examiners feel can be answered, both the question and answer must be given to the entire group.
After the Examination
The examiners may grade the results by one of three methods: (1) They may be graded independently and the results averaged; (2) examiners may jointly agree on the value to be awarded to each answer; or (3) a combination of both methods.
The findings of the examiners shall be final.
After the exam has been graded, the results will be forwarded to Human Resources which will promptly notify the applicants of the results.
Under no circumstances are examiners to discuss the results of their grading with any of the applicants. An applicant's request for information about the results of the examination should be referred to the employee's supervisor.
+ Exhibit M15 (Cont’d)- +Exhibit 17
Conclusion
171
The role of the examiners is an important one, since the success of the job posting and examination procedure depends upon the examiner's sincerity and ability to fulfill their responsibilities to the Company and the Union.
Every effort, therefore, should be made to insure that all employees are given a fair and equal opportunity to prove their ability and knowledge of the job for which they are attempting to qualify.

The Company and Union agree that a Line Clearance Man/Woman 2/C may be assigned under the direct supervision of either a Line Clearance Man/Woman or a Lineman/Linewoman of a higher classification to trim trees, clear lines, and perform other related line clearance work along energized distribution and transmission lines. In such cases, if the employee directly supervising the Line Clearance Man/Woman 2/C is not a Line Clearance Man/Woman of a higher classification, such Line Clearance Man/Woman 2/C shall be upgraded in accordance with the Working Agreement except when such related line clearance is performed from the ground. However, it should be clearly understood that such Line Clearance Man/Woman 2/C may be assigned to perform the work of a lower classification for which the employee is qualified without upgrading.

UNIFORM PRACTICE FOR THE EQUALIZATION & ASSIGNMENT OF OVERTIME AS REVISED ON JULY 1, 1975 (Revised 7/1/77, 7/1/83, 7/1/87, 7/1/89, 7/1/91, 7/1/94, 7/1/98 and 5/1/2003)
E X H
Uniform Practice for the Equalization and Assignment of Overtime.
172
+ Exhibit M17 (Cont’d)
I.	General Rules
1.	The following procedure which supersedes all other written or verbal agreements for distributing overtime shall apply to all regular and probationary employees. It will not apply to temporary employees.
2.	Scheduled overtime records and a call-out system will be maintained for employees at each work headquarters as a basis for the assignment of scheduled overtime and for calling employees for overtime work.
3.	Every effort will be made to equitably distribute scheduled overtime paid to qualified employees and to provide a fair and equal opportunity for call outs.
4.	Scheduled overtime records under this practice will start at July 1, 1964, and will continue on a “carry-over” basis thereafter. This carry over may be reduced by an agreement adopted by a two-thirds majority of the employees in the classification involved within the appropriate grouping.
In the event scheduled overtime records are reduced to zero for all employees on an overtime list in accordance with the above paragraph, the list showing all employees at zero will be put in seniority order with the senior employee being given the first opportunity to respond. The overtime list will revert to the low employee as soon as the next overtime list is published showing an employee with charged hours greater than zero.
5.	A temporary employee (not a probationary employee) will not be called out or scheduled for overtime assignments if regular employees in the same classification are able and willing to accept the assignment. This will not affect extended day work.
6.	Individual changes in procedure will be made only upon mutual agreement between the Company and the Union.
II.	Scheduled Overtime
1.	Insofar as possible scheduled overtime will be assigned by referring to a scheduled overtime record prepared each week with the low employee being given first preference. Exceptions to this general rule are as follows:
+ Exhibit M17 (Cont’d)173
a.	In the case of an extended workday those employees already assigned to the work may be asked to continue regardless of their position on the list.
b.	With respect to work in progress, those employees already assigned to the work and who are most familiar with it, may be asked to continue on an overtime basis without regard to their position on the list.
c.	If the overtime work is of a specialized nature (such as the use of Kenetron, Meuller, or welding equipment), a qualified employee who customarily does the work may be assigned.
2.	If an employee refuses a scheduled overtime assignment or accepts an overtime assignment and subsequently does not report for duty, the employee will be charged with the number of hours actually paid to the employee who worked the assignment.
3.	If an employee is absent for any reason, the employee's record will not be charged during this absence; however, in case of extended absence in excess of two weeks due to sickness, leave of absence without pay, military leave, or where an employee cannot accept extra work due to health reasons, the employee will be charged with sufficient hours to equalize the employee with the lowest active employee in the employee's classification grouping.
4A. An employee assigned to work for another utility outside Central Hudson territory will be charged with all overtime hours worked during the entire period of assignment.
B.	Employees who accept assignments to work for another utility accept such assignment for the entire period of such assignment or until the Company releases such employee(s) to return to Central Hudson. Any employees released to return to Central Hudson shall be released based on the then current scheduled overtime list.
C.	An employee who declines an assignment to work for another utility outside Central Hudson territory will be charged with all overtime hours worked during the entire period of assignment or up to the point where Central Hudson would have released such employee to return to
E X H
174
+ Exhibit M17 (Cont’d)
Central Hudson. However, if such employee who refused the assignment has a full week of vacation during the entire period or some portion of the entire period of such assignment, such employee will not be charged with refused overtime during such week of vacation.
D.	Any employee assigned to work for another utility outside Central Hudson territory who is a shift or special schedule employee shall be considered to be a day worker during the entire period of such assignment. The short notice shift schedule change provisions of the labor agreement shall continue to apply to such employees when making such assignments.
5.	Scheduled overtime records will be posted weekly and will show the number of hours charged to each employee. A copy will be supplied to the steward on the steward's request.
6.	If an employee's job classification grouping or headquarters is changed, including transfers made pursuant to Article IV J 4, the employee will start in the employee's new classification grouping or at the employee's new headquarters with the average scheduled overtime hours charged to the employee in the employee's new classification grouping or at the employee's new headquarters. For overtime records of roving Linemen/Linewomen see 1977+20. For overtime records of roving Gas Mechanics see 1987-M+30. For overtime records of roving Testers see 1991-M+40.
In the event an employee returns to his/her former position within his/her 2 week returnable right period from another bargaining unit position or within the first 2 weeks of assignment to an unclassified position, such employee shall resume in the former job he/she is returning to the amount of charged overtime he/she had at the time of transfer to the new position.
7.	If an employee is working overtime as the result of assignment on a “scheduled” basis and is “scheduled” for a further overtime assignment while working, such additional overtime shall be considered “scheduled”.
8.	When it is necessary to schedule employees as “helpers” in the line and gas forces for overtime work, the assignment will be made from a group of classifications comprised of Equipment Operators, Field Clerks, Equipment Operator-Dynamite Handlers, Linemen/
+ Exhibit M17 (Cont’d)
175
Linewomen 3/C, Gas Mechanics 3/C, Gas Mechanic Welders 3/C, Splicers 3/C and Splicer-Helpers and Mechanics 3/C. All Utility Workers within the same division and headquarters regardless of normal assignment will be listed together with those classifications listed above and will be scheduled for overtime assignment in either gas or electric. The overtime assignment will be made on the basis of the job classification required for the work; however, insofar as possible an effort will be made to equalize scheduled overtime among this group.
Where the work assignment is work of a nature that will provide an individual an opportunity to learn or be exposed to specific skills or job knowledge associated with their particular job progression, the Company may schedule an individual out of turn.
9.	When an employee has been scheduled to work and is called out before the scheduled reporting time, those hours between the call out and the scheduled reporting time will be considered call out; all other hours worked will be charged as scheduled overtime.
10.	If after going through the scheduled overtime list in the district where the overtime is required and no one accepts the scheduled overtime, then the employee(s) on the scheduled overtime list in question, who is/are the lowest on the scheduled overtime list will be selected and will be assigned to work. The overtime hours normally recorded pursuant to Section II, paragraph 2, for any individual so assigned shall be doubled (i.e. declined hours plus paid hours).
III.	Call-Outs
1.	For the purpose of this procedure a notification to an employee while off duty either to report for immediate duty or at a designated time shall be considered a call-out and made from a rotating call system.
2.	In an emergency or for work of a specialized nature if it becomes necessary to call an employee out of turn, a skip tag will be placed on the employee's call card.
E X H
3.	If an employee refuses a call or cannot be reached, the next employee in rotation will be called and the employee who could not be reached will be placed in last place. If an employee is on vacation, the employee's card
176
+ Exhibit M17 (Cont’d)
will be so marked and the employee will not be called. In such cases, the employee's card will be placed in last place.
4.	If an employee is unable to accept calls for health or other reasons, the employee may be temporarily removed from the call list until the employee is able to accept calls.
5.	Sleep time worked resulting from a call-out will be treated as part of the call-out and not as scheduled overtime.
6.	When it is necessary to call a “helper” in Customer Services, the call will be made from a rotating call list comprising Utility Workers, Equipment Operators, Field Clerk/Storekeepers, Linemen/Linewomen 3/C, Gas Mechanic 3/C, Gas Mechanic Welders 3/C, Equipment OperatorDynamite Handlers, Mechanics 3/C, Splicers 3/C and Splicer Helpers. If it is necessary to call an Equipment Operator, Field Clerk/Storekeeper, Lineman/Linewoman 3/C, Gas Mechanic 3/C or Gas Mechanic Welder 3/C within their separate classifications of work, a skip will be applied. Where the work assignment is work of a nature that will provide an individual an opportunity to learn or be exposed to specific skills or job knowledge associated with their particular job progression, the Company may call out an individual out of turn and a skip will be applied.
7.	If it is resolved by the district and the Control Center that an employee was called in error by the Control Center, that employee shall be charged with a skip.
8.	Employees transferred pursuant to Article IV J 4 shall be placed last on the callout list in the district such employee was transferred to.
IV.	Exception to Foregoing Procedures
1.	The parties agree that an employee assigned as a rover pursuant to Item 1977+20 or 1987-M+30 may be asked to work overtime in the headquarters the employee is roving to after all employees on the headquarter overtime list have been offered the opportunity to work the overtime in question.
2.	With respect to Electricians, the following will apply:
a.	When it is necessary to call a “helper” for the Electricians in the district*, preference will be given
+ Exhibit M17 (Cont’d)- +Exhibit M18
177
to Electricians 3/C, Field Clerk/Storekeepers and Utility Workers assigned to that district*.
b.	In the district*, all scheduled overtime will be distributed equitably among qualified employees in each job classification.
c.	Upon refusing scheduled work, the employee will be credited with overtime hours to be paid for, equal to the scheduled work. This will be added to the overtime record.
d.	When overtime scheduled work is necessary, an effort will be made to use the employees in the district* in which the work exists. If these employees refuse or are already engaged in overtime work, an effort again will be made, providing that additional expenses are not incurred, to obtain people from the district* in which the lowest overtime exists. The above statement does not pertain to extended days.
e.	When employees from within a district* are not available, required personnel assigned to the headquarters closest to the assigned work will be used.
*District, in this context, indicates the employees in a headquarters assigned to the General Services Division. (See Exhibit 116)

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
“PROJECT TRAINEE”
Background
The purpose of this discussion is to explain the proposed program and secure the cooperation and assistance of Local 320 in helping the Company put into effect the Pilot Program of hiring and training a limited number of “hard core” unemployed.
It is hoped that this joint effort will help find solutions to one of the Nation’s most pressing social problems.
Objective
The primary objective of this Pilot Project will be to employ, educate, counsel, train and motivate this limited number of previously unemployed or under-employed to become selfrespecting citizens of their community as well as good Union members and productive employees of Central Hudson.
General
The usual practice of seeking applicants with High School Diploma or equivalent will be waived for entry into this program. Interviewers will, to the best of their ability, determine the motivation and attitude of the candidates.
Normal physical requirements will be adhered to and candidates must be able to successfully complete the regular general physical and back x-ray examination.
Conditions of Employment
1.	Candidates in order to be eligible for “Project Trainee” employment must have attained their eighteenth birthday.
2.	Individuals will be hired as Utility Worker (Project Trainee) under Job Specification No. 103.3 for a period of up to two years. During this period, they will be considered to be “probationary employees”. For the purposes of identification, they will be called “Project Trainee” employees.
+ Exhibit M18 (Cont’d)
179
3.	All “Project Trainee” employees will become members of I.B.E.W. Local 320 no later than the thirty-first (31st) day after the date of employment.
4a. As “Project Trainee” employees, the provisions of Article IV of the Working Agreement with Local 320 shall not apply. Therefore, participants in the Pilot Program may be engaged for work only if it will not result in the layoff of regular employees. They shall have no seniority during the period they are considered “Project Trainee” employees; however, if when in the opinion of the Company they are entitled to become regular employees and they become regular employees, they shall have seniority and service starting from the date of employment with the Company. All other applicable provisions of the Working Agreement shall apply unless otherwise stated in this memorandum.
4b. It shall be understood that during the time they are considered “Project Trainee” employees they shall have no “bidding rights” under the posting and examination procedure.
4c. As “Project Trainee” employees they will not be called out or scheduled for overtime assignments if the regular employees are able and willing to accept the assignment. This will not, however, apply to extended day work.
5.	Individuals must understand and agree to abide by the requirements of the training program under which they are hired. (See attached copy of statement to be signed by “Project Trainee”.)
6.	If in the opinion of the Company any of the participating “Project Trainee” employees do not meet the requirements, the Company reserves the right to terminate the individual or individuals from the employ of the Company without notice. At the option of the Company, severance pay may be granted in lieu of notice. The Union will be notified in advance of any such action on the part of the Company in accordance with the Working Agreement.
Employee Benefits
“Project Trainee” individuals will be provided the following employee benefits during the term of the program:
1.
E X H

TRAINING PROGRAM - PILOT PROJECT
First Phase
Candidates after being selected will be enrolled in the HVOIC Feeder Program. These individuals will not be on the payroll of Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation until the feeder program has been successfully completed.
Prior to the actual start of the feeder program, candidates will receive a brief explanation from two employees giving them an indication of exactly what duties the Utility Worker performs and some insight as to what their experiences were with Central Hudson. This should present to the candidates the idea that a job really does exist at the end of their training program and will establish for them some reachable and attainable goal.
During the feeder program they will receive the following training:
5	hrs. Computational Skills (Basic Arithmetic)
5	hrs. Communication Skills (Basic English)
2 hrs. Minority History
2 hrs. Personal Development (Grooming-Hygiene, etc.)
1 hr. Consumer Education
+ Exhibit M18 (Cont’d)
181
All efforts will be made to have these courses taught during the day; however, at present they are only available on an evening basis. The schedule now provides for this training three evenings per week.
During the concluding sessions of the program, they would be given an orientation by Company employees. These would be informative type sessions with the following rudimentary subjects to be covered:
I.	Orientation-Employee Relations
A.	Program Information--self-help concept
1.	Purposes
2.	Objectives
3.	Responsibilities	of the participants
B.	Elementary Business Concepts

2.	Type of clothing to be worn
3.	Eating--bring lunches, etc.
E.	Types of skill required for future advancement
At the conclusion of the program those selected candidates will be notified that they are now eligible for temporary employment with Central Hudson and will be asked to sign a statement of understanding (see attached).
Second Phase
Upon successful completion of the first phase of training, the selected candidates will be asked to report to a specified work headquarters. After reporting, each individual will be assigned to work as a Utility Worker (Project Trainee) and will perform all of the normal duties associated with this classification.
During their first year of employment, it is understood that each candidate will voluntarily participate in a training program designed by Mind, Inc. This program requires that students listen with earphones to small transistor tape recorders and write in workbooks. They work at their own speed, repeating lessons without being observed by anyone. Roughly for each 22 hours of study they should improve their ability by 1.43 grade levels.
+ Exhibit M18 (Cont’d)
183
The students will participate two or three nights per week until they have exhausted the teaching program--the amount of time required to do this will vary depending upon their abilities and previous education, but it should not be more than 160 hours of instruction.
Third Phase
At the completion of the Mind, Inc. instruction phase (1 year maximum), the selected candidates will sign up to take the New York State High School Equivalency examination. Hopefully, all should pass. If an individual does not pass, consideration must be given to whether or not they should remain in the training program for additional instruction or be dropped from further consideration.
If the selected candidate successfully passed the examination and is to be granted a New York State High School Equivalency Diploma and the supervisors feel that the trainee’s on-the-job training has been satisfactory, the trainee will be transferred to regular status with all the rights and privileges of a regular employee.
Evaluation
The Working Foreman/Forewoman or Chief will evaluate each “Project Trainee” employee on a weekly basis. This evaluation will be routed through the Distribution Superintendent to the Human Resources coordinator.
Counseling
The Human Resources coordinator will see that each “Project Trainee” receives the necessary counseling and guidance to minimize all problems and keep the individual posted as to their progress in the program.
Supervision
As a necessary part of this program, the supervisors (including Foreman/Forewoman, Working Foreman/Forewoman or Chief) must be given some training with regard to handling this type of employee. This is a very important phase of their operation since the supervisor’s understanding and ability to handle their particular problems will be primary to their success. It will also serve to point out to the supervisor the necessity of the weekly evaluation sheets and the supervisor’s role as counselor.

The purpose of the Company's eye safety program is to provide eye protection, not eye correction, which is a personal responsibility of the employee. “Cover-glass” monogoggles, face shields, extra dark goggles with dark side-shields for use in live-line tool work and similar “common-fit” eye protection devices are storeroom issue. Personal, spectacle-type safety glasses are provided when the routine work assignment requires eye protection. This determination is made by local supervision and requires the approval of the Safety Director.
Plano (No Correction) Safety Glasses
Plano safety glasses are furnished by the Company to those employees whose routine job assignments require eye protection and who do not require corrective lenses.
Prescription Safety Glasses
Prescription safety glasses are furnished by the Company to those employees who routinely work in job assignments where eye protection is required and whose vision requires corrective lenses for the performance of the work requiring the eye protection. Authorized prescription safety glasses may be obtained by the employee through New York State

licensed practitioner(s) of the Vision Care Professionals under contract (hereinafter collectively called “Contractor”) with the Company. Prescription “sun glasses” are not provided under this program.
1.	Procuring Prescription Safety Glasses
Employee authorization to arrange for a refraction (examination), fitting and dispensing of prescription safety glasses by the Contractor must be obtained through local supervision PRIOR to arranging an appointment with the Contractor. Initial authorizations require also the approval of the Safety Director.

2.	Payment for Professional Services
a.	Professional Services, Contractor
Refraction, fitting and dispensing fees of the Contractor will be paid for by the Company. Professional fees for additional services other than routine refraction, fitting and dispensing shall be paid for by the employee if and when the employee elects to receive such additional services. The name(s) of the Contractor will be made available to employees.
b.	Professional Services, Other than Contractor
If an employee desires and elects the refraction, fitting and dispensing to be performed by a New York State Licensed Vision Care Professional other than the named Contractor, the employee may do so. In such instances the Company will reimburse the employee an amount not to exceed:
1.	$55	for	routine	refraction
2.	$15	for	routine	fitting and dispensing
3.	$15	for	repairs,

Maintenance of Spectacle-Type Protective Eyewear
1.	All plano/protective or corrective/ protective eyewear issued to or provided employees remain the property of the Company and are not to be altered in any manner.
2.	Minor repairs to plano/protective eyewear may be made at any of the issuing locations designated within the Company.
3.	Repairs to corrective/protective eyewear must be made by a New York State licensed member of the Vision Care Profession. PRIOR authorization of local supervision is required. The Company will pay for such repairs performed by the Contractor.
Employees who elect repairs to be made by other than the Contractor will be reimbursed for cost of services, an amount not to exceed the applicable fees currently agreed to between the Company and the Contractor or the amount charged by the Vision Care Professional, whichever is the lesser.
Materials required for repairs will be provided in the same manner as original purchase.
Frequency of Refractions and Replacement of Corrective/Protective Eyewear
1.	The Company will pay for the initial refraction requested by the employee only when the refraction indicates that corrective lenses must be worn for the performance of the work requiring eye protection to which the employee is routinely assigned.
2.	An interval of at least one year must elapse between the initial refraction which required the Company's provision of corrective/ protective eyewear and a subsequent refraction before the Company will assume the obligation of the second refraction.
3.	Company obligation for refractions subsequent to the
initial and first following refractions is limited to periods of not less than two years. Although the examination appointment arrangements with the vision care professional may be completed prior to the end of the two-year period, two calendar years must elapse between actual examinations.
4.	Replacement of corrective/protective eyewear will not be made on prescriptions which are four years or more from date of refraction.
Exhibit M20 (Cont’d) - Exhibit M22
189
5.	Subject to approval of local supervision, corrective/protective eyewear is to be repaired or replaced as required. Lenses must be inspected frequently. Deeply scratched or pitted lenses will not provide the designed protection and must be replaced.
6.	Routine authorizations that the Company issued for refractions and resultant prescriptions for corrective/protective eyewear are limited to single-grind and single-segment bifocal.

1965 Local 320 Negotiations T&D and TOC Job Specifications Changes Customer Services Division District Representative and Estimator
The Company requests a minor change in the job specifications for Estimator 1/C and 2/C and District Representative to make the job content of these classifications conform more closely with the basic objectives of the new Customer Services Division directed toward improving customer service. The proposed change permits the Company greater latitude and opportunity to assign either an Estimator or a District Representative to handle all of the customer and public contacts and technical layout work directly associated with the establishment of the less complicated service extensions and relocations.
The change is intended to improve customer service by eliminating duplication of effort and permitting one employee to handle the complete job of less complicated service extensions and relocations. In most cases when it has been necessary to contact the customer to obtain information concerning field work, a Commercial Representative has been called in to talk with the customer. There have been instances where several employees have eventually met with the customer to discuss the same job.
Exhibit M23 (Cont’d) - Exhibit M24
191
The Company’s public image would be improved by having one employee involved in these situations.
Attached hereto are job specifications for Estimator 1/C, Estimator 2/C and District Representative, revised to accomplish the objectives stated above. The additional language in each case is underscored.
The phrase “less complicated service extensions and relocations” as used in this memorandum and in the specifications attached hereto is defined as follows:
Any line extension not requiring more than one additional pole or any service lateral regardless of the length of such lateral; including lesser jobs involving secondary extensions; area lights or individual multiple street lights wherein only the application of the Company construction standards is required.

Memorandum Regarding Substitution of Roving Mechanic-Operator Job Specifications for Those of Hydro Station Mechanic-Operator
The Company and the Union agree:
Effective February 1,1971, the present specifications for Hydro Station Mechanic-Operator are hereby eliminated and in substitution, therefore, the attached specifications for Roving Mechanic-Operator are hereby adopted.
On February 1, 1971, the present incumbent of the hydro station classifications will be reclassified as follows:
1.	Chief Mechanic shall become Chief Roving MechanicOperator. (Pay Group 21)
2.	Hydro Station Mechanic-Operator, First Class, shall become Roving Mechanic-Operator First Class. (Pay Group 19)
3.	Hydro Station Mechanic-Operator, Second Class, shall become Roving Mechanic-Operator, Second Class. (Pay Group 16)
The present members of this crew (Charles G. Stokes, Carl G. Bush, Elwin F. Schoonmaker, Arthur D. Mott) will not be considered as shift workers under the Roving Mechanic-Operator job specifications they are initially assigned to. Roving MechanicOperators will be considered special schedule workers when relieving Hydro Station Operators First and Second Class.
1.	James J. Merritt, a present Hydro Station MechanicOperator 2/C will be frozen at his existing level in the new classification of Roving Mechanic-Operator 2/C.
2.	While on assignment to steam electric generating station normally manned on a continuous basis, Roving Mechanic-Operators will be scheduled 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday to Friday, as the basic workweek.
E X H
3.	A Roving Mechanic-Operator crew consisting of three to eight employees shall include a Chief Roving MechanicOperator when working in the field. It is recognized that the
196+ Exhibit M25 (Cont’d) -Exhibit 26 working conditions of the Roving Mechanic-Operators are similar to those of field crews and, accordingly, the requirement for the inclusion of a Chief Roving MechanicOperator for a crew of three to eight employees is recognized as based upon different conditions than those upon which the requirement of inclusion of Chief Plant Mechanic for a group of four or more employees is based (see eighth paragraph, Article V, Section C of the T&D Working Agreement).
4.	Amend Article V, Paragraph C, third Section to include Roving Mechanic-Operators.
5.	Substation Operators First and Second Class will be utilized for observation and communication only relative to peaking units not normally manned.
6.	The Chief Roving Mechanic-Operator shall receive Pay Group 22 for any hours that he/she supervises Plant Technicians First Class and/or Substation Technicians 1/C.
7.	Roving Mechanic-Operator jobs shall become jobs subject to automatic progression.
The new classification of Roving Mechanic-Operator 2/C shall have a maximum time in grade of 2-1/2 years and the new classification of Roving Mechanic-Operator 3/C shall have a maximum time in grade of one year. Selection and training will be done in accordance with Appendix A of the T&D Agreement.

Grievance 79-22
If an employee who has either accepted an assignment to a new position or becomes the incumbent in such a new position and the new position becomes unavailable to the employee (other than by virtue of a voluntary rejection of such new position or a voluntary withdrawal from such new position), the employee will continue to be considered for any other prior posted position to which the employee was assigned and thereafter withdrew (and for which the employee continues to be qualified), providing a selection under such prior posting has not been made at the date such new position becomes so unavailable.

In 1969 the Company officially adopted a policy on alcoholism that recognizes it as an illness just as deserving of diagnosis and treatment as any other illness.
It is proposed that a Joint Committee on Alcoholism consisting of three members be established to help develop and foster programs of early detection and effective motivation. These programs will be company-wide and will be designed to make maximum use of the existing communicative systems within the Company (Bulletin, etc.) as well as attempt to develop new means of communication.
This committee will not counsel or be involved with any individual employee who has a drinking problem.
The committee members will be: one from management, up to two from Local 320. They will be volunteers and they will all be recovered alcoholics.

(a) It is anticipated that where practicable, Central Hudson will perform trenching with its own personnel; however, contractors from time to time may be used to perform such trenching. When work on a job begins, trenching shall be performed by a crew of no less than two employees, one of which will be an employee of a first-class classification. The second such employee shall be in Pay Group 16, except as otherwise provided in Supplemental Agreement 1958-16 (as amended). When the work progresses to a point where operations in addition to trenching are being performed a crew consisting of a Chief Gas Mechanic or higher, a Lineman/Linewoman 1/C / Splicer 1/C and a qualified Gas
E X H
202
+ Exhibit M31 (Cont’d)
Mechanic or Gas Mechanic Welder or a crew consisting of a Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T), a Gas Mechanic 1/C or a Gas Mechanic Welder 1/C and a qualified Lineman/Linewoman / Splicer will install the entire electric system, and the main gas distribution system including gas services and meters to those homes ready for service at the time the main is installed. It is anticipated that the Gas Mechanic and Lineman/Linewoman / Splicer will work together installing the electric and gas systems during which a Gas Mechanic will be primarily responsible for making all gas connections and the Lineman/Linewoman / Splicer will be primarily responsible for making all electrical connections. It is understood that the crew which includes a Chief Gas Mechanic and a qualified Gas Mechanic may work on the energized gas systems and the crew which includes the Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) and the qualified Lineman/Linewoman / Splicer may work on the energized electric system. It is also understood that the addition of qualified employees which result in two qualified employees from each craft being present will enable the crew to work on both energized systems. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an electric crew only may, at the Company’s election, be used for installing terminating and energizing cable within a conduit system.
( b ) Without limiting the right to use a crew described in paragraph 1( a ) above, a crew consisting of a Gas Mechanic 1/C or higher and a Chief Gas Mechanic or higher may be utilized to install electric and gas services (which is included in the work referred to in paragraph 1( a ) above). The crew referred to in this paragraph 1(b) will be responsible for, but not limited to, fusing a service saddled to a plastic main or installing a mechanical saddle to a plastic main and installing, testing, purging and pressurizing a gas service up to the outlet of the meter by tapping the main. The crew referred to in this paragraph 1 ( b ) may also install a complete electric service from outside the transformer or service pedestal up to and into the meter box. The crew referred to in this paragraph 1( b ) will not be responsible for energizing this electric service. The crew referred to in this paragraph 1( b ) may also be responsible for excavating and backfilling the trench or coordinating such trenching and backfilling with a contractor. Those employees performing work referred to in this paragraph 1( b ) may also be used to perform all other work for which they are qualified including work referred to in paragraph 1( a ) of this Exhibit 31.
+ Exhibit M31 (Cont’d)
203
2.	Electric and Telephone - Trenching by Communications Company
Central Hudson will use a crew which includes at least a Lineman/Linewoman 1/C / Splicer 1/C and an additional employee who will be paid at no less than Pay Group 16. This crew will have the initial responsibility for installing and connecting all primary cables, secondary cables, secondary pedestals, transformer pads and related work. All such work will be performed while the system is deenergized; however, if such crew includes two qualified Linemen/Linewomen, they may work on the energized electric system.
3.	Electric and Telephone - Trenching by Central Hudson Electric (only) - Trenching by Central Hudson
It is anticipated that where applicable, Central Hudson will perform trenching with its own personnel; however, contractors from time to time may be used to perform such trenching. When work on a job begins, trenching shall be performed by a crew of no less than two employees one of which will be an employee of a first-class classification. When the work progresses to a point where operations in addition to trenching are being performed, Central Hudson will use a crew including a Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T), Lineman/Linewoman 2/C / Splicer 2/C or higher and an employee of Pay Group 11 or higher. The operator of trenching equipment will be an individual at Pay Group 16 or above. It is anticipated that the trenching operator will close the trench working as either part of this work crew or independently at the completion of this operation.
4.	Recognizing that the majority of electric service connections associated with URD developments will not be completed during the initial installation but will be made at some time in the future, one employee Lineman/Linewoman 1/C / Splicer 1/C or higher may make energized secondary connections in a pedestal or in a deadfront padmount transformer where the cable has been previously installed inside the transformer pad.
5.	The Company agrees that it will, in its best efforts, try to equitably distribute combination gas and electric URD work between the electric and gas crew in each district.
6.	The Company and Union have developed a program that establishes clearly the guidelines for the work involved. Therefore, it seems somewhat unnecessary to establish a
E X H
204
+ Exhibit M31 (Cont’d)-Exhibit M32
formal review committee at this time. However, the Company would not be hesitant to convene a small committee to discuss any problems that may arise from the trial agreement we have reached on URD.
7.	In making assignments for URD work, the supervisor in charge of each individual work headquarters will make every effort to consider the expressed preferences of individuals to perform URD-type work.
8.	During the period of this agreement, the Company will train bargaining unit employees in the operation of fault locating equipment. Upon the completion of such training, the bargaining unit employees will normally be used to operate such equipment.

CALL-OUT PAY AND OVERTIME MEALS
Section H of Article V of the T&D Contract or Section E, Article V, of the TOC Contract was originally intended to cover the application of overtime meals. Although it is expected that liberal treatment will be applied in unusual cases, it is expected that both parties will be fair and reasonable in the application of the principles intended. It is impracticable to outline specific treatment to be applied to all individual situations that may arise. Unforeseen circumstances may arise requiring special interpretation which may not necessarily form a precedent for handling other similar situations. To insure uniformity, the interpretation of these sections under normal predictable circumstances will be as follows:
An employee required to continue work for a period longer than two hours beyond the scheduled quitting time shall be entitled to a meal furnished or paid for by the Company and to an additional meal for each additional five hours worked thereafter.
An employee who is called or scheduled to work before or after the employee's regular workday schedule and misses a meal or meals thereby, or is called or scheduled to report for work more than one hour in advance of the regular starting time and misses a meal or meals thereby, shall be entitled to a meal or meals furnished or paid for by the Company.
Exhibit M32 (Cont’d) - *Exhibit M33
205
A call-out is a communication to an employee while off duty directing the employee to proceed immediately to a designated work location to engage in overtime work or to report for such work at a designated time.
On a call-out for immediate duty, time shall begin from the time of call with the understanding that the employee shall be reasonable and fair in his/her promptness in reporting.
On a call-out to report for work at a designated time, compensation shall begin at the time of leaving for work. Notice to report for work at a designated time shall be given at least eight hours prior to the start of the employee's regularly scheduled basic workday. An employee who is called to report for work at a designated time and such call is subsequently cancelled shall receive a cancellation payment equivalent to three hours' pay at the applicable rate. (See +Exhibit M127 -17)
If an employee is scheduled or called out to report for work at a designated time and if the employee cannot be relieved after starting duty and is requested to obtain the employee's regular meal in advance of the regular starting time, a meal allowance time at the applicable rate may be paid for by the Company.
On a call-out to report for work at a designated time to cover an unscheduled absence, travel time and meal allowance time, if applicable, shall not be considered as working time for the purpose of applying the sleep time provisions of this Working Agreement. (See +Exhibit M127 -17)
Overtime meals shall be eaten on Company time and only such time shall be taken as is reasonably necessary to obtain and eat the meal.
Overtime meals shall be those eaten before or after regular working hours or those covered by Article III E of the T&D Contract or Article III D of the TOC Contract.

(Amended 6/1/83)
To All Supervisors:
During the 1954 negotiations with Local 320 there was considerable discussion about the distinction between general and direct supervision as the terms are used in the job specifications.
To insure uniform understanding the following summary of the discussion has been prepared and issued.
General Supervision
The term “under general supervision” means that an employee performs their duties in accordance with general instructions from a supervisor or from a qualified higher rated employee. The employee is expected to exercise judgment and to make decisions regarding the performance of such duties. The employee is responsible for the completion of the employee's duties. It is contemplated that the employee will not require continuous supervision and that the employee will be supervised principally on the basis of overall results achieved. The employee may be required to direct the work of other employees.
Exhibit M37 (Cont’d)-+Exhibit M39
209
Direct Supervision
The term “under direct supervision” means that an employee performs the employees duties under the guidance or direction of a supervisor or of a qualified higher rated employee who will remain in the general vicinity of the job to check the progress of the work from time-to-time, and who will be available to make decisions regarding the performance of the work, and who will be responsible for the completion of the job. The employee may be assisted by other employees.

November 20, 1952 (Amended 6/1/83)
The Company’s work of line clearance has been greater in amount each year as its lines have been extended, and more important as increasing reliance is placed upon electric service. Every effort is being continuously directed to making electric service just as reliable as practically possible. Many factors operate against the supply of uninterrupted service, and cause the interruptions which distribution and transmission lines experience. The major factor is interference from trees, and there is none as difficult to bring under control.
It has been the Company’s practice to have this work performed by its line forces and by forces of tree trimming contractors. The amount performed annually by each has varied, being dependent upon the amount of line construction and maintenance work the line forces had to do. This practice has produced reasonably satisfactory results, although at times needed tree trimming has been delayed because of insufficient forces to do the work. Consideration of the increasing importance of this work and the necessity for performing more of it as time goes on, led to a review of the practices of carrying on line clearance. Based on this review it has been concluded that it would be more advantageous for the Company to employ tree trimming crews of its own to carry on a large part of the line clearance work, and to continue to perform the remainder of the work with its line crews and with tree trimming contractors. The
E X H
210
+ Exhibit M39 (Cont’d)
Company intends, therefore, to modify its present practice to that extent and hopes thereby to obtain better and more continuous clearance of lines, to effect a better control of public relations and to improve the quality of electric service supplied.
In order to test the merits of the proposed method of handling line clearance an organization of tree trimming crews will be created with headquarters at Eltings Corners. These crews will be comprised of persons specially trained for this work who will perform on a year-round basis such work as can be economically conducted from Eltings Corners. Initially there will be created three crews, each consisting of one First-Class Tree Trimmer, and one Second-Class Tree Trimmer, under the supervision of a Tree Trimmer Foreman/Forewoman.
It is intended that this organization will be set up during December, when it is expected the equipment ordered for the crews will be received. To recruit employees for these new positions, job postings are being made herewith and applications for these positions are solicited.
The duties of a Lineman/Linewoman include all the work which is done on transmission and distribution lines. Line clearance, such as tree trimming, is one of these duties. The creation of the new position of Tree Trimmer shall in no way alter or set aside any of the duties which Linemen/Linewomen have historically performed. The duties of a tree trimmer shall be complementary to those of a Lineman/Linewoman.

Lineman/Linewoman Taking Rotation Test
In the course of work operations involving a customer (or customers) who has polyphase electric service, it is sometimes necessary to disconnect such service in order to make modification to some part of the physical plant which serves the facility.
In such instance, it is necessary to make a rotation test before service is disconnected to provide a base for checking rotation when service is to be restored.
The Company feels that from the standpoint of operating efficiency, taking into consideration the job specifications and qualifications of existing Lineman/Linewoman 1/C or higher, the taking of such rotation tests by such personnel is an appropriate assignment. All other phase rotation tests presently performed by Testers will continue to be performed by Testers.

Re: Travel Allowance
An employee who is declared excess under the provisions of Article IX D of the Working Agreement and who is transferred to another headquarters that is a greater distance from the employee's place of residence than the employee's headquarters on the date of the declaration of excess and who subsequently bids to and accepts a position which requires travel equal to or greater than the distance from the employee's place of residence at the time of the original transfer, the employee will
Exhibit M52 (Cont’d) - * Exhibit M53
225
remain eligible for the mileage allowance under Article V P (T&D) or V H (TOC) for a period of time no longer than the applicable time period referred to in such sections measured from the date of the declaration of excess. Provided, however, if the subsequent bid and acceptance is to a position of a greater pay rate than the employee received on the date of the declaration of excess, the employee's mileage allowance will cease.
If the position subsequently bid and accepted requires travel less than the distance from the employee's place of residence at the time of the original transfer, the employee will be eligible for a mileage allowance based on such distance provided that such distance is greater than the distance from the employee's headquarters on the date of the declaration of excess from such place of residence for a period of time no greater than one year from the time declared excess and further provided if the subsequent bid and acceptance is to a position of a greater pay rate than the employee received on the date of the declaration of excess, the employee's mileage allowance will cease.
For the purposes of this memorandum, there shall be no differentiation for travel distance between Roseton and Danskammer.

UNIFORM PRACTICE FOR THE EQUALIZATION & ASSIGNMENT OF OVERTIME APPLICABLE TO THE TOC BARGAINING UNIT
I. General Rules
1.	The following procedure, which supersedes all other written or verbal agreements for distributing overtime, shall apply to all regular and probationary classified employees (except Part-time CSRs), subject to the tOc Labor Agreement. It will not apply to temporary employees.
2.	Scheduled overtime records and a callout system will be maintained for employees for each area as determined from time to time by Management in which two or more classified employees work together on a specific type of work and will serve as a basis for the assignment of scheduled overtime and for calling employees for overtime work. Such area may include a section or
E X H
226
* Exhibit M53 (Cont’d)
working unit within a division at a work headquarters, and such area will hereinafter be called the “responsibility area”.
3.	Every effort will be made to equitably distribute scheduled overtime among qualified employees in each responsibility area and to provide a fair and equal opportunity for callouts.
4.	Scheduled overtime records under this practice will start at January 1, 1983 and will continue on a “carry-over” basis thereafter. This carry-over may be reduced by an agreement adopted by a two-thirds majority of the employees in the classification involved within the responsibility area.
In the event scheduled overtime records are reduced to zero for all employees on an overtime list in accordance with the above paragraph, the list showing all employees at zero will be put in seniority order with the senior employee being given the first opportunity to respond. The overtime list will revert to the low employee as soon as the next overtime list is published showing an employee with charged hours greater than zero.
5.	A temporary employee (not a probationary employee) will not be called out or scheduled for overtime assignments if regular employees in the same classification within the same responsibility area are available and willing to accept the assignment. This provision will not be applicable to an extended workday.
6.	Changes in this procedure will be made only upon mutual agreement between the Company and Local 320.
II.	Scheduled Overtime
1.	Insofar as possible, scheduled overtime will be assigned by referring to a scheduled overtime record within the responsibility area with the low employee in such area being given first preference. Exceptions to this general rule are as follows:
a.	In the case of an extended workday, those employees already assigned to the work may be asked to continue regardless of their position on the list.
* Exhibit M53 (Cont’d)227
b.	With respect to work in progress, those employees already assigned to the work and who are most familiar with it, may be asked to continue on an overtime basis without regard to their position on the list.
c.	If the overtime work is of a specialized nature, a qualified employee within the responsibility area, who customarily does the work, may be assigned.
2.	If an employee refuses a scheduled overtime assignment or accepts an overtime assignment and subsequently does not report for duty, such employee will be charged with the number of hours actually paid to the employee who worked the assignment.
3.	If an employee is absent for any reason, such employee’s record will not be charged with overtime hours during this absence; however, in case of extended absence in excess of two weeks due to sickness, leave of absence without pay, military leave, or where an employee cannot accept overtime work due to health reasons, the employee will be charged with sufficient hours to equalize such employee with the lowest active employee in such employee’s classification within the responsibility area.
4A	. An employee assigned to work for another utility outside Central Hudson territory will be charged with all overtime hours worked during the entire period of assignment.
B.	Employees who accept assignment to work for another utility accept such assignment for the entire period of such assignment or until the Company releases such employee(s) to return to Central Hudson. Any employees released to return to Central Hudson shall be released based on the then current scheduled overtime list.
E X H
C.	An employee who declines an assignment to work for another utility outside Central Hudson territory will be charged with all overtime hours worked during the entire period of assignment or up to the point where Central Hudson would have released such employee to return to Central Hudson. However, if such employee who refused the assignment has a full week of vacation during the entire period or some portion of the entire period of such assignment, such employee will not be charged with refused overtime during such week of vacation.
228
* Exhibit M53 (Cont’d)
D.	Any employee assigned to work for another utility outside Central Hudson territory who is a shift or special schedule employee shall be considered to be a day worker during the entire period of such assignment. The short notice shift schedule change provisions of the labor agreement shall continue to apply to such employees when making such assignments.
5.	Scheduled overtime records will be posted weekly and will show the number of hours charged to each employee. A copy will be supplied to the steward on written request.
6.	If an employee’s job classification or responsibility area is changed, including transfers made pursuant to Article IV N 3, the employee will start in the new classification or at the new responsibility area with the average scheduled overtime hours charged to the employees in the employee’s new classification or at the new responsibility area.
In the event an employee returns to his/her former position within his/her 2-week returnable right period from another bargaining unit position or within the first 2 weeks of assignment to an unclassified position, such employee shall resume in the former job he/she is returning to the amount of charged overtime he/she had at the time of transfer to the new position.
7.	If an employee is working overtime as the result of assignment on a “scheduled” basis and is “scheduled” for a further overtime assignment while working, such additional overtime shall be considered “scheduled”.
8.	When an employee has been scheduled to work and is called out before the scheduled reporting time, those hours between the callout and the scheduled reporting time will be considered callout; all other hours worked will be charged as scheduled overtime.
9.	If after going through the scheduled overtime list in the district where the overtime is required and no one accepts the scheduled overtime, then the employee(s) on the scheduled overtime list in question, who is/are the lowest on the scheduled overtime list will be selected and will be assigned to work. The overtime hours normally
* Exhibit M53 (Cont’d)
229
recorded pursuant to Section II, Paragraph 2, for any individual so assigned shall be doubled (i.e. declined hours plus paid hours).
III. Call-outs
1.	For the purpose of this procedure, a notification to an
employee while off duty either to report for immediate duty or at a designated time shall be considered a call-out and made from a rotating call system.
2.	In an emergency or for work of a specialized nature, if it becomes necessary to call an employee out of turn, a skip tag will be placed on the call card.
3.	If an employee refuses a call or cannot be reached, the next employee in rotation will be called, and the employee who could not be reached will be placed in last place. If an employee is on vacation, the employee’s card will be so marked, and the employee will not be called. In such cases, the card will be placed in last place.
4.	If an employee is unable to accept calls for health or other reasons, the employee may be temporarily removed from the call list until the employee is able to accept calls.
5.	“Sleep time” worked resulting from a call-out will be treated as part of the call-out and not as scheduled overtime.
6.	If it is resolved that an employee who responded for overtime duty was called in error, that employee shall be charged with a skip.
7.	Employees transferred pursuant to Article IV N 3 shall be placed last on the callout list in the district such employee was transferred to. (See Exhibit 116)

Exhibit A to that certain Agreement, dated October 16, 1981, by and between the Company and Local 320, as last amended May 1, 2003 and, as amended, is restated in its entirety to read as follows:
Exhibit A
This Agreement shall be known as the “CSR-Part-time Agreement”.
The Customer Service Representative classification has been added to the automatic progression series of the “TOC” Agreement and the titles have been changed to CSR 1/C, CSR 2/C, and CSR 3/C. The CSR-D classification was eliminated; and CSR 3/C and CSR 2/C were retained as training positions with no change in job specifications or pay grade. Maximum times in grade are one year for CSR 3/C and 18 months for CSR 2/C. If an employee in the 2/C position fails to qualify for the 1/C position, the employee will be given one additional opportunity to qualify. The second qualifying examination will be given at the option of the Company anytime between six months and one year following the first examination. Effective July 1, 1989, the classification of Customer Service Representative-E.H. has been added to the automatic progression series as part of the full-time Customer Service Representative series as a special schedule position under Article III B of the TOC Labor Agreement and reference to the term “full-time CSR” referred to herein shall include such new classification, except as specifically excluded herein.
The Company has established three new classifications entitled Customer Service Representative First Class - Part-Time, Customer Service Representative Second Class - Part-Time and Customer Service Representative Third Class -Part-Time in the automatic progression series.
*Exhibit M54 (Cont’d)231
Successful applicants will be assigned and will go through the regular CSR training program on a part-time basis and the maximum time in grade will be two years for CSR 3/C - Part-Time and three years for CSR 2/C - Part-Time. The Company maintains the right to post for a maximum of one (1) CSR-pT in each of the Fishkill, Catskill, Kingston and Newburgh Headquarters and a maximum of seventeen (17) CSRs-PT in the Poughkeepsie Headquarters; however, the total CSR-Part-Time complement will be determined from time to time by the Company but will not exceed 17 or 25% of the total number of full-time CSRs (excluding CSRs-E.H. and CSRs in progression to CSR-E.H.), whichever is greater, as determined on July 1, 1995 and updated on each January 1 and July 1 thereafter. Written notification to the President and Business Manager of Local 320 of such numbers will be provided.
No additional CSR-PT positions, in addition to those listed in the previous paragraph, will be posted, or otherwise filled, unless there is mutual agreement between the Company and Union.
The Part-time CSR position will be posted before Parttime CSR positions are filled from outside the Company.
Full-time CSRs at the headquarters will be given the first opportunity to respond to requests for call-outs. If the Company elects to extend the hours of CSR work for any reason, then the Company may assign either full-time CSRs on an overtime basis or part-time CSRs on a straight-time basis.
If a Customer Service Representative or CSR-E.H. is assigned to an office open to the public between the night time hours of 6:00 p.m. and 12 midnight, or a CSR-Part-Time is assigned to an office open to the public between the night time hours of 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., there will be at least one additional employee (classified or unclassified) assigned to that office during such hours.
Part-time CSRs will work a maximum of 1,040 hours per year July 1 through June 30 and the Company has the right to schedule such part-time CSRs for any hours of work during any day of the week. Paid hours for vacation and holidays will not be included in the 1,040 hours. A part-time CSR who is unavailable to meet an assigned work schedule four times in any 30-day period will be terminated; however, any such unavailability will not be charged for absences associated with a death in the family (as defined in paragraph VIII I 3 of the TOC Labor Agreement). If scheduled, part-time CSRs will be assigned for a minimum of three (3) consecutive hours and they will receive straight time for all hours worked except they will be paid time and one-half for all
E X H
232* Exhibit M54 (Cont’d) hours worked on those holidays designated in Article III E of the Working Agreement or those hours worked in excess of eight hours per day. The applicable negotiated hourly wage for full-time CSRs will be the same hourly wage for part-time CSRs. (See ^Exhibit M125 and 1987-M*48)
A Part-Time CSR who is called out in accordance with 1987-50 will be compensated at the prevailing overtime rate for all hours worked outside their normal schedule and it shall not be considered as a reschedule of their work schedule. In the event such CSR-PT declines such callout it shall not be counted as one of the 4 unavailables within any 30-day period under *Exhibit M54 of the Labor Agreement.
The Company will provide each of the individual Customer Service Representative Part-time employees, no later than the 15th day of each month, the anticipated work plan for that employee for the following month. Such plan will continue to be subject to change without notice.
Part-time CSRs will receive the paid holidays as outlined in Article III E of the “Full-Time” Working Agreement. Holiday pay will be for four (4) hours at the straight-time rate.
Part-time CSRs will earn vacation at the rate of one (1) day for each 90 hours worked in a calendar year not to exceed ten (10) days.
Additional vacation for part-time CSRs will be earned for additional years of service, either as full-time or part-time employees as follows:
Five years of service - one and one-half (1 1/2) days for each 90 hours worked in a calendar year not to exceed fifteen (15) days.
Ten, eleven or twelve years of service - 12.8 hours for each 90 hours worked in a calendar year not to exceed sixteen (16) days. Thirteen or fourteen years of service - 13.6 hours for each 90 hours worked in a calendar year not to exceed seventeen (17) days.
Fifteen years of service - two (2) days for each 90 hours worked in a calendar year not to exceed twenty (20) days.
Twenty-two years of service - two and one-half (2 1/) days for each 90 hours worked in a calendar year not to exceed twenty-five (25) days.
Thirty years of service - three (3) days for each 90 hours worked in a calendar year not to exceed thirty (30) days.
* Exhibit M54 (Cont’d)233
Vacation pay will be for four (4) hours per day at the straight time rate. Vacation for part-time CSRs will be taken in the following calendar year. Vacations earned can be deferred pursuant to the provisions of Article VIII A-4 of the TOC Labor Agreement. Requests for vacation will be subject to the approval of the Supervisor, but the Company reaffirms that each employee is entitled to two weeks’ vacation in their normal vacation period (provided they are eligible for such two weeks’ vacation) in accordance with Article VIII of the Working Agreement. Part-time CSRs shall not be paid for any absence except as outlined above for holidays and vacation. (See 1985-M*36)
Part-time CSRs will become members of the Retirement Income Plan after meeting the one year eligibility requirements but they will not be eligible for nonstatutory benefits under the Company’s self-insured disability plan. Effective October 1, 1983, part-time CSRs may elect to be covered for $10,000 of life insurance coverage. Effective October 1, 1989, CSRs-PT may elect to participate in the Health Benefit Plan with individual coverage only. If a CSR-PT elects family coverage, he or she will pay the difference between the individual rate and the family rate. Any part-time CSR who becomes a permanent fulltime CSR will become eligible for family health care benefits the first of the month coinciding with or following employment as a full-time employee. Effective July 1, 1998, Customer Service Representatives - Part-Time shall only contribute one-half of the health benefit amounts contributed by Customer Service Representatives - Full-Time.
Part-time CSRs will become members of the Company’s Wellness Program effective July 1, 1998.
“Service” for a CSR-PT and a PT will be continuous from the date of the employee’s date of employment. “Seniority” for a CSR-PT and a PT shall commence from the date a CSR-PT or a PT is awarded a full-time position under either of the Full-time Agreements and shall accrue only while such employee is in any full-time position except as follows:
Seniority of all CSR-PTs shall accrue at the rate of one (1) day for each two (2) days of employment as a CSR-PT retroactive to the date of their entering or re-entering the CSR-PT classification including those who left the classification prior to July 1, 1994. Seniority for CSR-PTs who were incumbents at July 1, 1983, and have not left the classification, shall continue to accrue on the basis in effect on June 30, 1994; however, if such incumbents are assigned to a full-time position and, thereafter, are
E X H
234* Exhibit M54 (Cont’d) reassigned to the CSR-PT classification (other than an exercise of the incumbent’s return rights), seniority shall accrue, thereafter, at the rate set forth in the immediately preceding sentence.
Seniority of all CSR-PTs accrued to July 1,1983 shall be recognized.
New service work and front lobby customer contact, including cashier duties, will be performed by full-time and/or parttime CSRs.
Except as may otherwise be provided herein and in the said TOC “Full-time Agreement”, the part-time CSRs will have all the rights and obligations of other employees covered by said TOC “Full-Time” Agreement except that paragraphs M-1 of Article IV of said TOC “Full-time” Agreement shall apply only to the Service of said Part-time CSRs and further except that paragraphs L and M-2 of said Article IV shall be inapplicable to said part-time CSRs.
CSR Part-time employees (“CSR-PTs”) and part-time employees (“PTs”) in the Local 320 Part-time Agreement (“Parttime Agreement”) shall have full bidding rights on all job postings in the Local 320 T&D and TOC Full-time Agreements (“Full-time Agreements”) after the full-time bid list has been exhausted. Parttime employees in the Local 320 Part-time Agreement shall have full bidding rights on all job postings in the Local 320 Part-time Agreement after the full-time bid list has been exhausted. Employees in the job classification of Cleaning Worker (139.1) have no such bidding rights except as provided in Item 40 B of the 1989 Memorandum of Agreement. Seniority shall prevail, and where seniority is equal, service shall prevail. (See 1985-M*33)
Effective October 1, 1983, Group Life Insurance coverage of $10,000 will be offered to the CSR-PTs and the PTs. This coverage will also be offered to the CSR-PTs regardless of the number of hours worked. Contribution for such overage will be at the rate of 150 per $1,000 of coverage. No AD&D coverage will be provided, and no coverage into retirement will be provided.
Part-time CSR employees, the majority of whose regular scheduled basic workday hours in any workday occur within the period from 4:00 PM to 8:00 AM, shall be paid a night differential of 5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour effective May 1,2008, effective May 1,2009,5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour and, effective November 1,2009,5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour, effective May 1, 2010, 5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour and effective November 1, 2010, 5% of Pay Group 19.1 per hour for the total basic hours worked. However, when the basic hours worked in any workday are less than the majority of total hours worked then the night differential shall be paid only for those basic hours worked within
* Exhibit M54 (Cont’d) - +Exhibit M56 235
the period from 4:00 PM to 8:00 AM. The night differential shall not be paid for any work performed for which overtime is paid.
Part-time CSR employees scheduled for work on Saturday or Sunday between the hours of 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM will be paid at an hourly premium of 5% of Pay Group 19.1 effective May 1,2008, effective May 1,2009, such hourly premium will be increased to 5% of Pay Group 19.1, effective November 1, 2009, such hourly premium will be increased of 5% of Pay Group 19.1, effective May 1,2010, such hourly premium will be increased to 5% of Pay Group 19.1 and effective November 1, 2010, such hourly premium will be increased to 5% of Pay Group 19.1, provided, however, such premium shall not be paid for any work performed for which overtime is paid.

New Meter Set
The work associated with establishing a new service including inspection of appliance installations, care for leaks and stoppages, adjustment of appliances and inspection and adjustment of gas regulators, shall be performed by Commercial Representatives. A gas crew may connect the new service piping to the customer piping and set the gas meter.
Overtime
E X H
Relighting is to be performed on an overtime basis by gas crews in accordance with these general guidelines. Notwithstanding the Company’s right to uniformly make assignments on an overtime and regular time basis, gas crews will be assigned to relight on an overtime basis when repairing leaks, responding to emergencies, and relighting at the completion of an assignment on an extended workday. Gas crews will not be assigned to relight appliances on an overtime basis when the work has been scheduled with the knowledge that gas service will be interrupted. Commercial Representatives perform these scheduled overtime relights.
236
+ Exhibit M56 (Cont’d) - Exhibit 57
General
Bearing in mind that the relight assignment to a gas crew is intended to be incidental to their normal construction, repair and maintenance work, there is no restriction on number of services which may be relighted. Assignments to relight construction and maintenance jobs should be made with the purpose of scheduling and utilizing all employees in an effective manner.
Relocating Gas Meters
The relocation of the meter and associated piping, including tying into the customer piping, can be performed by either craft, separately or jointly, subject to limiting members of a gas crew to installing and tying in 10 feet or less of filler pipe between the new meter and the customer piping. Relighting will not be performed by members of a gas crew.
Changing a Gas Meter in Accordance with the PSC Time Test Program
Commercial Representatives shall be responsible for changing small meters associated with the PSC time test program. A crew consisting of at least a Gas Mechanic and a Commercial Representative may work jointly to change a large meter.
Interruption by Others
When service is interrupted by a third party excavator, relighting will not be performed by gas crews. When the interruption is caused by the gas crew in response to damage by a third party excavator, the management reserves the right to assign Gas Mechanics the responsibility for relighting.

Re: Response to Grievance 1976-88 Third Step
I understand your arguments and more importantly the fear, or perhaps suspicion, on the part of the Meter Testers that we are reaching out to reduce the Tester work. First, let me tell you, categorically, that we have no intention of having anyone but Meter Testers perform mandated Public Service Commission tests (i.e. rotating standards). We do not believe that the “black box” is a “testing” device as we are familiar with that term. This is merely a tool for helping the Commercial Representative resolve customer complaints and is used to indicate to the customer or the Commercial Representative 1st Class and above that there are no fundamental problems with the service; and the use of such a tool falls within the Commercial Representatives 1st Class and above job specification. We find no violation of the Working Agreement but we will take a good, hard look at the organizational function of those various activities to see if we can serve the customer more effectively and economically than we are currently doing.

December 17, 1962 (Amended 5/1/08)
Re: Clarification of Meal Provisions
At this year's negotiations, Local 320 asked for a clarification of meal provisions, especially as applied to extended day work.
For example, when employees are required to work an extended day at Danskammer, on a job requiring continuous coverage, it is the practice to stagger meal periods. In applying the section which provides for a meal two hours after quitting time and an additional meal for each five hours worked thereafter, employees who are asked to eat early may be entitled to a second meal before they leave for home under the “five-hour” rule, while those eating later may not. This apparent inequity comes about by applying the existing interpretation that time for determining eligibility for a second meal starts after the completion of the first meal.
The Company recognized an inequity and was willing to apply uniform treatment in such cases by agreeing to a “sevenhour” rule which merely combines the two and five hour provisions. In agreeing to this rule, however, it was the understanding of Company representatives that time to eat the first meal would not be considered as time “worked” and would not be a part of the seven hours.
It was quite apparent that there were misunderstandings as to what was agreed to. The Company representatives thought the settlement was based on time “worked”, whereas the Union members thought the agreement to mean an elapsed seven hour period starting from the normal quitting time. In defense of their position, the Union referred to examples quoted by one of their members during negotiations to clarify the Union's understanding.
In recognition of the apparent misunderstanding with respect to meals to which an employee may be entitled when required to work an extended day, the Company shall arrange to provide meals for such extended days with the following understandings:
Exhibit M61 (Cont’d) - Exhibit 63
239
1.	Overtime meals will be furnished or paid for the first elapsed seven hours of an extended day.
For example: If an employee whose normal quitting time is 4:30 p.m. continues on an extended day basis for seven hours until 11:30 p.m., he becomes eligible for a second meal at 11:30 p.m. In other words, time to eat the first meal will be treated as working time only for calculating the seven hours.
2.	Such meals will apply only to extended day overtime assignments at the end of a regular workday as set forth in the first paragraph of Article V, Paragraph H, of the Local 320 Contract, effective July 1, 1962.
3.	In agreeing to the foregoing, the Company is not conceding that time to eat a meal or travel time is time “worked” for the purpose of interpreting other provisions of the Working Agreement.

The following is in settlement of Grievances 81-03, 81-29, and 81-31, and shall continue during the term of the current Working Agreement:
The Company will continue its commitment to the Union that normally manned storerooms will be staffed by an employee of at least Pay Group 18 (or as may be provided in Item 1957-20 of the Memorandums of Agreement to Current Working Agreement), which employee will continue to be the responsible person for receiving and issuing material. However, CRT input will continue to be performed by an employee of a lower classification, including but not limited to the Equipment Operator-Special, who will be trained in the operation of the CRT.
Effective June 1, 1982, the Stock Handler classification will be increased to Pay Group 16, and effective as of said date, the job specification of Stock Handler is hereby amended as set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part of this settlement.
The Company will provide the opportunity for training for the Stock Handler classification to qualify for a N.Y.S. Motor Vehicle 1st Class Chauffeur's License required to operate and drive a tractor trailer with a fifth wheel. The incumbent Stock Handlers will continue at Pay Group 15 until they so qualify and will be given the opportunity to so qualify on or before December 1, 1982 but not thereafter. In the event the incumbent Stock Handlers are unable to qualify on or before December 1, 1982, such Stock Handlers will be permitted to continue in the job classification of Stock Handler but at Pay Group 15.
Any employee of a higher classification may be assigned to perform the work of a lower classification if the employee is qualified to perform such work.

Line Clearance Job Area Reporting Program
In response to your request for automatic progression and in an attempt to make our trimming crews more competitive with contractors, the following is proposed:
The Company shall have the right to assign Line Clearance personnel to their assigned headquarters or to any given job area within a radius of 25 miles of the employee’s assigned headquarters. Those assigned Line Clearance personnel will report to that area at the normal starting time and be dismissed from that area at the normal quitting time. The work assignments of line clearance employees will include trimming work and other incidental work. Personnel assigned to report to job areas in excess of the 25-mile radius in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be subject to the provisions of Article V G. In consideration of the fact that Line Clearance personnel would be required to report to a specific but varying job area, designated by the Company, the Company will grant automatic progression over an 18-month period from Line Clearance Man/Woman 2/C to 1/C. Existing Line Clearance Men/Women 2/C with more than 18 months in grade will be examined without delay for promotion and assignment at their existing headquarters. All other rules of automatic progression shall apply to employees covered under this proposal.
Additionally, when required to report to a job area within the 25 mile radius other than the employee’s assigned headquarters, the employee will be reimbursed for travel costs related to any additional tolls and any additional mileage from the employee’s home to the designated job area in excess of the mileage from his or her home to the assigned headquarters. Reimbursement will be based on the road miles driven and paid in accordance with the mileage rate established in Article V P of the Labor Agreement.
The Company shall continue to assign a Chief Line Clearance Man/Woman whenever four or more employees are brought together as a crew to do trimming.
The Company shall post for one additional Chief Line Clearance Man/Woman with no increase in complement. In addition, the Company agrees to increase the rate of pay for Chief Line Clearance Men/Women from 19.0 to 19.1 and the rate of pay for Line Clearance Men/Women 1/C from 17.0 to 17.1.
+ Exhibit M68 (Cont’d)243
These proposals are made with the understanding that the Company is not committed to maintaining any established complement of Chief Line Clearance Men/Women, Line Clearance Men/Women 1/C or Line Clearance Men/Women 2/C in the future. However, Management agrees to maintain a complement of no less than three Chiefs so long as personnel are assigned to report to areas other than their assigned headquarters.
Line Clearance personnel for the purposes of this Line Clearance Job Area Reporting Program shall be defined as those employees in the job classifications of Chief Line Clearance Man/Woman - 106.0; Line Clearance Man/Woman 1/C - 106.1; and Line Clearance Man/Woman 2/C - 106.2. Job specifications for these classifications are attached hereto.
This Program, known as the Line Clearance Job Area Reporting Program, shall remain in effect during the term of this Working Agreement. If mutually agreed to by both parties at the expiration of this Working Agreement, the Program shall be made permanent. If either party does not agree to continue the Program, the Program will be cancelled as of the expiration of this Working Agreement, however, all employees who have received the benefit of an upgrade as a result of the Program shall remain in the positions and pay groups in which they have been placed. Following such cancellation, all future employees who may enter the classification of Chief or Line Clearance Man/Woman 1/C or 2/C shall enter the classification in accordance with job specifications and associated pay groups in effect on June 30, 1985, and the automatic progression provision from 2/C to 1/C shall be eliminated.
Management shall insure that all employees receive timely delivery of all pertinent notices and communications including job postings, paychecks, newsletters, credit union transactions, time sheets, crew logs, vehicle cards, etc.
Whenever reporting areas are changed, Management shall be responsible for arranging the relocation of the equipment.
Headquarters shall be established in accordance with Article IV J with a concurrent posting at the time the vacancy is initially posted.
This agreement shall be attached as an Exhibit in the Labor Agreement in accordance with Article XI B.

Any Chief Gas Mechanic (Job Classification 125.0) may apply for the classification of Chief Gas Mechanic Welder. The employee shall make application by notifying the Supervisor in writing that the employee wishes to qualify for the position of Chief Gas Mechanic Welder. The qualification examination for such classification will be scheduled within 90 days from the time of notification. If the applicant is unable to successfully demonstrate the ability to meet the requirements of a Gas Mechanic Welder 1/C, the applicant will be given an opportunity to take a second qualifying examination within 90 days of the first examination. An applicant who fails the second examination will be ineligible to apply for the classification of Chief Gas Mechanic Welder in the future.
The Company will not provide training or training time that may be required by the applicant to meet the qualifications for Chief Gas Mechanic Welder. The Company will, however, provide applicants the time and material necessary to take the welding and other qualifying examination.
The contractual agreements for the selection of qualified candidates for promotion to the classification of Chief Gas Mechanic shall not be modified by this agreement.
Qualified Gas Mechanic Welders 1/C who in the future qualify and are promoted to the classification of Chief Gas Mechanics, and who maintain their qualification as Gas Mechanic Welders 1/C, will, upon written request to the supervisor, be promoted to the classification of Chief Gas Mechanic Welder.
Except for welding to complete a service, a blow off or purging installation, including welding the street fitting to the main, welding a stopper fitting on a small diameter main (being 2 inches or less in diameter) and other incidental welding, the Chief Gas Mechanic Welder will not be expected to perform the duties of

Any Chief Gas Mechanic Welder, who fails at any time to maintain the qualifications required of Gas Mechanic Welder 1/C will be returned to the classification of Chief Gas Mechanic, Pay Group 21.0.
For the purposes of transfer, under Article IX, of the Working Agreement, the Chief Gas Mechanic Welder will be considered as a Chief Gas Mechanic and such transfer shall be made on the basis of seniority only.

Re: Company's Reply to Step B of Grievance Dated August 24, 1961, with Respect to Upgrading an Electrician 1/C to Working Foreman/Forewoman
The following is the result of a discussion held on December 7, 1961, at Eltings Corners between Messrs. Maher, Mahoney and Fenn for Local 320 and Messrs. Rasmussen, Parker, Pultz and VanBramer for the Company.
In view of additional information developed at the meeting regarding the activities and responsibilities of Frederickson during the two days in question, the Company will arrange to pay him the Working Foreman/Forewoman's rate for August 17 and 18.
Both parties reaffirmed the right of the Company to make specific job assignments to individuals or crews regardless of job location without the need for upgrading so long as each individual or crew is working independently of the other, and the assignments are such that there is no need for job coordination or direction of combined crews.
When upgrading is necessary to comply with the terms of the agreement, it will be done with the knowledge and consent of supervision.

Second Step Answer Grievance 83-17
An employee who is called out to work shall be paid a minimum of three hours at the applicable rate. Supervisors may release employees who are called out prior to the expiration of the three-hour guaranteed work period after they have performed the necessary emergency work.
However, employees who are released remain on Company time until the expiration of the three-hour period and may be directed during this three-hour period by subsequent callouts to further necessary emergency work. An employee who receives a subsequent call during the minimum period of three hours’ time of the original call shall be paid at the applicable rate for the time elapsed from the beginning of the first call to the end of the second call or the end of the original minimum period, whichever is greater.
Due to a possible misunderstanding on the grievant's part as to his obligation to remain available for the minimum three-hour period after being released from the initial callout, the Company will, without precedent or prejudice, agree to pay the grievant, Frederick Harjes, for two hours at the prevailing rate.
The two hours represents a payment for a period of time from when the grievant accepted the original callout to the time he declined the subsequent callout, which was within the minimum three-hour period.

Without precedent or prejudice to the position of either party, the Company will modify its overtime procedure to include the 8-4 rotating shift employee in the group of eligible employees to be polled to work an extended day.
Exhibit 94 - (Reserved)
+ Exhibit M95
Item 18A of 1991 Negotiations
(Amended 5/1/2003)
The Company will modify its scheduling and assignment of Commercial Representative - Specials (No. 207.0) as follows:
1.	Previously, Commercial Representative - Specials (No. 207.0) have been scheduled to work Sunday at all locations. The Company anticipates that it can meet its operating needs by scheduling Commercial Representative - Specials (No. 207.0) to work Monday through Saturday. However, these individuals may be scheduled to work on Sundays to respond to specific operating circumstances in each area as determined by management.
+ Exhibit M95 (Cont’d)
269
As this change applies only to scheduling Commercial Representative - Specials (No. 207.0) and Commercial Representatives 2/C (No. 207.3) with more than 18 months as Commercial Representatives 2/C (No. 207.3), the following procedure would apply:
If the Company elects not to work Sundays, then when an employee working a Tuesday through Saturday schedule is to be rotated to a Monday through Friday schedule, such employee’s days off will not be consecutive that week (i.e. the employee will be off Sunday and the following Saturday that week). When an employee working a Monday through Friday schedule is to be rotated to a Tuesday through Saturday schedule, such employee will receive three consecutive days off (i.e. the employee will be off Saturday, Sunday and Monday).
2.	Holidays will not be considered as a basic work day for employees in the classification of Commercial Representative - Special (No. 207.0) or Commercial Representative 2/C (207.3) with more than 18 months’ experience as a Commercial Representative 2/C, and considered a shift worker under paragraph 3 below, and any assigned work on that day will be considered as an overtime assignment. The overtime assignment will be made in accordance with Exhibit 17 of the Labor Agreement (no later than two weeks prior to the holiday to be worked), from the combined overtime list of Commercial Representatives 2/C (No. 207.3) and 1/C (207.2), Commercial Representative - Specials (No. 207.0). District Representatives (No. 207.1) and Commercial Specialists (No. 206.0). If after going through the list in the district where the overtime is required, no one accepts the scheduled overtime, then the Commercial Representative -Special(s) (No. 207.0) and Commercial Representative(s) 2/C (No. 207.3) with more than 18 months’ experience as a Commercial Representative 2/C (No. 207.3), and considered a shift worker under paragraph 3 below, who is/are the lowest on the scheduled overtime list in that district will be selected and will be assigned to work.

The third sentence of Article III C of the Local 320 Labor Agreement will be amended to read as follows:
“Commercial Representatives Special, Commercial Representative 2/C (with more than 18 months’ experience as a Commercial Representative 2/C and in progression to Commercial Representative Special), Service Worker and Production Plant Cleaners shall be considered shift employees, but their hours of work need not conform to the foregoing schedule.”
The Commercial Representative 2/C (207.3) job specification will be amended as set forth in Attachment 1.
4.	The maximum number of Commercial Representative -Specials (No. 207.0) and/or Commercial Representatives 2/C (No. 207.3) (who have completed 18 months as Commercial Representatives 2/C (No 207.3) and are considered shift employees) will not exceed 24. This however, is not a commitment to permanent manning.
5.	Employees assigned to the classification of Commercial Representative - Collector (No. 207.6), on June 30, 1991, will be assigned to work between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.; and, if requested by management, may accept assignments to work between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. All individuals who enter or reenter this classification, on and after July 1, 1991, will be assigned to work between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. All aforementioned assignments in this paragraph 5, will include a 30 minute break for a regularly scheduled meal as stipulated in Article III E of the 320 Agreement.

Without prejudice to the Company’s right to use contract consultants to conduct the gas heating contractor basic combustion school, if the Company elects to conduct such school itself, it does not intend to change its current practice of assigning employees to such school as follows:
1.	One or more bargaining unit employees of the appropriate job classification(s) shall be assigned to conduct the “hands-on” part, if any, of such school, the first three of which shall be Commercial Specialists (Job Spec. No. 206.0), if available. The “hands-on” part of such school shall refer to work of the type normally performed by bargaining unit employees.
2.	Management, or one or more bargaining unit employees of the appropriate job classification(s) [one of which shall be a Commercial Specialist (Job Spec. No. 206.0), if available], or a combination thereof, may be assigned to conduct the lecture (and any demonstration by the lecturer incidental to the lecture) part of such school.
3.	If Commercial Specialists are not available where required above and other bargaining unit employees of the appropriate job classification(s) are assigned, no such employee shall be upgraded. If Management elects to assign bargaining unit employees of the appropriate job classifications(s) in addition to those Commercial Specialists referred to above, no such employee shall be upgraded.

Settlement in Local 320 Grievance 92-234
In settlement of the above mentioned Grievance, the parties agree as follows:
The maximum time in grade of an Equipment Operator (No. 102.2) to Equipment Operator - Dynamite Handler (No. 102.3) will be reduced from 36 months to 24 months. If such employee qualifies as an Equipment Operator - Dynamite Handler, such employee will be placed in Pay Group 16 until such time as such employee obtains any required qualification and/or certification or license (collectively the “license”) which is required to handle and use explosives; at which time such employee shall be placed in Pay Group 17. Such employee shall apply for such a license when he/she is first eligible to do so and shall take the next available examination. Failure to so obtain and maintain such license will result in removal of such employee from the employee’s then classification. Job Specifications No. 102.2 and 102.3 shall be amended to reflect the foregoing.
In consideration of such time in grade reduction, the parties confirm the long-standing principle that any employee in an automatic progression series can perform, without upgrade (except as otherwise provided for in the Labor Agreement), any job of a higher classification in that automatic progression series for which such employee is trained and qualified. Thus, an Equipment Operator in progression to Equipment Operator - Dynamite Handler can perform, without upgrading, any duties of an Equipment Operator -Dynamite Handler for which such employee is trained and qualified.

Any individual so assigned a vehicle (including those previously assigned a vehicle who thereafter became ineligible for such assignment) will be required to pay the fleet operating rate (at a rate of $.20 at May 1, 2008, and $.22 effective May 1, 2010) for all their commutation miles to and from work. Such rate may be adjusted annually each July 1 by the Company to be at the same rate charged to Management employees.

However, those 34 employees assigned vehicles, on June 30, 1998, will not be subject to such costs, so long as they continue to be assigned a vehicle and they do not transfer (including by promotion) from the headquarters to which they are assigned as of July 1, 1998; if they become ineligible for such an assignment and thereafter become eligible, they shall be subject to such costs.
4.	The Company will review the callout response record, as determined under the Callout Response Program, (for the past 12-month review period, July 1 through June 30) of employees who are assigned, or eligible to be assigned, such vehicles on such annual basis on July 1 of each year. Copies of such records will be provided to the President and Business Manager of Local Union 320, I.B.E.W. Employees who have a callout response record below 30% under the Callout Response Program (dated 8/11/93) will become ineligible for the assignment of a vehicle for the next 12-month review period commencing July 1 except as provided for by the following:
(i)	If the employee’s callout response record is below 20%, the employee will become ineligible for assignment of a vehicle for the next 12-month review period. For any subsequent review period, if the employee’s response record is 30% or higher, the employee will be offered a vehicle.
(ii ) If the employee’s callout response record is below 30%, but is 20% or higher, the employee will remain eligible for the assignment of a vehicle for the next 12-month review period. If the employee’s callout response record during this subsequent period is 30% or higher, the employee will retain the vehicle. If the employee’s callout response record during this subsequent period is below 30%, or if the employee has previously been permitted to retain the vehicle under this paragraph ( ii ), the employee will become ineligible for the assignment of a vehicle and will be treated as provided for in paragraph ( i ) above.

5.	The Company maintains the right to call employees who can respond most promptly in cases of a nature which, in the consideration of Management (which includes System Operations and the Control Center outside of an employee’s basic work week), require immediate attention. This includes the right to call employees out of turn on a callout list and to call employees who live closest to the problem regardless of the callout list they are on.

10.	Any employee who is assigned a vehicle will require a minimum of 23 callout attempts over the 12-month review period referenced in Section 4 above before his/her callout response record will be utilized to determine his/her eligibility to retain a vehicle under this Agreement.

Exhibit 111
Exhibit 111
July 1, 1998
The Company will continue the past practice of permitting the incumbent (as of 7/1/98) Union Presidents and Business Managers to take time off without pay (but with continuation of benefits) for Union Business (“UB”) and of paying for Company-related Union Business (“Co/UB”) for each Union President and Business Manager. The Company will continue this custom and practice for such incumbents while either or both remain in any “Local Union Position” (as defined below).
If there is only one incumbent in a Local Union Position and a second employee is elected or appointed to serve in a Local Union Position, the Company will pay for the Company/UB and the Company work time and one-half the premiums for the Health, Dental and Vision Plans for such second employee as well as continuing such second employee in the Group Life Insurance Plan and Retirement Income Plan at the Company’s cost. Such second employee shall be eligible to participate in SIP. Any coverage for such second employee will be subject to any required employee contribution except that no such contribution will be required for Health Benefit Plan coverage.
When such incumbents are no longer in Local Union Positions the Company will continue such past practice for no more than (1) representative of the Local Union, taking both Locals as a whole, and such representative shall be either the President and Business Manager, the Assistant Business Manager or the Business Representative (“Local Union Positions”) provided that any such individual has a membership of 50% or more of Company employees.
If the two incumbents are no longer in a Local Union Position and if a second employee is elected or appointed to serve in a Local Union Position and does not continue to work in his/her normal Company classification, such employee’s salary for Company/UB and UB and all holidays, vacation, personal time and sick time and all benefit plan premiums will be paid by the Union provided that any such individual is an employee of the Company and further provided that the Local Union of such individual has a membership of 50% or more of Company employees. Such second employee will be continued in the Retirement Income Plan at the Company’s cost. Such employee shall be eligible to participate in SIP.
Exhibit 111 (Cont’d)
305
If an employee who is elected or appointed to serve in one of the Local Union Positions continues to work in his/her normal Company classification (works four consecutive hours or more of his/her job in a day) the parties will meet to fully discuss what amendments to these provisions are necessary in that particular case.
There will be no change to the practice of allowing additional employees (not in Local Union Positions) to be released for unpaid UB or paid Co/UB with prior notice to the Company by the appropriate Local Union.
If employees of Central Hudson do not make up more than 50% of the membership of a particular Local Union, employees who choose to remain in their Local Union Positions (in that Local Union) full time will be placed on a leave of absence under Article VIII I. 2., not to exceed two years, but will not receive any benefits during that period of time except that they would continue to participate in the Retirement Income Plan, subject to the provisions thereof. Such employees will have returnable rights to the Company for a maximum of two years unless otherwise mutually agreed to.
The Leave of Absence provisions of Article VIII I. 2. and any other provisions of this Exhibit will not extend to employees elected/appointed to Local Union Positions if the existing Locals become combined with a Labor Union not currently representing Company employees. The Leave of Absence provisions in Article VIII I. 2. and any other provisions of this Exhibit will not extend to employees appointed as International Representatives unless otherwise mutually agreed to.

Mileage payments will be made in accordance with Article V P of the Labor Agreement. In no case shall the total daily reimbursement payments exceed the provisions of Article V G.
For the purpose of job site reporting, projects must start with a minimum of 3 consecutive days and also have an estimated completion date.

Mobilization and de-mobilization will be on Company time.
A pointer, similar to callouts will rotate among the Construction Maintenance Men/Women within the District, based on the number to be assigned which is declared by management. The foregoing excludes the Chief Construction Maintenance Man/Woman (141.8).
Notification will be at least 5 working days and “swaps” will be allowed within 48 hours. Swaps between employees are confined to employees assigned to the same headquarters unless approved by management. An employee already assigned to a roving job cannot swap out of such job assignment without permission of management.
The Company retains the right to declare, from the roving list, the number of employees required to “rove” and from which district or districts they will be chosen.
In addition, the duties of these two job classifications will be expanded as set forth in the revised Exhibit 19 and the revised job specifications attached thereto.

Those assigned personnel will report at the beginning of the work day to and be dismissed at the end of the work day from that temporary work site or headquarters.
1.	The total number of Electricians and Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T - Electricians) in this “roving” group will be the bottom 50% by seniority of each classification, not to be less than 2 Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) and 7 Electricians 1/C. Any employees who held the classification of Electrician 1/C or Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T - Electrician) as of 7/1/98 are grandfathered and exempt from this roving agreement except where otherwise provided for in the agreement.

CALLOUT RESPONSE PROGRAM For T&D Employees
I.	Purpose
Timely and effective callout response by all Central Hudson employees to emergency and other work situations is an essential ingredient in providing safe and reliable gas and electric service to our customers. The purpose of this Program is to improve the present level of callout response and to maintain adequate callout response to provide safe and reliable service to customers.
II.	Scope
This Program is designed to standardize the method of calculating callout response records for each T&D employee as well as the procedure for addressing employees who fail to maintain an acceptable callout response record as defined by this Program.
E X H
All T&D employees are subject to the provisions of this program and will be required to accept a minimum of 20% of the calls chargeable to him/her during the review period in order to be considered to have an acceptable callout response record.
326
+ Exhibit M124 (Cont’d)
III.	Definitions
A. The number of calls accepted as a percentage of calls made will be used to determine callout response. The callout data to be maintained and calls charged to an employee’s record will be as follows:
1.	Total calls made.
2.	Total calls accepted.
3.	Total calls refused.
4.	Total calls unavailable or no response.
a.	No answer (minimum of 10 rings).
b.	Line busy.
c.	Not home (including responses by answering machines).
Note: 1. An employee will be charged with only one call categorized as not available or no answer and not home for repeated calls within any four-hour time period, subject to a maximum of two chargeable calls in any calendar day.
2.	A. All “platform calls” (i.e. callouts made to employees at the headquarters prior to the start of the workday) shall be included in calculating an employee’s callout response record. A reasonable attempt will be made to distribute such “platform calls” equitably to available employees. Employees accepting “platform calls” will receive a skip unless they were called first in rotation.
B.	Any callout made to an employee after the end of the workday while the employee is still at the work headquarters shall be included in calculating an employee’s callout response record.
3.	Employees may leave a forwarding telephone number with the Company at any time to enable the Company to contact them instead of trying to call them at home. Also, an employee may give the Company a second telephone number where the employee may be reached.
+Exhibit M124 (Cont’d)
327
4.	An employee who is mistakenly passed over in the callout process shall be credited with an acceptable call and maintain his/her position on the callout list. If an employee is called out of turn and accepts, he/she will receive a skip.
5.	If an employee returns a call within fifteen minutes of being called by Central Hudson and the need for such an employee still exists and the employee accepts, the employee will receive credit for the call. If the need no longer exists, the employee will still be charged for the original call.
B. Employees will be taken off the call list on the day(s) of an absence until the start of the next calendar day (midnight) when full days are charged to the following, unless the employee notifies the Company they wish to remain on the callout list.
1.	Floating Holiday
2.	Personal Day
3.	Leave of Absence
4.	Union Business/Company-Union Business
5.	Jury Duty
6.	Death in the Family
7.	Military Leave
8.	Illness or Injury (Employees who report to work and subsequently leave due to illness or injury will also be removed from the call list until the start of the next calendar day. Employees who are called the next calendar day after being absent due to illness/injury and who indicate they are still ill/injured will not be charged for such call).
E
X
H
328
+ Exhibit M124 (Cont’d)
9.	Vacation - When vacation is charged for a full week (40 hours within one payroll week), the employee will be removed from the call list for the entire payroll week plus the last portion of their last work day and the remainder of that calendar week and the next Sunday (for example, a day worker will be removed from the call list from 4:30 PM Friday to 11:59 PM the following Sunday). In addition, when an employee is charged for a full payroll week of vacation, any other vacation days or scheduled days off which are contiguous with the payroll week vacation period shall also be included in the time when an employee is removed from the callout list. For example, when an employee takes vacation on Friday and the following Monday through Friday, and the next Monday the employee will be removed from the callout list from the end of their last workday (e.g. 4:30 PM on the first Thursday through 11:59 PM the second Monday). Employees who take a full week of vacation which includes a holiday or holidays will be taken off the call list for the entire payroll week plus the last portion of their last work day and the remainder of that calendar week (e.g. 4:30 PM Friday to 11:59 PM the second Sunday).
In addition, employees will be taken off the callout list automatically for any weekend which is sandwiched by a vacation day(s) on both sides of such weekend from 4:30 PM of their last day worked until 12:01 AM of their next regularly scheduled workday.
C.	Employees will be taken off the call list when their work requires them to be away from home overnight.
D.	Employees will be taken off their regular call list when on an alternate duty assignment, provided such restriction is documented with medical documentation. Such employee may be eligible for overtime for the alternate duty assignment.
E.	A refused call will not be charged to an employee’s record if the employee is called during a rest period.
+ Exhibit M124 (Cont’d)
329
F.	A call will not be charged to an employee’s record if direct contact is not made with the employee if the employee is called a) during the first hour immediately following the completion of work or b) during the first hour immediately prior to the commencement of a scheduled work period. This one-hour grace period is designed to recognize the travel time required for employees to reach home from work or work from home.
G.	A call will not be charged to an employee’s record if the employee is called while working. The Company will make every effort not to call an employee who is already working.
H.	With the approval of the employee’s supervisor, a callout will not be charged to an employee’s record if the employee cannot respond (CNR) within the Company’s indicated time.
IV.	When physical limitations or hardship cases might preclude an employee from responding to callouts, the Company will review each case in advance and make reasonable allowances. However, in no case will permanent exceptions be made. The President and Business Manager of Local 320 will be advised of exceptions made under this paragraph.
V.	Administration
A.	An acceptable callout response record shall be an acceptance rate of a minimum of 20% of the total calls made to the employee during the review period. A cap of 30 chargeable calls shall be used so that an employee shall have met the 20% minimum acceptance rate when he/she has accepted 6 calls within the first 30 chargeable calls; if an employee has met the 20% acceptance rate within the first 30 chargeable calls or has accepted a minimum of nine (9) calls, he/she shall not be subject to the 20% minimum acceptance rate during the remainder of the applicable review period. If the employee has (i) not had 30 chargeable calls within the applicable review period, or (ii) not accepted six (6) calls within the first 30 chargeable calls, or (iii) not accepted a minimum of nine (9) calls, the employee still has the obligation to reach a minimum acceptance rate of 20% during the review period.
E X H
330
+ Exhibit M124 (Cont’d)
B.	An employee shall have had at least nine chargeable calls during a review period in order to be covered under this Callout Response Program for the review period.
C.	The employee’s callout response record shall be reviewed every six months (for data from January 1 thru June 30 and July 1 thru December 31, each such (6) sixmonth period being a “review period”).
All reviews of unacceptable callout response will be conducted with the employee within 45 days after the June 30 or December 31 dates.
D.	The Company will review an employee’s callout response record with the employee when such response is acceptable but between 20% - 25%. The purpose of this review is to alert an employee who was close to the 20% minimum response rate.
E.	The Company agrees to maintain the Callout Review Program established in grievance settlement 2002-5, 2002-6, 2002-7 and 2002-8.
F.	The modifications to the Callout Response Program contained herein shall not amend or otherwise affect the applicable Sections of “+Exhibit M110 (amended 7/1/98) Assignment of Vehicles” with regard to callout response requirements for the assignment of vehicles to Commercial Representatives.
VI.	Discipline

Employees who have an unacceptable callout response record (i.e. less than a 20% response record) at the end of any review period may be verbally reprimanded by the supervisor and notified that if the employee’s callout response record is not brought up to an acceptable level in the next review period, further disciplinary action may be taken. A record of this verbal reprimand will be made by the supervisor and forwarded to the employee’s personnel file and a copy given to the employee.
+ Exhibit M124 (Cont’d)
331
B.	At the end of the next review period the supervisor will meet with the employee. If the employee’s callout response record is acceptable, the supervisor will inform the employee of such and document such discussion. A record of this discussion will be made by the supervisor and forwarded to the employee’s personnel file and a copy given to the employee.
If the level of response by the employee continues to be unacceptable (provided there has been a sufficient amount of overtime activity to evaluate the employee - minimum of nine calls to the employee’s telephone number including “platform calls”), the employee may be given a written reprimand stating that unless the employee’s performance improves to an acceptable level, further disciplinary action may be taken (but not as part of the General Performance Review process). The letter will be forwarded to the employee’s personnel file and a copy given to the employee.
C.	An employee who has had discipline issued up to and including the written reprimand under the terms of this Program and subsequently has three consecutive review periods with an acceptable callout response record shall be treated as if they had a continuous acceptable callout record (i.e. they shall start the disciplinary process at a verbal reprimand for any subsequent period of inadequate callout response).
D.	Any review period with less than nine chargeable callouts will be considered as an acceptable report period for purposes of the Program.
E.	The process of review, employee counseling and progressive disciplinary action may be utilized to ensure satisfactory callout response is achieved and maintained by the employee.
F.	An employee laterally transferring to another headquarters within the same classification carries his/her callout response record to the new location. An employee promoted within an automatic progression job carries his/her callout response record through such series.

VII.	Documentation
A record of the daily callout response showing the previous days’ callout activity (or weekend activity) for that headquarters shall be posted on the official bulletin board on a daily basis of said headquarters.
A weekly callout response summary shall be posted on the official bulletin board on a weekly basis. The summary will show the callout response record for each employee for the previous week (number of calls made and number of calls accepted). In addition, the summary will include the cumulative review period to-date information (number of calls made, number of calls accepted and associated percentage it represents). Any inaccurate information on the summary which is verified by the Company shall cause the Company to adjust the employee’s official record to accurately reflect the correct information. Such possible inaccurate information shall be brought to the Company’s attention as soon as reasonably possible by the employee.
VIII.	Revisions
The Company and Union will meet to review this Program from time to time. Such meetings will be held at the request of either party and be held within a reasonable period of time of such request. Any revisions to this agreement shall be mutually agreed to.
IX.	The mutually agreed-to Callout Response Program for T&D employees shall become permanent and the parties will continue to meet to discuss modifications to such Program.
X.	This Program is not intended to establish a definition of emergency needs but is to improve the overall system callout response by establishing a minimum callout response rate which must be met by each employee. If the overall system callout response does not meet the Company’s operating needs, the parties agree that such issue will be subject to discussion in the meetings referred to in paragraph VIII above.

Exhibit D
The Company and Union agree as follows:
CSR Vacation
In response to the Union’s concerns regarding the number of Customer Service Representatives allowed on vacation at any one time, the Company reaffirms that each employee is entitled to two weeks’ vacation in the normal vacation period in accordance with Article VIII of the Working Agreement. The Company recognizes that they have added scheduling flexibility because of the availability of CSRs-PT and therefore the parties have agreed as follows:
1.	For the purpose of scheduling vacations, beginning in 2004,
for Customer Service Representatives of all classifications (Job Specification Numbers 350.0, 350.1,350.2, 350.3, 350.5, 350.6, 350.7, 350.8 and 350.9) (“CSRs”) assigned to the Call Center, the following will be adhered to:

b.	For the day before Thanksgiving Day and for the weeks of Christmas and New Year’s, no less than 10 employees will be permitted to schedule vacation.
c.	The minimum number of CSRs on vacation provisions established in paragraphs 1a and 1b above are limited to the establishment of the annual vacation schedule posted as of March 22nd of any year. The granting of vacations after the posting of the March 22nd vacation schedule shall be governed by Article VIII of the Labor Agreement including the addition of any replacements to the March 22nd schedule as a result of the cancellation of a scheduled vacation by an individual after the March 22nd posting. (See *Exhibit M120)
E X H
334* Exhibit M125 (Cont’d) d. The Company has invested in new and technically advanced customer service systems that may reduce the number of Customer Service Representative Positions in all classifications in the future. Any such reductions will be made solely through attrition. In the event the Company needs flexibility under provisions 1a and 1b above, the Company and Union shall meet to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution regarding paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Exhibit.
2.	Paragraph 5 of ^Exhibit M54 and paragraph 10 of *Exhibit M86 shall be amended to increase the maximum number of CSR-PT to 17. The Company may reduce the number of CSRs by 1 without reducing the CSR-EH numbers (i.e. 29 CSR day workers will produce 15 CSR-EH). (See Exhibits *M54 and *M86)
3.	Paragraph 1 and 2 of this Agreement are made for the term of the Labor Agreement . If the Company requires a change in this Agreement, it will meet with the Union. No changes to paragraph 1a or 1b shall be based on any contracted out customer service work.

2.	Effective 5/1/08 for employees hired on or after May 1,2008 the pay grade for the classification of CSR 1/C - Bi-Lingual will be established at pay grade 17 (top 2 steps only). The pay grade for the classification of CSR - EH - Bi-Lingual will be established at pay grade 17.1 (top 2 steps only). Effective May 1,2009 these pay groups will be effective for individuals entering such classifications on or after May 1, 2009 and who were employed on or before April 30, 2008.
3.	The Company will post a “Notice” indicating its need for bilingual skills in the Call Center, identifying the languages in addition to English in which the skills are needed and specifying the number of positions to be filled.
4.	Applicants will be required to be fluent in the language specified in the Notice and such competency shall be demonstrated through ajointly administered examination.
5.	Any CSR who may request an upgrade due to intermittent use of a second language shall notify Supervision in advance of the language they are capable of speaking. In the event that any Customer Service Representative reasonably determines during a telephone conversation to use bi-lingual skills in any language other than English, such CSR shall be compensated at an upgraded rate for a minimum of one hour. In the event there are numerous phone calls during the course of a workday, each call will receive an upgrade; provided however, the maximum number of upgrades for the use of bi-lingual skills in any one day is two.

Except as specifically amended by this Service Worker Agreement, all existing five-year commitments previously established under the Labor Agreement for Linemen/Linewomen 1/C, Service Worker A’s, and Service Worker B’s shall remain in effect until such commitments have been fulfilled by the affected employees.
15.	The parties agree that when posting for a Lineman/Linewoman 3/C, such individual shall progress to the position of Lineman/Linewoman 2/C, and then Lineman/Linewoman 1/C. If the current Service Worker shift complement has a vacancy and cannot be filled through post & bid, the junior Lineman/Linewoman 1/C with a 60-month Service Worker commitment will be assigned the Service Worker A vacancy as their permanent headquarters.

2008 Central Hudson Benefits Program
What’s New in 2008?
Here’s what’s changing starting August 1:
A New Medical Plan
A new medical plan is being offered: the Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plan. The new PPO plan offers the employee two levels of benefits—a higher level when a PPO network doctor or hospital is used and a lower level when out-of-network doctors and hospitals are used. The PPO plan does not require referrals from a primary doctor.
Also, the PPO will use the MVP regional network and a contracted nationwide network of doctors and hospitals. Therefore, employees will most likely not have to change doctors to benefit from in-network savings.
Also, a restructured Point of Service Plan (POS), which is currently offered to the management organization, will be offered.

Memorandum of Agreement (Exhibit F Cont’d)
The CHampion Point-of-Service (POS) Plan and the Indemnity Plan will continue, with no change in benefits.
Contributions for Health Care Coverage
Currently, contributions for medical, dental and vision care benefits combined, equal 3% of base salary. Beginning August 1, 2008:
■	The employee will make separate elections for medical, dental and vision coverage. This provides added flexibility, in that the employee elects only the benefit coverage needed at the coverage level (Individual, Individual Plus One, or Family) required. The coverage level selected is applied to all benefit plans elected.
■	There will be separate contributions for medical, dental and vision coverage.
■	Contributions for medical, dental and vision coverage will equal 21% (22% effective 1/1/09, 24.5% effective 1/1/10 and 25% effective 1/1/11) of the Company’s cost to provide these plans. The PPO will be the standard plan and employees will pay more to enroll in the CHampion POS Plan, the Indemnity Plan or the new POS Plan.
■	The Company will limit the amount of annual increase to the PPO plan contributions until January 1, 2011, under the new cost-sharing schedule.
Prescription Drug Changes
The current structure of co-pays ($10 generic, $20 brand) will remain under the CHampion POS and Indemnity Plans. The PPO plan (and the restructured POS plan) will have a 75/25 coinsurance structure. In this structure, the employee will pay 25% of the cost of the prescription with the Company paying 75%. There is a minimum payment amount of $10 at retail and a maximum payment at retail of $125.
The CHampion POS and Indemnity Plans will continue with the current purchase of a three-month supply of mail order prescription drugs for the cost of a two-month supply, with the appropriate co-pay. Under the PPO Plan, the minimum payment for mail order is $30 and the maximum amount will be $375, paying for the full 90-day supply. The mandatory mail order requirement for all maintenance drugs is still in effect.
Memorandum of Agreement (Exhibit F Cont’d)455
Dental Plan Benefits
The current dental plan (old plan) is unchanged.
A new dental plan is available, with the lifetime deductible eliminated and replaced with an annual $50 per person deductible for all covered family members. The deductible will not apply to preventive care services.
The “step-up” in benefits (from 80% to 100%) available under the old plan, is eliminated in the new dental plan. Instead, dental benefits will be payable according to the schedule on page 13.
This new dental plan is the standard plan.
Vision Care Plan Benefits
The current vision plan (old plan) is unchanged.
A new vision plan is available, with the an increased co-pay from $20 to $25 for a doctor’s office visit. In addition, the plan requires a $25 co-pay for materials purchased, such as contacts and lenses. Also, the plan will provide benefits for lens replacement every 24 months (currently every 12 months) to coincide with the frame replacement benefit.
This new vision plan is the standard plan.
Health Care Coverage in Retirement
An employee will retire with the same medical plan options available at the time of retirement.
Effective August 1, 2008 the PPO Plan will be offered to current retirees.
The retiree will pay 21% (increasing to 22% on 1/1/09, 24.5% on 1/1/10 and 25% on 1/11/11) of the premium for PPO medical coverage at the elected coverage level, with a full cost differential applied for any medical plan elected, other than the standard PPO.
Vision Plan coverage will terminate at retirement. Dental coverage will continue with current eligibility.

Participating in the Program
Who Is Eligible
All employees are eligible to participate in the benefit programs noted in this document including health care (medical, dental, vision).
Eligible dependents can also be covered under the health care plans. Eligible dependents include:
■	Spouse of employee
■	Unmarried dependent children up to age 19, or up to age 23 if they are full-time students and dependent on the employee for more than one half of their support
■	Physically or mentally disabled child of any age provided he or she is totally dependent on the employee for support
Eligible children include the employee’s biological children, adopted or foster children, children placed with the employee for adoption or foster care, and stepchildren.
Coverage Levels
Beginning August 1, 2008, employees will choose one of the following coverage levels for their medical, dental and vision care coverage:
■	Individual
■	Individual Plus One
■	Family
When Coverage Begins
There will be a special open enrollment period in the June-July timeframe. The choices made during the enrollment period will take effect on August 1, 2008, and will remain in effect until December 31, 2008.
If the employee gains a dependent during the year and they wish to add that dependent to coverage—for example, because of marriage, birth or adoption—they must do so within 60 days of the life event. Otherwise, the employee can only enroll these dependents during open enrollment.
Memorandum of Agreement (Exhibit F Cont’d)
457
Cost of Coverage
The employee and Central Hudson share the cost of the health care coverage, with the Company paying the majority of the cost. The amount the employee pays will be based on the plans and the coverage level selected. Please refer to page 15 for 2008 contribution rates.
Employees pay their share of health care costs on a “pre-tax” basis— meaning that the cost of the coverage is deducted from their pay before federal, state or local, Social Security and Medicare taxes are withheld. If so elected, contributions to the Health Care and Dependent Care Reimbursement Flexible Spending Accounts are also deducted from the employee’s paycheck on a pre-tax basis.
Health Care Contributions for 2008
Currently the employees pay one contribution for medical, dental and vision care benefits combined, equal to a percentage of your base salary. Beginning August 1, 2008:
■	The employee will make separate elections for medical, dental and vision coverage. This provides the employee with added flexibility: They elect only the benefit coverage they need at the coverage levels (Individual, Individual Plus One, or Family) they require. The coverage level selected is applied to all benefit plans elected.
■	The employee will make separate contributions for medical, dental and vision coverage.
■	The contribution will no longer be tied to base salary. The contribution for medical, dental and vision will equal 21% (22% effective 1/1/09, 24.5% effective 1/1/10 and 25% effective 1/1/11) of the Company’s cost to provide this coverage. The PPO will be the standard plan and the employee will pay more to enroll in the Indemnity, CHampion POS or restructured POS currently offered to the management organization.
■	The Company will limit the amount of annual increase to employees electing PPO plan contributions over the next two and one-half years under the new cost-sharing schedule.

Memorandum of Agreement (Exhibit F Cont’d)
Limit on PPO Contributions for Transition Period Until January 1,2011 If an employee elects the PPO plan and their health care contributions are expected to increase by more than $10 weekly, beginning on August 1, 2008, the Company will limit the increase in the employee’s contributions to $10 per week, as measured from the 5/1/08 annualized contribution being made under the former 3% of base salary contribution and the new 21% cost schedule. Effective January 1, 2009 such maximum increase will be $20 per week as measured from the 5/1/09 annualized contribution that would have been made under the former 3% of base salary contribution and the new 22% cost schedule set. Effective January 1, 2010 such maximum increase will be $30 per week as measured from the 5/1/10 annualized contribution that would have been made under the former 3% of base salary contribution and the new 24.5% cost schedule. All employees shall be fully transitioned to the new contribution schedule by January 1, 2011. Please note that the transition limit does not apply if the employee elects coverage under the CHampion POS, Indemnity or restructured POS.
Medical Benefits
The medical benefits are designed to provide the employee and their family with protection against the high cost of health care expenses. For 2008, the employee will have a choice of four medical options, plus the option to waive coverage.
Medical Plan Options
■	Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Plan
■	New Point-of-Service (POS) Plan
■	Indemnity Plan
■	CHampion POS Plan
■	No Coverage____________________________
In general, all medical plan options cover the same services. The key differences between the plans are how much each pays toward medical bills, how much the employee will pay out of pocket during the year, and how much choice they have over when, where, and from whom they receive medical treatment.
Following are brief descriptions of the two new medical plan options.
Memorandum of Agreement (Exhibit F Cont’d)
How the PPO Plan Works
459
In general, the new Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plan will cover the same services as the current Indemnity and CHampion Point-of-Service (POS) and the new Point-of-Service (POS) plans. What may be different for the employee is how much they pay out of pocket for services and how they obtain medical care.
The PPO includes a network of doctors and health care facilities that participate in the MVP regional and contracted nationwide network. Each time the participant (employee or their covered family member) needs care, they have a choice: use a provider participating in the PPO networks (in-network), or use a doctor or hospital not participating in the networks (out-of-network).
■	When an in-network provider is chosen, the participant will receive a higher level of benefits and pay less out of pocket. In addition, the plan pays benefits for certain preventive services not available outside the network. Also, in most cases, there are no claim forms to file. Unlike the Point-of-Service Plans, the participants do not need to obtain care or a referral from a primary care physician to receive in-network benefits.
■	The participant will receive higher benefits in-network because these doctors have contracted with MVP in exchange for the opportunity to be part of the network. This means that network providers cannot charge more than the negotiated discounted rate for care. MVP continually monitors the quality of care patients receive and requires that in-network doctors meet certain performance standards.
■	If an out-of-network provider is chosen, the plan still pays benefits, but the employee will pay more and need to file a claim form for reimbursement.
For a list of MVP network providers, visit www.mvpselectcare.com. Select Doctor Search; Physicians (or Hospitals, etc); select ASO PPO; the State and County, Zip Code and Mile Radius. A list of providers in the area will be accessible for printing. If the employee prefers, they may call MVP at 1-800-229-5851 for assistance with finding a network provider.

460 Memorandum of Agreement (Exhibit F Cont’d)
The Annual Deductible. A deductible will apply for both innetwork and out-of-network services. If the participant uses innetwork providers, each covered person must satisfy a $400 deductible each calendar year (or $1,200 for a family of three or more) before the plan pays for certain expenses. If the participant uses out-of-network providers, each covered person must meet a $1,000 deductible each calendar year (or $3,000 as a family of three or more) before the plan starts paying benefits.
Coinsurance and copays. The PPO pays benefits for most eligible expenses after the annual deductible is satisfied. The amount of benefits received depends on the provider used.
■	If in-network providers are used, the participant will make the appropriate co-pay and be balance billed to meet the annual deductible. Once the annual deductible is satisfied; the participant will make only a co-pay. In some cases, the plan pays 80% coinsurance and the participant will pay 20% coinsurance instead of a co-pay. Charges for care received from network providers are based on negotiated rates.
■	If out-of-network providers are used, once the annual deductible is satisfied, the plan pays 50% coinsurance for most eligible expenses, and the participant pays the other 50%. Charges for care received from out-of-network providers are based on Reasonable and Customary (R&C) amounts.
Pay Attention to Reasonable and Customary Charges-They Can Cost Extra Money
For services provided by or on behalf of an MVP network physician, the reasonable charge is an amount that does not exceed Negotiated Rates. (Negotiated Rates is the amount a network provider has agreed to accept from MVP as payment in full for covered services.)
For services provided by out-of-network providers, the maximum amount considered under the PPO for payment is Reasonable and Customary charges. MVP develops Reasonable and Customary charges taking into account pertinent factors, including:
■	The complexity of the service
■	The range of services provided
■	The prevailing charge level in the geographic area where the provider is located and other geographic areas having similar medical cost experience.
To avoid paying charges that exceed R&C, be sure to receive care from in-network providers whenever possible.
Memorandum of Agreement (Exhibit F Cont’d)
461
Out-of-pocket maximums. To help protect the employee from the high cost of medical expenses, the PPO limits the total amount paid in any calendar year. Once the amount paid reaches the out-of-pocket maximum, the plan pays 100% of most remaining eligible expenses incurred for the rest of the year. If in-network providers are used, the out-of-pocket maximum is $3,000 per person (maximum of $5,000 per family). If out-of-network providers are used, the out-of-pocket maximum is $6,000 per person (maximum of $10,000 per family).
How the New Point-of-Service Plan Works
The new Point-of-Service (POS) Plan benefits depend on where the participant decides to receive care. Here’s how it works.
■	First the participant must choose a primary care physician from a list of doctors in the MVP regional network. The primary care physician is the central resource for managing all the employee’s medical care— treating the employee for illness or injury, referring the employee to specialists, scheduling hospital stays, and so on.
■	Any time the employee or a family member needs medical care, there is a choice: Use a provider participating in the POS network (in-network), or use a doctor or hospital not participating in the network (out-of-network). The level of benefits is determined at the “point of service”—where the medical care is provided.
■	When in-network providers are used, and the primary care physician authorizes the service or supplies, a higher level of benefits will be received with less out of pocket payment required. In addition, the plan pays benefits for certain preventive services not available outside the network. Also, in most cases, there are no claim forms to file.
■	Higher benefits are received in-network because these doctors have contracted with MVP in exchange for the opportunity to be part of the network. MVP continually monitors the quality of care patients receive and requires that in-network doctors meet certain performance standards.

O
462
Memorandum of Agreement (Exhibit F Cont’d)
If the participant uses an out-of-network provider, or the primary care physician doesn’t first authorize the care, the plan still pays benefits, but at more cost to the employee.
For a list of MVP network providers, visit www.mvpselectcare.com. Select Doctor Search; Physicians (or Hospitals, etc); select ASO POS; State and then insert the city and zip code of interest. A list of providers in the area will be accessible for printing. If the employee prefers, they may call MVP at 1-800-229-5851 for assistance with finding a network provider.
The Annual Deductible. A deductible will apply for both innetwork and out-of-network services. If in-network providers are used and the primary care physician coordinates the care, each covered person must satisfy a $250 deductible each calendar year (or $750 as a family of three or more) before the plan pays for certain expenses. If out-of-network providers are used, each covered person must meet a $500 deductible each calendar year (or $1,500 as a family of three or more) before the plan starts paying benefits.
Coinsurance and Co-pays. The POS plan pays benefits for most eligible expenses after the annual deductible is satisfied. The amount of benefits received depends on whether innetwork or out-of-network providers are used.
■	When the primary care physician coordinates the care, the participant will be required to make a co-pay -- for example, there is a $20 co-pay for visits to the primary care physician and a $100 co-pay for emergency room care -- the participant will make the appropriate co-pay and be balance billed to meet the annual deductible. Once the annual deductible is satisfied; the participant will make only a co-pay. The plan pays 100% of the balance, for most eligible expenses.
■	If out-of-network providers are used, the plan pays 80% coinsurance against the MVP negotiated in-network rate for most eligible expenses, and the employee will pay the other 20%. Again, for some services, the employee may be required to make a co-payment instead of paying coinsurance. The employee will be responsible for any and all charges above the negotiated rate. An annual deductible applies to most out-of-network services.
Memorandum of Agreement (Exhibit F Cont’d)463
Out-of-pocket maximums. To help protect the employee from the high cost of medical expenses, the POS plan limits the total amount the employee must pay in any calendar year. Once the amount paid reaches the out-of-pocket maximum, the plan pays 100% of most remaining eligible expenses incurred for the rest of the year. The out-of-pocket maximum is $3,000 per person (maximum of $5,000 per family) combined in-network and out-of-network out-of-pocket expenses.
How The Prescription Drug Benefits Work
When the employee enrolls for medical coverage, they will automatically receive retail and mail order prescription drug benefits. Here are some key features of this benefit.
Retail drugs. As a PPO or POS plan participant, the employee will receive an identification card from MVP Select Care. Whenever their doctor prescribes medication, simply show the ID card at the pharmacy. The employee will pay 25% of the cost of retail prescriptions for up to a 30-day supply of medication, subject to a minimum and maximum amount. If the drug cost is less than $10, the participant will pay the full cost of the drug. If the cost is $10 or more, the participant will pay 25% of the cost or $10, which ever is more, with the maximum amount per prescription at $125.
Mail order drugs. The Medco mail order drug program provides a convenient, inexpensive way to buy maintenance drugs—that is, drugs taken on an ongoing basis for chronic conditions such as hypertension or diabetes. The employee must use the MVP contracted mail order provider (Medco) for drugs taken for 90 days or more. The employee will pay 25% of the cost of their mail order drugs for a 90-day supply of medication, subject to a minimum and maximum amount. If the 90-day supply drug cost is less than $30, the participant will pay the full cost of the drug. If the cost is $30 or more, the participant will pay 25% of the cost or $30, which ever is more, with the maximum amount per prescription at $375.
For new prescriptions, the employee will be required to complete and return a Medco By Mail Order Form (available on the Company Intranet or from Human Resources). The employee can obtain refills by visiting www.medco.com online or by phone at 1-800-4REFILL (1-800-473-3455).
For information about how to use the mail order drug program, please contact Medco’s Member Services at 1-800-716-3752.

Dental Options
■	Old Dental Plan
■	New Dental Plan
■	No Coverage
The New Dental Plan
(Standard Plan)
The New Dental Plan covers a wide range of dental services and supplies, including preventive and diagnostic care and major services. The plan also covers orthodontic care for the employee and their covered dependents up to age 19.
The employee can choose dental coverage under one of the coverage levels: Individual, Individual Plus One or Family. Or they can waive coverage. The coverage level selected must be the same as other elected benefit plans.
Dental Plan Benefits
With this plan, the participant can use any dentist they wish. However, the plan includes the Delta Dental Premier Network. If the participant uses a dentist in the Premier Network, they can lower their out-of-pocket costs for dental care by taking advantage of their lower, negotiated rates. A listing of these participating dentists may be found at www.midatlanticdeltadental.com or the employee may contact Delta Dental at 1-800-471-7091.
Regardless of the dentist used, once the employee or their covered family members satisfy an annual $50 deductible, the plan pays a percentage of the covered dental care for the year. The deductible does not apply to preventive care services, such as routine cleanings and x-rays.
Please note that starting in 2008 the deductible is an annual deductible, which means that the deductible must be met each year before the plan pays benefits. The previous lifetime deductible is being eliminated and does not apply toward the annual deductible.

Memorandum of Agreement (Exhibit F Cont’d)
If the non-emergency eligible expenses are expected to exceed $300, the dentist must submit a “Treatment Plan” to Delta Dental for charges to be covered. A Treatment Plan is a report from the dentist that lists the recommended services, shows the charge for the services, and is accompanied by x-rays.
The Dental Plan pays up to $1,600 in dental benefits per person each calendar year.
The New Dental Plan Benefits At-a-Glance	
Plan Feature	Plan Benefits*
Annual Deductible	$50 per person
Diagnostic and Preventive Services	Plan pays 100% of charges (no deductible)
Basic Restorative Services	Plan pays 80% of charges after deductible
Major Services	Plan pays 80% of charges after deductible
Orthodontia (for employee and covered dependents up to age 19)	Plan pays 50% of charges after a $50 orthodontic deductible, maximum of $3,000 per lifetime

Health Care in Retirement
There are also several changes to the retiree health care program that will impact all employees retiring on or after August 1, 2008:
■	First, the employee will elect one of the medical plans i.e.: current Indemnity Plan, CHampion POS, new POS or PPO plan.
■	Second, the contribution schedule is changing to a percentage of the premium, at age 60, rather than a percentage of pension. Age 60 contribution will change to 21% of premium effective May 1, 2008, 22% of cost effective January 1, 2009, 24.5% on January 1, 2010 and 25% on January 1, 2011. See the schedule on page 16 (464).
■	Third, a “cap” on the amount Central Hudson will pay toward the cost of coverage for retirees and dependents age 65 and older is being added. Once the yearly average medical cost for post-65 coverage reaches the cap of $9,333 per person per year, the increase in the contribution will go from 25% to 100% of the dollar increase. At the current pace of medical cost inflation, it is anticipated that the cap will not be reached for another 8 to 10 years.
■	Fourth, vision care coverage for anyone retiring on or after May 1, 2008 is being eliminated.

b.	Line personnel who were Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV), Lineman/Linewoman 1/C, or Service Workers on May 1, 2003 and still had the one-year obligation at that time are considered to have fulfilled it as of May 1,2006 (Sunset Clause).
c.	Any employee who held the classification of Lineman/Linewoman 1/C, Lineman/Linewoman 2/C, Lineman/Linewoman 3/C, Service Worker B, Service Worker A or Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) as of 2/1/90 was grandfathered and exempt from the mandatory reassignment.
2.	The Company maintains the right to fill the Midnight to 8:00 AM Service Worker shift.

If the Company makes the determination to fill the Midnight to 8:00 AM Service Worker shift, the Company shall meet with the President and Business Manager of Local 320 in an attempt to identify other alternatives that will meet the operating needs of the Company. If the Midnight to 8:00 AM shift is implemented, all affected Local 320 employees will be notified a minimum of 30 days prior to the start of the schedule. If a Midnight to 8:00 AM Service Worker shift is reestablished, the 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM Service Worker shift will revert back to 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM.
Memorandum ofAgreement (Exhibit G- Ex 126 Cont’d) 475
3.	All existing Service WorkerA’s (109.1), as of02/01/01, will continue to be exempted from being scheduled to work the Midnight to 8:00 AM shift.

Such service as a temporary Lineman/Linewoman 1/C PC shall count as service for purposes of fulfilling an individual’s 60-month Service Worker A commitment. Until this 60-month commitment is fulfilled, these individuals shall remain available for reassignment to the Service Worker A position as provided for under this agreement. Those assigned will be from a group of 8 individuals. Such group shall be comprised of 1) those Service Workers already assigned

8.	The Union and Company will discuss and rectify, if possible, the assignment of any individual that would result in a more favorable headquarters assignment being made to an individual with less seniority (including new hires) over a more senior individual.
9.	Any employee reassigned on a mandatory basis shall be eligible for mileage reimbursement (with the rate consistent with Article V P of the T & D Labor Agreement.) Such reimbursement shall not exceed 24 months. The provisions of Article V G shall not apply.
10.	Future Linemen/Linewomen 1/C subject to being assigned to Service Worker A will be assigned on a voluntary basis and if enough individuals do not accept the assignment, the employees with the lowest seniority will be assigned.

Employees who work two hours beyond their scheduled quitting time shall be entitled to a stipend of $24. Such stipend shall be in lieu of any reimbursement for any meals and/or the time to obtain and eat such meals.
Employees who work more than two hours (ie. a minimum of two hours and fifteen minutes) beyond their scheduled quitting time shall be entitled to a stipend of $24 and one hour of straight time in lieu of any reimbursement for any such meals and/or the time to obtain and eat such meals. This stipend and one hour of straight time in lieu of any reimbursement also applies to the situation where an employee extends beyond the two hours to complete the job and their workday without a meal break. Where the employee interrupts the work operation to take their meal and return to work to complete the assignment they shall receive the stipend and obtain and eat their meal on the job at the applicable rate.
For scheduled overtime assignments only (where there are at least 8 hours off prior to the beginning of the work assignment) an employee who is scheduled to report to work more than two hours in advance of the employees regular working hours shall be entitled to a stipend of $12 and the meal will be eaten on Company time. Individuals assigned to the 4 to 12 shift who are asked to report more than two hours in advance of their shift will receive a stipend of $15. Individuals assigned to thel2 to 8 shift who are asked to report more than two hours in advance of their shift will receive a stipend of $15.
The “7 hour rule” shall be administered as follows: An individual entitled to a meal after two hours of overtime shall be provided a stipend of $24 and eat their meal on the job at the applicable rate. At the completion of the 7th hour of work the individual shall
11
be entitled to a second $24 stipend and one hour at straight time at the completion of the assignment.
The Company maintains the right to provide meals to employees and in the event the Company provides a meal to the employee no stipend shall be paid.
The payment of any hours in lieu of obtaining and eating a meal shall not be considered for any other provisions of the Labor Agreement (eg. rest time, sleeptime etc...)
The stipend of $24 shall be increased to $25 on May 1, 2013.
55.	The parties, through the collective bargaining process, and continuing past practice have had and will have shift and special schedule employees who, when not working an eight and one-half hour shift, eat their meals on the job.
56.	Cleaning Workers and Cafeteria Attendants will receive the same percentage wage increases as all other classifications.
57.	Article V paragraph I in the T& D labor agreement shall be amended as follows:
Construction or maintenance employees shall not be required to do all of their regular work duties outdoors in rainy or inclement weather, except in emergencies or to perform essential work such as outdoor switching, gas and electric service restoration and to correct other gas and electric system conditions that may result in a service interruption such as pumping drips and correcting gas regulator problems, fuel and ash handling, and necessary snow removal. Such employees may, however, be assigned to perform elements of their regular work duties that are not impacted by the weather and other work as closely applicable to their work as is available on such days; such work shall not include painting but need not be confined to work applicable to their specific job classifications. For such work, a work plan will be mutually agreed upon for the given weather conditions. If the Classified crew leader or members of his/her crew believe that a task will be impacted under the current weather circumstances then such work will not proceed. However, when working any tasks that cannot be reasonably interrupted due to recognized work practices or safety considerations, and the weather conditions change from the original work plan and it becomes inclement, work will be suspended upon the completion of the immediate task.
58.	The Company will maintain the position of Commercial Specialist and the three individuals currently in the position will be maintained in the position. However, Item 7 of the 1952 Memorandum of Agreement shall be modified to read:
The Company will maintain a minimum of two Commercial Specialist (206.0) positions. As the current individuals vacate the position they will not be replaced except for the two last persons in the position. The Company agrees it will not seek to further amend or modify Item 7 of the 1952 Memorandum of Agreement prior to April 30, 2021.
59.	Effective May 1, 2011 the pay groups for certain classifications will be changed as indicated in this item for individuals hired on or after May 1, 2011. In addition, other job classifications will be eliminated as noted in this item.
12
The positions of Accounting Clerk 2/C and 3/C shall both be eliminated and any employee in progression shall be promoted to Accounting Clerk in pay group 10 without examination.
The position of Accounting Clerk (405.3) shall be in pay group 6.
The position of Commercial Representative - Meter Reader (207.5) shall be in pay group 7.

In recognition that a Chief Gas Mechanic was needed on Saturday, August 9, 2008, agrees to modify the gas crew callouts by chaining all districts’ Chief Gas Mechanics together and all districts’ Gas Mechanics 1/C together once the required complement from the district of need is not reached. The intent of this modification is to create consistent callout procedures that require minimal manual intervention. In addition, the intent is to eliminate calls out of turn; and equalize callout opportunities. The programmed chains in ARCOS for both Chief Gas Mechanic and Gas Mechanicl/C classifications are listed below.

In settlement of Grievance 2005-05 and 2005-83, the Company will agree for the term of the Labor Agreement that when all line personnel in a district (Fishkill, Poughkeepsie, Kingston, Catskill, Newburgh) are called out, the Company will also call out a Field Clerk/Storekeeper from that district. If no district Field Clerk/Storekeeper accepts the callout, the Company is not obligated to call out any other Field Clerk/Storekeeper from another district. The length of the callout for a Field Clerk/Storekeeper is not tied to the length of the callout for any such Linemen.

Exhibit 12
Item 20 of the 1977 Memorandum of Agreement shall be amended to read:
A.	Digest Item 1977-20 established a roving provision for the Line Organization that has from time to time been revised to meet the operating needs of the Company. The parties have agreed to work collectively to develop a means of transitioning to a more Flexible Work Force. The intent of establishing a Flexible Work Force is to provide the staffing necessary to:
1.	Provide the qualified crewing required to supplement existing District resources to productively complete the incremental capital and maintenance work associated with meeting one or more of the following: regulatory requirements, customer commitments, or work plan objectives based on system wide priority.
2.	Provide adequate qualified crewing for larger scale construction projects best suited for the Project Construction Program where a dedicated construction organization is required to be equally or more competitive with outside line contractors, and thereby assist in displacing the number of line contractors working on the Company property.
The transition to a more Flexible Work Force will require establishing and maintaining, for the term of this Labor Agreement, a minimum complement of six Utility Workers and six Linemen 3/C or a minimum of twelve Linemen 3/C. If the complement falls below those levels established above, the Company will post and fill each vacancy within nine months from the date the position was vacated
The Company will designate a group of Linemen/Linewomen 1/C consisting of 20% of Linemen/Linewomen 1/C as Rovers (who became Linemen/Linewomen 1/C on or after May 1,2003) (but in no event fewer than four such Linemen/Linewomen 1/C). The selection of such qualified Linemen/Linewomen 1/C will be from the least senior in such classification. Such employees will report at the normal or designated time to any permanent headquarters within the system from time to time as the Company may determine. Such employees shall only be reimbursed for additional mileage cost for transportation pursuant to Article V-P of the T&D Working Agreement when reporting to other than their normal headquarters.
All current Service Worker B’s who were scheduled to progress to Service Worker A will retain the Service Worker B’s pay rate 17 until they progress to Lineman/Linewoman 1/C.
Scheduled overtime records and a call-out system for such employees will be maintained at each such employee’s normally designated headquarters.
B.	Effective May 1,2011, the parties agree that all current and future individuals assigned to the position of Lineman/Linewoman 3/C after January 1, 2011, and progressing to the position of Lineman/Linewoman 2/C, and then progressing to Lineman/Linewoman 1/C shall become part of the Flexible Work Force but shall have a permanent headquarter assignment. Linemen/Linewomen 1/C in the Flexible Work Force will report at the normal or designated time to any permanent headquarters within the system or Project Construction job site reporting location from time to time as the Company may determine. When a Lineman/Linewoman 1/C in the Flexible Work Force is assigned to a Project Construction job site they will be subject to all provisions of the Project Construction Program as outlined under Exhibit 127 of the Labor Agreement. When the Flexible Work Force complement of Linemen/Linewomen 1/C reaches twelve, then the group of Linemen/Linewomen 1/C designated as Rovers consisting of 20% of Linemen/Linewomen 1/C shall be suspended. If the current Service Worker shift complement has a vacancy and cannot be filled through post & bid, then the Lineman/Linewoman 1/C with the least seniority currently assigned to either Project Construction or the Districts with a 60 month Service Worker commitment will be assigned the Service Worker A vacancy as their permanent headquarters.
C.	The parties agree that the Company will continue to require permanent staffing of Linemen/Linewomen 1/C in the District Headquarters in addition to Service Workers to support daily operation and maintenance requirements. There shall be Linemen/Linewomen 1/C excluded from the Flexible Work Force to support the District Operations. These Linemen shall be determined based on seniority.
D.	Effective May 1, 2011, the parties agree that the six least senior Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) will become part of the Flexible Work Force. Subsequent postings and assignments for Working Foreman/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) will become part of the Flexible Work Force, in accordance with paragraph D (1) below, but shall have a permanent headquarter assignment.
1.	When the Flexible Work Force complement of Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) reaches eight, then based on seniority, as each new Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) is created, they will become part of the Flexible Work Force and replace an existing Working Foreman/Working Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) on the Flexible Work Force.
Such Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) will report at the normal or designated time to any permanent headquarters within the system or Project Construction job site reporting location from time to time as the Company may
determine. Such Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) shall only be reimbursed for additional mileage cost for transportation pursuant to Article V-P of the T&D Working Agreement when reporting to a headquarters other than their normal headquarters. Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) reporting to a Project Construction job site reporting location shall be reimbursed in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit 127. During the term of the Labor Agreement, Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) designated as Flexible Work Force assigned to Project Construction shall have the option to opt out of Project Construction after 27 months (this service need not be continuous) The Working Foremen/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) who successfully bid or are assigned to Project Construction will be subject to all provisions of Exhibit 127, except as noted below.
Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) who did not bid, but are subsequently assigned to Project Construction, will have the option to work, but not be forced to work, the 10 hour/day work schedule provided that there is at least one Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) on each project working the 10 hour/day work schedule. A Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) designated as Flexible Work Force who decides not to work the 10 hour/day work schedule will also have the option to remain on the scheduled overtime list and callout system for such employee’s normally designated headq uarters, but will be held to the 20% response requirement of the Callout Response Program. If neither Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) designated as Flexible Work Force assigned to a Project Construction job site volunteers for the 10 hr/dav work schedule, such assignment shall be determined based on seniority. The Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) assigned to Project Construction will be subject to all other provisions of Exhibit 127.
Scheduled overtime records and a call-out system for Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) assigned to an alternate headquarters but not Project Construction will be maintained at each such employee’s normally designated headquarters.
E.	The parties agree that the Company will continue to require permanent staffing of Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) in the District Headquarters to support daily operation and maintenance requirements. There shall be Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) excluded from the Flexible Work Force to support the District Operations. These Linemen shall be determined based on seniority.
The foregoing shall not preclude the Company from assigning any Second or Third-Class Lineman/Linewomen to any headquarters for training as may be required, in accordance with Article IV (J4).
In view of the foregoing, all Linemen/Linewomen shall continue to progress through the Linemen/Linewomen automatic progression series. (See Exhibit 127). (CH 43 & 45)
1.	Exhibit 126 shall be amended to read as follows: This Agreement replaces Exhibit 91 to incorporate the following provisions for the term of the existing Labor Agreement.
a.	Except as specifically amended by this Agreement, all existing five year commitments for Linemen/Linewomen 1/C, Service Worker A’s and Service Worker B’s shall remain in effect until such commitments have been fulfilled by the affected employees.
b.	Line personnel who were Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV), Lineman/Linewoman 1/C, or Service Workers on May 1, 2003 and still had the one-year obligation at that time are considered to have fulfilled it as of May 1, 2006 (Sunset Clause).
c.	Any employee who held the classification of Lineman/Linewoman 1/C, Lineman/Linewoman 2/C, Lineman/Linewoman 3/C, Service Worker B, Service Worker A or Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) as of 2/1/90 was grandfathered and exempt from the mandatory reassignment.
The Company maintains the right to fill the Midnight to 8:00 AM Service Worker shift. The Company will fill the Midnight to 8:00 AM Service Worker shift if it determines operating conditions warrant such a shift. If the Company makes the determination to fill the Midnight to 8:00 AM Service Worker shift, the Company shall meet with the President and Business Manager of Local 320 in an attempt to identify other alternatives that will meet the operating needs of the Company. If the Midnight to 8:00 AM shift is implemented, all affected Local 320 employees will be notified a minimum of 30 days prior to the start of the schedule. If a Midnight to 8:00 AM Service Worker shift is reestablished, the 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM Service Worker shift will revert back to 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM.
All existing Service Worker A’s (109.1), as of 02/01/01, will continue to be exempted from being scheduled to work the Midnight to 8:00 AM shift. Such Service Workers may be assigned to work shifts consisting of 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM and/or 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM and such shifts will not be considered to be working the Midnight to 8 AM shift. If the Service Worker schedule, which need not conform to the Midnight to 8:00 AM, 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM and 4:00 PM to Midnight shifts, includes a shift from 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM and/or 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM these exempt Service Workers, working such shift, will not compromise their Midnight to 8:00 AM shift exemption. However, if these Service Worker A’s bid to another headquarters, they will be subject to work the Midnight to 8:00 AM shift.
Employees in the classification of Service Worker B (109.2) are subject to being assigned to work the Midnight to 8 AM shift. However, Service Worker B’s will not be assigned to cover a shift or any part of a shift alone or be paired with another Service Worker B to fill a Service Worker shift or any part of a shift.
Service Workers’ workdays off will be rotated as provided for in Article III C of the T&D Labor Agreement.
It is the Company’s intent to continue to operate all Service Crews as one-person crews. There are circumstances, related to the nature of a work assignment, where two one-person crews may be teamed together to complete an assignment. Where two one-person crews are teamed together, and the crew determines that it may be advantageous to operate as a two-person crew in a single truck, the crew will first discuss it with a supervisor and get agreement from the supervisor.
Where there is a Service Worker shift vacancy and the Company determines that such vacancy needs to be filled, the Company will first post to fill the vacancy.
Any individual who becomes a Lineman/Linewoman 1/C on or after 02/01/01 shall be subject to being assigned (either through reassignment under this agreement, post & bid or outside hire) into the Service Worker A position without any examination for promotion to Service Worker A.
Individuals who enter this Program will be obligated to serve in the Service Worker A position for a period of not less than 60 months (this service need not be continuous). The Company and the Union agree to permit Service Worker A’s, with less than 60 months as a Service Worker A, to bid a posted position in the Project Construction Program, such time assigned to the Project Construction Program will be credited toward the minimum 60-month commitment as a Service Worker A but such credit will be limited to 36 months for employees progressing to Lineman 1/C or Service Worker A effective May 1, 2012 as outlined in Exhibit 127.
The Company shall post for a Lineman/Linewoman 1/C and give Service Worker A’s, who are not needed to maintain the complement necessary to staff the Service Worker shift schedules that are in place at the time of such posting, the opportunity to bid to Lineman/Linewoman 1/C, regardless of the time they may have left on their 60-month Service Worker A commitment. Seniority shall prevail regardless of time served as a Service Worker A.
If the Company has a need for temporary Linemen/Linewomen 1/C in Project Construction, it will post. In the event there are no bidders to a temporary Lineman/Linewoman 1/C posting for Project Construction, the Company may
assign a Lineman/Linewoman 1/C to Project Construction provided the Lineman/Linewoman 1/C still has time remaining on his/her 5 year Service Worker A commitment. Such service as a temporary Lineman/Linewoman 1/C PC shall count as service for purposes of fulfilling an individual’s 60-month Service Worker A commitment as outlined in Exhibit 127 and paragraph 7C above. Until this 60-month commitment is fulfilled, these individuals shall remain available for reassignment to the Service Worker A position as provided for under this agreement. Such group shall be comprised of the junior Service Workers A and/or Linemen/Linewomen 1/C that have time remaining on their 60-month Service Worker A commitment. All terms and conditions of the Project Construction program shall apply.
An individual hired on or after 02/01/01 directly into a Lineman/Linewoman 3/C position in progression to Service Worker A will also be eligible, prior to completing their 5 year Service Worker A commitment, to bid into other positions outside the Line classifications; however, if they do, they will maintain their obligation to complete the remainder of their 5 year Service Worker A commitment if they return to a Line classification.
In no event will any 5 year Service Worker A obligation extend beyond 12 years from the original date of the assignment of the employee to Service Worker A or Lineman/Linewoman 1/C, provided that the employee remains in the classification of Service Worker A or Lineman/Linewoman 1/C. There is no obligation on the part of the Company to post for Lineman/Linewoman 1/C or to reassign Service Workers A’s following the expiration of this 12 year period, except as otherwise provided for in this agreement. Any employees who bid for and accept a position as one of the 41 permanent Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) shall be considered to have fulfilled their obligation as long as they remain in that classification.
The Union and Company will discuss and rectify, if possible, the assignment of any individual that would result in a more favorable headquarters assignment being made to an individual with less seniority (including new hires) over a more senior individual.
Any employee reassigned on a mandatory basis shall be eligible for mileage reimbursement (with the rate consistent with Article V P of the T&D Labor Agreement.) Such reimbursement shall not exceed 24 months. The provisions of Article V G shall not apply.
Future Linemen/Linewomen 1/C subject to being assigned to Service Worker A will be assigned on a voluntary basis and if enough individuals do not accept the assignment, the employees with the lowest seniority will be assigned.
The parties will maintain a committee consisting of up to 5 members of the Union and up to 5 members of Management during the term of this Agreement. Meetings will be held at the request of either party to discuss any aspect of the program that is of concern to either or both of the parties.
Employees who were Working Foremen/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV), Linemen/Linewomen 1/C or currently assigned Service Worker A’s on May 1, 2003 have fulfilled their obligation as of May 1, 2006.
The Pay Group for Service Worker A shall be Pay Group 21.
Except as specifically amended by this Service Worker Agreement, all existing five-year commitments previously established under the Labor Agreement for Linemen/Linewomen 1/C, Service Worker A’s, and Service Worker B’s shall remain in effect until such commitments have been fulfilled by the affected employees.
Effective May 1, 2011, the parties agree that all current and future individuals assigned to the position of Lineman/Linewoman 3/C after January 1,2011 shall progress to the position of Lineman/Linewoman 2/C, and then Lineman/Linewoman 1/C and become part of the Flexible Work Force. If the current Service Worker shift complement has a vacancy and cannot be filled through post & bid, the junior Lineman/Linewoman 1/C with a 60-month Service Worker commitment will be assigned the Service Worker A vacancy as their permanent headquarters. All current Service Worker B’s who were scheduled to progress to Service Worker A will retain the Service Worker B’s pay rate 17 until they progress to Lineman 1/C.
The following procedure shall be followed when covering absences of Service Workers.
All Service Workers A’s and Service Worker B's (assigned to a shift) in the District are eligible to be called for any shift. Service Worker B's will only be called to cover a shift if a Service Worker A is scheduled to work the same shift. Service Worker B's will not be assigned to cover a shift alone or be paired with another Service Worker B.
When a shift vacancy occurs, the Company may elect to cover part or all of the shift. When the decision is made to cover part or all of the shift, the assignment will be offered to the Service Workers in accordance with the process outlined below:
1.	Call, if available, a Service Worker in the District on their first day off.
2.	Call, if available, a Service Worker in the District on their second day off.
3.	Assign, if available, a Service Worker in the District on the prior shift to work an additional four hours and call, if available, a Service Worker in the District on the following shift to report to work fours hours ahead of such Service Worker’s scheduled shift. The selection of the Service Worker to work an additional four hours shall be made from the scheduled overtime list. The selection of the Service Worker to report to work four hours early shall be made from the callout list. Assign, if available, a Service Worker in the District on the prior shift to work eight additional hours. The selection of such Service Worker shall be made from the scheduled overtime list.
4.	Call, if available, a Service Worker on the following shift to report to work eight hours early. The selection of the Service Worker shall be made from the call out list.
The off Service Worker is defined as a Service Worker who is not scheduled to work for the entire calendar day and shall be called using the callout list. Consideration shall be given to the Service Worker’s respective position on the list and the number of skips already assigned to each Service Worker. If all eligible Service Workers have the same number of skips, they shall be called in the order they appear on the call out list. If the Service Workers have different numbers of skips, the Service Worker with the lowest number of skips shall be called first. (See Example)
A skip shall be applied to those Service Workers called to work. No skip shall be applied if the pointer was at a Service Worker called. Skips are only removed when the pointer moves past a Service Worker during a normal call out.
If, after going through the above procedure, no Service Worker is available to cover a shift and the Company has determined that coverage is required, the shift may be filled in accordance with the terms of Exhibit 74 of the Labor Agreement.
Pay and meals for the employee called shall be administered in accordance with Exhibit 32 of the Labor Agreement.
EXAMPLE TO EQUALIZE SKIPS
The following example is a call out to fill an unscheduled Service Worker vacancy. The sequence begins with the Service Worker with the least amount of skips. The call out order would be SW 3, SW 2, and then SW 1. In this example SW 3 accepted the call. SW 3’s skip total will be increased by one. SW 1 and SW 2’s skip total will remain unchanged.
Order	Name	Skips	Call out Order	Skips After Call
1	SW 1	6	3	6
2	L 1	0	N/A	0
3	SW2	5	2	5
4	L2	0	N/A	0
5	SW3	2	1	3
Lineman/Linewoman 2/C and Service Worker B training.
Linemen/Linewomen 2/C shall be upgraded to Service Worker B and assigned to ride on shift with a Service Worker A for at least one full shift rotation during their last four months of progression. The employee ungraded to Service Worker B will be eligible for applicable shift differential but not mileage reimbursement under Article V P of the Labor Agreement during this upgrade period. This assignment will be for training purposes only; however, the crew complement would be considered qualified.
Exhibit 127 shall be amended to read as follows:
Exhibit 127 - Project Construction Program Agreement
A.	The intent of the Project Construction Organization is to be a dedicated construction organization, assigned to large-scale construction projects that would typically last 3 or more days, which will maximize crew productivity on construction projects, be equally or more competitive with outside line contractors, and assist in reducing the number of line contractors working on the Company property.
B.	The Project Construction Organization will be assigned to the Customer Services Group.
C.	The work force of the Project Construction Organization can be permanently headquartered in one or more normally staffed headquarters with like type job classifications. The Project Construction permanent headguarters will be established through the post & bid process utilizing temporary postings. In the event the Company changes the Headquarters at any time in the future, the Company may do so through a subsequent temporary posting. Any temporary posting under this program may extend for the term of the Labor Agreement. Under these provisions, the posting is subject to an individual employee’s right to opt out of the Program after completion of 12 months in the Program, and additional opportunities to opt out of the Program every 12 months thereafter and such employee shall be returned to their permanent job and headquarters as soon as possible thereafter but in no case more than 30 days. If an individual wishes to opt out of the program at any other time, and Management agrees to such opt out, such individual shall be returned to their permanent job and headquarters at the completion of their current assignment or within 30 days whichever occurs first. If such return is to a job they left less than 6 months before, such individual will maintain their position on the scheduled overtime list with the hours they had when they left their permanent headquarters, and all scheduled overtime hours they worked as part of Project Construction will be added to their scheduled overtime hours on the list in their permanent headquarters.
D.	Multiple alternate headquarter reporting will be established. Each Project Construction job that is expected to last at least 90 days or more shall be posted. This provision includes normally staffed headquarter reporting and project jobsite reporting. Employees of a Project Construction Crew will report at the beginning of the workday and be dismissed at the end of the
1
day from the alternate headquarters site, from the project jobsite to which they are assigned, or from their permanent headquarters.
E.	The Project Construction work force will include, but not be limited to, Linemen/Linewomen 1/C, Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) and Chief Line Clearance Men/Women. The work force will be established through a temporary posting for the purpose of performing project construction work on a job site reporting basis. Other employees assigned to the Project Construction work force may be assigned in accordance with paragraphs F, G, H, and I below and in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit 126.
F.	Employees may be assigned to this program through Article IV J 4 for training during their progression period. (Linemen/Linewomen 3/C may be assigned for up to 9 months of their 18 month progression period and Lineman/Linewomen 2/C or Service Worker B for up to 18 months during their 30 months in progression.) These employees shall be assigned for a minimum of 40 hours/week and will conform to the work schedule of the Project Construction Crew and all other conditions of this Project Construction Agreement. However, any such employee may enter this program through a temporary posting through post and bid.
G.	The Company shall create the position of Temporary Working Foreman/Forewoman 1/C (HV) in Pay Group 23 for the purpose of supervising crews in the absence of a supervisor under the provisions of Article V.C. in the Labor Agreement while assigned to a Project Construction project.
H.	It is the intent to have a Project Construction project staffed with two Temporary Working Foremen/Forewomen 1/C but at a minimum of one Temporary Working Foreman/Forewoman 1/C (HV) and one Temporary Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV).
1.	When the Company has a need for temporary Working Foremen/Forewomen in Project Construction, it will post for one or more Temporary Working Foreman/Forewoman 1/C (HV) as well as Temporary Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV). The Company shall assign two Temporary Working Foremen/Forewomen 1/C (HV) from the list of gualified bidders.
2.	In the event that there are no gualified bidders to a Temporary Working Foreman/Forewoman 1/C (HV) posting for Project Construction, the Company shall assign a qualified Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) from the Flexible Work Force (1977-20) to Project Construction. Such assignment shall be to the classification of Temporary Working Foreman/Forewoman
2
1/C (HV). The Company shall also assign one Temporary Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) from the list of qualified bidders.
3.	If there is only one qualified bidder for the Temporary Working Foreman/Forewoman 1/C (HV) posting, then the Company shall also assign one Temporary Working Foreman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) from the list of qualified bidders.
4.	In the event that there are no qualified bidders to a Temporary Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) posting, the Company may assign a Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) from the Flexible Work Force (1977-20) to Project Construction. Such assignment shall be to the classification of Temporary Working Foreman/Forewoman 1/C (HV).
The Company will offer a vehicle to the Working Foremen/Forewomen 1/C (LES&T) (HV) assigned to the Project Construction Program to be taken home and used to commute between their home and their work headquarters. All terms of the Project Construction Program and Transportation Policy shall apply.
I.	If the Company has a need for temporary Linemen/Linewomen 1/C in Project Construction, it will post. In the event there are no bidders to a temporary Lineman/Linewoman 1/C posting for Project Construction, the Company may assign a Lineman/Linewoman 1/C to Project Construction provided the Lineman/Linewoman 1/C still has time remaining on his/her 5 year Service Worker A commitment. Such service as a temporary Lineman/Linewoman 1/C - PC shall count as service for purposes of fulfilling an individual’s 60-month Service Worker A commitment but such credit will be limited to 36 months for employees progressing to Lineman 1/C or Service Worker A effective May 1, 2012. Such group shall be comprised of the junior Service Workers A and/or Linemen/Linewomen 1/C that have time remaining on their 60-month Service Worker A commitment. All terms of the Project Construction Program shall apply.
J.	Until the Flexible Work Force complement of Linemen/Linewomen 1/C reaches twelve, the provisions of 1977-20 do not apply to Linemen/Linewomen 1/C assigned to the Project Construction Program. No Linemen/Linewomen 1/C assigned to the Project Construction Program will be included in the percentage calculation provided for in 1977-20 nor will any Linemen/Linewomen 1/C assigned to the Project Construction Program be classified as a Rover while in said program.
3

Staffing in excess of the above will be based on the requirements of the job. A crew leader may request additional manpower if he/she gives reasons why the safe performance of the job requires it. Prior to proceeding with the work as planned, the supervisor shall review at the work site the conditions or circumstances which have created the reported unsafe or hazardous condition.
If the supervisor determines that the job does not warrant additional manpower or if an alternative work method and/or equipment can be utilized to remove the hazard, the supervisor will assign the work to the crew leader.
i
If the crew leader still believes that a safety hazard exists, the work will be performed by that crew either utilizing “hot sticks” or de-energized at the direction of the unclassified Supervisor and such issue will be referred to the 15KV Review Committee as established under Item 8 of this Agreement for discussion and resolution.
There is no restriction on the number of people who may be elevated at any one time regardless of the crew size. When a job assignment involves direct handling of energized 15KV circuits, one qualified high voltage crew member will remain on the ground (not elevated). If the job involves more than the crew complement listed above, a Lineman/Linewoman 2/C / Service Worker B may be assigned to assist a Lineman/Linewoman 1/C /Service Worker A or higher classification, in the elevated position to direct handle energized 15 KV circuits at the discretion of the Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV) or Working Foreman/Forewoman 1/C (HV) in charge of the crew.
Linemen/Linewomen 2/C and Service Worker Bs will be permitted to direct handle energized 15 KV circuits as described in the previous paragraph provided that the current Linemen/Linewomen 2/C / Service Worker B High Voltage Gloving Training Prograpi is added to the Lineman/Linewoman 3/C to Lineman/Linewoman 2/C / Service Worker B progression school.
Other employees assigned to the crew for the purpose of flagging or other work not associated with the direct handling operation may be of classifications lower than that of Lineman/Linewoman 2/C.
2.	This agreement shall be in effect as of January 1, 1993. Thereafter, this agreement shall be extended and remain in full force and effect, except that either party may terminate this agreement, on or before January 1,1995, by providing the other party with a written Notice of Termination. Such Notice of Termination shall take effect 30 days after it is served on the other party. Such 30-day Notice of Termination may not be given after December 1, 1994. In the event one of the parties elects to terminate this program, then upon such termination, the pay of Lineman/Linewoman 1/C (101.1) shall revert back to pay group 19.1; the pay of Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (130.1) shall revert back to pay group 21.1; and the pay of Service Worker A (109.1) shall revert back to pay group 20.1.

5.	A training program will be provided to ail future employees prior to participating in the Program. Adequate refresher training will be provided to incumbents on an as-needed basis.
6.	Exhibit 17 of the Labor Agreement shall not be modified as a result of this agreement. Any Lineman/Linewoman 1/C	(HV), Working
Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) (HV), Working Foreman/Forewoman 1/C (HV), or Service Worker A (HV) participating in this gloving program who is called out of turn to direct-handle 15KV energized conductors shall have a skip applied.
7.	Direct-handling of 15KV energized circuits shall not be performed in inclement weather or during the hours of darkness. (Emergencies shall not affect this prohibition).
8a. A 15KV Review Committee consisting of not more than four (4) representatives of Management and four (4) representatives of Local 320, consisting of the Union President and three (3) qualified line personnel in the Program, shall meet on a semi-annual basis or more often, if necessary, to discuss any areas of concern that may arise during this Program. Any issue dealing with how a gloving job is to be performed including the staffing under paragraph 1 above, shall not be subject to the grievance procedure but rather be submitted to the Review Committee for discussion and resolution.
3
b. In the event the Review Committee is unable to resolve any issue which comes before it including staffing under paragraph 1 above, such issue will be referred to the President of the Company, who shall act as an independent arbitrator and decide the issue.

The Company will post for five (5) additional Working Foremen/Forewomen 2/C (LES&T) (HV) assigned to the line department to establish a complement of 41 by 12/1/91. These complements are without a commitment to permanent staffing.
13.	The Program shall not be a limitation on the ability of the Company to use the Service Workers A, Linemen/Linewomen 1/C, Working Foremen /Forewomen 2/C (LES&T), Working Foremen/Forewomen 1/C (HV), or other electric line personnel as set forth in the Labor Agreement.
14.	Item 1965 +10 is null and void and the item is to be removed from the Labor Agreement. Item 1965 +10 reads as follows:

The work associated with establishing a new service including inspection of appliance installations, care for leaks and stoppages, adjustment of appliances and inspection and adjustment of gas regulators, shall be performed by Commercial Representatives. A gas crew may connect the new service piping to the customer piping and set the gas meter.
Overtime
Relighting is to be performed on an overtime basis by gas crews in accordance with these general guidelines. Notwithstanding the Company’s right to uniformly make assignments on an overtime and regular time basis, gas crews will be assigned to relight on an overtime basis when repairing leaks, responding to emergencies, and relighting at the completion of an assignment on an extended workday. Gas crews will not be assigned to relight appliances on an overtime basis when the work has been scheduled with the knowledge that gas service will be interrupted. Commercial Representatives perform these scheduled overtime relights.
General
Bearing in mind that the relight assignment to a gas crew is intended to be incidental to their normal construction, repair and maintenance work, there is no restriction on number of services which may be relighted. Assignments to relight construction and maintenance jobs should be made with the purpose of scheduling and utilizing all employees in an effective manner.
Relocating Gas Meters
The relocation of the meter and associated piping, including tying into the customer piping, can be performed by either craft, separately or jointly. Relighting will not be performed by members of a gas crew.
Changing a Gas Meter in Accordance with the PSC Time Test Program
Commercial Representatives shall be responsible for changing small meters associated with the PSC time test program. A crew consisting of at least a Gas Mechanic and a Commercial Representative may work jointly to change a large meter.
Interruption by Others
When service is interrupted by a third party excavator, relighting will not be performed by gas crews. When the interruption is caused by the gas crew in response to damage by a third party excavator, the management reserves the right to assign Gas Mechanics the responsibility for relighting.
