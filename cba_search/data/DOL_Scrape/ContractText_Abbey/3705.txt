C.	Preparatory and Concluding Activities
“Preparatory and Concluding Activities” are time worked and should be accomplished within the designated shift (see Glossary).
Section 2-	Hospital Convenience Time Off (HC)
A.	Definition
“Hospital Convenience Time Off (HC)” is hereby defined as a day and/or part of a day off without pay and without loss of benefits and/or seniority. HC is not prescheduled time off except in specific instances approved by the management representative.
93
B.	Prior to the start of the shift, an HC will be issued in an increment of four (4) or more hours unless the RN requests and management agrees to provide, an HC of shorter duration.

H.	An RN receiving an HC is limited to two (2) calls per shift.
I.	HC will be given, in the following order:

9.	Full-time/part-time RNs working under status by inverse percentages
J.	The final decision will be based on patient safety and cost center requirements.
94
K.	For the purpose of determining which RN receives an HC, seniority is the tie-breaker within a category when all else is equal. For example:
1.	Voluntary HC- Two (2) full-time/part-time RN volunteers with the same HC percentage- the most senior RN is granted the HC.
2.	Mandatory HC- Two (2) full-time/part-time RNs, each within work status, with the same HC percentage- the least senior RN must take the HC.
L.	If an RN(s) must be cancelled or sent home as a result of staffing need changes once a shift has started, the RN(s) will be given HC in the same priority order as in subsection I above. The final decision will be based on patient safety and cost center requirements.
M.	Refer to the PCSS for unit specific guidelines about HC. Notwithstanding any PCSS guidelines, RNs who are within their probationary period will be eligible for HC as soon as they have their competencies signed off.

APPENDIX B
SIDE LETTER OF AGREEMENT #2 BETWEEN EL CAMINO HOSPITAL
AND
PROFESSIONAL RESOURCE FOR NURSES
Rest Between Shifts Differential for 12-Hour Shift RNs in e-Time Scenarios
It is agreed:
After the schedule has been published additional unscheduled extra shifts or additional hours are subject to the following (for 12-Hour Shift RNs):
Return in Less than Eleven and One-Half (11 ¥) Hours
1.	Rest Between Shifts (RBS) is paid when unscheduled shifts or extra hours beyond a scheduled shift occur, that result in a return in less than eleven and one half (11 ^) hours. The premium pay is associated with a change in the working conditions (time off) that were planned or relied on when the schedule was posted.
2.	For RBS to apply the extra shift worked would occur the day before or the day after a scheduled shift.
3.	Return in less than 11 ^ hours is not automatically captured in eTime. You must email your manager that you worked an extra unscheduled shift that resulted in return in less than 11 ^ hours and your time card needs to be adjusted to Code 63 to receive Premium Pay.
Return in Less than Ten and One-Half (10 ¥) Hours
1.	This applies to 12-hour RNs working additional hours on scheduled shifts (staying over/coming in early). If a 12-hour RN status additional hours on a scheduled shift at the request of the Hospital due to staffing needs and the RN returns to work in less than 10.5 hours, the RN will receive the premium pay.
2.	Code 63 will automatically be applied in eTime in this scenario and no request to manager is necessary.
*8-Hour Shift RNs the premium pay remains as a result of return in less than 12 hours.
114
eTime Scenarios
	Monday	Tuesday	Wednesday	Comments
Example 1	Scheduled 0700-1930 12 hours Pays 12 hours Pay Code 60 Straight time	Scheduled 0700-1930 12 hours Pays 12 hours Pay Code 60 Straight time	Scheduled 0700-1930 12 hours Pays 12 hours Pay Code 60 Straight time	Consecutive scheduled shifts, does not qualify for Premium Pay.
Example 2	Scheduled 0700-1930 12 hours Extends shift 1930-2330 Pays 12 hours Pay Code 60 Straight time Pays 4 hours Code 61 1.5 times	Scheduled 0700-1930 12 hours Pays 12 hours Pay Code 63 Return <10.5	Day Off	Consecutive scheduled shifts, does not qualify for Premium Pay because the scheduled shift is extended and the RN comes back in <10.5 hours. (auto captured by eTime)
Example 3	Day Off	Unscheduled Extra Shift 0700-1930 (clocks out 1938 or later to apply) Pays 12 hours Pay Code 60 Straight time	Scheduled 0700-1930 12 hours Pays 12 hours Pay Code 63 Return <11.5	Since the unscheduled extra shift does not cause the RN to return in <11.5 hours, it is paid at straight time The extra shift caused the RN to return to work in <11.5 hours so the RN receives Code 63 premium pay on the Wednesday scheduled shift. (Remember eTime does not auto capture this scenario, tell Manger to be compensated).
Example 4	Scheduled 0700-1930 12 hours (clocks out 1938 or later to apply) Pays 12 hours Pay Code 60 Straight time	Unscheduled Extra Shift 0700-1930 12 hours Pays 12 hours Pay Code 63 Return <11.5	Scheduled 0700-1930 12 hours Pays 12 hours Pay Code 60 Straight time	In order for the return in <11.5 to apply the RN would have to clock out the shift before at 1938 or later. This scenario the RN has 2 opportunities for code 63. Scenario 1) If the RN clocks out at 1938 or later on Monday, Tuesdays Extra shift will be Code 63. 2) If the RN clocks out at 1938 or later on the Extra Shift Tuesday, Wednesdays scheduled shift will be Code 63, 3) If the RN off on time at 1930 no Premium Pay will apply as there is no return in <11.5. Shown in ex 4 Scenario 1.
