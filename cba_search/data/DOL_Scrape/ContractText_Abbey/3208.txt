ARTICLE 9
Teacher Work Hours/Work Year
9-1 All teachers on the regular salary schedule may be assigned teaching and school-related duties for a maximum of forty (40) hours per week, including duty-free lunchtime. The hours a teacher works per day shall be determined by the local school schedule, except that no teacher’s regularly-scheduled daily work assignment shall be other than in a consecutive time block, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the teacher and the principal. Saturday and/or Sunday work will be totally voluntary.
9-2 Except as set forth in Section 9-5, the regular teacher work year will not exceed one hundred eighty-eight (188) days.
9-2-1 The regular teacher work year will include one (1) day or equivalent seven and one half (7.5) hours outside the normal work schedule necessary to complete the activities associated with providing a quality educational program. The faculty at each school will decide collaboratively whether to add that day to the school schedule or allow each faculty member to apply the equivalent seven and one half (7.5) hours.
9-2-1 -2 Teachers will work two (2) non-contact days, each to be paid at a per diem rate of one one hundred eighty-seventh (1 /187th) of their salary. The use of non-contact days will be determined per Article 9-2-1 and Article 20. At least two (2) noncontact days will be teacher directed.
9-2-1-3 Schools will utilize three (3) non-contact days from the one hundred-eighty (180) pupil contact days for staff development and teacher directed time. At least one and one half (1.5) of these three (3) days in half (1/2) day blocks will be utilized as teacher directed time. The use of the non-contact days will be determined as per Article 20.
9-2-2 New teachers who are employed with the District will work an additional six (6) days, at the per diem salary rate, to participate in the District’s Induction Program for their first two (2) years. JCEA and District representatives will annually develop the Induction Program that will result in the enhancement and improvement of instruction in District classrooms. New teachers will be involved in this program and second year teachers will continue in a six (6) day Induction Program at the per diem salary rate.
9-3 Faculty and other meetings during orientation days at the beginning of the school year shall be kept to a minimum to enable teachers to complete their classroom preparations, and teachers agree to utilize this time effectively to prepare for classroom instruction.
9-4 Teachers shall have a duty-free lunch period of no less than thirty (30) minutes, exclusive of passing and inter--school travel time. Teachers may leave the building during their duty-free lunch period, provided such absence from the building does not interfere with their regular assignment. The principal's office must be notified prior to such absence from the building.
9-5 Speech therapists, office occupation coordinators, distri-butive education coordinators, psychologists, resource teachers, social workers, and all other non-administrative licensed personnel, except classroom teachers, may be required to begin their work year up to ten (10) workdays before the first day when pupils are in attendance, and terminate their work year up to ten (10) workdays after the last day when pupils are in attendance. Any teacher who is required to work beyond the regular teacher work year, as set forth above, will be compensated at his/her regular rate of pay (computed on the basis of a one hun-dred eighty-seven (187) day work year) for all additional time worked. Except as otherwise provided above, no teacher will be required to accept any assignment other than during the regular teacher work year.
9-5-1 Teacher contract days shall be one hundred eighty-eight (188) days, including the one (1) day equivalent defined in 9-2-1.
9-5-2 Classroom teacher-pupil contact days shall be a minimum of one hundred seventy-five (175) days, but no more than one hundred-eighty (180) days as determined by District policy.
The District recognizes the increased demand placed on teachers by the State-mandated assessments and the preparation necessary to administer the assessments. Current policy requires one hundred seventy-five (175) full student contact days. This proposal would allow two (2) days of the one hundred seventy-five (175) days to be identified as “modified contact days.” “Modified contact days” are defined as student contact days not requiring attendance of all students at the grade for the normally scheduled instructional day. The “modified contact days” would require student contact throughout the instructional day. This proposal would be in effect for the duration of the contract.
9-5-3 School library information specialists shall report for work three (3) days before the reporting date for classroom teachers, unless the library information specialist and the principal or immediate supervisor mutually agree to a different sched-ule for the six (6) additional days. (Library information specialists shall receive additional pay at the rate of one one hundred eighty-seventh [1/187th] of their annual salaries for each additional day worked.)
9-5-4 Full-time counselors shall work ten (10) addi-tional days per year, and part-time counselors shall work five (5) additional days per year. (Counselors shall receive additional pay at the rate of one one hundred eighty-seventh [1/187th] of their annual salaries for each additional day worked.)
9-6 Teachers will, in addition to their lunch period, have individually directed planning time consistent with school scheduling patterns, but not
http://jeffcoweb.jeffco.kl2.co.us/emprelations/jcea/article_9.html	2/5/04
Jeffco Schools: JCEA Negotiated Agreement	Page 2 of 2
less than two hundred twenty-five (225) minutes per week. In no instance shall any time block of less than thirty (30) minutes be considered planning time. For teachers in grades K through 12, such planning time shall be scheduled within the student day, unless agreed to otherwise by the principal and the teacher. Planning periods which are during the student-teacher contact day shall be used for planning and preparation as determined by the teacher, grade level, department or team.
9-7 Teachers will not be required to cover classes for other teachers or to perform supervisory duties during their preparation time, but they may be asked to cover classes voluntarily to accommodate educationally-significant programs such as field trips.
9-8 Exceptions to the foregoing provisions may be made only in cases of emergency.
9-9 Scheduled parent-teacher conferences shall be conducted within the forty (40) hour workweek with the following provisions:
A.	Lunch time scheduled in excess of the thirty (30) minute duty-free lunch period shall not be counted within the forty (40) hour workweek.
B.	Parent-teacher conferences may be scheduled in the evening, provided no individual school shall schedule more than two (2) evenings for parent-teacher conferences at each scheduled conference time. Teachers will be provided with an equivalent amount of time off for such evening parent-teacher conferences as mutually agreed by the teachers and the building administration.
C.	When scheduled parent-teacher conferences extend into the evening hours, time scheduled for dinner shall not be included in the forty (40) hour workweek.
9-10 Both parties recognize that classroom interruptions diminish the time on task for instruction; therefore, the parties agree that policies designed to minimize disruption by the use of intercoms and summoning students out of classrooms during instructional periods shall be developed in each school, as per Article 20.
9-11 Head coaches and head sponsors who are required to take CPR/First Aid training will be entitled to credit(s) on the salary schedule and recertification credit. If a head coach or head sponsor takes CPR/First Aid training during work time, they will only receive recertification credit(s) for the course.

Class Size
18-1 The parties recognize that maximum attention to students by the teacher is desirable to ensure the high quality education that is the goal of both the Association and the Board. It is also acknowledged that the primary duty and responsibility of the teacher is to teach, and that the organization of the school, the school day and assignment of students to classes should be directed toward ensuring that the energies of the teacher are primarily utilized to this end.
18-2 The Board and the Association further acknowledge that proper class size is a function of many factors, including course objectives, subject matter, teaching process, scheduling patterns, and style of educational activity. Further, that every effort will be made to adjust class size to allow individual attention to each student when that is the required mode of instruction, and except in any emergency situations, pupils will not be placed in any classroom in larger numbers than the capacity of the teaching facilities and stations available in that classroom.
18-3 The Association and the Board recognize all grades as being very critical in the educational development of the student. Further, both parties recognize that class size has an effect upon the students’ experience. Accordingly, it is mutually agreed that every effort will be made to limit the class size as follows:

If a satisfactory resolution is reached, the parties shall reduce the resolution to writing and each shall sign it.
4.	If agreement cannot be reached, an appeal may be initiated. Said appeal shall be reviewed by the area administrator. The area administrator shall respond within ten (10) working days.
5.	If a teacher feels his/her contractual rights were violated in this process, the teacher may file a grievance.
18-9 The Association and the District agree that any development of new, or changes in current staffing practices and/or ratios for any teacher or group of teachers, will involve the Association with the intent of developing an agreement that is mutually acceptable to both parties.

Library Information Centers
25-1 The District and the Association recognize that students and their proficiencies are the central focus of the Library Information Center and that a well-staffed, adequately supplied and well-equipped library information center is essential at each school. Therefore, each center shall be staffed with a library information specialist who is a licensed teacher and has a School Library Media endorsement from the Colorado Department of Education, as well as competencies in library and information technologies. The library information specialist serves as teacher, instructional partner and resource manager within the school community. Accordingly, it is agreed as follows:
25-1-1 Every middle and senior high school shall be staffed with a full-time library information special-ist.
25-1-2 Elementary schools with more than three-hundred (300) students shall be staffed with a full-time library information specialist, and those with less than three-hundred (300) students shall be staffed with a one-half (1/2) time library information specialist.
25-1-3 In order to assure effective utilization of the library information center by providing for an equitable distribution of teacher aides, the District and JCEA agree as follows:
1.	An area administrator will work with individual building principals to assure that each principal will provide a percentage of the building allocated aide hours to the library information center. This percentage will be provided as follows:
Elementary 6.7% -12.7%
Secondary 15.0% - 21.0%
2.	The provisions of this article will not be used as rationale for reducing the percentage of the building allocated aide hours allocated to the library information center.
3.	The principal shall consult with the library information specialist about the allocation of aide hours prior to the principal making such assignment.
4.	All buildings shall continue to have the option of supplementing their paid hours through student assistants and volunteers.
25-1-4 The library information specialist for a particular school will have a workday not longer than that required of classroom teachers at the school. The library information specialist’s workday will occur during the classroom teacher’s regularly scheduled day for that school.
25-1-5 In schools, which are on double session, a full-time library information specialist shall be in charge of the library information center for each session.
25-1 -6 When it is necessary or desirable to consider for hire teachers who are working on their endorsements, because no qualified and licensed candidates exist, the District and the JCEA will implement a tiered advertising/bidding system for library information specialist positions. The teacher would be placed in the open position on a temporary basis for up to two (2) years. Library information specialist positions will be advertised as follows:
First Tier: Open to candidates with library information specialist endorsement.
Second Tier: Open to licensed teachers who are currently enrolled in and making substantial progress in obtaining the library information specialist endorsement.
Third Tier: Open to licensed teachers who are willing to commit to enterisng and successfully completing a program to obtain the library information specialist endorsement.
The teacher filling the library information specialist position on a temporary basis in tier two (2) and three (3) would have his/her former position filled with a temporary teacher.
The teacher filling the library information specialist position in tier two (2) and three (3) may apply for the opening when it is re-advertised. The process for final selection shall follow article 34-5.

Reassignment/T ransfer
34-1 Reassignment
34-1-1 Reassignment shall mean a shift of a teacher within a department, grade level or team or from one department, grade level or team to another within a building, or, in the case of SERS personnel, within a Cluster, except when such shift would result in an identified increased work year.
34-1-2 The principal or immediate supervisor shall have the right to make intra-building reassignments of teachers. Intervention Services administrators shall have the right to make intra-area reassignments of Cluster SERS personnel under their supervision. Such reassignments shall be made only for valid educational reasons.
34-1-3 A teacher who desires a change in assignment within a building or SERS Cluster, for which he/she is qualified, shall submit annually a written request to the building principal for teachers or Intervention Services for SERS personnel. Such requests must be received by the principal or immediate supervisor not later than thirty (30) calendar days from the beginning of the teacher’s work year. Vacancies within a building or SERS Cluster will not be advertised until said requests for reassignment have been considered by the building principal or immediate supervisor.
34-2 Transfers
34-2-1 Transfers shall mean only those changes involving moves from one (1) building (school location) to another, or, in the case of Cluster SERS personnel, from one (1) Cluster to another. Exceptions will be made when advertised openings would result in an identified increased work year (e.g., teacher to counselor, teacher to information specialist), in which case, teachers within a building or SERS personnel within a Cluster may apply for said openings.
34-3 Selection Committee
34-3-1 A Selection Committee will be formed for each vacancy. At least fifty percent (50%) of said committee shall be comprised of teachers. Representation from administration, parents, and students may comprise the rest of the committee. At least fifty percent (50%) of the teachers on the committee shall be chosen by those faculty members in the department, grade level or team in which the vacancy exists. If the department, grade level or team has an insufficient number of teachers to fill the teacher positions on the Selection Committee, teachers may be chosen from related fields or adjoining grade levels within the school.
34-4 Announcement of Vacancies
34-4-1 As soon as the principal or immediate supervisor has received notification from a teacher that the teacher will vacate his/her position, the principal or immediate supervisor will, provided the position is projected to be on-going, initiate the process for the establishment of the Selection Committee. The Selection Committee’s composition may vary from school to school provided the requirements of Article 34-3 must be fulfilled. The Selection Committee shall either write or approve a basic job description for the vacancy. The job description will include a requirement for a one page resume and a one page statement of educational philosophy, which must be submitted with the transfer request form.
34-4-2 All vacancies in the District, which occur between September 15 and June 30, will be advertised. The teacher employment administrator will first determine if an open position is restricted or unrestricted. During February and March, all positions for voluntary transfer will be advertised in the established District electronic medium available at all sites as well as in the District’s current communication media. Involuntary transfers and unassigned leave returnees will be placed in accordance with Article 347-1. All openings occurring after the placement of unassigned leave returnees and involuntaries will be advertised through June 30. However, those open positions requiring special skills, e.g., SERS personnel, counselors, library information specialists and teachers-on-special-assignment, may be advertised and filled anytime during the calendar year.
34-4-3 Vacancies which occur after the last posting in June through September 15 and are not filled with an involuntary transferee or leave returnee, shall be filled with a continuing contract teacher with the approval of the area administrator and subject to review by the Transfer Oversight Committee.
34-4-4 The District and JCEA will form a Transfer Oversight Committee (TOC), which will meet regularly between February 1 and June 30 and at any other time as needed. Each party will appoint three members to this committee. The TOC’s purpose is to discuss, investigate, resolve, and make recommendations concerning pertinent issues related to transfer. The TOC will be provided, in a timely manner, all information needed, including but not limited to, job description, site human resource plans, lists the District has compiled of temporary contract teacher, involuntary transferees, leave returnees, teachers who have been transferred, and retirees.
34-5 Voluntary Teacher Transfer
34-5-1 Non-probationary and probationary teachers who teach a majority of their time in the discipline posted shall be eligible to
http://jeffcoweb.jeffco.kl2.co.us/emprelations/jcea/article_34.html	2/5/04
Jeffco Schools: JCEA Negotiated Agreement	Page 2 of 6
file an application for restricted open positions. Non-probationary teachers, probationary teachers, and temporary teachers shall be eligible to file an application for unrestricted positions. Temporary teachers are defined as those teachers employed first semester as either long-term substitutes or temporary teachers and who continue for the second semester as temporary teachers. If the District has initial screening criteria which the transferees must meet in order to be interviewed for an opening, said criteria will be identified on the job description (to include job title, job number, job responsibilities, and job screening criteria). Applicants who meet the pre-screening criteria will be granted an interview, unless more than six (6) applicants meet the prescreening criteria. If more than six (6) candidates meet the pre-screening criteria, the selection committee may reduce the number to six (6) using the one page resume and one page statement of educational philosophy submitted with the transfer request form. The job description will be on-line. Transfer requests are accepted only on-line through the on-line application process.
34-5-1-1 Teachers who do not meet the pre-screening criteria will be so notified in a timely fashion.
34-5-1-2 Teachers who are not selected to be interviewed using the one (1) page resume and one page statement of educational philosophy will be so notified in a timely fashion.
34-5-2 Voluntary transfers for positions advertised between February 1 through June 30 as outlined in Section 34-4-2, for the next school year shall take place as follows:
34-5-2-1 Open positions shall be identified as outlined in Section 34-4, and applications for transfer shall be processed as outlined in Section 34-5-3.
34-5-2-2 The applicants for transfer will be advised of the Selection Committee’s decision in a timely manner.
34-5-2-3 Positions that come open between September 15 and the end of the school year will be filled on a temporary basis until the close of that school year. If the position continues, it will be advertised during the transfer season.
34-5-3 The Selection Committee will interview all applicants as referenced in section 34-5-1 who meet the pre-screening criteria. In determining the best-qualified candidate for the position, the Selection Committee shall base their consensus selection on all of the following:
A.	The teacher’s experience and/or qualifications related to the vacancy.
B.	Information obtained from interviews of selected candidates.
C.	Evaluations and relevant information in the central personnel file.
D.	Job requirements as specified in the job requisition.
E.	Length of service in the District.
34-5-3-1 The Selection Committee will determine what weight will be given to each of the criteria listed above.
34-5-3-2 The applicant may also bring his/her portfolio and/or copies of his/her work for the Committee’s consideration. Videotapes will not be required nor considered.
34-5-4 If the Selection Committee cannot reach a consensus, the committee and principal may re-interview the top two (2) candidates and attempt to come to a consensus decision. If consensus still cannot be reached, a majority vote may be tried. If a decision cannot be reached by consensus or by majority vote, the principal will make the final decision.
34-5-4-1 Timely decisions must be made.
34-5-5 The decision of the Selection Committee shall not be grievable, unless the decision is arbitrary or capricious or the abovementioned process was not followed.
34-5-6 The District and the Association shall mutually agree upon a training program to be offered to selection committees.
34-5-7 For serving on the Selection Committee, teachers will be provided with some type of compensation, such as, time off, a financial stipend, and/or relief from other duties.
34-5-8 Teachers shall not be required to use personal leave or have other staff members cover classes in order to be interviewed or to participate as a member of a selection committee.
34-5-9 Voluntary transfer of probationary and temporary teachers can only occur if the teacher meets or exceeds standards in all

Jeffco Schools: JCEA Negotiated Agreement	Page 3 of 6
four (4) performance areas on his/her last evaluation.
34-5-10 Teachers who have secured a voluntary transfer in accordance with the above-outlined provisions may decline the transfer until such time as the position they vacated has been advertised.
34-5-11 All advertised open positions shall be filled by June 30 and the results reported to Human Resources on or about June 30.
34-5-12 Open teaching positions may be advertised with Schedule I, Additional Performance Positions included in the job description. Such positions will not be filled by involuntary transferees unless qualified and acceptable.
34-6 Involuntary Teacher Transfer
34-6-1 After consultation with the staff, the building administrator will identify the organizational pattern of the school, listing its departments, grade levels or teams. Such identification of organizational patterns should be communicated in writing to the school staff during the month of October. Teachers who teach in more than one (1) department, grade level, or team will, for the purpose of declaring potential involuntary transferees, be assigned by the building administrator to a department, grade level or team. Such assignments shall be made for valid educational reasons.
34-6-2 No later than February 1 of each year, all schools will have determined, with their area administrator, the projected number of positions authorized, including the number of staff vacancies or surplus. Teachers who have been identified as potential involuntary transferees will be advised by March 15 each year of this possible transfer. Should the projected number of positions be reduced after that date, any additional potential involuntary transferees shall be notified as soon as possible.
34-6-2-1 If, during the fall of the subsequent school year, a school is determined by the area administrator to be overstaffed, the building administrator will identify potential involuntary transferees, using the previous school year’s organizational pattern.
34-6-3 Teachers may be involuntarily transferred under the following conditions:
A.	Where reduction in student enrollment makes such transfer necessary.
B.	To accommodate paid leave returnees.
C.	To fill assignments which cannot be accommodated by the existing staff.
D.	Effective September 1, 1989, teachers holding Schedule I positions may be subject to involuntary transfer if they resign from their additional performance responsibilities within three (3) years of their initial employment, provided no individual within the building is qualified and willing to fulfill said additional performance assignment, or no other teaching position is open to which the additional performance assignment could be linked.
1.	This provision (34-6-3-D) shall only apply to teachers whose original hiring or transfer included one (1) or more of the aforementioned additional performance responsibilities as a part of their teaching assignment.
2.	This provision (34-6-3-D) shall not apply to teachers assigned to one (1) or more of the aforementioned additional performance responsibilities prior to September 1,1989.
E.	To accommodate administrative transfers:
1.	The teacher and the Association will be advised of potential administrative transfers, and if, in the view of the Association, the reasons for the administrative transfer are not justified, the Association may refer the matter to the grievance procedure.
34-6-4 Teachers identified as potential involuntary transferees will be identified in the following manner:
A.	The department, grade level or team which has the surplus will be identified.
B.	In the following provisions, length of service in the District shall be as defined in Section 1-9, Full-time Continuous Service.
C.	The teachers within the identified grade level, department, or team will attempt to arrive at a mutually-acceptable identification. If the teachers cannot agree, the teacher with the greatest length of service in the District will be given first option to involuntarily transfer. If this teacher is not interested in the transfer, the transfer will be offered to the teacher with the next greatest length of service in the District, etc. If no teacher desires to fill the position, the teacher with the least length of service in the District will be identified as the potential involuntary

transferee, unless, by the transferring of the teacher with the least length of service in the District, the school or, in the case of SERS personnel, the area, is unable to meet identified instructional needs within the grade level, department or team.
D.	In instances where declining enrollment causes teaching positions within a building, or, in the case of SERS personnel, within an area, to be combined, the teachers involved who are qualified to meet the identified instructional needs will attempt to arrive at a mutually-acceptable identification of who will fill the respective positions. If the teachers cannot agree, the teacher with the greatest length of service in the District will be given his/her choice of the remaining position(s) or of being identified as a potential involuntary transferee. If, after the teacher with the greatest length of service has made his/her choice, open positions still remain, the teacher with the next greatest length of service in the District will be offered his/her choice of the remaining position(s), etc. The aforementioned process shall be followed going from the most senior to the least senior teacher, until no positions remain. In the case where none of the teachers involved are interested in the remaining positions, said positions shall be awarded to the teacher(s) with the least length of service in the District.
E.	In instances where declining enrollment in separate buildings (school locations) causes the combining of teaching positions, which would result in the elimination of teaching position(s), the teachers involved who are qualified to meet the identified instructional needs will attempt to arrive at a mutually-acceptable identification of who will fill the respective position(s). If the teachers cannot agree, the teacher with the greatest length of service in the District will be given his/her choice of the remaining position(s) or of being identified as a potential involuntary transferee. If, after the teacher with the greatest length of service has made his/her choice, open position(s) still remain, the teacher with the next greatest length of service in the District will be offered his/her choice of the remaining position(s), etc. The aforementioned process shall be followed going from the most senior to the least senior teacher until no positions remain. In the case where none of the teachers involved are interested in the remaining positions, said positions shall be awarded to the teacher(s) with the least length of service in the District.
F.	In instances where teachers are assigned to more than one (1) school (split assignments), the principal of the home school or his/her building level administrator shall identify for said teachers their home schools within thirty (30) calendar days of the beginning of the teacher’s work year. The teacher shall be considered a staff member of the identified school and shall be given all the rights and privileges accorded thereto, including intra-building reassignment.
G.	In instances where split school assignments have been re-paired and where the newly-paired schools have been identified as home schools for the teachers involved in the split assignments, the teachers involved shall attempt to arrive at a mutually-acceptable identification of who will fill the respective positions. If the teachers cannot agree, the teacher with the greatest length of service in the District shall be placed in the position of his/her choice.

Leaves of Absence
Page 1 of 8
35-1 Sick Leave
35-1-1 The District will grant sick leave to all teachers for personal illness or serious illness in the immediate family.
35-1-1-1 Teachers whose work year is one hundred eighty-five (185) days will be granted nine (9) days of leave per year.
35-1-1-2 Teachers whose work year exceeds one hundred eighty-five (185) days will be granted one (1) additional day of leave for each additional twenty (20) days, or major portion thereof.
35-1-1-3 Annual sick leave advancement will be available as of the first official day of the school year or the first official day of employment, whichever shall occur first. Advancement shall be the equivalent of one (1) day per month, or major fraction thereof, provided the first official day of employment occurs on or before the 15th of the month.
35-1-1-4 Sick leave shall be cumulative without limit from year to year.
35-1 -1 -5 A teacher returning from paid sick leave, not exceeding one year, will return to his/her former or comparable position at the same school.
35-2 Additional Sick Leave
35-2-1 The purpose of additional sick leave coverage beyond a teacher’s accrued balance is to provide the teacher with additional sick leave coverage in the event an illness occurs. Additional sick leave is restricted to the illness of the teacher.
35-2-2 An illness of five (5) days or less:
35-2-2-1 A teacher who experiences an illness of five (5) or fewer days and does not have the number of accrued sick leave days to cover the illness shall be automatically advanced up to the number of days necessary. This advancement shall not exceed five (5) days during one (1) academic work year to supplement his/her accrued balance of sick leave to provide paid coverage during the period of ill-ness.
Employee’s Accrued Sick Leave Balance	District’s Advancement
Odays	5 days
1 day	4 days
2 days	3 days
3 days	2 days
4 days	1 day
5 days	0 days
35-2-2-2 Such days shall be reimbursed to the District from the teacher’s new beginning accrued sick leave balance in the next academic school year commencing on September 1 (For the purposes of this provision, the aca-demic year is defined as that period of time from approximately September 1, continuing through the school year.)
35-2-3 An illness of six (6) or more consecutive work-ing days:
35-2-3-1 A teacher who experiences a prolonged illness (an illness of six (6) or more consecutive working days) and who has exhausted or anticipates exhausting his/her accrued sick leave balance, as verified by his/her licensed physician’s statement, shall be granted Extended Sick Leave coverage as follows:
A.	The teacher must submit two (2) written documents to the Assistant
Superintendent of Human Resources or his/her designee.
http://jeffcoweb.jeffco.kl2.co.us/emprelations/jcea/article_35.html
2/5/04
Page 2 of 8
Jeffco Schools: JCEA Negotiated Agreement
1.	A written request from the teacher for Extended Sick Leave coverage, stating the reason or the name of the illness and the anticipated date for returning to work.
2.	A written statement from a licensed physician verifying that the teacher is under the physician’s care for the particular illness and the physician’s recommendation for the teacher’s recovery period, subject to the provisions outlined in Section 35-3.
B.	The number of Extended Sick Leave days that a teacher may accrue shall be determined by the number of years of service to the Jefferson County Public Schools multiplied by nine (9). Based on this formula, a teacher accrues eligibility for Extended Sick Leave. For example: Fifteen (15) years of service to the District times nine (9) days per year accrual of Extended Sick Leave days equals one hundred thirty five (135) days of eligibility.
C.	No teacher shall be eligible for more than a total of sixty (60) days of Extended Sick Leave coverage per related illness unless the teacher has applied for, or is on the waiting list for, Long-Term Disability, in which case the teacher will be granted up to ninety (90) days. In the event the teacher is eli-gible to receive Long-Term Disa-bility coverage prior to the 90th day, the teacher will be imme-diately placed on Long-Term Disa-bility.
D.	Teachers returning to work before the expiration of Extended Sick Leave days granted them must notify the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources or his/her designee. The balance of their eligibility status will be changed to credit them with the unused portion of Extended Sick Leave days for future use. Example: A teacher who has fif-teen (15) years of service with the District has a one-hundredthirty-five (135) day eligibil-ity for Extended Sick Leave. The physician’s statement anticipates hospitalization for an illness of fifty (50) consecutive working days, and the teacher makes application for use of Extended Sick Leave, which is approved. However, the teacher returns to his/her assignment after forty-five (45) consecutive working days and notifies the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources or his/her designee of his/her early return to work. The teacher’s Extended Sick Leave record is changed to reflect the following:
135 (days of ESL eligibility)
-50 (to be effective from_____to______)
85 date date___
+5 (teacher returned early on______)
90 (days of ESL eligibility as of mo./day/yr.) = status.
E. Accrued sick leave and Extended Sick Leave shall not be accruable while a teacher is taking sick leave or Extended Sick Leave. Accrual begins again when the teacher returns to work.
35-2-3-2 Such Extended Sick Leave days shall not be deducted from future accrued sick leave.
35-2-3-3 A teacher’s request for Extended Sick Leave will be considered only if the teacher has made application for, and is eligible to receive, use of Extended Sick Leave days within thirty (30) calendar days from the time the teacher initially became ill or anticipated need for additional sick leave coverage.
An example of anticipated need would be knowledge of scheduled surgery and recovery period for which the teacher did not have enough accrued sick leave to cover the illness in ques-tion.
35-2-3-4 When Long-Term Disability Insurance applies:
When a teacher applies for, and is eligible to receive, Long-Term Disa-bility Insurance coverage, that teacher may utilize available accrued sick leave to carry the teacher’s regular salary until the Long-Term Disability coverage would apply. If the teacher still has a balance of accrued sick leave days at the time the Long-Term Disability Insurance becomes effective, the unused portion of accrued sick leave will be reserved for future use, after the teacher returns to work from using Long-Term Disability Insurance.
There is a one hundred twenty (120) calendar day waiting period from the time application is made until Long-Term Disability Insurance becomes effective. If the teacher does not have enough
http://jeffcoweb.jeffco.kl2.co.us/emprelations/jcea/article_35.html
2/5/04
Jeffco Schools: JCEA Negotiated Agreement	Page 3 of 8
accrued sick leave to cover the illness during this waiting period, the teacher may apply for Extended Sick Leave coverage, and, if eligible, will be granted up to a maximum of sixty (60) days of Extended Sick Leave, depending upon the individual teacher’s eligibility to draw from Extended Sick Leave, in order to provide the teacher with regular salary during the illness, except as provided in Section 35-2-3-1 -(C.).
35-2-3-5 A teacher returning from paid sick leave, not exceeding one year, will return to his/her former or compara-ble position at the same school.
35-3 Verification of Illness
Upon notice to a teacher, the teacher shall be required to furnish proof of illness, proof of fitness to return to duty, or proof of fitness to continue to perform duty, as verified by a written statement from a licensed physician. If deemed necessary by the District, the teacher may be required to be examined by a physician designated by the District, at District expense. If a difference of opinion exists between the two (2) physicians, a third physician may be designated, at District expense, to render an opin-ion.
35-4 Personal Leave
35-4-1 Teachers will be entitled to two (2) days leave of absence without loss of pay each school year. Notice to the teacher’s principal or other immediate super-visor that personal leave is to be taken will be given at least one (1) day before taking such leave (except in cases of emergencies).
35-4-2 Teachers shall be allowed to accumulate unused personal leave from year to year and will be apprised of such accumulation.
35-4-3 A teacher will be paid for accumulated personal leave days, upon retirement, at the same rate as sick leave reimbursement; or the teacher may use accumulated personal leave as outlined in Sections 35-42-3-1 and 35-4-3-2.
35-4-3-1 Teachers may use one (1) or two (2) accumulated personal leave days in accord-ance with the provisions of Section 354-1.
35-4-3-2 With prior approval of the immediate supervisor, more than two (2) accumu-lated personal leave days may be used at any one time. Written requests for leave must be submitted to the immediate supervisor at least five (5) days before taking such leave, except in cases of emergency. The written request must provide information justifying the circumstances which merit consideration for the granting of said leave.
35-5 Professional Leave
35-5-1 Teachers who are designated as official representatives by the Association shall submit a short leave form to their principal for the purpose of attending JCEA, CEA and NEA functions. Applications must be made at least five (5) school days in advance of the time required, except in cases of emergencies.
35-5-2 A total of two hundred seventy-five (275) release days per calendar year for professional leave will be authorized by the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources or his/her designee. Should there be a conflict in providing such leave due to school matters, the Association will be advised, in order to select a replacement. In the event of any such problems, Teacher Employment Administrator or his/her designee shall render the final decision.
35-6 Bereavement Leave
35-6-1 Permanent teachers will be granted up to five (5) days’ bereavement leave, which may be deducted from either personal leave or accrued sick leave, in the event of death of any member of the immediate family. The teacher involved will determine whether the days are deducted from personal or sick leave.
35-6-1-1 If there are extenuating circumstances, i.e., extended out of state or foreign travel, or other unavoidable circumstances, more than five (5) days of bereavement leave will be granted. In such instances, the leave will be deducted from personal or accrued sick leave. If such leaves are exhausted, the teacher will reimburse the District at the substitute rate of pay for the days used. This reimbursement will be made even if no substitute is required.
35-6-2 Members of the immediate family are defined as follows:
a.	Brother

35-7-11 The teacher on sabbatical leave retains all tenure rights.
35-7-12 An interruption in the program for sabbatical leave because of serious accident or illness will not be considered a failure to fulfill the conditions upon which the sabbatical leave was granted, nor will such interruption affect the amount of compensation to be paid the teacher under the terms of the leave agreement, provided that the authorities have been promptly notified of such accident or illness.

35-10 Maternity/Child Care Leave.
It is the intent of both the District and the Association to be in compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act. In accordance with this intent we have agreed upon the following language, specifically Article 35-10-2.
35-10-1 A teacher shall be entitled, upon written re-quest, to an unpaid leave for maternity/child care, prior to or following the birth of a child or upon adoption of a child (not to exceed kin-dergarten age). Said teacher shall notify the Human Resources division of his/her desire to take such leave, and except in cases of emergency, shall give notice thirty (30) calendar days prior to the anticipated commence-ment of the leave. The teacher will make a decision to take a leave for maternity/child care for a predetermined period of time, pro-vided that such leave does not exceed two (2) years.
35-10-2 The teacher’s written request will include the teacher’s date of return, which must be the first reporting day of any quarter, term, trimester, or semester as determined by the District. If the teacher’s return from leave is not until the first reporting day as stated above, the period of time from the end of the teacher’s requested leave until the first reporting day will be in compliance with the FMLA.*
*Note: Specifically the FMLA specifies that a school district has the discretion of not allowing a teacher to return from an approved leave until a "natural break." However, the school district cannot count the time period between the teacher’s requested return date and the "natural break." as FMLA leave nor can the school district refuse to provide benefits the teacher was otherwise entitled to during such time. The proposed language allows for FMLA compliance and does not have to be changed if the FMLA changes.
35-10-3 All maternity/child care leave identified above shall be without pay, except that the teacher may use sick leave during that period of time a teacher is actually disabled. However, no maternity/child care leave may commence later than thirty (30) calendar days from the birth of a child, unless the teacher’s disability exceeds thirty (30) calendar days, in which case the teacher shall be required to furnish proof of illness, as identified in Section 34-3. In the case of adoption, no leave may commence later than the adoption of the child.
35-10-4 A teacher who requests and is granted maternity/child care leave will be returned to his/her former or comparable position at the same school, if the leave is for two (2) academic years or less, provided the limitations on leaves as specified in 35-13 are not exceeded
35-10-4-1 A teacher on maternity/child care leave will be considered as a member of the staff of the school/SERS area from which he/she was assigned prior to the leave for such matters as determining involuntary transferees, etc.
35-10-5 A teacher who requests to amend his/her initial leave shall submit, in writing, his/her request to the District’s Human Resources division not less than thirty (30) days prior to the teacher’s original date of return.
35-10-5-1 The teacher’s request to extend leave will be considered as follows:
A.	Each individual request will be judged on its own merits.
B.	A teacher who is granted his/her request for an extension is not guaranteed the same position held at the time of leaving. The teacher’s return will be based on the availability of jobs for which the teacher is qualified. In any event, the District shall not be compelled to return said teacher to a position prior to the beginning of a school year.
35-10-5-2 A teacher taking maternity/child care leave, who, for a justified reason, desires to return to work prior to the end of his/her leave shall so notify the District’s Human Resources division. The teacher shall be assigned to the first available position for which the teacher is qualified. If the teacher refuses the available posi-tion, the teacher will remain on leave for the balance of his/her agreed leave. If more than one (1) teacher has given notice pursuant to this paragraph, such teachers shall be returned to work in order of the date on which notice of desire to return to work was given to the Human Resources division. In any event, the District shall not be compelled to
http://jeffcoweb.jeffco.kl2.co.us/emprelations/jcea/article__35.html
2/5/04

Jeffco Schools: JCEA Negotiated Agreement
return said teachers to positions prior to the beginning of a school year.
35-10-6 While on leave, if not otherwise provided for, a teacher will have the option to remain an active participant in fringe benefit program(s) by con-tributing thereto the full cost of the pro-gram(s).
35-10-7 Fringe benefits shall be computed at a per diem rate based on the number of contract days a teacher works during a school year.
35-10-8 No leave referred to in this section shall be considered an interruption of services, nor shall it be included in computing the probation-ary period, nor toward experience increments on the salary schedule.
35-11 Other Leaves of Absence.
35-11-1 Full-time licensed teachers may apply for a leave of absence after having gained non-probationary status. Exceptions may be made with the approval of the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources or his/her designee.
35-11 -2 Teachers will be granted leaves of absence with-out pay for one (1) full academic year, provided that the purpose of such leave does not include another paid teaching position. This provision shall not prohibit a teacher from accepting a fellowship which may result in a simultaneous paid teaching position, and it shall not prohibit exchange teaching.
35-11 -3 Requests for leaves of absence of one (1) academic year are to be presented, in writing, to the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources or his/her designee by March 1.
35-11 -4 A teacher may apply for a second leave of absence beyond the initial academic year by submitting a written request to the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources or his/her designee by April 1. Such request for a second academic year shall be granted unless the identified instructional needs of the District cannot be met.

Reduction in Force
39-1 Definitions
39-1-1 "Teacher" for the purpose of this Article shall mean any person who is regularly licensed by the teacher licensing authority for the State of Colorado, and who is employed full-time by the District, except those persons holding letters of authorization and the Chief Administra-tive Officer of the District.
39-1-2 "Cancellation of employment" shall mean the ter-mination of employment of a teacher when there is a justifiable reduction in the number of teaching positions in the District.
39-1-3 "Layoff" shall mean a removal from active ser-vice to the District because of a reduction of teacher(s).
39-1-4 "Full-time Continuous Service" for the purpose of this Article shall mean the length of ser-vice as a contracted teacher of the District and shall be computed from the employee’s first year of employment. Time spent on sabbatical leaves shall be credited toward continuous service. Continuous service shall not be interrupted by approved leaves of absence, resignation, or ter-mination followed by rehiring within thirty-nine (39) months. However, such period of time dur-ing such leaves of absence or after termination or resignation, and prior to rehire, shall not be credited as continuous service.
39-1-5 "Recall status” shall mean that period of time that the teacher is on unpaid leave prior to being returned to work.
39-1-6 “Recall” shall mean notification of, and return to, active service in the District of a teacher(s) on layoff status.
39-2 Any reduction in the number of teaching positions in the District shall be in accordance with Colorado Statutes then in effect.
39-3 If the Board determines that teachers should be laid off (cancellation of employment) by reason of financial neces-sity, declining enrollment, or for other reasons justify-ing a decrease in the number of teaching positions, the District will institute the procedure described hereafter. This procedure shall apply equally to all teachers defined in Section 39-1-1.
39-4 Reduction in Force Conditions
39-4-1 Before District representatives recommend a reduction in force to the Board, the Association will be notified of the conditions necessitating the reduction. If possible, said notification will be given by November 1 prior to a semester layoff, or by March 1 of the school year preced-ing an anticipated end-of-the-year layoff. With such notification, the Superintendent or his/her designee will furnish the Association with rele-vant data necessitating the cancellation of employment contracts. Layoffs will only occur at the end of a semester or academic year.
39-4-2 Within five (5) school days of said notifica-tion, representatives of the District and the Association will meet to discuss the reduction in force. Discussions will include, but not be limited to, the following:
A.	Alternatives to a reduction in force.
B.	The needs of the District.
C.	Budget information.
D.	Effective date of the reduction in force.
E.	Number of teachers affected within each pro-gram, i.e., level (elementary or secondary), subject area, SERS, and/or teachers of the handicapped.
F.	Other relevant matters.
39-4-3 Before implementation of a layoff of teachers, the District will utilize attrition (i.e., vol-untary retirement, resignations, termination of temporary contracted teachers, termination of part-time teachers, and the number of teachers who will be on leave) as the first means of reducing staff.
39-5 Implementation of Layoff
If a layoff is still necessary following the fulfillment of the aforementioned provisions (39-4), the District will consider the
http://jeffcoweb.jeffco.kl2.co.us/emprelations/jcea/article_39.html	2/5/04
Jeffco Schools: JCEA Negotiated Agreement	Page 2 of 3
instructional needs of the District, area(s) of licensure endorsement, qualifications as defined in 39-6-1-2, and previous District experience in the teaching field. The cancellation of employment will occur in the following order:
A.	First year of employment.
B.	Second year of employment.
C.	Third year of employment.
D.	Non-probationary.
39-6 In the implementation of a layoff as identified in 39-5, the following will occur:
39-6-1 The District will provide those teachers affected and the Association with a Full-time Continuous Service List. Any objection to the placement on the list shall be reported to the Association and the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources or his/her designee within ten (10) school days after receipt of said list. After consideration of factors identified in Section 39-5, selection of teacher(s) to be reduced shall be made as follows:
39-6-1-1 Teacher(s) with the least length of continuous service in the program affected in the District will be laid off first.
A.	In the event two (2) or more teachers have the same length of service in the District, the teachers affected will be ranked on the Full-time Continuous Service List as to when they signed their employment contract with the District.
B.	In the event ties still exist, teacher(s) so affected shall participate in a drawing by lot to determine position on the Full-time Continuous Service List. The Association and all teachers so affected shall be notified in writing of the date, time and place of the drawing and shall have an opportunity to attend.
39-6-1-2 Upon written request of the teacher(s) identified for reduction, the District shall investigate assignments in other programs for which the teacher(s) is licensed and qualified to teach. Under this article, a teacher shall be deemed to be licensed and qualified to render a teaching service if he/she meets any one (1) of the following:
A.	Has the appropriate licensure and endorsement; or
B.	Has the proper courses to meet accreditation standards; or for those teachers hired after 2003, meet the State definition of highly qualified by 2006.
C.	Can successfully complete the training requirement in order to fulfill the job responsibilities prior to the beginning of the assignment.
Exceptions to the above may be made only when the District can substantiate that by reassigning the teacher(s) identified for reduction it will be unable to meet the identified instructional needs of the school or department affected.
39-6-1-3 If the length of continuous service in the District, licensure and qualifications entitle teachers to be reassigned to other positions, the following shall apply:
A.	They shall be assigned to open positions.
B.	If open positions are not availa-ble, teachers with less continu-ous service in the District shall be reduced to achieve sufficient open positions.
39-7 Should transfer of retained teachers be necessary as a result of a layoff, the provisions of Article 34 shall apply.
39-8 The District will make every effort to provide written no-tification to the teacher(s) affected at least forty-five (45) days prior to the date the Board takes official action. The Association and each teacher involved shall be provided a copy of the notice. The teacher’s address, as it appears on the School District’s records, shall be deemed to be the correct address. After the Board takes official action, all teachers laid off shall receive a written layoff notice from the District.
39-9 Review of Individual Cancellation.
39-9-1 Within fourteen (14) days of receiving the lay-off notice, a teacher may request a review of the action by the Board of Education. If the teacher so requests, the Board and the Associa-tion, through their representatives, shall select an impartial hearing officer from avail-able sources to conduct a hearing. In the event that the parties are unable to agree upon a hearing officer, said hearing officer shall be selected as per Sections 5-5-1-1, 5-5-1-2, and 5-5-1-3 of this Agreement. When appropriate, more than one (1) case may be heard at the same time.

39-9-2 The request for review must specify the grounds on which it is contended that the decision was improper under this Article. This provision shall not prohibit the hearing officer from allowing additional grounds to be argued, should new facts and/or information warrant considera-tion.
39-9-3 The Board shall consider the request and shall schedule a hearing to be held within fourteen (14) days after the request is received. The teacher(s) shall be given seven (7) days notice of the hearing.

39-9-5 The hearing shall be limited to those grounds specified in the request for a hearing and supported by such proof as is offered, provided a hearing officer may consider additional argu-ments and facts as specified in Section 39-9-2. A decision shall be made within fifteen (15) days following completion of the hearing.
39-9-6 The hearing officer will make written findings and recommendations to the Board and the teacher. The cost of the hearing officer shall be borne by the District.
39-9-7 The Board will take final action on the findings and recommendations at its next regular meeting.
39-9-8 This procedure is the only procedure that may be used in a reduction in force under this Agree-ment.

Job Sharing
41-1 For the purpose of this Agreement, job sharing shall mean the occupation of a single staff position by two (2) non-probationary teachers, with each assignment being half-time each day for the entire contractual work year. Job sharing is not a fringe benefit. The principal or immediate supervisor and the job sharing teachers (team) may agree to a work schedule allowing the teachers to work every other day or a variation thereof in order to better meet educational needs. However, a job sharing teacher may not work a prolonged period of time with a like amount of time off, such as, one quarter on, and one quarter off; or one (1) semester on, one (1) semester off. In all arrangements, each teacher must work each week. In the case of secondary school assignments, where sharing a teaching position in the same manner each day would lead to an unbalanced workload, teaching schedules shall be arranged in a manner as to provide for an equal workload between the participants during the course of the school year. Temporary teachers and first and second year probationary teachers are not eligible to apply for job sharing. Third year probationary teachers may apply for job sharing if the teacher meets or exceeds standards in all four (4) performance areas.
41-2 Non-probationary teachers who so choose may agree to share one job position for a period of time not less than one (1) year. A team may renew its job sharing position for additional year(s) or the teacher may select a new teammate and reapply.
A teacher returning from a job sharing position after one (1) or two (2) year(s) will be returned to his/her former or comparable position at the same school or in the same Cluster area.
41-3 Teachers job sharing a position beyond two (2) consecutive years will be co-owners of the position. Anytime after two (2) years, a job sharing teacher could notify the District and the respective parties of his/her desire to return to full-time teaching and/or to terminate the job sharing arrangement. The job sharing partners would attempt to arrive at a mutually agreeable solution as to which teacher stays in the current job sharing position, and which teacher would be an unassigned leave returnee, as per Article 34-7. If the job sharing teachers cannot agree, the teacher with the greatest length of continuous service shall be given his/her choice of staying in the current position or being an unassigned leave returnee, as per Article 34-7.
A teacher job sharing beyond two (2) years will have his/her job protected only if he/she is job sharing his/her own position with a teacher who has one (1), two (2), or three (3) years of job sharing experience, otherwise the aforementioned provisions of this section shall apply.
41-4 If one (1) teacher in a job sharing situation has an illness or takes a short leave of absence, the other teacher may agree to teach full-time during said leave at the substitute rate or other mutually agreed upon arrangement.
41-5 Any such job sharing and/or renewal shall be voluntary and mutually agreed upon, in writing, by the teachers and principals or immediate supervisors involved, as well as the District and JCEA. A teacher desiring to job share should approach his/her principal or supervisor for preliminary approval prior to seeking a job-sharing partner.
41-6 Teachers interested in job sharing shall be responsible for identifying teachers who would be willing to job share with them. Teachers agreeing to job share shall submit a completed application form to the Human Resources division with a copy to JCEA. The Human Resources division shall be responsible for determining job sharing eligibility.
41-7 All agreements for job sharing and/or renewal must be made prior to February 15th.
41-8 Both teachers of a job sharing team must be licensed and qualified for the shared job position.
41-9 Service credit for PERA will be counted in accordance with PERA policy.
41-10 Participants in job sharing agree to half-time teacher status at half their annual salary, as determined by their positions on the adopted salary schedule as a full-time teacher at the time they begin the job sharing assignment.
41-11 Continuous full-time service will accrue for a teacher in a shared time position on a pro rata basis.
41 -12 In determining the placement of a job sharing team, the teachers involved will attempt to arrive at a mutually acceptable decision. If the teachers cannot agree, the teacher with the greatest length of service in the District will make the determination about which position to fill. Said determination must be approved by the principal.
41-13 After consultation with the participants, the teaching schedule will be determined by the administrator(s) who will have supervisory responsibility for the team under this Article.
41-13-1 If requested, both teachers will attend required faculty meetings.
41-13-2 As needed, teachers will participate in scheduled parent conferences, as required of all other full-time teachers.
41-13-3 Teachers must share equally the responsibility in meeting identified building or position needs, provided the workload for a job sharing team shall not be greater than the equivalent of one (1) full-time teaching position.

41-16 Vacancies created by teachers forming a job sharing team shall be filled on an interim basis.
41-17 Job sharing shall not be used as a means of reducing the work force.

44-5-2 Teachers new to the District will be given one (1) experience step (as defined in Section 44-5) for each year of teaching experience outside the District, to a maximum of seven (7) years; the District may grant up to an additional three (3) years of experience, as determined by 44-5, at its discretion. This language is effective starting the 2001-02 school year and is not retroactive to previous years.

Long-term substitute positions are not subject to this provision.
44-5-3 Beginning September 1,2003, and each successive September, one (1) experience step will be given to full-time teachers who were under contract and/or continuous, uninterrupted assignment in the District for ninety (90) days or a semester.

MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING:
Goals For Elementary Visual Arts, Music And Physical Education Teachers
Regarding Special Education and Related Services
Co-Operative Decision Making (CDM)
Goals For Elementary Visual Arts, Music And Physical Education Teachers
« Back to top
The Jefferson County Public Schools and Association are committed to retain and support the visual arts, music and physical education teacher concept at the elementary level. Teachers in the instructional areas of visual art, music, and physical education are provided because they:
1.	have proven educational expertise in their fields;
2.	provide quality experiences in the subject areas meeting student, District, and community expectations;
3.	take best advantage of the instructional time available in these subject areas to provide quality experiential learning;
4.	encourage students’ creative and aesthetic growth;
5.	provide students with safe and proper activities for physical and skill development;
6.	and provide expertise in the safe handling and utilization of various types of equipment, instruments, tools, mediums, and materials available in the programs.
The regular classroom teacher, normally, does not have the educational background or interest in these areas sufficient to carry out the sophisticated programs in place in Jefferson County Public Schools.
The purpose of these goals is to establish standards for the assignment of elementary visual arts, music and physical education teachers. These goals strive for equity throughout the District regarding teaching loads, frequency of class contact, and length of contact sessions to meet the standards of Board policy relative to the instructional day.
These goals are to be utilized by area administrators and principals as goals for elementary visual arts, music and physical education program implementation effective August, 1995. In the event that an unexpected increase in pupil enrollment or a lack of facilities dictates that these goals cannot be honored, area administrators and principals will take note and initiate adjustments as soon as educationally feasible.
1.	Insofar as possible, the goals will be to assign eighteen (18) sections per teacher. *Note: Class size relief may be applied for if the number of sections exceeds nineteen (19).
2.	To the extent possible, class size of the visual arts, music and physical education teacher should be consistent with the teaching load of a classroom teacher within the building.
3.	Special education students who are mainstreamed into visual art, music, and physical education should be integrated in a manner consistent with the regular classroom. When it is most appropriate educationally to maintain a group of special education students as a separate class in visual arts, music, and physical education, this group shall be counted as a section for the visual arts, music and physical education teachers.
4.	There should be time allowed for travel between schools as determined by the principal and area administrator.
5.	Expectations for special programs are identified in Key Features documents and other program materials.
When visual arts, music and physical education teachers are assigned to two (2) schools, adjustments are needed regarding expectations for performances, exhibits, and other identified program, as well as time to travel, set up, put away and plan, in order to meet instructional needs at each site. The yearly school calendars should be coordinated in a meeting of the principals and the visual arts, music and physical education teachers involved.

Co-Operative Decision Making (CDM)
« Back to top
In order to assure successful implementation of the Co-operative Decision Making (CDM) process, the District and the JCEA agree to incorporate the CDM Task Force report into this Memorandum of Understanding. Further, the parties agree to the following:
1.	Building CDM committees will develop norms which provide a safe environment for all stakeholders and encourage their full participation
http://jeffcoweb.jeffco.kl2.co.us/emprelations/jcea/appendix_3.html
2/5/04
Jeffco Schools: JCEA Negotiated Agreement	Page 2 of 7
in the CDM process.
2.	The building CDM Committee will operate separately from the building Liaison Committee, as provided for in Article 20.
3.	Funding for training will be made available in an amount to be determined on an annual basis in conjunction with the budget development process.
Full report follows.
CO-OPERATIVE DECISION MAKING
I.	INTRODUCTION
The concept of shared decision-making was first explored in January, 1990, as an avenue to involve stakeholders and make better decisions in the District. A task force of representatives of the employee associations, PTA and the District sponsored three District-wide conversations for school employees and community members to create an action plan for shared decision-making in Jeffco. In August, 1991, the Board of Education adopted the Co-Operative Decision-Making Statement of Beliefs which states in part, “There is an expectation that schools and departments in the District will use a co-operative decision-making process whenever appropriate.”
A broad-based task force worked for two years to identify common ingredients of successful models; determine unresolved issues; learn about needs and resources; and make recommendations based on seventy-eight (78) site interviews throughout the District.
In May, 1993, a Memorandum of Understanding between the Board of Education and JCEA created a charge to the Co-Operative DecisionMaking Task Force. The charge was: define co-operative decision-making; clarify the scope and authority of decision making at work sites; determine training needed; and develop a transition process and models, and a proposed time line for implementation.
This document represents the work of the Task Force in fulfilling that charge. It is expected that all schools and work sites will have a functioning structure for co-operative decision-making by September, 1996.
Students and their proficiencies are the primary focus of all co-operative decisions made at each work site and serve as the foundation for a student-centered vision.
Co-operative decision-making works best in a context which ensures broad-based representation of primary clients including: students, parents, employees and the community. Other participants can be included in the process, as the need requires.
Each school’s Accountability Plan and each work site’s goals and objectives will reflect a student-centered vision. These will provide the necessary framework for effective implementation of a District-wide, student-centered quality program. It is expected that all decisions made are in compliance with Federal and State regulations, employee agreements, and District policies and procedures.
The co-operative decision-making process is flexible enough to ensure effective responses to varying situations and needs. Collaboration which seeks consensus enhances the potential for successful implementation of decisions. The co-operative decision-making process will look different at the various work sites. A collaborative process will be used to determine: 1) which decisions will be collaborative, consultative or command at a given work site; 2) which decision-making methods will be used; 3) in which areas of scope and authority co-operative decisionmaking will occur; and 4) what are the roles and responsibilities for implementation.
II.	DEFINITION
Co-Operative Decision-Making is a collaborative process that includes all of these elements:
•	A commonly held, student-centered vision.
•	A climate of trust.
•	A respect for diverse ideas and interests.
•	An open dialogue and debate.
•	A shared leadership, accountability, authority and responsibility.
•	An actively involved, broad-based representation of employees, parents, students and the community.
The goal of Co-Operative Decision-Making is to continuously improve education for the students in Jefferson County Public Schools.
III.	TYPES OF DECISIONS
CDM recognizes that there are different types of decisions:
•	Collaborative: Decisions made by stakeholders and/or representatives of stakeholder groups. Collaboration based on consensus ensures that all stakeholders will have a voice and will support the decisions.
•	Consultative: Decisions made by the designated individuals after consultation with stakeholders and/or representatives of stakeholder groups.
•	Command: Decisions made by the designated individuals without consultation with stakeholders and/or representatives of stakeholder groups.

Jeffco Schools: JCEA Negotiated Agreement	Page 3 of 7
IV.	SCOPE AND AUTHORITY
Scope and authority determine what types of decisions are made and how they are made. The impact of a school/department decisions on other parts of the organization must be considered. Therefore, co-operative decision-making teams need to select decisions within the context of approved employee contracts, adopted Board policies and existing federal, state and local laws. Decisions to be made may include, but are not limited to, the following examples.
Instruction: Suggestions for potential decisions include: Instructional models and strategies; student assessment and placement; learning resources, staff development and employee training; student awards and recognition; enrichment activities and exceptional students needs.
Allocation of Resources: Suggestions for potential decisions include: Interviewing, selecting and recognizing employees and volunteers; recruiting volunteers; budget development, expenditures and evaluation; grant writing and the use of community and volunteer resources.
Governance and Management: Suggestions for potential decisions include: Room assignments, facility management, support services, transportation, field trips, discipline plan, extra-curricular activities, student progress reporting procedures, scheduling, community relations and communications.
Requests from the site for variances and memoranda of understanding will be reviewed at both the work site and within the articulation areas, as well as by representatives of appropriate State agencies, Board of Education, District administration, employee organizations and community groups. A procedure has been established for seeking variances from the JCEA R-1 Master Agreement.
V.	STANDARDS FOR THE CO-OOPERATIVE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS
The following standards and questions are designed to assist in the establishment and ongoing assessment of your co-operative decisionmaking process: Schools/work sites are in various stages of development in their practice of CDM and may use these accordingly.
1.	The participants are broadly representative of the school community.
•	What procedures are you following that assure your membership is representative of your school/work site community
•	How will you assure that the membership selection process is fair and open
•	What is the process by which you replace members
•	How will you assure that each member has an equal voice
•	How will you assure ethnic diversity
2.	The process operates with written rules that are widely understood.
•	How does your governing document establish roles and responsibilities
•	What is the structure for your process
•	What is your plan for distributing your governing documents to your school/work site community
3.	The roles of the various decision-making groups are understood within the CDM process.
What decision-making groups exist at your school or work site
What is the relationship among decision-making groups at your school/work site
4.	The CDM process has a shared vision that focuses on improvement of student learning.
What is the shared vision around which your co-operative decision-making process is organized
In what way does your vision include improving the learning environment and education/services to all students
5.	The CDM process determines what decisions are made and how they are made.
What decisions will be made at the school/work site
What is your plan for collaboratively determining how decisions are made and the manner in which they will be communicated to members of your school/work site community
6.	Meetings are open and at convenient times.
What process will you use to assure that meetings are open and convenient to all
7.	The CDM process is communicated internally and externally.
How does your communication plan serve your internal and external communities
What plan do you have for producing, maintaining and distributing a written record of your process to your school/work site community
8.	The process is evaluated to determine its effectiveness.

Page 4 of 7
Jeffco Schools: JCEA Negotiated Agreement
What is your strategy for providing ongoing technical knowledge/training for each participant
10.	Assistance is utilized when needed.
What additional assistance does your school/work site require in order to help you establish or improve your co-operative decision-making process, e.g., consultation, concrete examples, technical assistance and training
VI. CDM IMPLEMENTATION
It is expected that all schools and work sites will have a functioning structure for co-operative decision-making by September, 1996. Some sites that already have co-operative decision-making structures in operation, and after self-evaluation, may move into step two of implementation. For those sites in the early stages of development, it is recommended that a facilitator be used to provide assistance in the development and ongoing evaluation of a successful co-operative decision-making process. Sites that do not have a co-operative decision-making process in place may use an existing group or groups to meet the co-operative decision-making standards. Ongoing training of all stakeholders is a critical and necessary component of successful co-operative decision-making.
The following steps detail a process for successful transition to co-operative decision-making at all schools and work sites:
Step One: Development of Site Co-Operative Decision-Making
1.	Conduct a self-assessment of critical attributes to determine readiness or effectiveness of operation using the questions in Section V., Standards for the Co-Operative Decision-Making Process.
2.	Prepare a school or site implementation program with defined time lines.
3.	Define a co-operative decision-making governance structure. To implement a Co-Operative Decision-Making process, sites may use existing committees, restructure existing committees, create a new entity, or any combination to meet the defined co-operative decisionmaking standards for their site.
4.	Adopt and implement a scope and authority model (who will decide what).
5.	Develop method for selecting CDM participants.
6.	Plan and provide training for key stakeholders.
Examples and detailed descriptions of how sites have used co-operative decision-making, appointed selected participants, and structured their process are described in the “Co-Operative Decision-Making Resource Book.” The Resource Book also includes samples of operating rules, process descriptions and membership structures of existing co-operative decision-making systems. Copies of the resource book will be available in conjunction with the self-assessment video that the Task Force will provide. (See page 7.)
Step Two: Implementation of Site CDM Plan
1.	Formalize goals and objectives.
2.	Continue training for stakeholders participating in the program.
3.	Revisit scope and authority model.
4.	Provide ongoing evaluation of program.
VII SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE
As the District moves toward the full implementation of a co-operative decision-making process, schools/work sites will require support to understand how this process can best meet the needs of the school/work site. To provide this support, a team of trained facilitators will be made available to assist these schools/work sites. District employees, parents and volunteers who have demonstrated an ability to provide positive leadership for the co-operative decision-making process will be recruited as facilitators.
In addition to support and assistance from trained facilitators, there will be a process review to assess the effectiveness of CDM on a Districtwide basis. A Coordinating Committee will be structured to provide this process review.
Site Evaluation
A critical first step in implementing co-operative decision-making in the District will be the identification of a CDM process at each school/work site. This report recommends providing support to participants of training and technical assistance. The Co-Operative Decision-Making (CDM) Task Force will produce an interactive video that will assist all schools/work sites in a self-assessment to determine where they are in the process and what needs to be done. After viewing the video and completing the self-assessment, schools/work sites will determine training needs and utilize their allocation from the CDM funds identified by the Board.
Schools and work sites will also receive a CDM Resource Book that will contain samples from other schools and districts, and a list of resources for assistance and support.
At the conclusion of each year, each school/site will be required to complete a form reporting on how assistance was used as well as the effectiveness of co-operative decision-making efforts. The form will ask for signatures of each participant serving at the school/site.
http://jeffcoweb.jeffco.kl2.co.us/emprelations/jcea/appendix_3.html
2/5/04
Jeffco Schools: JCEA Negotiated Agreement	Page 5 of 7
Support and Assistance by Local Facilitators
The District will create a Co-Operative Decision-Making Support Team by training volunteers who will be willing to assist sites on an “as-called” basis. Volunteers will include teachers, administrators, classified employees, parents, students and others who currently use co-operative decision-making at their site.
To create the pool of facilitators, the following organizations should be asked to solicit volunteers for this task. Following training, the names will be compiled for distribution to each school/site council:
Jefferson County Education Association.
Jefferson County Administrators Association.
Classified School Employees Association.
Student Councils.
Parent Teacher Association.
District Accountability Committee.
Volunteers/seniors active in the District.
District CDM Coordinating Committee
A Coordinating Committee will be created with two assigned responsibilities:
Review of site appeals.
District co-operative decision-making assessment.
The Coordinating Committee will meet a minimum of twice a year, mid-year and at the end of the school year, to evaluate progress in cooperative decision-making efforts throughout the District. To conduct this review, the Committee will use the data from the feedback provided by sites at the end of the year.
The second function proposed for the Coordinating Committee is to provide an appeals process for schools/sites. The Coordinating Committee should be composed of Board of Education appointees and representatives of JCEA, JCAA, CSEA District Accountability, Parent/Teacher/Student Associations, volunteers and community organizations.
When presented with an appeal, the Coordinating Committee, using the standards set for all schools/sites, will determine if the appeal is a cooperative decision-making issue. It is not the purpose of the Coordinating Committee to review site decisions, but to assist in assuring a cooperative process has taken place.
The Coordinating Committee members may be expected to gather appropriate data prior to convening meetings. Coordinating Committee meetings will be convened to review appeals, to collect information from all parties and to respond with suggestions for process improvement.
Co-operative decision-making is a process designed to encourage involvement for mutual benefit. It is the expectation of the Board of Education that the process be developed within each school and department. The purpose of the District Co-Operative Decision-Making Coordinating Committee is to assure that such a process is in place and to assist in facilitating the process where possible. The issues and procedures used in co-operative decision-making will always be within the limitations of Board of Education policies and procedures, negotiated agreements, and State laws.
