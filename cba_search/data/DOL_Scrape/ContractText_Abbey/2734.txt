Such time off with pay shall be subject to prior approval by the Grievance Representative's immediate supervisor; however, approval of such time off will not be withheld, if the Grievance Representative can be allowed such time off without interfering with, or unduly hampering, the operations of the unit to which the Grievance Representative is assigned.

(C)	If the employee is not represented by the Association, any adjustment of the grievance shall be consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Further, the Association shall be given reasonable opportunity to be present at any meeting called for the resolution of such grievance. An employee using this procedure in the processing of a grievance will be bound by the procedure established by the parties to the Agreement.

(B)	There shall be no reprisals against any of the participants in the procedures contained herein by reason of such participation.
(C)	The filing or pendency of any grievance under the provisions of this Article shall in no way operate to impede, delay or interfere with the right of the State to take the action complained of; subject, however, to the final disposition of the grievance.
(D)	The resolution of a grievance prior to its submission in writing at Step 2 shall not establish a precedent binding on either the Association or the State in other cases.
(E)	If a grievance meeting is held or requires reasonable travel time during the working hours of any required participant, such participant shall be excused without loss of pay for that purpose. Attendance at grievance meetings outside of regular working hours shall not be deemed time worked.

(b)	The parties may, by mutual agreement in writing, submit related grievances for hearing before the same arbitrator.

Compensation and any leave usage or credit shall be determined at the end of the 40-hour workweek for included employees and pay period for excluded employees on an hour-for-hour basis.

(1)	An employee providing essential services shall be credited with hours of work and, in addition, receive disaster compensation on an hour-for-hour basis for the number of hours worked for the period the facility is closed.
(2)	When an employee is determined to not be necessary for providing essential services in those facilities which have been closed under Executive Order, the employee shall be eligible for administrative leave up to an amount equal to the employee’s scheduled work hours for the period the facility is closed.
(3)	At the end of the workweek or pay period, as appropriate, employees shall be compensated in the following order:
(a)	Employees shall be credited with time actually worked. If the hours worked exceed the normal pay for the workweek or pay period, employees will be compensated for all overtime earned;
(b)	If the hours actually worked are still below the normal pay for the workweek/pay period, leave shall be used to bring the employee to the normal rate of pay in the following order:
1.	Any annual leave, sick leave, or regular compensatory leave that had been approved;
2.	Any administrative leave for which the employee is eligible. Any unused administrative leave eligibility that is not needed to bring the employee to the normal pay shall be cancelled.
28
(c)	In addition to the above, the employee providing essential services shall receive disaster compensation to be paid at the employee’s current regular hourly rate of pay for each hour worked while the facility is closed by order of the Governor, regardless of whether overtime was earned or leave used during the workweek or pay period.
(B)	Work in all other circumstances where facilities are closed; work on an observed holiday; or extra hours worked during a holiday workweek or pay period:
(1)	An employee required to work when the facility has been closed under the direction of the Department of Management Services or the agency head due to any other condition not covered by an Executive Order, would be eligible for special compensatory leave on an hour-for-hour basis for the number of hours worked each day that the facility is closed,
(2)	An employee required to work on a holiday shall be eligible for special compensatory leave equal to the time worked on the holiday, not to exceed the number of hours in the employee's established workday. However, if the holiday falls on an established workday of less than 8 hours, the employee will be eligible for an 8-hour holiday.
(3)	An employee required to work extra hours during a holiday workweek or pay period shall be eligible for special compensatory leave equal to the number of extra hours worked.
(4)	At the end of the workweek or pay period, as appropriate, the employee shall be compensated in the following order:
(a)	The employee shall first be credited with time actually worked;
(b)	Eligible special compensatory hours during the workweek/pay period will be added to the hours of actual work to bring the hours worked up to the normal hours for the workweek/pay period. Any remaining eligible special compensatory leave hours shall be converted to special compensatory leave credits;
(c)	If the employee is still below the normal pay for the workweek/pay period leave shall be used to bring the employee to the normal rate of pay in the following order:
1.	Any annual leave, sick leave, or regular compensatory leave that had been approved;
2.	Any administrative leave for which the employee is eligible. Any unused administrative leave eligibility that is not needed to bring the employee to the normal pay shall be cancelled.
(C)	Administrative leave shall not count as hours worked for overtime purposes.
(D)	The representatives of the Association shall have the opportunity to consult with each agency employing unit members on the Agency's Emergency Comprehensive Plan with regard to compensation and overtime pay during declared emergencies.

SECTION 6	- Department of Health Employees and Emergency / Disaster Compensation
(A)	The Florida Nurses Association (herein the “FNA”) and the State of Florida desire to recognize the sacrifices of those employees who serve in the capacity of health care professionals during a declared emergency. The provisions of this section apply to this Unit’s professional health care employees who are employees of the State of Florida Department of Health.
(B)	When health care professional employees in the Department of Health are deployed to perform services during a declared emergency, but their regular work location is not closed, the following compensation arrangement will be implemented.
(1)The Department of Health professional health care unit employees shall be considered as “included” employees for the purposes of overtime compensation for the duration of the declared emergency or disaster.
(2)	The “included” status shall apply only during the work week(s) in which the employee is deployed to the emergency or disaster area.
(3)	This compensation is appropriate as deployed employees are required to provide a wide variety of services to those in need of healthcare and assistance during the emergency or disaster, involving an increase in “included" type duties.
(4)	Employees who work at their home agency work location or whose home agency work location is closed as a result of a declared emergency or disaster will not be considered “included” but rather will continue to be compensated in accordance with this agreement.
(5)	The ability to provide this compensation is in furtherance of the existing policies on connecting employees to included status on a temporary basis in these circumstances.
(C)	An alleged violation of the provisions of this Section can be grieved in accordance with the grievance and arbitration processes included in Article 6, Grievance Procedure, of this agreement.
