J.	Salary Placement Following Transfer to Another Salary Classification
1.	Except as provided, in paragraph 2 below, when an employee moves from one salary classification to another, s/he will be placed on his/her new salary lane in such a manner that places the employee one step above his/her former hourly wage. Should this hot qualify an employee for a higher step placement than s/he would have received had s/he been hired directly into that position, the employee will be placed into that step determined by .Section L(l) below. However, when an employee moves from one salary lane to another within the same salary classification, s/he will move laterally, retaining his/her former step placement on the new lane.
2.	An employee who returns to his/her former salary classification, following a transfer to a different classification, will be placed on the step in that former classification which the employee would be on had s/he continued in that classification without the transfer.
K.	No employee’s salary level will be decreased due to a reclassification of his/her position. Any such employee will move to his/her new salary lane and step but will have his/her salary level frozen at the present dollar value of his/her base rate of pay until such time as the dollar value of his/her new salary level equals or surpasses his/her frozen value. At that point the employee will no longer continue to have his/her salary level frozen. Employees who are having their salary levels frozen will receive all applicable longevity and negotiated bonus payments but will not receive any negotiated “across-the-board” increases or step increments.
L.	Rules for Salary Placement
1.	For purposes of determining initial placement on the appropriate salary schedule for new employees, one step will be granted, up to a maximum of three steps for each two full years of related experience. The employee’s initial step placement will then be one step above that determined herein.
2.	If an employee employed by the Board resigns his/her position and subsequently is reemployed by the Board, s/he will be given salary credit for his/her prior service up to a maximum of Step 6 on his/her respective salary lane. Each rehired employee will receive one year’s credit for each year of prior related experience with the School Board of Sarasota County. In no event will a returning employee be placed on a higher step than that on which s/he was last placed. Prior service time will apply to the determining of the appropriate longevity bonus. (However, no additional employees will be placed into the 11-15 year longevity grouping.)
3.	When an employee who had not previously been a member of the classified bargaining unit moves from an instructional position to a classified position s/he will be placed on his/her new salary schedule in such a fashion as to minimize his/her salary injury.

which the employee is qualified in his/her present job classification. In such a case, the employee possessing the least seniority at that cost center will be surplussed.
c.	An employee whose position has been eliminated must be given the opportunity to elect to remain at his/her cost center in another position in his/her former or a lower job classification for which s/he is qualified, and must exercise his/her election, prior to surplus lists being transmitted from the cost center to the Human Resources Office (with the appropriate salary adjustment). •
d.	Upon receipt of surplus lists from all cost centers, the Human Resources Office will compile a listing, in seniority order, of all employees who have been surplussed. That listing, as well as a listing of all vacancies county-wide (excluding Board approved,charter schools), will,be posted for a period of five working days. Employees may update their preference lists through the conclusion of this five day period.
e.	All employees will be placed into vacant assignments on a seniority basis based upon their expressed preferences (excluding Board approved charter schools). The most senior surplussed employee will be considered first and placement will continue on a seniority basis. Each employee must be qualified for the assignment selected. During the placement process, if no vacancy remains for which an employee is qualified, the employee will replace, the least senior employee in either the north or south county region (as selected by the employee) in his/her job classification. The employee may elect to switch his/her region selection and pick from vacancies in the other location. This process will continue until there remains no employee on the surplus list who has more seniority than any employee in the district holding a position in that job classification. Those employees who are junior to all others in the district within their job classification will thus be identified. Those junior employees, for whom there are no positions available within their job classification, will be laid off. Those laid off employees will have recall rights within the parameters set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.
f.	During the placement process, should an employee not be reassigned due to his/her failing to be assigned to one of the work sites stated on his/her preference form or because a Preference Form was not filed, management will attempt to contact said employee to explain to him/her those positions remaining available at that time. Should management not be able to contact said employee, the employee will be reassigned to a cost center and position most closely resembling that which they were last assigned or those expressed on their preference form. Should said employee upon his/her return not agree with the placement, s/he will be allowed to exercise his/her seniority for any remaining unfilled positions for which s/he is qualified.
C.	Return to Former Placement
Any employee displaced from his/her position due to the implementation of those procedures described above will be able to return to a position vacancy at his/her last former work.site at his/her present or former job classification for which s/he is qualified or in the case of an employee who has suffered an involuntary reduction in his/her job classification, to any position vacancy, county-wide on his/her former job classification, should such a position become available within a period of five years. Such return will be automatically granted upon written receipt of the employee’s request stating right to recall, and will be undertaken on a seniority basis in the order specified in Article XVI. It will be the employee’s responsibility to monitor such opportunities.
D.	Notification
The Board agrees to provide notice of the layoffs to the affected employees and the Union at least ten work days before any action is taken. Notification of .layoff shall be sent by certified mail to the affected employee. It is the employee’s responsibility to keep the Human Resources Office informed of his/her current address.

Improving Employee Performance ......................... 4 hours
As a director of work activities, one of the Head Custodian/Senior Head Custodian’s major responsibilities is keeping the output of the employees in the work group at certain standards of quality and quantity. To meet the goals/standards established for the job, each employee must be willing to do his/her share. When an employee is under-performing, the Head Custodian/Senior Head Custodian should take action. The key is; to handle the discussion with the employee in such a manner that s/he is motivated to improve performance. The employee must be motivated. There is no other way to successfully improve the performance of the work group.
Class size maximum -12
Improving Work Habits...................................4 hours
Directors of work activities are often faced with the problem of an employee who is developing a poor work habit, such as sloppy housekeeping, inappropriate dress, unsafe procedures, improper use of the telephone, late reports, etc. A poor work habit which develops in one employee may spread to the rest of the work group. Therefore, it must be handled immediately and effectively. A poor work habit should be dealt with as soon as it appears because habits are much easier to change as they are developing than after they have become established. The effective Head Custodian/Senior Head Custodian notices the work habits of the employees in the work group. When an employee starts to develop a poor work habit,' the Head Custodian/Senior Head Custodian takes immediate action to change the habit before it becomes a bigger problem.
Class size maximum -12
Maintaining Improved Performance........................4 hours
When an employee’s performance improves, it is imperative that the Head Custodian acknowledge that improvement in a way that will encourage the employee to maintain the improvement. While it may seem easy to encourage employees to maintain improvement, it is really a very difficult situation to handle effectively. Poor handling of this situation can be seen by the employee as an insincere compliment. Insincerity (either real or perceived) will not encourage the employee to maintain the improved performance.
Class size maximum -12
Utilizing Effective Follow Up Action....................4 hours
When an employee’s unsatisfactory performance or poor work habit continues even after discussions of the problem, the Head Custodian needs to take action. This module will help build the skills to conduct effective follow-up discussions, giving the employees another chance to solve the problem before disciplinary action is taken.
Class size maximum -12
Handling Employee Complaints............................4 hours
Every employee has a complaint from time to time. Sometimes the Head Custodian can take actions which will resolve the complaint; at other times he/she can do little more than listen to the complaint. At all times it is important that the Head Custodian establish a climate which encourages employees to bring their complaints to him/her. Employees will voice their complaints no matter what the work climate. If there is an open climate, the complaint will be voiced to the Head Custodian. If a relatively closed climate has been established, the complaint will probably be voiced only to other employees.
Class size maximum -12
Delegating Responsibility...............................4 hours
Delegating allows the head custodian time to devote to other activities that will build a more efficient and effective work unit. Effective delegation is probably the most direct and effective way of developing employees. In this module the custodian will develop skills to utilize subordinates effectively by allocating work that is accompanied by responsibility and accountability.

Overcoming Resistance to Change............................4	hours
The head custodian has a direct impact upon employee acceptance and involvement whenever changes must be implemented. Managing change means developing strategies to help employees through the transition and to assist those who are having difficulty adjusting during the change period. This module builds skills to effectively work with employees to help them overcome real or perceived barriers to making the change work.
Class size maximum - 12
Reducing Tardiness.......................................  4	hours
Tardiness is a problem that most head custodians have to deal with from time to time. It; is important that the tardiness be dealt with effectively and promptly because tardiness, causes several other problems. The tardy employee may get behind in his/her work. Also, other employees may be unhappy and wish to have the same “privilege.” The result may be that other employees complain about the tardy employee or come in late themselves.
Class size maximum -12
