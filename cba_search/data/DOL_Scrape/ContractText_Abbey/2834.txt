PART 1	- BASIC DECLARATION
A.	Agreement
This Agreement is entered into by the Appleton Area Schoo] District, hereinafter referred to as the BOARD, and the Appleton Education Association, hereinafter referred to as the ASSOCIATION, to encourage and increase effective and harmonious working relationships between the Board and the Association.
The Agreement and the Memorandum of Understanding between the Board and the Association encompass both the written solutions to past issues and the commitment to continuous mutual problem solving, through consensus, of issues as they emerge. As a vehicle to implement this dynamic approach to problem solving, the Issues Resolution Council will meet to resolve issues of import to either party as they arise.
The Issues Resolution Council will normally submit any tentative agreements for ratification to the full membership of the respective parties on an annual basis in the spring.
Other changes to this Agreement will only be proposed by committees representing the parties. These committees will start meeting prior to March 1 in the year in which the current Agreement expires. These committees will employ consensus-seeking strategies to arrive at a tentative agreement on these matters with a goal of having this accomplished in a period of approximately thirty (30) days.
The Board, selected administrators, and selected Association representatives will participate annually tn a Communications Workshop to maintain and strengthen the positive working relationship already established.
B.	Recognition of Bargaining Agent
The Board recognizes the Association as the exclusive bargaining representative on wages, hours and conditions of employment for all regular and replacement professional educators who do not have evaluative responsibility over other professional educators*
The foregoing is not intended to exclude from the bargaining unit anyone who is eligible to be in the bargaining unit. In addition, professional educators who temporarily assume supervisory/managerial duties as a result of shared decision-making and/or who assume non-teaching leadership assignments shall remain members of the bargaining unit. Changes in the composition of the bargaining unit shall be made only through mutual agreement of the parties or through official action of the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission. The Board guarantees to the Association and to all those for whom it is the exclusive bargaining representative all rights due under existing statutes or official regulations of appropriate federal and state regulatory bodies*

c.	Job Sharing
Professional educators interested in changing to a shared assignment for the ensuing school year shall initiate the process by completing a job-sharing request form and submitting it to the appropriate building principal with a copy to the Director of Human Resources no later than April 1. The two administrators shall review the request and, if satisfactory, the Director of Human Resources shall recommend that the Board of Education approve it. If the request is approved, it is understood that such approval does not set any job-sharing precedent for either of the parties to the Agreement.

(1)	Should either or both professional educators wish to discontinue the sharing arrangement, this can only be done when a vacancy occurs for which the professional educators) wishing to discontinue the arrangement can qualify and there is no one on the recall list who qualifies. In such situations, the senior professional educator has the option of remaining or moving to a vacant position. The normal rules for filling a vacant position apply,
(2)	Should one of the professional educators resign, be laid-off or otherwise terminate his/her employment, the other professional educator shall be given the first option of having a full-time contract and the foll-time position without posting. If he/she elects this option, then he/she has up to 45 contract days in the current school year to make the transition to full-time. If the professional educator does not elect this option, and it is the last quarter of the school year, then the vacancy shall be filled by a substitute. If it is not the last quarter of the school year, then it shall be filled via a regular posting. If either of the latter two situations occur, then at the end of the school year, the original job-sharing professional educator must find a new official partner, return to full-time, or resign,
(3)	During the first three years, the job-sharing arrangement shall be cooperatively evaluated by the professional educators and the building principal to determine if it should be continued for the succeeding year. A decision to discontinue it shall not be arbitrary and/or capricious, and shall be made by February 15°’. If the decision is to discontinue the job-sharing arrangement, it shall be treated as a ‘^without an assigned position” situation and the senior professional educator has the option of remaining in or leaving the position.
(4)	The professional educators in a job-sharing arrangement, including those in a recognized split position, are expected to substitute for one another, whenever

feasible. However, long-term substituting is recognized as not fitting the intent of the job-sharing arrangement that has been implemented. Thus, while the remaining professional educator will be given the first opportunity to do longterm substituting for the other, it is not considered to be an expectation.
Payment for substitute work within the job-sharing arrangement will be at the base pay (Step 1) for the BS or BS+40/MS lane, whichever reflects the education of the professional educator who is performing the substitute work.
(5)	Both professional educators shall be responsible tor attending the parent-teacher conferences referenced in Part III J of this Agreement* With respect to the compensatory time which is provided for nighl conferences, the professional educators shall decide how this time is to be apportioned* If there is no mutual agreement, then schedules shall be rearranged so that the time may be split.
(6)	Professional educators in a job-sharing arrangement have the same rights as full-time professional educators with regard to exercising professional judgment in attending faculty meetings* However, although one would be responsible for finding out what transpired, attendance at meetings which are held at a time not contiguous to one’s work schedule is purely voluntary.
(7)	The portion of the three (3) teacher orientation days at the start of the school year that fall outside the contractual obligation of a professional educator who is fifty percent (50%) do not have to be attended. A professional educator may do so voluntarily. Compensatory time for attendance may also be approved at the discretion of the administration,
(8)	On days with staff development time, the professional educators shall adjust their daily schedules, if necessary, so that each can fulfill his/her contractual obligation for the year with a balance of time with students and staff development activities* Anything beyond one’s contractual obligation (0.5) shall be voluntary and compensatory time for attendance shall be approved.
(9)	Individuals involved in scheduling elementary specialists shall attempt to equally divide the total specialist time allocated between the two (2) professional educators.

(1)	Voluntary layoff will take precedence over involuntary layoff.
(2)	Current certification and seniority shall be the prime considerations in layoffs. The Board shall also consider the qualifications of professional educators in relation to training, education, performance and professional competence. Where qualifications other than current certification and seniority take precedence, it shall be for good cause, and the senior professional educators) directly affected and the Association shall be informed of such reasons in writing. When selecting elementary professional educators for layoff kindergarten, primary and intermediate are to be treated as a single certification area.
(3)	Whenever the Board determines it is necessary to lay off as indicated in Part IIB 2 f of this Agreement, the professional educator scheduled for layoff will have the right to “bump” the least senior professional educator in another subject area(s) of certification if the “bumping” professional educator has current certification in the subject area(s) the professional educator being “bumped” is currently teaching/working and if the “bumpir.g” professional educator has experience in the subject area(s) in which the “bumped” professional educator is currently teaching/working, However, if a professional educator scheduled for layoff has “bumped” another professional educator and the Board, prior to the end of the current school calendar, authorizes the continuation of the exact same position he/she currently holds, then he/she shall be awarded the position without posting and the "bumping” chain he/she initiated shall be reversed.
Senior professional educators will also, have the right to **bump” into subject area(s) for which they are currently certified but in which they do not have previous experience, but such “bumping” shall involve a "trial status” of not to exceed two (2) school years. During the “trial status,” the professional educators shall, at least once each quarter, be given a written evaluation on the same form(s) as used for other professional educators* evaluations pursuant to the Cooperative Evaluation Procedure. At least every other evaluation during the <4trial status” shall be on the same form as is used for professional educators with three (3) or less years of service. The written observation reports on which the evaluation is based shall also be provided to the professional educator on a regular basis. The professional educator shall be made aware of any alleged deficiencies on an ongoing basis as they are observed. The written evaluation(s) shall clearly indicate any alleged deficiencies in the professional educator's performance, the expected corrections necessary to bring his/her performance to a satisfactory level, and a stated period of time for correction which shall not be unreasonable. The Board may, at the conclusion of the first or second year of “trial status ” remove the professional educator from the portion of the position in which the professional educator did not have previous experience if it is determined the professional educator has not performed satisfactorily as

D, Cooperative Evaluation Procedure
I* Supervision of instruction, when appropriately used, is a powerful tool that helps all professionals refine skills and polish strengths which result in an ever increasing growth in the quality of education we provide our students. Supervision is most effective if it is perceived as a process where both supervisor and professional educator discuss a specific lesson in a collaborative, non-evaluative manner, with both parties bringing reflection and insight to the lesson. With competent staff, this fine-tuning results in ongoing quality improvement, much like that provided by a personal coach to an Olympic athlete. In order to foster this kind of supervision, the following procedures will be implemented.
a, i. Personnel involved in supervising professional educators will be involved in Quality Instruction Training to develop skills to implement the kind of supervision described above*
it. There will be a continued moratorium on evaluations with increased emphasis on supervision during the 1991-92 school year (exceptions noted below). This will allow supervisors and professional educators to concentrate on developing a collaborative relationship, with mutual responsibility for constant improvement -without the “evaluative” overtones that inhibit this process.
iii.	The Professionalism Committee will investigate comprehensive evaluation systems to recommend directions for our District that will effectively provide a balance between meaningful accountability and improvement of instruction. We

want to avoid requiring supervisors and professional educators to go through processes that have no resulting value.
In order to be fair to the staff and the District, it has been determined that the following groups will participate in the cooperative evaluation process,
b. i. Professional educators with probationary status
Professional educators in years two (2) and three (3) will proceed with the evaluation model they have utilized in the past. Professional educators in their first year will review the PBTE and the short form with their principal or supervisor and come to a mutual decision as to which model to use. New principals will meet with the Assistant Superintendent/School Services to receive background information in both models.
ii.	Professional educators new to a building or a unique assignment change within a building! These professional educators will also discuss with their principal the PBTE and short form to mutually determine which form will be used.
iii.	Professional educators needing assistance: Professional educators who have been identified by their principals or supervisors as needing special assistance will remain in an evaluative mode. Principals or supervisors will plan an individual program of support and expectations for professional educators in this category. The AEA president and the Director of Human Resources will also be notified.
The parties will continue to analyze where we are as a District in relation to supervision and evaluation.
2,	The District is in the process of revising evaluation procedures. In the interim, the short form currently being utilized shall be used along with the PBTE form. Unless otherwise noted above, no professional educator shall be evaluated utilizing the PBTE approach unless both the professional educator and evaluator have been in-serviced in the PBTE approach.
During the first two (2) weeks of the school year or within two (2) weeks of a professional educator's first day on the job for the school year, whichever is later, each professional educator will be:
a.	informed by the administration of the individuals) who will observe/evaluate him/her for the school year;
b.	given a copy of the evaluation form to be used.
If a professional educator is not provided with the above information, it will be his/her responsibility to contact the appropriate Assistant Superintendent-School Services who will then do so.

Professional educators with less than three (3) years of experience in the District (probationary) will be evaluated by the above named individual(s) with the evaluation being completed prior to February 1 of each year.
Professional educators with three (3) or more years of experience in the District (non-probationary) will be evaluated at least once every three (3) years by the above named individual(s) with the evaluation being completed prior to the last two (2) weeks of school in the spring. Evaluations may be conducted on a more frequent basis to support innovations or to assist non-probationary professional educators with special needs. In a year in which one is not going to be evaluated, a non-probationary professional educator shall be observed by his/her evaluator(s) at least once and an informal follow-up conference shall be held after each observation. Any documents generated because of the observation/follow-up conference shall be given to the professional educator and not placed into his/her personnel file without his/her permission.
If a due date for an evaluation is to be postponed, then a written tripartite (AEA, District and employee) waiver with a new due date must be agreed upon and signed prior to the original due date.
The evaluation process for probationary and non-probationary professional educators shall be the same except for deadlines. An evaluation is completed when the evaluation conference has been held and the final evaluation document has subsequently been prepared and signed.
Since this shall be a cooperative evaluation, both the professional educator and the evaluator should prepare all applicable information prior to their conference. Each professional educator will be given a blank copy of the Board-adopted evaluation form to be used two (2) weeks prior to the conference for his/her use. The conference will focus on a discussion of that information. The evaluation report shall contain the signatures of both the professional educator and the evaluator to indicate that both have been a part of the evaluation and that the professional educator has read the evaluation, not that he/she necessarily agrees with it. Space shall be provided on the report for the professional educator to add any comments he/she feels are relevant. A copy of the report shall be given to the professional educator. The evaluation report shall be based on previous classroom observations and other information. There should be no surprises. It shall be placed on a standard form which shall be limited to relevant information pertaining to the teaching act, personal qualities as they affect the teaching act, and professional attitudes and behavior as they relate to the teaching act. All criteria under which professional educators are evaluated shall directly relate to their professional responsibilities,
A copy of the form(s) to be used during that school year in cooperative evaluations covered under this Section will be given to the Association President the first week of the school year. Should any change in the format of the form(s) be considered, discussion will be held with the Association President prior to use of any new form(s) in the subsequent school year.

It is not the intent of this Section to supplant routine evaluations, discussions, and suggestions between supervisors and professional educators, nor does it negate the possibility of future consideration for non-renewal.
Information from anonymous sources and/or unfounded comments shall not be included in any evaluation report of a professional educator. “Anonymous” is interpreted to mean ’"unknown to the evaluator and/or the professional educator”
E. Issues Resolution Council (LR.C.)
The parties to this Agreement have established an Issues Resolution Council (I.R.C.) to promote an environment of trust and open communications. The Issues Resolution Council shall be made up of six (6) representatives of the Board and six (6) representatives of the Association, plus one (1) ex-officio representative from each party, all of whom shall have had training/experience in consensus-seeking strategies. Meeting approximately once a month (minimum of ten [10] times a year), the Issues Resolution Council’s agenda may include:
1.	Discussion/action on requests for waivers from the terms of the Agreement;
2.	Discussion/action on general issues or concerns, including those referenced in Part I-A of this Agreement*
3.	Discussion/action on pre-grievance issues or concerns;
4.	Receiving, processing and taking action (forward to the parties, return to the committee, or not approving) on Category 4 (Joint Administration/Association Committee) Reports*
Meetings may be canceled by mutual agreement of the parties due to lack of agenda items.
Normally on an annual basis, the Issues Resolution Council shall forward any proposed modifications to the Agreement which may include Category 4 Reports and/or any other Category 4 Reports it has approved to the AEA and the Board for final disposition.
The Issues Resolution Council has established a sub-committee which normally handles pregrievance issues or concerns prior to the full LR*C, occasionally taking action on them.

R Shared Decision-Making
1.	The Board and the Association jointly endorse the concept of staff involvement in decision making. Such involvement should be conducted in a spirit of cooperation and with the clear focus that student learning is the most important function of a classroom, a school, and a school administrative unit.
The parties jointly recognize that shared decision-making can foster the collegial exchange of ideas that is necessary for effective professional practice.
At each building, a process has been established in which meaningful participation by professional educators is sought during shared decision-making. This process is to be reviewed at the beginning of each school year and can be modified at any time by following the rules contained therein. It cannot be modified unilaterally by the administration.
Copies of all shared decision-making documents (e.g*, procedure, decisions) generated by a building shall be sent to the AEA President by the Senior Building Representative,
2.	H’fljver Process /n Scared Decbion-Making
A waiver is a written exception to (a) specific term(s) of the Agreement and has status equal to the term(s) that the waiver replaces* A waiver or a renewal of a waiver is granted by the Issues Resolution Council to a school site shared decision-making committee. The District or the Association may also request waivers on issues that are not site-based.
A proposed waiver must specify the provisions) in the Agreement to be waived, the nature and duration (maximum of one year) of the proposed waiver, and the professional educators) affected by the proposed waiver* A waiver must normally be submitted to the I.R.C. no later than the April 1 prior to the school year for which it is being requested.
Waivers that are applicable to all the professional educators at a school site shall be signed by all members of die site’s shared decision-making committee. Waivers that are applicable to some professional educators at a school site shall be signed by all those professional educators affected and by all members of the site’s shared decision-making committee* Only professional educators affected by a proposed waiver shall be permitted to participate in the consensus/voting process.
A waiver does not constitute past practice or establish precedent. A waiver shall not abrogate a professional educator’s Agreement rights with regard to discipline, personnel files, lay off?recall, seniority, monetary compensation, or access to the complaint procedure. A waiver can also not abrogate the contractual rights of members of other bargaining units.
A waiver shall not be renewed more than two (2) times* (Transitional Note: Waivers approved for the 1997-98 school year can be renewed twice.)

All waivers that are approved shall be disseminated to each facility in which professional educators work and shall be put up on the bulletin boards that are designated for postings,
3.	IZse of Site-Eased Funds to Purchase Additional Professional Educator Time
Using shared decision-making, the staff in a building can utilize site-based funds to purchase additional professional educator time on an annual basis. The deadline for such purchases for the upcoming school year shall be the day before the compilation of postings for the final Arena Staffing of the year is distributed.
If a decision on whether to renew such a position has not been made when staffing assignments for the next year are being prepared, the professional educator holding that position will either have been laid-off or given “without an assigned position” status. Should the staff in that building, prior to the end of the current school calendar, authorize the continuation of the exact same position the professional educator currently holds for the next year, then he/she shall be reinstated to that position without it being posted, provided that this would not be in conflict with the seniority-based recall provisions of the Agreement.

PART 111 - TEACHING OBLIGATIONS AND CONDITIONS
A.	Membership In Private Organizations
Membership in private organizations shall not be required as a condition of employment.
B.	Physical Exam And X-Ray
Every professional educator new to the Appleton Area School District shall be given a physical examination and x-ray (or a TB skin test) as a condition of employment. Such examination and x*ray shall be given without cost to the professional educator if the examination is performed by one of a panel of doctors selected by the Board and if the x-ray is taken at an area institution specified by the Board. The Board will pay an amount not to exceed the cost applicable to the panel doctor’s charge should a professional educator prefer to have the examination made by a doctor not on the panel.
C.	Hepatitis B Immunization
The AEA will recommend to professional educators who have been specifically requested by the District to obtain Hepatitis B immunization that they check with their personal physicians about the medical advisability of going through the immunization procedure. If a professional educator does not have a medical risk, the AEA will recommend that he/she go through the procedure. If a professional educator's personal physician believes that there is a medical risk, provisions of Part III E, Safety and Health, shall apply.
In instances where the District has specifically requested that a professional educator obtain Hepatitis B immunization, the District shall pay all associated costs, including the initial visit to the doctor mentioned in the immediately, preceding paragraph, not paid by the District's health insurance plan, so long as the immunization is performed by a District-approved facility/medical source. The Board will pay an amount not to exceed the cost applicable to the cost of the District-approved facility/medical source toward the total costs of the immunization should a professional educator prefer to have the immunization done at some other facility/medical source.
The District shall not require any professional educator to obtain Hepatitis B immunization nor to sign any waiver form (e.g.. Agreement to Indemnify and Hold Harmless) concerning not obtaining Hepatitis B immunization. However, a professional educator specifically requested by the District to obtain Hepatitis B immunization does need to sign the Declination form provided by the District if he/she chooses not to do so.
D.	Class Size
The parties recognize that optimum teaching and learning conditions are greatly affected by having a workable class size. Recommendations of the Department of Public Instruction regarding class size for the various grades and subjects are accepted as desirable goals that should be sought after, insofar as facilities and personnel permit.

In accepting this principle, however, the parties recognize that from time to time there will be situations of temporary imbalance resulting in slight overflow. In addition, it is recognized that these recommendations apply to traditional classroom teaching situations and they may not be applicable where new teaching techniques and changes in means and methods of instruction are involved.
E.	Safety And Health
In the interest of safety, elective courses in Science, Technical Education and Family and Consumer Education will be limited in enrollment for each individual class to the number of stations available in each room, unless otherwise agreed by the professional educator in a meeting with the principal and a building representative from that building.
The District will continue to make every reasonable effort to provide and maintain safe working conditions. The Association will cooperate in these efforts and encourage professional educators to work in a safe manner. Should a professional educator become aware of conditions which he/she considers to be unsafe or hazardous, the situation is to be immediately reported to his/her immediate administrative supervisor so that an immediate investigation can be conducted and appropriate changes recommended.
Reasonable efforts shall be made to meet the medically certified inability of a professional educator to perform his/her regularly assigned tasks. A second medical opinion may be obtained by the District’s medical consultant, Should the two medical opinions differ, the opinion of a third physician chosen by mutual agreement of the professional educator’s physician and the Board’s medical consultant shall take precedence. These procedures shall not, however, abrogate the statutory rights of either party.
F,	Emergency Closing Of Schools
As a general rule, public schools will be open in times of inclement weather for instruction to those pupils who find it possible to attend. If the schools are closed because of an act of God, snow, storm, power failure or any other reason, and if the day(s) must be made up so that the District’s state aids will not be adversely affected, the school calendar will be extended for this day(s) without addition compensation. If the schools are closed as described above, professional educators need not be in the buildings. In addition, if the schools have a late starting time, are dismissed early, or are closed and the time/day($) are not required to be made up, professional educators need not be in the buildings and shall suffer no loss of compensation as a result. If extended, the make-up day($) shall be mutually agreed to by the parties.
If the schools are closed for a full day and this day is not required to be made up, a professional educator shall not have the absence, including a scheduled personal day, charged against him/her provided that it is not part of an absence of five (5) or more consecutive work days. If it is part of such an absence, then he/she shall be charged for it.

4	Except for unusual situations, only one individual (the professional educator, his/her 5 replacement, or his/her substitute) is normally paid for a given work day.
G.	School Day
The school day is considered to be that time during which the students of the District are in regular session for classes or are otherwise involved in related school functions and activities. Deviations from the time schedule now in effect will be made only after negotiations with the Association. Classes taught outside the time schedule now in effect will be on a voluntary basis with arrangements made between the building principal(s) and the professional educators) in question for the total time schedule and load. A written tripartite (AEA, District, employee) waiver must also be agreed upon and signed prior to implementation.
H.	Staff Development
(NOTE: Scheduling is contingent on a 180-day alternative compliance letter from the DPI. Should such not be issued in the future, then scheduling shaE change to the extent necessary to comply with the 180-day requirement.)
The instructional day has been adjusted to accommodate the equivalent of nine (9) one-half (1/2) days for District/building goal-driven shared decision-making/interactive planning/staff development time leading to the improvement of instruction. This could include time for faculty meetings, curriculum meetings, and department meetings that meet this criteria.
If any of the time falls outside the contractual obligations of a professional educator who is part-time, then he/she does not have to attend. He/she may do so voluntarily. Compensatory time for attendance will be approved.
A professional staff development plan designed to meet the needs of individuals or curriculum areas in each school shall be annually established. The plan shall be developed through consensus of the support staff, instructional staff, administrative staff and other appropriate staff in the building. Up to three (3) hours each year of staff development activities which support District/curriculum area level goals shall be planned by supervisors/curriculum area specialists and appropriate staff utilizing the shared decisionmaking process.
At least three (3) weeks prior to a staff development session, the building staff development committee will distribute agendas and details for the session to all building staff Professional educators who travel will choose which building’s (from those to which they are assigned) activities they will attend. (As a courtesy, each of your assigned buildings should be notified of your attendance decision.)

Such responsibilities are a part of the regular work day and year and shall receive additional compensation only as noted in Appendix A4. Professional educators who travel shall not be expected to participate in additional responsibilities beyond those of a professional educator who is assigned to only one school.
The objective of this Agreement is to grant the greatest possible degree of autonomy to professional educators consistent with the responsibilities listed above. Professional educators are expected to exercise reasonable and prudent independent professional judgment in making the decisions necessary to fulfill their professional responsibilities.
Educators expect to be treated as professionals with professional responsibilities and inattention by either party to the professional rights and responsibilities set forth in this Agreement may result in open dialogue between the individuals involved and, if this is unsuccessful, utilization of the complaint or discipline procedures.

When deemed necessary and appropriate by a professional educator, he/she shall schedule an individual conference regarding a student’s status and performance with the student's parent(s)/guardian(s). The student, appropriate administration and other staff may be included in the conference* Whenever practical, such conference shall be scheduled during regular school hours.
In addition to the above, all professional educators are responsible for scheduled general parent-professional educator conferences* Such general conferences shall be scheduled with the following parameters and conditions:
a* The conference schedule for a school year shall consist of six (6) sessions at the elementary [K-6] and middle school levels and four (4) sessions at the high school level.
Half-day Kindergarten and Early Childhood shall follow the elementary schedule and have an additional two (2) sessions during the day each semester (total of ten [10] sessions per year). See Appendix B, #4 for exceptions.
b* For each level (elementary [K-6], middle school, high school) and for each semester, the AEA/AASD Calendar Committee shall schedule a different morning or afternoon on which such conferences may be scheduled for a period of three (3) hours. If students are to attend school on that day, the conferences shall be scheduled for the afternoon and the total work time in the day shall be equal to that of a normal day.
•l
The above shall be completed for the upcoming school year prior to winter break* If a mutually agreeable decision cannot be reached, the schedule shall match to the extent possible that of the current school year*
c.	Each site shall decide if it wishes to schedule all evening conferences in the first and/or second semester of the upcoming school year. Eighty percent (80%) or more of the professional educators at a site must choose to do so*
After the above decision has been made, each site, using its shared decisionmaking process, shall select the following number of evening(s) in each semester on which such conferences will be scheduled for a maximum length of 2-1/4 hours:
Elementary [K-6]	—>	2	(3 if no day conferences)

Evening conferences can be scheduled in the same week that day conferences may be held or the week before or after. Schools in the same cluster should communicate with each other to minimize the possibility of the same evening(s) being selected for different levels.
The above shall be completed for the upcoming school year prior to the end of February,
d.	The Committee shah schedule compensatory time for the evening conferences at each level with !/a work day being given for each such session.
If a site has chosen to have all evening conferences in the first and/or second semester, the professional educators at the si-e should be aware that the compensatory time for the extra evening will normally be scheduled during the designated day conference slot. However, if all sites at a level have chosen this option, the Committee will consider other alternatives that may be more appropriate.
e,	When selecting the date(s) on which day conferences can be scheduled and on which compensatory time is to be given, the Committee shall attempt to configure them with other scheduled activities so that district/level-wide non-student contact days are created and state statutes/DPI regulations are satisfied.
f.	Elementary (Early Childhood and K-6): Specialists, librarians, guidance counselors, etc* shall have the same time schedule during conference weeks as regular classroom teachers.
As long as professional educators with specific students assigned to their classrooms have notified parents regarding the availability of conference times and have scheduled parents into specific slots for conference appointments, then those professional educators have the flexibility to leave the building when conference obligations have been met. Parents shall not be inconvenienced to accommodate a teacher* s desired schedule, nor shall teachers be purposely scheduled to keep them on site for the entire time. The building sign^out procedure should be followed if a professional educator will not be in the building for any portion of those pre-determined hours.
If other professional educators (e.g., resource, TAG, LMC, guidance, psychologists, social workers, nurses, other EEN) have followed the same procedure as classroom teachers by notifying parents of their availability and requesting parents to schedule specific times for conference appointments, then the same flexibility exists for them as well. If, however, these professional educators have informed parents that they will be available at school sites on specific days or evenings for “drop-in” conferences, then these professional educators shall remain for the full time set aside.

If the number of conferences a professional educator has (including “no-shows'*) exceeds the number of time slots available (e.g., 1-6 has 30 [day + 2 evenings] or 27 [3 evenings]), he/she should work with his/her principal to obtain mutually acceptable compensation for the additional time reeded. Alternatives can include hiring a substitute and holding the conferences during the work day (nan-prep time portion) or holding the conferences outside the normal work day and receiving compensatory time/additional pay at the professional services rate. If there is no agreement, then the compensation shall be in the form of pay.
All parents have rights to equal access of information regarding their children. Therefore, if parents wish to have that information and need or desire a separate individual time slot from their spouse or ex-spouse to obtain that information, professional educators have an obligation to make it available to them. If multiple conferences for a child(ren) cause a professional educator to exceed the number of time slots available, then the above provisions take effect,

h.	from Night Conferences:
(1)	Professional educators who are excused by their immediate administrative supervisor from attendance at such night conferences (e.g., a coaching conflict, a night class) shall be entitled to the compensatory time-off provided that they contact all parents who made such a request and schedule a mutually agreeable time for a conference for any parents who would like one.
(2)	Professional educators who are absent from such night conferences due to a paid leave listed in Part IV - Section E 2 or 3 of the Agreement shall also be entitled to the compensatory time-off subject to the same provisions as in (1) above, except in situations covered in (3) below. Absence from such night conferences shall not result in a charge to any leave time for these professional educators.
(3)	A professional educator who notifies Substitute Service that he/she will be using a persona! day not subject to permission of the Director of Human Resources on the day of the previously scheduled night conferences shall not be entitled to compensatory time-off if he/she is absent from such night conferences.

3 days of service per year or 15 days of total service
* Professional educator B has 6475 seniority days at retirement.
6475 -f- 185 days/year = 35 years
35 years X 3.2%/year = 112%
112% -* rolled down to 100% maximum 100%/5 years of payment - 20%/year 20% = 5 days of service per year or 25 days of total service

The parties recognize that Appleton’s 1988-89 salary schedule ranked 17th in the state. The goal of the parties is to maintain a ranking within the top seventeen (17) salary schedules in the state with a 1994-95 goal of maintaining a tanking within the top fifteen (15).
The methodology for finding the rank of a salary schedule is to calculate an average dollar amount using the seven (7) salary schedule benchmarks of E^Minimum, B+6 Steps, B-Maximum (no longevity), M-Minimum, fvf+9 Steps, M-Maximum (no longevity), and Scheduled Maximum (no longevity).
Going from a BS+40/M to a BS+40/M does not constitute a Lane change.
Should a professional educator who has not received an experience increment for a school year earn enough additional credits to move horizontally to a lane with more vertical steps, then he/she shall also move vertically one (1) step for the appropriate portion of that year pursuant to the provisions of Part IV G 2 e (5).

STIPEND FOR TRAVELING EDUCATORS WITH ASSIGNED SUPERVISION
Contract language provides that:
In lieu of ths former supervisory credit, professional educators teaching partly or lolly al the secondary (7-12) level shall receive an additional yearly stipend it they travel between two (2) schools once in a day. The stipend is significantly larger if they travel between two (2) schools more than once in a day or if they travel between three (3) or more sohdote in a day. The exact amounts are set forth in the Master Agreement with Ihe AEA. Such amounts Shall be pro-rated and added to professional educator's checks lor payment throughout the year. Part-timers affected by the above shall receive pro-rated amounls as theyi would have had pro-raied supervision. Increases in these figures will be adjusted by the same percentage figure as the base teacher salary schedule increases for succeeding years.
The stipends referenced in the first paragraph shall be paid to all professional educators leaching partly or fully at Ihe secondary (7-12) level who travel as specified above. However, if a professional educator does not wish to have a supervisory assignment (this includes homeroonVresource period or study hall at the junior high level) and his/her immediate administrative supervisors) concurs), ihen Ihe payment of the stipend shall be waived. Such mutual agreement must be in writing. •
When calculating the amount payable to a professional educator, the lormula(s) isVare only applied to the day(s) on which one has a secondary (7-12) supervisory assignment. Resource activities done at a time other Ihan resource period qualify for purposes of applying the above lormula(s) to a professional educator's schedule.
ft an educator has less than a 100% contract, the stipend is pro-rated. He/she is entitled to supervisory time and compensation only for that percentage of their contract time (e.g., if educator has a 60% contract, he/she would only need to do 60% of full-1 rm e supervision and will be paid 00% of the stipend).	•
This Is not reimbursement tor travel mileage. This is compensation for time ibst that might otherwise be used for educational preparation for classroom teaching.
I meet the provisions of the contract and qualify lor the above stipend. I am a full time part lime (indicate %)teacher.
Please indicate your daily travel schedule and supervisory assignment following the example in Ihe box below:
