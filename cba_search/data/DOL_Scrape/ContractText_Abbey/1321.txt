INSIDE WIREMEN'S AGREEMENT
Agreement by and between the Los Angeles County Chapter, NECA and Local Union 11, IBEW.
It shall apply to all firms who sign a Letter of Assent to be bound by this agreement.
As used hereinafter in this agreement, the term "Chapter" shall mean the Los Angeles County Chapter, NECA, and the term "Union" shall mean Local Union 11, IBEW.
The term "Employer" shall mean an individual firm who has been recognized by an assent to this agreement
The word "Workmen", as used hereinafter, shall mean workmen covered by the terms of this agreement
SCOPE OF WORK
Workmen employed under the terms of this Agreement shall do all electrical construction, and installation or erection work, including the final running tests.
This shall include the installation of all temporary power and light wiring (providing, however, other tradesmen may be permitted to attach or disconnect safe, properly grounded portable cords of not more than one hundred feet in length from a plug-in box for the use of not more than two (2) lamps or power devices to the source of temporary wiring) provided for under this Agreement. This shall also include the installation of all electrical lighting, heating and power equipment, fiber optics, and the installation and connecting of all electronic equipment, including computing machines and devices. This shall also include monitoring of radiation hazards where such monitoring work is not preempted or performed by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, their agents, successors, or assignees.
BASIC PRINCIPLES
The Chapter and the Union have a common and sympathetic interest in the Electrical Industry. Therefore, a working system and harmonious relations are necessary to improve the relationship between the Chapter, the Union and the Public. Progress in the industry demands a mutuality of confidence between the Chapter and the Union. All will benefit by continuous peace and by adjusting any difference by rational, common sense methods.
In accordance with the Federal Government Executive Orders, the Fair Employment Practices Act of the State of California, and other applicable laws, the parties
1
to this Agreement are obligated not to discriminate against employee or applicant for employment because of race, religion, color, age, sex, creed, national origin or disability.
The Employers recognize the Union as the sole collective bargaining agency between itself and the employees covered under this Agreement
Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:
MUTUAL POLICIES
It is the understandable right of every contractor to build a strong organization and every workman to be represented by a strong Union.
Both parties to this Agreement shall comply with the provisions of this agreement. Employees will not be removed from the job because of jobsite disputes and all disputes shall be resolved by the grievance procedure contained in Article I.
When the contractor secures a contract, that contract is his property to direct, operate and supervise as he sees best. The contractor shall have the ownership, direction and supervision of the job; the Union shall furnish the workmen employed on the job. The Union or its representatives shall have the representational direction of the workmen employed on the job.
The LA/NECA and IBEW Local 11 should jointly undertake a program of Public Relations and Public Information to alert buyers, and the public alike, as to the many benefits inherent in "QUALITY" union electrical work.
The LA/NECA and IBEW Local 11 should continue to monitor all jobs in L.A. County to make certain all parties are abiding by the laws.
The LA/NECA and IBEW Local 11 recognize the need to recover, retain, and increase the market share of unionized electrical construction. The customer is our most valuable asset.

Unindentured workers shall not remain employed if apprentices become available for OJT assignment. Unindentured workers shall be used to meet job site ratios except on wage and hour (prevailing wage) job sites.
Before being employed, the unindentured person must sign a letter of understanding with the JATC and the employer, agreeing that they are not to accumulate more than two thousand (2,000) hours as an unindentured, that they are subject to replacement by indentured apprentices and that are not to work on wage and hour (prevailing wage) job sites.
Should an unindentured worker be selected for apprenticeship, the JATC will determine, as provided for in the apprenticeship standards, if some credit for hours worked as an unindentured will be applied toward the minimum OJT hours of apprenticeship. The JATC may elect to offer voluntary related training to unindentured; such as Math Review, English, Safety, Orientation/Awareness, Introduction to OSHA, First-Aid and CPR. Participation shall be voluntary.
Section 5.11. The employer shall contribute to the local health and welfare plans and to the National Electrical Benefit Fund (NEBF) on behalf of all apprentices and unindentured. Contributions to other benefit plans may be addressed in other sections of this agreement.

Secti n 5.12. Each job site shall be allowed a ratio of two (2) apprentices for every three (3) Journeyman Wiremen or fraction thereof as illustrated below.
Number of Journeymen	Maximum Number of Apprentices/Unindentured
1	to	3	2
4	to	6	4
7	to	9	6
97 to 99, etc.	66,	etc.
The first person assigned to any job site shall be a Journeyman Wireman.
A job site is considered to be the physical location where employees report for their work assignments. The employer’s shop (service center) is considered to be a separate, single job site. All other physical locations where workers report for work are each considered to be a single, separate job site.
Section 5.13. An apprentice is to be under the supervision of a Journeyman Wireman at all times. This does not imply that the apprentice must always be in sight of a Journeyman Wireman. Journeymen are not required to constantly watch the apprentice. Supervision will not be of a nature that prevents the development of responsibility and initiative. Work may be laid out by the employer’s designated supervisor or journeyman based on their evaluation of the apprentice’s skills and ability to perform the job tasks. Apprentices shall be permitted to perform job tasks in order to develop job skills and trade competencies. Journeymen are permitted to leave the immediate work area without being accompanied by the apprentice.
Apprentices who have satisfactorily completed the first four years of related classroom training using the NJATC curriculum and accumulated a minimum of 6,500 hours of OJT with satisfactory performance, shall be permitted to work alone on any job site and receive work assignments in the same manner as a Journeymen Wireman. An apprentice shall not be the first person assigned to a job site and apprentices shall not supervise the work of others.
Section 5.14.	Upon satisfactory completion of apprenticeship, the JATC shall issue all graduating apprentices an appropriate diploma from the NJATC. The JATC shall encourage each graduating apprentice to apply for college credit through the NJATC. The JATC may also require each apprentice to acquire any electrical license required for journeymen to work in the jurisdiction covered by this Agreement.
Section 5.15.	The parties to this Agreement shall be bound by the Local Joint Apprenticeship Training Trust Fund Agreement which shall conform to Section 302 of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 as amended, ERISA, and other applicable regulations.
29
The Trustees authorized under this Trust Agreement are hereby empowered to determine the reasonable value of any facilities, materials, or services furnished by either party. All funds shall be handled and disbursed in accordance with the Trust Agreement.
Section 5.16.	All Employers subject to the terms of this Agreement shall contribute the amount of funds specified by the parties signatory to the local apprenticeship and training trust agreement. For the current rate of contribution refer to Article III, Section 3.05 of this agreement. This sum shall be due the Trust Fund by the same date as is their payment to the NEBF under the terms of the Restated Employees Benefit Agreement and Trust.

Labor-Management Cooperation Committee. Each Employer shall make the five cents ($0.05) per hour deduction for each hour worked and shall forward the total amount for all employees covered by this agreement and on a monthly basis transmitted on a form furnished and prescribed by the Trustees of the Fund.
Section 7.06 All Employers subject to the terms of this agreement shall contribute fifteen cents ($.15) per hour for each hour worked for the purpose of maintaining the Local 11, I.B.E.W.-Los Angeles County Chapter, N.E.C.A. Labor-Management Cooperation Committee. This sum shall be forwarded monthly to the Trust
Section 7.07. A Board of Trustees for the Labor-Management Cooperation Committee is hereby established and shall consist of an equal number of members selected by the Union and the Chapter. The Board of Trustees is hereby authorized to establish and implement such Trust Fund, Trust Fund Agreement, and reporting forms as they consider necessary to administer the plan.
Payroll and Fringe Benefits Guarantee Trust Fund
Section 7.10. Each electrical contractor employing workmen under the terms of this Agreement shall deposit One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), free of interest, for a payroll and fringe benefits guarantee (including Credit Union Fund) up to Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) of payroll, but not over that amount, with the Trustees who shall function under a Trust Agreement to be agreed upon between the parties. If at any time, the interest accrued in the Payroll and Fringe Benefits Guarantee Trust Fund is depleted, each signatory contractor shall make an additional deposit into such fund of any amount up to One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), making a total of Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) maximum. Notice of such additional deposit shall be given by the Labor-Management Committee.
Net payroll checks shall be paid by the Electrical Industry Payroll and Fringe Benefits Guarantee Trust Fund to be agreed upon between the parties. Net payroll checks shall be paid by the Electrical Industry Payroll and Fringe Benefits Guarantee Trust Fund in a total amount not to exceed Two Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($2,250.00) maximum per employee.
A contractor who makes the payroll and fringe benefits deposit, and pays wages and fringe benefits to employees covered by this agreement, shall be absolved from all responsibilities with respect thereto. This payroll and fringe benefits deposit is in no respect a bond covering the contractor's payroll and fringe benefits obligation, but only an emergency fund to relieve employees' financial strain caused by issuing of bad checks or
32
failure of contractors to meet payroll, or failure of contractors to make fringe benefit contributions as provided in this agreement. If the contractor defaults in the foregoing, his/her liability shall be as set forth in the Trust Agreement but shall, in any event, include the following:
(1)	The contractor shall be liable for cost of enforcing collection, including but not limited to court costs, attorney fees, loss of earnings of an employee not paid, fringe benefits lost to an employee and any other expenses as determined by the Trustees to be the fault of such delinquent contractor.
(2)	The Trustees are authorized to institute whatever federal or state, civil or criminal actions as are necessary to enforce collection. Upon collection of defaulted payroll, or bad check, employees must reimburse the Payroll and Fringe Benefits Guarantee Trust Fund. Employees shall cooperate in every manner in regard to the collection of defaulted payroll, as requested by the Trustees.
(3)	The contractor must, within five (5) calendar days after notice from the Business Manager of Local Union No. 11, IBEW, make good any defaulted wages to his/her employees.
(4)	On the first default of payroll payments and/or fringe benefit payments the defaulting contractor shall, upon notice from the Trustees, furnish a surety or cash bond in an amount of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) as guarantee that wage payments and fringe benefit payments will be regularly made. On the second default of payroll and/or fringe benefit payments, the defaulting contractor shall furnish a bond or equivalent of at least Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000). The amount of bond may also be set by the Trustees by using the following formula:
Four (4) times the weekly wages and fringe benefits for all of said signatory contractor's employees covered by this agreement.
However, the amount of bond required in this instance shall not be less than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000). Failure to furnish the above-referred-to bond shall constitute cause for immediate cancellation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement at the option of the Local Union and the processing of all legal procedures necessary to enforce collection of defaulted amount, plus collection costs and interest involved. It shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Union to refuse to pennit persons covered by this Agreement to work on said job or project until all such wages and/or fringe benefits have been paid.
(5)	Whenever a contractor has definite knowledge that he is taking over a contract for a job that has been partially completed by another contractor, he/she shall notify the Local Union, in writing, in the area before starting work.
(6)	It is understood and agreed that this Payroll and Fringe Benefits Guarantee Trust Fund is considered a joint fund covering both the Inside and Outside Agreements
33
and groups of workmen. Consequently, contractors who are engaged in both Inside and Outside work shall make only one payroll and fringe benefits deposit to this Trust.
Rules, regulations and operations of the Payroll and Fringe Benefits Guarantee Trust Fund are as set forth in the Trust Agreement.
