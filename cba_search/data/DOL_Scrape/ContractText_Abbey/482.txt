5
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
4.2	GRIEVANCE/MEDIATION PROCEDURE
It is agreed that both the Company and the Union have a mutual interest in the settlement of differences through the grievance machinery as provided in this contract and that every effort should be made by both parties to see that differences are processed promptly and settled by the first level in the grievance procedure, if possible.
(a)	First Level
The employee or employees shall discuss the difference with the immediate supervisor either personally or through their Union representative. If the difference has not been settled within three working days, it may then be referred to the second level.
All unsettled differences shall be reduced to writing and, as necessary, referred to further levels. Such differences submitted by employees or by Union representatives in writing shall be answered in writing.
(b)	Second Level
Any unsettled grievance may be discussed at the second level conference provided it is referred to it within seventeen working days following its occurrence.
A conference for the purpose of settling the grievance may be held as mutually agreed to by the parties.
The second level conference shall consist of:
For Management—Manager and/or his/her designated representatives.
For Union — System Vice President and/or his/her representatives.
6
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
(c)	Third Level
Any unsettled grievance may be discussed at the third level conference provided it is referred to it within thirty calendar days after date of last second level conference and may be held as mutually agreed by the two parties.
The third level conference shall consist of not less than one representative of each party.
A written grievance may be filed directly with the third level conference within seven calendar days, starting with the day of occurrence, after an employee has been suspended or discharged for cause by the Company, or performs a work assignment under protest, or as described in Subsection 2.4 Question Regarding Application, or as described in Subsection 12.3, Change of Job Content.
If the grievance is still not settled, the parties agree to a grievance/mediation step, modeled after the Mediation Research & Education Project, Inc. (MREP) procedure, provided it is referred to it within thirty calendar days after the Union receives third level answers. The mediator’s fees and expenses of this step will be shared equally by the parties.
If the parties mediate a case and no settlement is reached, the mediator will provide a non-binding advisory opinion concerning the likely outcome in arbitration. The party who takes such a grievance to arbitration and does not do better in arbitration than the mediator’s predicted outcome will be responsible for paying 100% of the arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
If the grievance is still not settled, either party may request arbitration as hereinafter provided. The request must be made within thirty calendar days
7
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
after date last discussed and answered at either third level or the grievance/mediation step.
The Union may request that grievances involving a suspension, discharge, or demotion due to disciplinary action or unsatisfactory work performance, be placed at the top of the list of grievances for which arbitration has been requested. In addition, the Union may select one case of its choosing per month to be placed at the top of the list of grievances for which arbitration has been requested. The right to expedite cases as provided in the preceding sentences is recognized as the Union's unilateral right, and the Union's requests in this regard shall be honored by the Company. These procedural rights also extend to grievances over any indefinite separations or layoffs. Grievances in the categories referred to in this paragraph shall be scheduled for arbitration according to the date they were filed. If the Union elects to expedite the placement of any grievance involving a suspension, discharge, or demotion due to disciplinary action or unsatisfactory work performance, the Company shall have a right to have any other grievances involving discipline imposed on that grievant expedited and heard together with the grievance the Union had expedited.
4.3	DISPOSAL OF GRIEVANCES
All grievances at each level of the procedure described above shall be disposed of in one of the following ways:
(a)	By final settlement agreed to in writing by both parties.
(b)	By holding grievances over for further discussion by mutual agreement.
(c)	By referring grievances back to a lower level of the procedure for additional information or discussion by mutual agreement.
8
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
(d)	By referral to the next level in the grievance/mediation or arbitration procedure.
(e)	Failure by the aggrieved party to refer grievances to subsequent levels in the grievance/mediation or arbitration procedure within the specified time limits will constitute settlement.
No grievance shall be discussed at any level which was not processed through lower levels, except as described in Subsection 4.2, Grievance Procedure, (c) Third Level.
4.4	COMPENSATION FOR GRIEVANCE PROCESSING
Grievances handled at the first step of the grievance procedure will not ordinarily require employees or Union officials who may be involved to be off their jobs for any extended periods of time. Normally, such grievances will be handled during scheduled working hours.
Employees and their representatives who may be involved in conferences at first and second levels will be paid at regular rates for any hours within normal scheduled working time.
Not more than four Union officials will be compensated for attending the second level conference, but if the employees involved in the grievance discussed are required to attend by agreement between Company supervisors and Union officials, they will also be compensated on the same basis as Union officials.
Union officials attending third level meetings, or off on Union business other than mentioned above, shall not be compensated by the Company. When they are engaged in Union business in connection with
9
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
matters affecting this Company, on regularly scheduled workdays, those days shall be counted as days worked when determining eligibility for weekly overtime, provided the remaining scheduled days of the week are worked on their Company job.
4.5	AGREEMENTS PUT INTO EFFECT
Agreements on grievances reached at any level may be put into effect immediately for the particular grievance involved. Such settlements shall not prejudice any future similar grievances in the same or other groups or departments.
However, this does not apply to any settlement which has the effect of modifying the current contract. Such modifying settlements may be made in accordance with Section XXVIII, Amendments.
4.6	ATTENDANCE AT GRIEVANCE/MEDIATION MEETINGS OR NEGOTIATIONS
During the term of the General Labor Agreement, the Company and Union agree to meet upon notice and to negotiate in good faith any issues that may arise. All steps in the grievance process (except arbitration) are now considered Company business and as such would be paid time. Effective with the ratification of this contract, the Company shall pay wages for Union Officers (except for full time officers) and members for attendance at meetings or negotiations including activities related to third level grievance meetings, mid-term and full contract negotiations, and grievance/mediation process. For third level grievance meetings and negotiations, paid participants will be limited to the following numbers per contract year - 4 effective May 1, 2002, 4 effective May 1, 2003, 3 effective May 1, 2004, and 3 effective May 1, 2005.

LOCAL NO. 102
or rest pay. The Company shall not pay any expenses or ancillary charges (such as travel expenses including mileage or use of Company vehicles, meals/refreshments, lodging, overtime) for Union Officers and members to prepare for or attend such meetings or negotiations.
4.7	JOINT CONFLICT RESOLUTION TRAINING
With the goal of developing a more satisfactory working relationship between the Company and Union, the parties agree to engage in conflict resolution training to be conducted by MREP, beginning January 2003. The Company agrees to pay all the costs of such training.
Prior to beginning the grievance/mediation procedure, MREP will conduct training for those individuals who will be presenting grievances during the grievance/mediation process and the parties will share the costs of such training equally.
Section V - ARBITRATION
5.1	METHOD OF ARBITRATION
(a)	In the event of notice in writing by either party given to the other, that arbitration of any grievance is requested, two representatives from each the Company and the Union may meet within a period of seven days and attempt to agree upon a statement of issues and the method of arbitration. If no agreement has been reached by the Company and Union representatives within the seven-day period, each party shall appoint a representative on the Arbitration Board and shall notify the other party of such appointment in writing. Such appointment must be made within a period of fourteen days from the date that arbitration is requested, or the party failing to act forfeits its case.
11
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
The two arbitrators or their representatives named by the parties may meet and endeavor to agree upon the third member of the Arbitration Board. Failing such agreement within a period of seven working days after date of appointment of the Union and the Company arbitrators, either party may request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to furnish a list of names of seven qualified arbitrators. The Union and the Company arbitrators or their representatives shall endeavor to agree upon one of the seven names, and failing to agree within seven working days after the list is submitted, the Union and the Company arbitrators or their representatives shall cross off names in turn until only one remains, whereupon the remaining name shall be acceptable to both parties as the impartial member and Chairperson of the Arbitration Board.
(b)	Effective with the date of this Agreement and continuing until April 30, 2011, the following method shall be used to select the third member and Chairperson of the Arbitration Board:
A permanent list of seven qualified arbitrators who are all members of the American Arbitration Association shall be established. These arbitrators shall be selected from seven lists of seven qualified arbitrators provided by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. A Union and Management representative will cross off names on each list, in turn, until only one remains on each list. The seven names remaining will constitute the permanent list.
12
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
Each time a grievance is to be arbitrated, the parties will select an arbitrator from the permanent list, according to the present practice of alternating the opportunity to strike the first name.
If after the initial period noted above the parties agree, this method may be continued for another year, provided, however, that either party shall have the right to change, effective May 1, 2006, May 1, 2007, May 1, 2008, and May 1, 2009, and May 1, 2010 any or all of the seven names on the permanent list in accordance with the method of establishing the original list.
During the period this provision is in effect, if any member on the list is unable to serve, he/she shall be replaced immediately in accordance with the method establishing the original list. No arbitrator can be selected to hear a case unless the list contains seven names.
In the event the parties do not agree to continue this method beyond the initial period or subsequent extension, the method of selecting the Chairperson of the Arbitration Board shall revert to the procedure outlined in Section 5.1 (a).
5.2	AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATION BOARD
The Arbitration Board shall limit its consideration to the issue submitted for arbitration and shall not add to, subtract from, or alter the provisions of the Agreement. The decision of the Board, which shall be by majority vote, shall be based on the evidence submitted by both parties. The Board shall have no authority to render advisory awards or make recommendations unless the parties in a particular case specifically request in writing that it do so. Every decision of the Arbitration Board made within
13
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
the scope of its jurisdictional authority shall be submitted to both parties in writing and shall thereupon be binding upon the Company, the Union, and the employees.
5.3	EXPENSE OF ARBITRATION
Each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and shall share equally the expense of the impartial arbitrator, the cost of hearing room, and any other necessary costs which may be required by unanimous agreement of the Arbitration Board.
If the parties mediate a case and no settlement is reached, the mediator will provide a non-binding advisory opinion concerning the likely outcome in arbitration. The party who takes such a grievance to arbitration and does not do better in arbitration than the mediator’s predicted outcome will be responsible for paying 100% of the arbitrator’s fees and expenses.

If and when territorial changes are made in the Customer Operations Department involving the combining of service centers, areas, or the transfer of a section thereof from one service center or area to another, the employee's unit seniority date in the employee’s new service center or area shall be the same as his/her unit seniority date in his/her former service center or area.
9.10	JOB SENIORITY
In the Operations Unit of each of the separate Power Stations, where job seniority is recognized, job classifications are established in sequence for the purpose of training and advancement or promotion.
In the separate Power Station Operations Units, job seniority shall apply. Changes in the existing sequence of operating jobs shall be made only upon agreement of both parties to this Agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the rights of Management to eliminate any job or operation subject to the pertinent provisions of this Agreement.

Acceptance of a regular job in another unit within the station cancels all previous job seniority dates except as provided in case of bump-back or lay-off after transfer.
9.11	APPLICATION OF SENIORITY
Seniority shall prevail in transfers, promotions, bump-backs, and layoffs provided the employee with greater seniority is capable of performing the work available. Because of Management's responsibility for the operation of the Company's facilities, it is understood that Management must be the sole and final judge of a person's qualifications for employment or promotion, and that a person's ability to perform a job or to accept increased responsibility must be the primary consideration in employment and promotion.
Management's rights, as above stated, shall not be used arbitrarily to prevent promotion or to cause bump-back without just cause. It is the sense of this Agreement that the Company's policy, making available promotions for its employees wherever and whenever possible, shall be continued so that jobs will be filled by present or former employees whenever possible, before new employees are hired. The Company agrees not to effect permanent transfers of employees without their consent. Transfers, as used in this section of the Agreement, are defined as transfers which result in a change of job classification, department, service center, area, or living location. However, it is recognized that:
Employees in job classifications such as Meter Technicians who are hired and trained with the understanding that they are to hold themselves in readiness for future field assignments in any location must, as a condition of continued employment, accept transfers to an appropriate location at an appropriate time as determined by Management.
23
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
The Company agrees not to discriminate against members of the Union in any transfers or promotions.
The above provisions do not invalidate the individual practices sometimes used in specific departments, stations, divisions, or areas whereby outstanding ability has been mutually recognized in specific promotions.
Such promotions based on mutual agreement between the parties are not inconsistent with the provisions of this section.
In filling job vacancies, if it becomes necessary to select employees from outside units, it will continue to be the practice to regard seniority as the determining factor only if abilities and qualifications are relatively equal.
Seniority records shall be made available from the Company upon request of the Union.
9.12	SENIORITY ADJUSTMENTS BY TRANSFER
An employee who qualifies for transfer within his/her own unit, or to another unit, or to a position outside the bargaining unit and subsequently returns to a job in the bargaining unit, shall be entitled to adjusted seniority credit in the following manner:
(a) Seniority in the New Unit
Except as modified in Subsections 9.13 through 9.15, credit for seniority in previous units shall become effective in the new unit on an annual cumulative basis, year for year during the first five year period or part thereof in the new unit; i.e., at the end of the first year of employment in the new unit, the employee shall be credited with seniority from the previous unit up to one year, and at the end of
24
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
his/her second year of employment in the new unit, the employee shall be credited with seniority up to two years from the previous unit, and so on until the employee has been credited with all the seniority from his/her previous unit up to five years. If the employee possessed more than five years' seniority prior to his/her transfer, the employee shall, at the end of the five years in the new unit, be credited with all the seniority from his/her previous unit.
9.13	TRIAL PERIOD WHEN TRANSFERRED OR PROMOTED
An employee who qualifies for transfer or promotion does so for a trial period. This period will not exceed six months during which time the employee shall have the right to return or the Company shall have the right to return the employee to his/her former job. Such an employee retains his/her recognized seniority for the trial period.
9.14	WHEN RETURNING TO THE BARGAINING UNIT
When an employee returns to the bargaining unit, he/she shall be entitled to the job he/she previously held, or its equivalent, at the time of his/her transfer; and his/her job and unit seniority in that job and unit only will be adjusted by the length of time he/she was in the position outside of the bargaining unit. An employee thus affected will accrue job and unit seniority as described in Subsection 9.12 (a), Seniority in the New Unit. The application of this section will not result in the displacement or demotion of any bargaining unit employee.
9.15	SENIORITY IN PREVIOUS UNIT
If the employee remains in his/her new job after the trial period, he/she may not return to his/her previous job or unit except as provided above and in Section X, Job Vacancies, when a vacancy is advertised, or as provided in Subsection 9.23, Bump-Back and

9.16	TRANSFER IN LIEU OF LAYOFF
In order to avoid laying off an employee in a classification in which a work shortage exists, Management may, with Union concurrence, transfer an employee where work is available but no actual vacancy exists.
9.17	TRANSFER TO POSITIONS NOT COVERED BY AGREEMENT
An employee desiring to be considered for transfer to positions, other than those covered by Union agreement, may advise his/her supervisor of his/her desire for transfer and his/her qualifications. Management will give consideration to such applications and to other qualified Company employees in exercising its discretion in filling such vacancies.
Education, work experience, and length of Company service are considered in filling such vacancies.
9.18	PROMOTION
For the purpose of promotions, seniority shall be observed in the manner described below in the organization elements recognized for seniority purposes, as shown in Section IX, Seniority.
9.19	POWER STATION UNITS

9.20	ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT
In any unit of the Engineering and Construction Department, applicants shall be considered in order of their unit seniority, and the senior qualified applicant shall be first offered the job.

In the event there are no qualified applicants in any of the units corresponding to or matching the one in which the vacancy exists, applicants from other units shall be considered and Company seniority shall be the determining factor where abilities and qualifications are satisfactory and relatively equal.
9.23	BUMP-BACK AND LAYOFF
An employee bumped out of a job shall retain his/her rights to a future vacancy in that unit without the necessity of bidding, provided he/she does not give up his/her rights by refusing a pre-offered vacancy in the unit or does not exercise seniority by bidding and being accepted in another unit.

Such incapacitated employee may exercise his/her Company seniority and displace the employee with the latest seniority date in any classification for which he/she qualifies, and within any station, area, or department. The employee displaced may exercise his/her seniority in accordance with other provisions in Section IX Seniority. An employee who accepts a new job on this basis shall have the right to disqualify himself/herself or the Company shall have the right to disqualify him/her within a six-month period, and his/her rate of pay in a job classification to which he/she is then transferred shall be in accordance with the formula provided in this Section XI, Incapacitated Employees, as if it were at the time of incapacity.
If for any reason an incapacitated employee later becomes further incapacitated, he/she shall be assigned to another new job classification and be paid a rate of pay based on the formula in this Section XI, Incapacitated Employees, between the new job classification and the employee’s rate of pay as of the latest incapacity.
If the job occupied by an incapacitated employee is eliminated, or job content changed so he/she can no longer perform the additional duties, or an incapacitated employee is displaced by another incapacitated employee with greater Company seniority, he/she shall be given the opportunity to transfer to a new job classification for which he/she is qualified. His/her new rate of pay shall be in accordance with the formula in this Section XI, Incapacitated Employees, as if it were at the time of the original retrogression. His/her adjusted rate of pay shall include any general adjustments granted between the date of his/her original retrogression and the date assigned to the new classification.

11.2	WAGE RATE DETERMINATION
An employee with less than ten years of recognized service shall receive the rate of pay for the job to which he/she is assigned.

This rate shall be the rate of the new job plus a percentage of the difference in the rates between the new job and the old job. Such percentage shall be equal to 3.2% times the number of years of recognized service with a maximum of 80% for twenty-five years and over.
An incapacitated employee to whom Workers' Compensation is to be paid will receive a total pay which is equal to the amount under the formula in this Section XI, Incapacitated Employees, or what is due him/her under the Workers' Compensation Laws, whichever is higher. If the employee receives an amount due under the Workers' Compensation Laws, he/she will receive such amount for a period set forth by law and then receive the rate of pay to which he/she is entitled under this Section XI, Incapacitated Employees, determined at the date of incapacity.

ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
Names on the call-out list shall be in the order of seniority.
Call-out lists shall be classified as follows:
(a)	Primary Lines List - includes all lead lineworkers, night lineworkers, lineworkers A, appliance repairworkers, installers A, and serviceworkers A.
(b)	Secondary Lines List - includes all lineworkers B and serviceworkers B.

Except when specific qualifications are needed, employees will be called in rotation and once called, will not be called again until all other employees on the list have been called.
46
ALLEGHENY ENERGY

B.	Ready Response: Call Truck
At Service Center locations where the call truck is in effect, call-outs normally will be first assigned to employees on call truck duty.
Truck can be kept at home or mutually agreed nearby location.
Lines
a.	Qualified employee call truck list
1.	Call truck list to rotate on weekly basis (Friday evening - Friday morning). In the event Friday is a holiday, the employee will return the truck to the service center at the regular quitting time to exchange it with the employee who has responsibility for that period. The two employees may agree to a different, reasonable location for the truck exchange. No compensation will result from this exchange.
b.	Management will determine the number of call trucks needed by location. Additional trucks will be considered based on the volume of calls or the number of hours worked. Call trucks will be limited to service bucket(s), service truck(s), pickup(s), or van(s) with the employee’s option to select the truck(s) as designated available by management.
c.	Weekly fee of $280 ($40/day) will be paid with cellular phone and/or pager provided by Company.

1.	For transportation only.
2.	When using for non-Company use, travel must be limited to a 25-mile radius from home.
3.	Travel time to and from home for regular work assignments will not be compensated.
Employees that take the Call Truck will be available for out-of-town requests for work if a replacement is obtained from the Absence Lines Replacement List.

For the purposes of this provision only, the Call Truck shall be considered reassigned to the next person on Friday at the normal quitting time presently assigned.
f.	Assignment Sequence:
1.	There will be three lists available for Ready Response Call Truck: Total Qualified List, Voluntary Lines List and Voluntary Absence Lines Replacement List. The Total qualified list will contain all qualified employees listed by Unit Seniority.
48
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
2.	No employee’s name can appear on the Voluntary Lines List more than once, and no employee can have the call truck for more than two consecutive weeks. Qualified employees can sign up by seniority for the Voluntary Lines List on the first working day of each month. After the initial list is established, additional volunteers are added to the end of the current list.
3.	Employees that sign up for the Absence Lines Replacement List will be listed by seniority and will rotate from the top. If the employee who has the truck for the week is legitimately unable to carry out his duties for any or all of the week, the Company will go to the top of the Absence Lines Replacement List and ask employees from the top if they are able to fill in and take the truck for all or any of the week. If no one is available from this list, the employee that is pegged on the Total Qualified List must take the truck. For partial weeks, the daily fee is $40/day.
4.	Employee must notify Customer Service Center if not available to respond.
49
ALLEGHENY ENERGY	LOCAL NO. 102
5.	End of day trouble calls (those that occur during the last half hour of the work day) will normally be assigned according to the following order:
a.	Qualified employees already working and available in accordance with local workplace agreement or practice.
b.	The Ready Response Truck (s).
c.	Lineworkers/Serviceworkers
If no one has signed on the Voluntary List and a replacement cannot be obtained from the Absence Lines Replacement List, the least senior employee that is pegged on the Total Qualified list will be forced to take the truck for the week. As soon as the employee meets their requirement, the peg is moved up to the next least senior. The peg will bypass an employee under the forcing provision if they are unable to fulfill the requirement due to vacation, jury duty, bereavement, previously scheduled PC days or sick (with written excuse).
The second truck will be manned by volunteers (except as hereinafter provided) and response opportunity would be rotated with the primary Ready Response Call Truck. The second truck, if any, would be called prior to running the primary list. The second truck may also be assigned back-up responsibility in an adjacent 102 location, if the appropriate adjacent Service Center list has been exhausted.
50
ALLEGHENY ENERGY	LOCAL NO. 102
If the Company has designated a need for a second Ready Response Call T ruck for a weekend, for which there are no volunteers, the Company may assign the next available qualified person from the Total Qualified list to man the second Ready Response Call Truck for Saturday (beginning at normal starting time) and Sunday coverage (ending at normal starting time Monday). The peg will bypass an employee under the forcing provision if they are unable to fulfill the requirement due to vacation, jury duty, bereavement, previously scheduled PC days or sick (with written excuse). An employee forced to take the Call Truck on Saturday and Sunday may choose to take the assignment on Friday and receive the additional per diem amount.
Two separate Total Qualified Lists will be maintained for those Service Centers whereby a weekly and weekend Call Truck have been established.
Otherwise, the second ready response truck process will be handled as described above.
13.12	PREARRANGED OR SCHEDULED OVERTIME
With respect to equalization, the distribution of prearranged or scheduled overtime work to qualified employees within the recognized units shall be continued in accordance with present practice.
13.13	FILLING FINAL OVERTIME REGUIREMENTS

13.14	SHIFT EMPLOYEES
A shift employee occupies a job which must be filled each day of the week except as noted under Subsection 13.16, Work Schedule for Shift Employees, and may require work on one, two, or three shifts per day.
13.15	SHIFT DESIGNATION
Working hours included in the three shifts each day shall be designated as Day, Afternoon, and Night shifts in accordance with regular starting time being between the hours of:
Day Shift........4	a.m. and 11:59 a.m.
Afternoon Shift ... 12 noon and 7:59 p.m. Night Shift......8	p.m. and 3:59 a.m.
13.16	WORK SCHEDULE FOR SHIFT EMPLOYEES
Unless otherwise stated in this agreement, the regular schedule for shift employees shall include six consecutive eight-hour days on the same shift each day, followed by two days off in each eight-day period. However, it is understood by both parties that due to load conditions, it will not be necessary for all designated shift employees to work the above schedule, and Management shall have the right, subject to the Union's right to file a grievance, to institute a schedule for certain shift employees which shall consist of a Monday-through-Friday work week.
Individual changes in schedules necessary to fill vacancies caused by promotions, sickness, vacations, absences, etc., shall be arranged as far in advance as possible and with a minimum of overtime.
13.17	TEMPORARY VACANCIES FOR SHIFT EMPLOYEES
A temporary shift vacancy shall be filled by advancing a qualified operator below the vacancy in
52
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
the same crew, filling the resultant vacancies in the lower positions in that crew in the same manner, with the vacancy in the lowest position or in a single position crew being filled by a non-shift employee, if this can be done at straight time. If overtime must be paid to fill the original vacancy or a resultant vacancy, the first shift of the original vacancy shall be filled by one of the three remaining operators who work the same job in which the vacancy occurs. The order in which this distribution is made to these operators shall be continued in accordance with the present practice. At locations where it has been the practice to assign such overtime to the employee on shift, an employee who has completed four hours or more at the beginning of the shift on the job in which the vacancy occurs, shall be assigned to work such overtime.
After the first shift, or on the first shift if it cannot be filled in accordance with the procedure outlined above, a vacancy shall be filled in one of the following ways, consistent with the principle of minimizing overtime:
(a)	By advancing the qualified operators within the crew in which the vacancy occurs as outlined above, using a nonshift employee to fill in, at straight time if possible, or at overtime if necessary, or
(b)	By advancing the operators within the crew in which the vacancy occurs as far as possible, filling the vacancy which cannot be filled in this manner by advancing a qualified operator from another crew in a position below the vacancy, advancing the operators within the crew and filling the lowest position by a non-shift employee. If a
53
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
position in the second crew cannot be filled in this manner, the procedure outlined in the preceding sentence shall be followed and so on; or
(c)	By one of the three remaining operators on same job in which the vacancy occurs working an additional shift. The order in which this distribution is made to these three operators shall be continued in accordance with present practice; or
(d)	By some other arrangement. The method being used (as outlined in Subsection 13.17, Temporary Vacancies for Shift Employees) to fill a vacancy may be changed to minimize the payment of overtime.
13.18	VACATION VACANCIES
Vacation vacancies shall be filled beginning with the first shift by advancing the regular operators within the crew if possible and filling the lowest position by a non-shift employee, or by assigning vacation relief operators if necessary. Arrangements so made shall continue for the duration of the vacancy.
13.19	PERMANENT VACANCIES
Permanent vacancies shall be filled in accordance with Section IX, Seniority.
13.20	OVERTIME HOURS WORKED BY SHIFT EMPLOYEES OR SUBSTITUTES

13.21	OVERTIME PAYMENT FOR SHIFT EMPLOYEES
(a)	Overtime provisions under Subsections
13.5 through 13.9 shall apply.
(b)	Change of Schedule
Time-and-one-half shall be paid for all or any part of each first shift worked that is a change from any regular schedule to which an operator has been assigned, except when he/she does not have a change in daily work time. This provision does not apply when an employee returns to his/her regular schedule (See Subsection 20.5, Change of Schedule).
Employees are permitted to trade shifts by mutual consent only if no overtime results from the trade.
Employees required to work an additional shift in a twenty-four hour period shall be paid change of schedule on the day following provided the employee continues to work the new schedule.
(c)	Rest Days
Time-and-one-half shall be paid for hours worked on the first scheduled day off and double time shall be paid for hours worked on their second scheduled day off, which would have been his/her days off on the old shift, when a shift employee is transferred between crews at the request of the
55
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
Company. This provision does not apply to the return of a shift employee to his/her regular crew. This provision also does not apply to subsequent transfers between crews unless the shift employee has become attached to the crew from which he/she is to be transferred.
A shift employee transferred to another crew shall become attached to that crew as soon as he/she has worked continuously for one full period of six consecutive days with that crew. Overtime shall not be paid for loss of days off when transfers are made at the request of the Union.

Normal weekly work schedules shall be posted and remain in effect as normal schedules until changed in accordance with provisions herein described or by posting changed schedules which shall be done not later than 3 p.m. Friday of the week previous to that in which the change is to be made.
Scheduling of work periods for time other than during daylight hours shall be limited insofar as possible to essential work requirements such as filling operating assignments, condenser cleaning, certain janitor assignments, major maintenance work, and emergencies.

Thereafter, shift operating work on Sunday shall be paid for on the basis of a shift employee's schedule until he/she is returned to nonshift work. It shall not be construed that a shift schedule has been interrupted when an employee is used on non-shift work to give him/her forty straighttime hours in a week.
Except for the overtime provision for work on the first Sunday, a non-shift employee shall follow the provisions applying to shift employees as long as he/she continues to work as a shift employee. When the employee is returned to non-shift work, he/she shall follow the provisions applying to non-shift employees and he/she shall not be paid time-and-one-half or double time for work on days which would have been his/her days off on the shift schedule.
Upon completion of a shift assignment, there shall be no requirement to schedule a short swing shift at overtime in order to return the employee to his/her non-shift schedule, unless this is necessary in order to provide a minimum of forty hours in the week. Overtime shall not be paid for a change of schedule when the employee is returning to his/her regular non-shift job.

Section XV INCLEMENT WEATHER
15.1	LINES, INSTALLER, SERVICE, AND SUBSTATIONS
Employees engaged in the construction and maintenance of lines and substations will not be required to do work outdoors in inclement weather on jobs which can reasonably be deferred until weather conditions are less severe.

Examples of when work cannot be deferred are when there is an emergency, which is a combination of circumstances which calls for immediate action consistent with the safety of employees, or when it is necessary to protect life and property or to restore or maintain customer service.
It is the supervisor’s responsibility to determine when weather conditions are too severe for the work at hand with due regard to the nature of work to be performed, temperature, wind velocity, precipitation, snow or ice accumulation on ground or structures, availability of shelter or combination of these factors. In general, temperatures of 10°F. or lower will be considered inclement weather for lineworkers, installers, or serviceworkers required to work on pole tops, towers, or structures. It is recognized that weather too inclement for climbing may not be considered inclement for work involving less exposure or exposure of shorter durations.

In such cases, all time will be considered working hours, including time spent in eating meals.
16.5	OPPORTUNITY TO EAT MEALS
When it is known in advance that an employee will be entitled to a meal by reason of working two or more consecutive hours past his/her normal quitting time as provided in Subsection 16.1(a), opportunity for eating the meal will be provided at the first convenient time following completion of his/her eighth hour of work.

During each one-year period from May 1 to May 1, an employee shall be paid sick pay beginning with his/her first day off sick on no more than his/her first two specific illnesses or injuries, except when illness or injury is of an occupational nature and employee is entitled to receive Workers' Compensation. After the first two specific illnesses or injuries, an employee shall be paid sick pay beginning with the 25th consecutive scheduled hour off as determined by his/her normal working schedule. Beginning with the 25th consecutive hour, the employee will be paid in accordance with the schedule shown above.
When an employee is entitled to receive Workers' Compensation, he/she shall be paid sick pay beginning with his/her first day off and the incident shall not be counted in determining the first two specific illnesses or injuries as stated above.
If an employee is absent from work more than once during any consecutive twelve-month period, the off-time pay allowance will be granted as often or as long as is permitted within the schedule shown above until the full provisions have been entirely used.
To qualify for these wage allowances, the employee must be a regular employee and have completed one year of continuous service. The employee must present satisfactory evidence of inability to work due to such illness or injury; adopt such remedial measures as may be commensurate with his/her disability; and/or permit such reasonable examinations by the Company's medical department representatives as in its judgment may be necessary to ascertain the employee's condition. Unless prevented by his/her own physical incapacity, the employee must report to his/her supervisor or the

ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
supervisor's designee the cause of his/her absence prior to the beginning of the scheduled workday.
Unless specifically allowed by Management, no wage allowance, as provided for in this section, will be paid if the disability is the result of the use of drugs or intoxicants; or the result of the employee's own gross negligence or misconduct; or the result of a chronic ailment which existed and was known to the employee at the time of his/her employment by the Company.
No wage allowance will be paid after an employee is laid off or if the injury or illness was incurred while on leave of absence, furlough, or suspension from work. However, no employee will be laid off to avoid the payment of sick pay. Time actually paid in accordance with these provisions shall not be deducted from the employee's vacation. An employee may deduct from his/her vacation time the number of days of waiting period. When a holiday occurs during an employee's period of sick leave, an additional day of sick leave is allowed when the holiday occurs within the first fourteen calendar days of sick leave. Days for which employees receive holiday pay shall not be counted as part of the waiting period under this regulation.
When an employee is absent from work due to an occupational illness or injury, and is entitled to receive Workers' Compensation, sick pay allowance will be used on an hourly equivalent basis to supplement the difference between the legal rate of compensation and sick pay entitlement. No sick pay allowance will be used or charged when the legal rate of compensation is greater than sick pay entitlement.
When an employee becomes sick on the job and leaves his/her work before completing his/her normal
92
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
hours of work, the employee shall only be paid for hours worked and that day shall be considered the first day of his/her waiting period. However, if it is one of the first two specific illnesses or injuries within the year period and he/she returns to work the next scheduled workday, he/she may elect not to count that part of a day as sick leave.
Sick pay, on the basis of the sick pay schedule given above, will be paid for a multiple-rate employee at the appropriate wage rate for the employee's basic job.
The hours allowed under the sick pay schedule for employees who are used as operators part of the time and as maintenance employees part of the time shall be determined in accordance with their basic work schedule, regardless of the schedule they may be working at the time the lost time occurs. If they have no basic work schedule, they will be paid on the basis of five eight-hour days per week, Monday to Friday, inclusive.
Increases in sick allowances shall become effective at the beginning of the pay period in which the employment anniversary occurs.
22.2	WEEKLY RATED EMPLOYEES
All of the provisions stated in Subsection 22.1, Hourly Rated Employees, shall apply to those regular employees who on April 30, 1971, were classified as weekly rated employees except that there shall be no waiting period at any time before permissible sick pay allowance is made and provided that such employees remain in a job that was considered weekly rated as of April 30, 1971.

Section XXIII HOSPITALIZATION AND MEDICAL/DENTAL/VISION CARE
23.1	The Union accepts responsibility to administer all details of a hospitalization and medical plan for employees covered by Section I, Recognition, which is satisfactory to the majority of union-represented employees.
If the retiree reaches age sixty-five or begins receiving Medicare benefits and the spouse is not eligible, the spouse and dependents may continue coverage until the spouse reaches age sixty-five or begins receiving Medicare benefits, so long as the retiree is living, by continuing to pay the same premium as though the retiree were still an active employee.
If an early retired employee dies, the surviving spouse may elect to continue hospitalization coverage until age sixty-five or upon receipt of Medicare benefits. Should the spouse make this election, then the Company will contribute 50% of the then current Company contribution rate for the appropriate coverage until such time a spouse reaches age sixty-five or upon receipt of Medicare benefits.
The monthly cost of the Hospitalization and Medical Plan for contract year May 1, 2001 through April 30, 2002 did not increase from the plan year 2000-2001 premium levels. For contract years May 1, 2002 through April 30, 2003, and May 1, 2003 through April 30, 2004, and effective upon implementation of the Union PPO plan, the parties agree to the following cost sharing formula for any premium increases, and the Company contribution level will not be reduced for the term of the labor contract:

Effective May 1, 2006, all new members/employees represented by UWUA Local 102 will not be eligible for post-retirement medical benefits. Current employees represented by UWUA Local 102 as of April 30, 2006 shall continue to be covered by the remaining provisions outlined under Section XXIII of

the General Labor Agreement as it related to postretirement medical benefits.
23.2	If an employee dies as a result of an accident on the job on or after May 1, 1992, his/her dependents who are covered at the time of death may continue medical plan coverage by paying the same premium rate as active employees under the appropriate type of coverage. If the spouse is pregnant at the time of employee's death, the newborn child/ren will be covered under the appropriate type of coverage at the same premium rate as active employees.
Coverage for spouse will continue until eligible under any other group plan, Medicare, or remarriage. Dependent children will be eligible under the same conditions as dependents of active employees.

The premiums and contributions paid on a pre-tax basis will not be subject to federal, social security (FICA), and in some cases state taxes. Premium payments under this arrangement will be deducted from wages before taxes, thereby resulting in lower taxable income.

The objective of the Company is to provide stable, long-term, and continuous employment for all regular operating and maintenance employees. The Company will employ no contractor to do work which is customarily and regularly done by the regular employees of the Company, without the approval of the Union, if the employment of the contractor will directly or indirectly result in the necessity for the layoff of regular employees who are willing, able, and qualified to perform the work being contracted. Subject to the above limitation, it is recognized that the Company must retain sole discretion to determine when and by whom contract work shall be done. It is recognized that the Company may need to contract with outside parties as has been its practice, especially where the Company's normal working force, the skills, training, and organization of its employees, its tools or equipment, are inadequate for performing the work in addition to normal duties in an efficient manner or within the time the work must be done.

Therefore, it is agreed that any section of this Agreement which is subsequently found to be at variance with any applicable law, shall become inoperative for the balance of the term of this Agreement.
It is further agreed that should any section of this Agreement become inoperative in the manner noted above, the other sections and provisions of this Agreement which are not in conflict with the law, shall continue in full force and effect for the term of this Agreement.

(e)	In like manner, when an employee fails to receive notice of cancellation by reason of being unavailable or for failure to answer his/her telephone when his/her supervisor has made reasonable effort to contact him/her within the specified time, the employee forfeits his/her right to minimum overtime allowance.

ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
1.	Attrition by Location:
When a vacancy occurs, the normal process of filling the vacancy as described, but not limited to, Section 10 of the General Labor Agreement will be followed. If this process is unsuccessful, qualified excess* employees living within a reasonable commute of the work location will be required to fill the vacancy.
Reasonable commute is defined as the greater of 30 minutes or the employee's current drive. Reasonable commute may be greater with the employee's consent.
2.	The Company may move excess personnel (Division Operations, Engineering and Construction, and Power Stations units) into lower-rated jobs at 90% of their current rate or the new classification rate, whichever is higher, subject to any future wage adjustments. Affected employees will remain classified at their excessed classification.
(Example: Substation Electrician A moved to Meter Reader A will remain classified as Substation Electrician A.) Upon first opening in previous classification, excessed employees, by seniority, will be restored to their previous classification, without the necessity of bidding unless they accept a bid into another classification. No excess personnel movement will take place before February 1, 1997. Management will earnestly attempt to expedite the retraining and progression process so as to restore the affected employees to their previous level of compensation. This process will be based on the abilities of the employee and availability of the required training.
If an excess employee bids into an opening, the employee will be classified at the new position and
114
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
retain 90% of their previous excessed classification rate as noted above.
*Excess: Is defined as employees who exceed the recommended staffing levels by position as shown in Attachment A. Attachment A is to be used to define excess employees only and is not to be construed as a guarantee of employment or staffing levels (except as referenced in operating unit resource sharing).
Section XXXVIII
UNANTICIPATED LAYOFFS
The Company does not anticipate a layoff during the term of this agreement. In the event of an unanticipated layoff, the Company and the Union will meet with the intention of working together to minimize the need for such a layoff.
If an unanticipated layoff occurs, an early retirement program with benefits equal to those then offered to non-bargaining unit physical employees and/or the program as noted in the Reduction by Attrition Process, will be offered to employees in the affected area. Company will offer by locations a proposed agreed upon Early Retirement Program. After determining effects of offer, the Company will retain the right to withdraw the proposed offer of the agreed upon Early Retirement Program to those employees whose position would result in a vacancy for which there are no current qualified Allegheny employees represented by UWUA Local 102 at that location. With respect to the Early Retirement Program, the company reserves the right to establish the applicable eligibility date, the election window period, and the retirement dates that will be applicable to any early retirements relating to future layoffs. If the desired levels are not met through this offer, then the excess employees may exercise their bumping rights per the General Labor Agreement.
115
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
Employees who have exhausted their bumping rights will be seriously considered for openings in the Apprentice Lineworker position, provided they meet the minimum qualifications. If upon completion of the above two programs the desired staffing levels are not met, then the Company will lay off affected employees and offer a forced separation program with benefits equal to those then offered to nonbargaining unit physical employees or if none exist, the parties will negotiate a forced separation program. The period of negotiations is not to exceed seven days in session. It is further understood that Section XXIV (Separation Allowance) will be applicable if another separation program is not agreed to. Those employees will retain recall rights as set forth in the General Labor Agreement.
Section XXXIX
RESOURCE SHARING OPERATING UNIT
1.	The following provisions in the area of Resource Sharing are applicable to Customer Operations and Engineering and Construction. These provisions are not applicable to Power Stations.

Section XL
RESOURCE SHARING POWER STATIONS
At times the Company may have a need to ask power station employees to work at another location within the region. This concept of Resource Sharing established the basis by which the employee will report directly to the required work location. Various elements of this concept are listed below. The intent of Resource Sharing is to reduce costs and reduce the need for contracting out work.
1.	The following provisions on the use and procedures which shall be followed in the area of Resource Sharing are applicable to power stations:
(a)	Resource sharing crews will be assigned hours not to exceed those of
119
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
the personnel of the home station. Does not include travel time.
(b)	Will be voluntary.
(c)	If too many volunteers, then selections
will be on a seniority rotating basis.
2.	Job site reporting compensation for travel time/paid mileage will be:
(a)	The Company will pay the IRS standard for the difference in increased travel distance from the employee's normal reporting location, but not to exceed the distance between the two stations (applies to each direction).
(b)	The Company will pay wages for the additional time of driving (applies to each direction) the difference between the employee's normal driving time and the driving time to the job site. This will be established on a 15 minute interval (rounded forward to the nearest 15 minutes), per round trip. Under no circumstances will an employee be eligible for duplication of wages.
(c)	Travel distance and time will be established by the employee (first time) and mutually agreed upon by management.
3.	Company will establish two lists (1 mechanical and 1 electrical). Company's intent and effort will be to equalize opportunities between the lists.
4.	If used for less than one day, the limits listed above will be lifted, but paid in the same manner as 2 (a) and (b).

5.	Travel time will not be included in meal eligibility calculation (except for travel between Power Stations when required).
Section XLI
POWER STATIONS CROSS TRAINING
The Company proposes to establish the team concept in the power stations. Cross training is an important element in this concept.
All members of Local 102 currently employed by West Penn Power at power station locations on May 1, 1996 shall be considered grandfathered, relative to required cross training, in their current job progression and cross training shall be on a voluntary basis only.
For new employees hired after May 1, 1996, cross training shall be considered a requirement of all job descriptions on the Production and Bulk Material Handling Teams.
Acceptance of a bid into another classification on the Production or the Bulk Material Handling Teams after May 1, 1996 voids employees’ grandfathered status, and cross training shall be required. Section 9.13 of the General Labor Agreement applies and employee who returns to a former position within the six-month period does not forfeit the grandfather status.
Open Progression will be offered to grandfathered employees who volunteer and successfully cross train.
Progression Definitions
Open Progression - Progressing to allowed level based on qualifications. No vacancy is required.
121
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
Natural Progression - Progressing only when a regular vacancy exists.
The existing units will not change. Below is an example of how the existing units will be assigned to teams:

Shift Maintenance
Operations Unit
Equipment Service Team -
Maintenance (1)
Maintenance (2)
(Hatfield only)
Reserve Operator/Labor Unit
Results/Chemical Unit
Stores/Clerical Unit
Bulk Material Handling -
Coal and Ash Unit
(Armstrong and Hatfield)
Coal, Lime, and Ash Unit
(Mitchell)
New Operator/Technician (Op/Tech) position titles will be established and shall be related to the existing job positions as stated below unless otherwise agreed.
Op/Tech - Jobs for each station (See Attachment F).
Op/Tech Operators will cross train to the "C max" level in maintenance.
Op/Tech Maintenance employees on the production team will cross train to the first position of Op/ Tech Operations. These positions will be "B" Attendant (Armstrong), "C" Attendant (Hatfield), Chief Operator
122
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
(Lake Lynn), and Fixation Equipment Operator (Mitchell). At Armstrong, if the shift reserve operator (Op/Tech II) position exists in the future, it will be the entry level position and will be bid.
The following cross training is proposed for the Bulk Material Team:
Op/Tech Coal Handling will cross train in Maintenance to the "C max" level. Any other cross training would be subject to management needs and approval. It would also be voluntary on the part of the employees and offered on a seniority basis. After May 1, 1996, any new hire or current employee entering into the Coal and Ash Unit will have open progression which is limited to the Op/Tech III position.

8.	This agreement only applies to members of the System Substation Electrician Crew. All other terms of the GLA apply if not superseded herein.
Section XLV Customer Satisfaction
The Company and the Union agree that improving customer satisfaction is critical for the Company, the Union, the employees it represents, and the public in general. A critical aspect of customer satisfaction is the ability of bargaining unit employees to respond to emergency call-outs. As such, all Lineworkers (including Weekend Lineworker positions), Serviceworkers and Utilityworkers will be required to work at least a minimum of 150 hours of overtime during each respective contract year period and accept at least 10 call-outs during the same period. Additionally, the parties agree to devote their best efforts to improve customer satisfaction and the callout acceptance rate during the term of this agreement.
141
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
The Company will consider in addition to its Customer Satisfaction indicators (CAIDI and SAIDI), items such as the following:
1.	Improvements to the dispatch function; including trouble call procedures during normal daylight operation.
2.	Number of call-out responses
3.	Call-out percentages
4.	Ready Response Call Truck
participation rates
5.	Employee unavailability (sickness, etc.)
The Company will provide the Local Union President with overtime hours worked and call-out response rates, on a quarterly basis.
If however, after conducting a respective threemonth and six-month review subsequent to the implementation of the various customer improvement components, the Company determines that additional improvements are needed, the Company may provide written notice to the Union of its desire to open discussions addressing such issues. If the parties fail to reach agreement, they then will proceed to interest arbitration for the establishment of an remedy.
Upon receipt of such written notice, the parties will attempt to select an arbitrator to hear the dispute, who is not on the Panel of Permanent Arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree on a neutral arbitrator, the parties jointly will request the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) to provide a list of seven neutral arbitrators. The panel will be drawn from the AAA’s complex dispute resolution roster of arbitrators.
142
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
The parties will choose one neutral arbitrator from the list by alternatively striking names from the list until only one name remains. The parties will determine the order of striking by the flip of a coin. The winner of the coin toss will have the choice to strike first or second. The selected arbitrator will conduct hearings to receive sworn testimony, exhibits and other evidence in order to create a full and complete record on the appropriate remedy. The order of presentation of the parties’ cases before the arbitrator will be set by mutual agreement of the parties.
In the event of a failure to reach mutual agreement regarding the order of presentation, the arbitrator will resolve the matter [by a coin toss].
The scheduling of the hearing and closing argument will be determined by the arbitrator, but in no event will the hearing be scheduled beyond 30 calendar days after the arbitrator’s appointment, except upon mutual agreement of the parties.
At the commencement of the hearing, the Company and Union shall each submit to the arbitrator their final offer of remedy. The arbitrator’s authority shall be limited to awarding only one or the other of the two remedies submitted. If post-hearing briefs are agreed upon, they will be submitted no later than fifteen (15) calendar days after the close of the record, in lieu of closing arguments.
The arbitrator shall render his decision within fifteen (15) calendar days after the close of the record, or the submission of post-hearing briefs, whichever is later.

STIPULATIONS
Disciplinary records over two years old will not be used against an employee, providing such employee has no further infractions or reprimands during that period.
Such records may, however, be used during discussion of grievances, arbitration hearings, and hearings before other agencies as evidence of how similar disciplinary action was handled in prior cases.

Safety Timeout Process
Purpose
The purpose of this process is to provide a method which has been mutually agreed to by both Allegheny Energy Supply and Utility Workers Union of America Local 102 representatives to satisfactorily resolve employees safety concerns during the performance of work activities in power stations. This process does not supersede the use of the four-step job procedure, including the job location conference.
Process
1.	When an employee during the execution of a work assignment has good reason to believe that performance of the work as initially directed will result in an unsafe condition and this condition is beyond that which can be corrected by using OSHA approved control method available to him, i.e., personal protective equipment, etc., the employee has the right to declare a safety timeout. This declaration of a safety timeout will apply to the specific concern as identified by the employee.
2.	Once an employee has declared a safety timeout, the following steps shall be taken:
145
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
a.	The employee shall inform the responsible member of supervision to which he/she is reporting what his specific safety concern is. The employee and the supervisor shall attempt to resolve this issue to the employee’s satisfaction that the specific safety concern has been alleviated. If a member of the joint safety committee is available on site or someone else is on site with knowledge of the situation, they can become involved in the process at the request of either the employee or a member of supervision. In the event that the issue cannot be dealt with to the employee’s or supervisor’s satisfaction the process should proceed to the next step.
b.	The supervisor shall notify a member of the next level of management that a safety timeout has been declared and the details of the specific safety concern of the employee. This representative of management shall attempt to resolve the concerns of the employee. If necessary, appropriate members of the joint safety committee, union representatives, etc., shall be requested to become involved to achieve a resolution which is acceptable to all parties.
c.	In the event no satisfactory resolution can be achieved and the management of the station deems the employees safety concerns are unwarranted and performance of the assigned work
146
ALLEGHENY ENERGY
LOCAL NO. 102
activity is critical in nature, the work may be performed by others. At this time, involvement of a union representative shall be mandatory and any resultant disputes will be handled utilizing the General Labor Agreement between Allegheny Energy Supply and the Utility Workers Union of America Local 102.
d.	In order to resolve the dispute the parties may conduct a safety process review of the result, which will be recorded and examined by the joint safety committee. The joint safety committee will agree on a safe procedure to accomplish the task and communicate to employees for future use. Either party may contact the appropriate safety professional for review and assistance.
3. It is the expectation of both parties that this process will not be abused and that declaration of a timeout will occur for legitimate safety concerns. In that case no disciplinary action will be taken against any employee involved in the safety timeout process.
