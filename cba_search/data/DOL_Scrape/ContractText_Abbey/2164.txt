Section 6.	Overtime Assignments. The Employer determines staffing requirements, including if and when overtime will be required, and nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the Employer’s right to require overtime work, provided it pays the
8
employees on the basis herein. The definition of department is: Production, Maintenance, Juice Preparation, Material Handling, and Sanitation. Employees will be scheduled on their respective shifts first. Daily unscheduled overtime will be first offered to the person performing the job. If a more senior classified operator wants to claim daily scheduled overtime for the following week, they may do so, but will be required to work that job for the full week, unless mutually agreed upon. Daily overtime during commissioning (scheduled or unscheduled) will be first offered to the person performing the job. For the purpose of clarification, daily scheduled overtime is anticipated and assigned on the manpower log in the week prior. Daily unscheduled overtime is work that occurs during a particular work week that is unplanned, and therefore is not assigned on the weekly manpower log. Unplanned vacancy is defined as a vacancy during a particular work day due to illness, injury, or unanticipated absence. When the unplanned vacancy results in overtime, the Employer must make an attempt to offer this overtime, by order of plant seniority, to the employees in the original effected classifications utilizing the following method: The Employer and the Union agree to create a voluntary call-in list, to be updated annually in August. This list will provide names of employees who agree to work overtime, and the telephone number al which the Employee can be reached. Should an employee decline overtime on three (3) consecutive occasions, their name shall be removed from the call-in list until the next annual update.
Employees who want to work overtime must indicate such by utilizing the designated volunteer method.
(1)	Employees will sign up for the day they wish to be available for overtime in their department and/or plant-wide on the corresponding daily overtime sheets.
(2)	Employees who wish to remove their name from the overtime sheet must give notification to the Employer prior to the final assignment.
9
(3)	When a scheduled overtime assignment becomes available, the Employer will utilize the following procedures:
(a)	Overtime for classified jobs first will be assigned to the highest senior employee within the department on that shift holding the particular classified job and who signed the sheets; next, the overtime will be assigned to the highest senior employee within the department holding the particular classified job and who signed the sheets.
(b)	If the overtime cannot be filled based on part a), the overtime will be assigned to the highest senior qualified employee within the department, and who signed the daily overtime sheet. In the event employees volunteer from both adjacent shifts, the overtime will be split between the two high senior qualified volunteers of those shifts.
(c)	If the overtime cannot be filled based on part a),or b) the overtime will be assigned to the highest senior qualified employee who signed the daily plant-wide overtime sheet.
(d)	If qualified temporary employees are available, they will be utilized before any employees with seniority (e, f, or g below)
(e)	If the overtime cannot be filled based on part a), b), c), or d) the overtime first will be assigned to the lowest senior employee within the department holding that particular job classification on that shift; next the overtime will be assigned to the lowest senior employee within the department holding that particular job classification.
(f)	If the overtime cannot be filled based on part a), b), c), d), or e) the overtime will be assigned to the lowest senior qualified employee within the department.
(g)	If the overtime cannot be filled based on part a), b), c), d), e), or f) the overtime will be filled with the lowest senior qualified employee plant-wide.
10
(4)	In the event a forced employee identifies a volunteer willing to substitute for him/her prior to the shift starting, that volunteer, if qualified, may take on the overtime assignment as long as the replacement has been approved by the Employer.
(5)	Any unexpected overtime (i.e.: mechanical breakdown) as a result of work running beyond its normal shift that is not relieved by a subsequent shift will be assigned to those employees who are working on that particular line at the end of the scheduled shift. The Employer will make reasonable efforts to notify employees as soon as possible of required overtime, and will post a voluntary signup sheet. The effected employee may seek relief under part (4) above.
(6)	No employee will be forced to work more than two (2) hours over their normal schedule shift in any given twenty-four (24) hour period. Advance notice of overtime will be provided where practicable. No employee may volunteer to work more than sixteen (16) hours in any twenty-four (24) hour period. Weekend forced scheduled hours shall not exceed eight (8) hours per shift. Reasonable efforts shall be made to post the tentative weekend schedule on Thursday by one (1:00) p.m.
(7)	Forced overtime assignments shall be limited to production, maintenance, loading and unloading freight, changeover, PM, COP, and CIP. In addition, forced overtime may be utilized for preparation for food safely and other audits, provided that the required overtime occurs within thirty (30) days of the scheduled audit, and further provided that the Employer posts a voluntary overtime sign-up list for at least one week prior to date the actual overtime is to occur.
(8)	To be eligible for an overtime assignment the employee must be available to fulfill the entire overtime assignment. For full shift assignments, shifts may be split between two (2) employees provided they spilt the shift into two (2) equal blocks. Preference for scheduling will be given to the employee who is available to work the full shift assignment.
II
SECTION 7.	The Employer will not layoff employees from their regular hours for the sole purpose of equalizing the time and to avoid overtime, nor will employees be required to work a split shift or be sent home during regular hours to avoid overtime.

ARTICLE VII. 12 HOUR CONTINUOUS OPERATION
SECTION 1.	The Company may require specific individuals, by department, to work on a (12) hour continuous operation. In moving into I out of this shift pattern, the Company agrees to give the affected employees a minimum of ten (10) day’s notice of a shift pattern change. Once the pattern has been initiated, the Company agrees that it will stay in that pattern for a minimum of four (4) weeks. Shift pattern is to be defined as three (3) 12 hour days the first week and four (4) 12 hour days the second week then repeat:
•	3 day work week will be Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday
•	4 day work week will be Monday, Tuesday, Friday, Saturday
The following will be the governing rules:
SECTION 2.	Hours & Overtime
(1)	The work week will commence at 6:00 am Sunday morning.
12
(2)	The 24 hour “workday" will run from 6:00 am one day through until 6:00 am the next day. Therefore the “Monday” workday will start at 6:00 am'Monday and end at 6:00 am Tuesday (at the end of the "Monday" night shift). This means that for the purposes of overtime pay “Sunday” will start at 6:00 am Sunday morning and end at 6:00 am Monday morning. Thal is if you work a "Sunday” night shift, all 12 hours through until 6:00 am Monday morning will be paid at time and one half. Conversely if you work a “Saturday" night shift from 6:00 pm Saturday to 6:00 am Sunday, all 12 hours will be at straight time.
(3)	Calculations of hours worked in a week for the purposes of overtime payment will commence at 6:00 am Sunday (the beginning of the workweek).
(a)	I 1/2 x after 36 hours in 3 day week.
(b)	I 1/2 x after 40 hours weekly or after 12 hours daily.
(c)	I 1/2 x on scheduled Sunday.
(d)	2 x on non-schedulcd Sunday.
SECTION 3.	Pay Provisions
(I)	Jury Duty: difference between wages and jury pay.
(2)	Funeral Leave: 12 hours per day if scheduled to work, per ; funeral leave policy.
• !(3j Breaks:
(a)	3-10 minute - paid.
(b)	1 - 30 minute - paid.
(4)	Shift Premium:.$.35 per hour worked on 6 pm - 6 am shift.
SECTION 4.	Vacations
(1)1 week vacation = 40 hours.
(2)	# of 12 hour days of vacation = (# of weeks of vacation) times 40 divided by 12 (i.e. 2 weeks vacation x 40 / 12 = six 12 hour days + 8 hours left over).
(3)	Vacation must be taken in "week" blocks - for the purposes of PhD this will equal either three or four 12 hour day blocks.
13
(4)	These 3 or 4 day blocks need not all be in one calendar week.
(5)	Employees with three or more weeks vacation may take up to one week (three or four 12 hour days) in less than one week blocks (i.e. may take 3 or 4 individual 12 hour days).
(6)	Clearly it is likely that (after employees have taken all their 12 hour day vacation entitlement) they may end up with 4 or 8 hours of vacation time left over. The employee can elect to take a part day vacation, not take this vacation time and be paid the straight time rate for it, or take a full day vacation but only get paid for their outstanding vacation entitlement (i.e. if he had 4 hours left over he could take the day off but only get paid for 4 hours).
(7)	The Company reserves the right to approve all vacation requests in order to ensure adequate line coverage (i.e. we would not allow all trained filler technicians on one crew to go on vacation at the same time).
(8)	Those employees affected by a change in schedule into / out of 12 hour continuous operations will have an opportunity to modify their vacation requests. In the event of a conflict, seniority will prevail.
SECTION 5.	Holidays
(l)The continuous operation conditions in the Union Contract require employees to work all Plant Holidays if it is their “scheduled” shift.
(2)	Employees who work on a Plant Holiday will be paid double time for hours worked plus Holiday Pay.
(3)	Employees who are not scheduled to work on a Plant Holiday will receive 8 hours (straight time) “Holiday” pay. With respect to only those employees who are working a twelve (12) hour shift pattern when a holiday falls on a day such employees have been scheduled to work and do not work, those employees shall receive holiday pay equivalent to twelve (12) hours of straight time pay.
(4)	To be eligible to receive Holiday Pay, employees must work
14
all scheduled hours the day before and all scheduled hours the day after the Holiday. Exceptions to,this rule will be for employees who have an approved scheduled vacation day(s) surrounding the Holiday.
(5)	The parties acknowledge and agree that Article VII, Section 5 (4) and Article VIII, Section 4 establish eligibility requirements to receive holiday pay, including, specifically, the requirement that the employee must have worked all scheduled hours the day before and the day after the holiday. The parties further agree and acknowledge that it is not always practical to determine whether the requirements have been fulfilled al the time payroll processes holiday pay, resulting, in some instances, in employees receiving holiday pay in a paycheck even though the requirements for receipt of such pay were not actually met (e.g., the employee failed to work scheduled hours the day after the holiday). Therefore, the parties agree that any such improper payments may be deducted from the employee’s paycheck pursuant to an agreed-upon payment schedule or as otherwise permitted by law. Prior notice of any such deduction will be provided to the employee and the Union, and the employee will be asked to sign an acknowledgement form. Any disputes concerning the propriety of recoupment overpayments shall be subject to the griev-ance and arbitration procedures of Article XV. The parties intend this Section to comply with New York law and agree to conform this provision to any newly issued regulations dictating a change.
Other forms of accidental overpayments shall be processed in the same manner consistent with New York law, as it may be amended from time to time.
