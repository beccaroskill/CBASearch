1.	A teacher shall be entitled to a daily duty-free lunch period of no less than thirty (30) minutes inclusive of the time to escort students to the cafeteria, provided teachers assigned to self-contained exceptional education classes shall be entitled to such duty-free lunch when feasible. The forty (40) hour workweek shall be inclusive of the daily lunch period. It is not the intent of the Board herein to preclude reasonable duty-free lunch time not provided herein, where such may be reasonably provided nor to preclude a principal from implementing an alternative method of providing such duty-free lunch to a teacher for whom duty-free lunch is not provided herein. All schedules for teachers' lunch shall reflect the thirty (30) minutes provided for dutyfree lunch and may include the statement that the thirty (30) minutes will include time to escort students to the cafeteria.

2.	Except as provided herein, teachers who are assigned to teach in elementary schools, middle schools, junior high schools, or high schools shall be scheduled for a period of uninterrupted preparation time.
a.	The use of such preparation time shall normally be for the purpose of teacher preparation, student staffings, individual parent conferences, department meetings, evaluation conferences, and the like. It is not the intent of the parties for planning time to be used for those purposes, which could be better accomplished by utilizing a school-wide faculty meeting.
b.	In the event a principal assigns a teacher to the class or classes of an absent teacher and/or the teacher loses his/her preparation time as a result of an assignment, compensatory time equal to the amount of lost preparation time shall be made available to the affected teacher for such preparation time.

If the workweek is less than five (5) days, such preparation time shall be reduced pro-rata fifty-two (52) minutes per day for each day students are not scheduled to attend full time. It is the intent of the parties that the allowance to schedule sixty (60) minutes of planning time as provided herein, should not be used to lower the amount of planning that has normally been scheduled during the student day.
e.	Except as otherwise provided herein, preparation time as provided herein shall be scheduled within the six and one-half (6 1/2) hour period of time immediately following the beginning of the normal student day.

Multi-period blocks of classes as used herein shall mean only those instances in which a teacher's classes are scheduled in multi-period blocks for the entire student day, e.g. three (3) classes of two (2) period blocks in a six (6) period day. Provided that in the event of an emergency, planning time as provided herein for an exceptional education teacher may not be provided.

4.	The normal teacher workweek shall not exceed forty (40) hours inclusive of a daily thirty (30) minute lunch period except in an emergency and/or to allow for compensatory time.
a.	If the teacher workweek shall be less than five (5) days as a consequence of an official school recess or holiday, the normal workweek shall be reduced pro-rata from paragraph 4 above.
b.	In the event a teacher is assigned to work beyond the normal forty (40) hour workweek, then compensatory time shall be granted to the teacher. Additionally, workweek adjustments shall be allowed only when the length of the work assignment(s) does not cumulatively exceed thirty (30) minutes in a normal workweek. Assignments beyond the thirty (30) minutes in such workweek are subject to the compensatory time provisions of this Agreement. The rules governing compensatory time shall apply as stated in Article VI, Section C, Paragraph 5.
In the event a teacher meets with a parent of his/her students and such meeting causes the teacher to extend his/her forty (40) hour workweek, time spent at the parent conference shall be subject to compensatory time provided that the principal and teacher have prior mutual agreement that such parent conference time will qualify for compensatory time. Parent conferences as used herein are those parent conferences in addition to those found on the

school calendar as adopted by the Board. The requirement of "prior mutual agreement" may be met by the principal establishing a building policy on such requirement.
c.	In the event a principal assigns a teacher to perform duties which require a teacher to return to school for evening functions (e.g. open houses, individual parent conferences, other such functions), time spent at such assignments shall be accruable to compensatory time. On the two board-adopted calendar parent conference nights, teachers shall be released as soon as the student day has ended and student supervisory duties have been completed.
d.	Compensatory time accrued by a teacher shall be made available to a teacher during the normal student day up to sixteen (16) hours. Nothing contained herein shall preclude a principal from approving compensatory time during the student day beyond the minimum guaranteed amount of sixteen (16) hours.
e.	The Board and the Union agree that the thirty (30) minute lunch shall be a paid lunch and the additional one hundred fifty (150) minutes to the workweek shall accommodate the needs of the school, provided any day a teacher does not have an uninterrupted planning time he/she shall receive compensatory time equal to the length of the interruption as referenced in Article VI, Section C.2)b.
f.	In the event a teacher chooses to use compensatory time in lieu of sick/personal leave as provided herein, such teacher shall be given a verification of such time being so charged to his/her compensatory time balance.
g.	In the event a teacher transfers from one school to another, any unused compensatory time shall transfer with the teacher subject to the following condition: Written verification of compensatory time earned shall be provided from the sending principal to the receiving principal at the time of the transfer.

This does not preclude a teacher(s) from applying for compensatory time accrual.
2)	Such written request must be received by the principal no earlier than forty (40) calendar days prior to and no later than two (2) school days prior to the date compensatory time, if approved, is to be utilized.
3)	The principal shall act on requests for compensatory time submitted two (2) days prior to the utilization within one (1) day of the request. Other requests will be acted upon within two (2) days of the request. In the event the principal does not act on any request for compensatory time within the specified time frames, the request shall be considered approved. Provided that in circumstances where the requesting teacher is not assigned to the same worksite as his/her principal, such responses shall be extended by three (3) days. When a teacher applies for compensatory time two (2) or more school days prior to the day compensatory time is requested to be used, the applicant cannot be required to supply his/her own substitute as a condition of approval for such compensatory time request.
4)	Time limits as prescribed herein may be waived by the principal without precedent and at his/her discretion.
5)	Failure of a teacher to utilize approved compensatory time may result, at the principal's discretion, in the reduction of such time from the teacher's accrued compensatory time balance.
6)	In the event a teacher qualifies for compensatory time as provided herein and the teacher makes proper application which is subsequently denied, up to twelve (12) hours of such denied compensatory time shall be carried forward to the next school year. Such twelve (12) hours may be used at the teacher's option as either sick leave for the same purposes as other sick leave may be used or as personal leave charged to sick leave as provided in Article XIV.

c.	Except as otherwise provided herein, compensatory time shall only be accrued and utilized during the school year in which it is earned. Teachers shall be given the opportunity to utilize their compensatory time as provided herein and shall not be carried forward from one school year to another except as provided above.
d.	Nothing contained herein shall be construed as precluding a principal from allowing compensatory time on a non-student attendance day as reflected on the school calendar as adopted by the Board.
e.	In the event a principal denies the use of accumulated compensatory time on an inservice day or on a post planning day as scheduled on the school calendar as adopted by the Board, such denial shall give the affected teacher(s) the right to use, at his/her option, compensatory time in lieu of and for the same purpose(s) as sick leave. The amount of any such compensatory time used as sick leave shall be no more than an amount equal to the time designated by the Board for the affected inservice day or postplanning day. Provided that any sick leave taken on an inservice day or post-planning day shall be deducted from the accrued sick leave balance of the teacher.
f.	In the event a teacher chooses to use compensatory time in lieu of sick/personal leave as provided herein, such teacher shall be given a verification of such time being so charged to his/her compensatory time balance.
6.	As used herein, the normal teacher workweek shall not include time devoted to performance of duties for which compensation is received pursuant to The Schedule of Supplements For Extracurricular and Supplemental Compensation. If such assignment is not included in the Schedule of Supplements, the amount paid for such assignment shall be as determined by the Board.
7.	Reimbursement of mileage for teachers required to travel to another school(s) during the normal workday is as follows: After reporting for duty at a school, if the teacher is required during the normal workday to travel to another school(s), the teacher shall be reimbursed for mileage between the first school and the other school(s), and between the last school and return to the original school or to the teacher's home, whichever shall be the lesser.

a.	Employees who regularly travel among the various schools and other location in the county to perform their official duties, will be eligible for reimbursement beginning with the first stop of the work day unless the first stop is farther from their home than their established work site.
b.	If the first stop of the day is farther from the employee's home than the established work site, the employee will be eligible for mileage reimbursement for the difference between the work site and the first stop of the day.
c.	From the first stop of the day, the employee will be eligible for reimbursement for mileage to other sites for official business during the day.
d.	The employee shall be reimbursed for mileage between the last stop of the day and return to the established work site or to the employee's home, whichever shall be the lesser, which could result in the employee being reimbursed for returning home from work.
e.	Since reimbursement for returning home is made for personal, not business, miles traveled, it will result in taxable income to the employee and will be reported on the employee's W-2.
f.	The reimbursement rate shall be no less than the rate allowed by law.
g.	In the event that a teacher is required by the Board to travel within the district but beyond the administrative area (North, Central, South) in which he/she is normally assigned, the teacher shall be entitled to mileage either to and from his/her normal worksite to the out-of-area worksite, or to and from his/her home to the out-of-area worksite, whichever shall be the lesser. This out-of-area provision is intended to entitle a teacher to reimbursement for travel to and from an assignment for which he/she received specific direction by the Board to attend and which also requires a teacher to travel from one administrative area to another.
8.	Attendance of teachers at PTA or PTO meetings shall be voluntary.
9.	The length of the normal teacher workweek shall be forty (40) hours. During the ten (10) days (totaling eighty (80) hours) reflected on the Board-adopted school calendar as student non-attendance days, the

Superintendent and/or principal shall schedule forty-four (44) hours of teacher work assignments providing a thirty-six (36) hour balance which shall be designated as planning time used at the teacher's discretion. The principal shall give to teachers on the first day of pre-planning a written schedule of the year's non-student days, specifying which hours are to be administratively designated and which hours are to be used at teacher discretion. Except in an emergency, the principal shall not adjust the schedule. In such case, the adjusted schedule shall be provided in writing with details of the emergency. Unless the teacher is planning at a school board facility or approved site, such thirty-six (36) hours are not subject to Workers' Compensation injury claims unless otherwise specified under State Statute.
Section D	- Teaching Assignments and Duties
1.	a. Pursuant to state law, the Board may hire degreed, non-certificated personnel for positions designated "critical shortage". The Union will be notified seven (7) calendar days prior to the publication of the Board agenda item concerning the Board designating such "critical shortage" teaching areas. The Union may provide input for the Board's consideration. All other teachers must qualify for a valid Florida teaching certificate.
b. The Board and the Union agree to review the classroom management training of the beginning teacher in order to determine what changes, if any, should be made in order to better equip beginning teachers to handle student discipline. On a voluntary basis, Educational Research and Dissemination programs on classroom management for the beginning teachers shall be made available to teachers during the afternoon of the preplanning period. The voluntary nature of such ER&D programs shall not prohibit the principal from providing compensatory time for such attendance, provided that up to four (4) ER&D instructors shall be granted compensatory time for time spent in instructing the ER&D Program described above.
2.	Teachers shall be assigned to a grade level and/or subject for which they are qualified. If teachers are assigned to a grade level and/or subject beyond the scope of their certificate they shall be reassigned as promptly as circumstances permit within the scope of their certificate. The foregoing shall not preclude agreement of teachers to continue to teach outside the scope of their certificate while working for the acquisition of proper certification.

Except as otherwise provided herein, when a student(s) is referred to the administrator for disciplinary reasons, the teacher shall be informed of the conditions, if any, which have been imposed on the student before he/she reenters the class. Whenever the circumstances do not permit the administrator to address a particular student referral, the administrator may

B.	The teacher shall have the right and responsibility to impose classroom discipline where necessary and may use reasonable force to protect himself/herself from attack, or to prevent injury to a student where intervention is a prudent course of action.
C.	A teacher shall have the right to temporarily exclude a student from class when the misbehavior or disruptive effect of the behavior makes the continued presence of the student in the classroom intolerable.

I.	No reprimand or discipline shall be discussed by the administrator(s) or the teacher or representative involved in the presence of students, parents, or employees not involved in the events giving rise to such reprimand or discipline, provided this shall not preclude such discussion as is necessary to establish the facts or to process such reprimand or discipline to the School Board, and provided such shall not preclude the teacher and/or representative discussing the same with appropriate Union officials.
J.	A teacher shall be entitled to have present a representative when being reprimanded or disciplined. Reassignments out of the teacher's classroom following an alleged incident upon investigation shall be grounds for the presence of a representative of the teacher's choice. In an emergency, such meeting shall be held within one work week of the reassignment. When a request for such representation has been made, no action shall be taken with respect to the teacher until such representative shall have a reasonable opportunity to be present.
K.	Teacher's desks and lockers shall not be entered or searched except in an emergency or when it shall be necessary to locate a teacher's plan book or other materials to assist the instructional process. If such entrance or search shall occur, the teacher shall be made aware of such action and the reason therefor upon his/her return to work.

continuing contract cannot be accomplished by attrition, the following procedures shall be utilized in the following order:
1.	The Board shall identify the instructional assignment(s) [grade(s)/subject(s)/special area(s)], to be reduced. All annual contract teachers in such assignments shall be non-renewed prior to any reduction of continuing contract or professional services contract teachers.
No continuing contract or professional services contract teacher who is subject to reduction pursuant to this Article shall be reduced while an annual contract teacher is employed in a position for which the continuing contract or professional services contract teacher is certified, as provided by law.
2.	Any additional reduction shall be in order of the least consecutive years of creditable experience in the district of all teachers in such instructional assignment. As used herein, "creditable teaching experience" shall mean service rendered while under contract with the Board, provided such service qualifies for years of experience for salary purposes, and provided such service has been continuous. "Continuous" service shall not be affected by any authorized leave of absence, but service shall not be deemed continuous if the teacher has previously resigned or been terminated for any reason except reduction in force.
3.	The preceding section shall not be applicable to any continuing contract or professional services contract teacher identified by the Board as fulfilling educational requirements of the district. As used herein "educational requirements" shall be construed to mean activities within the district, which relate to particular area(s) of curricular or extracurricular activities, or supplemental positions, with or without additional financial compensation, and the particular ability of individual teachers to effectively complete these assignments.
B.	In the event it is determined a reduction in teachers shall occur, the Union President shall be given the opportunity to discuss the reduction with the Superintendent.
C.	If the Board shall determine to employ teacher(s) at any time during the seventeen (17) calendar months next following such reduction in staff, such positions shall be offered in writing to the last continuing contract or professional services contract teacher in such instructional assignment terminated in the inverse order of lay-off, provided such teacher holds the

D.	Nothing herein shall prohibit teachers who have been reduced pursuant to this Article from seeking and/or accepting gainful employment elsewhere.
E.	Nothing in this Article shall be construed as to prevent the Board from providing staff balances to comply with mandated programs or to preclude or overcome any form of illegal discrimination.

Continuation of Benefits
In the event a teacher's contract is not renewed at the end of the regular school year such teacher may elect to continue medical, dental, and vision benefits under the COBRA provisions and life insurance, should such teacher subsequently be re employed at the beginning of the following school year, the Board will reimburse the teacher for the amount the Board would have paid for medical and vision insurance benefits and life insurance had the teacher's contract been renewed. In the event a teacher's employment is terminated with the Board, the District shall calculate the coverage such teacher is due based on his/her premium contributions and appropriate insurance coverage shall be provided by the Board.
Should there be a discrepancy between this Appendix and the Summary Plan Description (SPD), the provisions of the SPD prevail.
