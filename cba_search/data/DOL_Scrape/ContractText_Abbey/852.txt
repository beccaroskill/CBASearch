F.	In order to take a vacancy, transfer or bump into a position a nurse must successfully complete the unit specific education and achieve clinical competence on the assigned unit within six (6) months.
In accordance with Section 5.07, in the event of a layoff a nurse may take a vacancy or bump into the next level if he/she has the foregoing experience and curriculum prerequisite. Once in the job, if unit specific education is not successfully completed, or clinical competence is not achieved, the nurse will be treated in accordance with Section 5.07 Limited Recall Rights.
Effective January 1, 1999, the Hospital shall pay up to two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) per calendar year for nurses with one (1) or more years of service to take core courses and for nurses subject to layoff to train for vacant positions. Unused money in a contract year shall not carry over to the following contract year.
A written report of the finances and distribution of the staff retraining fund shall be reported by the Hospital at the monthly labor/management meeting.
3.0	6 Appointment to Position
Appointment to a position shall be in writing with the salary, differential, and shift stated. A job description shall be distributed to all employees at their orientation or appointment to a new position having a different job description.
3.0	7 Evaluations
The Hospital will continue its policies of:
A.	Providing written evaluations, discussion, encouragement to comment, and recording of a nurse's performance and experience annually. Nurses will receive a copy of their evaluation in the form, as finalized and placed in the employee’s file at the time of finalization, and a copy of their job description.
Nursing Department performance appraisal forms shall include a legend that reads: “My signature indicates that I have read this evaluation and have received a copy, but not that I necessarily agree with it" and include a space to make comments. Recipients shall sign each evaluation form below such legend.
B.	Employees will have access to their personnel file consistent with the guidelines spelled out in Section C of the Hospital's policy dated October 27, 1992 and entitled "Personnel Files - Content and Access Rules."

3.08 Clinical Ladder
Administration views the Clinical Ladder not only as very positive to the growth and development of staff, but as a motivational factor, which recognizes professional career goals, and a means of consistently preparing individuals who ultimately will have an impact on patient care. Therefore, the Administration will continue its commitment to the development of the Clinical Ladder.
3.0	9 Negotiating Time
The Hospital will allocate to the Association to divide among the NYSNA negotiating committee, up to 400 hours (at straight time rate) to compensate up to a maximum of nine (9) employees for contract negotiations conducted during their off-duty hours. Employees released from their assignments for negotiations will be paid their regular rate of pay for those assigned hours. The Employer will make every effort to release employees from normally assigned duties.
3.10	Priority of Patient Care
The Hospital will make every effort to avoid assigning nurses to non-nursing functions in order to focus nurses' efforts on patient care.
The parties agree to further review the issues of nurses being assigned to nonnursing duties. The Hospital recognizes that it is in the best interest of the patients to avoid, wherever possible, use of nursing staff on matters that may be performed by non-nurses.
A side letter in which the Hospital and the Association agree to work in collaboration to address issues of nurses routinely performing non-nursing functions is annexed hereto as Exhibit K.
4.	EMPLOYEE STATUS
4.01 Classification
Employees covered by this Agreement shall be classified as either (a) regular full-time, (b) regular part-time, (c) other part-time, (d) per diem or (e) temporary.
4.02 Regular Full-Time Employees
A regular full-time employee is an employee who regularly works seventy-five (75) hours or more per fourteen (14) day pay period. A regular full-time employee will be eligible for all benefits under this Agreement, if otherwise qualified.
4.03 Regular Part-Time Employees
A regular part-time employee is an employee who regularly works less than seventy-five (75) hours in a fourteen (14) day pay period, but who regularly works at least thirty (30) hours in a fourteen (14) day pay period. A regular part-time employee who qualifies as set forth herein in connection with the particular benefit, is eligible for pro rata benefits.
4.04 Other Part-Time Employees
This category includes regularly scheduled employees who fall within the scope of this Agreement but who are not regular full-time, regular part-time, per diem or temporary employees, and work less than thirty (30) hours in a fourteen (14) day pay period. These employees shall be eligible only for the salary schedule and grievance procedure herein and shall not be eligible for any other benefits.
9
4.05 Per Diem Employees
This category includes employees who fall within the scope of this Agreement, but who are not regular full-time, regular part-time, other part-time or temporary employees. These employees shall work on a day-to-day basis as agreed to by the employee. These employees shall be designated as per diem at the time of employment or change of employment status. These employees shall be eligible only for the salary schedule and grievance procedure herein and shall not be eligible for any other benefits unless otherwise indicated.
Per diems will provide schedules of their availability on a monthly basis, at least four (4) weeks prior to the start of the month covered by the schedule.
The Hospital will promptly investigate claims that work is not being equitably distributed among available per diems. In appropriate cases, i.e., where there is no legitimate basis for the work assignments in question, the Hospital will take appropriate steps to ensure equitable distribution. The Hospital shall have no obligation to investigate a claim of inequitable distribution where the per diems on whose behalf a claim has been made did not timely submit a schedule for availability for the time period that is the subject of the claim.
In preparing schedules, the Hospital will generally give regular employees a scheduling preference. Where, however, the verified scheduling limitation of a per diem makes it impractical to adhere to this general practice, the Hospital may accommodate the per diem’s scheduling restriction. Where possible (i.e., where the per diem does not have legitimate scheduling conflicts that would preclude such a schedule), the Hospital will schedule per diems to work at least one (1) major holiday per year, one (1) day per week and one (1) weekend per month.
Per diems with restricted schedules generally shall be assigned to a float pool.
4.06 Temporary Employees
A temporary employee is one who is so informed at the time of hire, and who is hired for a specific project or to replace employees on leaves or vacation and who is hired for a period of six (6) months or the duration of such projects, leaves or vacation periods, whichever is greater. The said period may be extended up to an additional three (3) months with the consent of the Association which will not be unreasonably withheld. These employees shall be eligible only for the salary schedule and shall not be eligible for any other benefits. These employees shall be eligible for the grievance procedure after the completion of six (6) months of employment.
4.07 Probationary Period
An employee will be on probation until the employee has actually worked six (6) months from the date of hire. During the probationary period, the employee shall be subject to demotions, suspensions, other discipline or discharge at the Employer's sole discretion, without recourse to the grievance procedure, but will otherwise be covered by this Agreement. Employees promoted or transferred shall be on probation and may, during the six (6) month period following such promotion or transfer, in the sole discretion of the Employer, be returned to their prior title, and such action shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure provided by this Agreement. Employees may choose to return to their previous unit within six (6) weeks of transfer.
10
4.08 Post-Probationary Discipline
Except as stated in paragraph 4.07, an employee will be demoted, suspended or otherwise disciplined or discharged only for just cause. The Hospital will notify the Association and the Council of Nursing Practitioners, in writing, of any discharge, suspension or demotions within forty-eight (48) hours of each such action and the reason for it. Employees will receive copies of all Disciplinary Action involving them. An employee summoned to a discipline conference or hearing may have a local Association representative present if one is available at the Hospital at the time of taking of a proposed disciplinary action or disciplinary warning; if there is such a representative reasonably available, such representative shall make himself/herself available at the disciplinary meeting or conference. Nothing in this paragraph shall delay the Hospital in taking any disciplinary action it believes necessary on an immediate basis.
No employee will be transferred for disciplinary reasons. An employee transferred will be notified of the reason for transfer at the time of transfer.
The Hospital will furnish a copy of its Disciplinary Action procedure to the Association.
4.09 Seniority: Definition and Types
There will be two (2) types of seniority, bargaining unit seniority and title seniority. Bargaining unit seniority is defined as the length of time an employee has been continuously employed by the Employer as a registered nurse. Title seniority shall be defined as the length of time an employee has worked continuously in a specific title.
4.10 Seniority: Accrual and Acquisition
An employee's seniority shall commence after the completion of the probationary period and shall be retroactive to the date of the employee's last employment date. A regular part-time employee shall accrue pro rata seniority on a separate list from the regular full-time employees. Seniority shall accrue during the first six (6) months of authorized leaves of absence, but not while an employee is on suspension.
4.11 Seniority: Loss of Seniority
An employee's seniority shall be lost when the employee (a) terminates voluntarily; (b) is discharged for cause; (c) fails to return from a leave of absence; (d) is laid off or has not worked for a period exceeding six (6) months; (e) fails to return to work as provided in Section 5.08; (f) fails to apply for reemployment within the statutory period after honorable separation from military service. Seniority shall not be lost while an employee is on an approved leave of absence.
4.12 Seniority: Application
Bargaining unit seniority shall apply in the computation and determination of eligibility for all benefits where length of service is a factor pursuant to this Agreement.
The Employer may continue the practice of offering temporary promotional opportunities classified as "Acting." Such employee shall receive the pay and perquisites of the higher title so long as the employee holds that title. A dispute concerning the period of such "Acting" status shall be subject to Section 14 hereof.
11
Where more than fifty percent (50%) of an employee's regular compensation rate is charged to a special or non-budgeting fund and such employee is informed at the time of employment or at the time of transfer, that her/his employment is for a special non-budgeting or research project and subject to this paragraph, such employee shall, for the purpose of layoff, be considered to have title seniority which may be exercised only within the project or grant to which assigned. Such employee shall be considered to have bargaining unit seniority for the purpose of transfer or recall to a vacant position outside of the special project, provided that on each recall the Employer determines that the employees retained or recalled have the ability to do the work. Such determination by the Employer shall not be arbitrary. Employees, fifty percent (50%) or more of whose regular compensation rate is charged to the Hospital's budget, shall be considered as having seniority on that basis and not under a grant.
4.13 Seniority: Lists
Employer will, on execution of this Agreement and at least semi-annually thereafter, post and furnish to the Association seniority lists. The posted lists will conclusively establish an employee's seniority unless the employee protests it, in writing, within thirty (30) days from posting or if the employee is on leave of absence or vacation or otherwise unable to so protest it within such time, thirty (30) days after the employee returns from such leave or vacation or such disability is removed.
Such seniority lists shall be updated quarterly by the Hospital.
4.74 Posting of Positions
The Employer will post all vacancies it intends to fill prior to filling such vacancies from inside or outside the Hospital. Vacancies will be posted within eight (8) days from receipt by the Director or designee of the resignation, approval of transfer or creation of a new position.
Applicants will receive written verification of receipt of the application.
A decision on selection will be made within twenty (20) days after the completion of the posting period, except in emergency situations (e.g., candidate unavailable for interview).
All candidates applying for a posted position will be notified in writing within fourteen (14) days of selection of the candidate as to why they were not selected and can request a personal meeting if desired for discussion of refusal.
An employee on a paid or unpaid leave of absence may have her/his fully completed bid submitted by another employee, as long as written confirmation from bidder of interest in the position is received prior to the closing of the posting period. The employee must also be willing to return to active payroll status in the new title upon appointment to the position.
Postings will include unit or areas, title and specific shift hours and variable hours wherever possible. Where it is not feasible to post specific shift hours, the Hospital will consult with the Association prior to posting the position in order to achieve the most meaningful posting.
12
If a successful bidder is not transferred within twenty-eight (28) days of notifying her/his current supervisor that she/he has accepted a new position, the successful bidder shall receive the difference in pay, if any, between the current and new job. A conference with the former and new Director or designee will be arranged to accomplish transfer as soon as possible.
If the successful bidder is still not transferred to the new job within sixty (60) days after notification to the current supervisor, the successful bidder shall receive a premium of twenty-five percent (25%) of the base rate of the new position until transfer occurs.
Those positions not filled by bids received during the posting periods set forth below will remain posted until filled.
This section shall have no effect to the extent it is inconsistent with any other section of the contract.
Lateral Transfers
All non-promotional positions shall be posted on the unit for five (5) days: bargaining unit seniority shall prevail. If the position is not filled, it shall be posted Hospital-wide for seven (7) days.
Employees at that promotional level on the same unit who work the other shifts will be considered for the position without being required to go through the interview process.
Promotional Vacancies
All promotional vacancies shall be posted Hospital-wide for ten (10) days.
Where a promotional vacancy in the bargaining unit occurs and two (2) or more employees are under consideration for such vacancy, the Employer shall promote the most competent employee as determined by the Director or designee. Disputes under the provision shall be subject to the grievance procedure only if the question involves an unfair application of the promotional criteria by the Director or designee.
4.14A Promotional Committee
For NYSNA promotional positions, the respective Director or designee convene(s) an interview panel comprised of an equal number of bargaining unit members and Nursing management at different managerial and staff levels appropriate to the classification of the promotional position(s). A delegate of the Association will be invited to observe the interview process. Recommendations from the panel are then submitted to the Director or designee who will make a final decision. The Hospital will give five (5) days notice to the Association concerning promotion interviews.
4,15 Transfers
An employee who is transferred within the same title shall not have her/his individual base compensation rate reduced by reason of such transfer. An employee transferred will be notified of the reason for the transfer prior to the transfer. Transfers shall not be of a disciplinary nature.
13
An employee may apply for one (1) transfer within her/his unit (shift change) while on probation. If accepted for the transfer the employee will continue with her/his probation. The Hospital reserves the right to add an additional month to the probationary period, if the Hospital deems it necessary. The Association shall be notified of any extension to an employee's probationary period prior to the actual extension of the probationary period.
4.16 Job Security
An employee hired before November 1, 1996 shall not be laid off during the term of this agreement.
An employee hired in a bargaining unit position before January 1, 2001, shall not be subject to layoff during the term of this agreement, except in the event of closure of beds for longer than three (3) months, or a reduction in total number of in-patient discharges/out-patient visits in the affected unit for a period of no less than forty-five (45) consecutive days as compared to the immediately preceding period of like duration.
An employee guaranteed employment during the contract term, but whose job is eliminated, shall obtain a position through the procedures in Section 5.07. This no layoff guarantee supersedes the Hospital’s right to layoff such employees.
5.	WORK TIME
5.01 Normal Workday
For the purposes of determining application of an employee's regular compensation rate, the employee’s normal workday will be seven and one-half (7%) consecutive work hours, excluding any scheduled meal period.
5.02 Normal Workweek
For the purposes of determining application of an employee's regular compensation rate, the employee's normal work schedule will be seventy-five (75) hours in fourteen (14) days in a biweekly period, and the employee will have four (4) days off in each biweekly period. The workweek will begin at 12:01 a.m. Sunday and end at 12:00 midnight Saturday.
5.03 Scheduling
A.	Weekend Schedule
Full-time and regular part-time employees who have not agreed to special scheduling arrangements will be entitled to the following maximums on weekend schedules:
1.	Effective January 1, 1983, a maximum of twenty-six (26) weekends worked per year;
2.	Effective January 1, 1984, a maximum of twenty (20) weekends worked per year for employees with ten (10) years or more of service at the Hospital as a registered nurse;
3.	An employee who is scheduled to work two (2) days of a weekend who works only one (1) day of the weekend will be credited with one-half (%) a weekend worked for purposes of Sections 1 and 2 of this provision. The Hospital will not schedule split weekends of work, except at the request of an employee.
14
4.	Weekends will be equitably assigned.
5.	The weekend schedule shall commence at 7:00 a.m. Saturday and conclude at 7:00 a.m. Monday.
B.	Mandatory Overtime
The Hospital will not require mandatory overtime, however, registered nurses recognize their professional obligation to patient care.
C.	Work Obligation: Employees
An employee will work the hours assigned.
D.	The Employer will maintain rosters of nurses volunteering for overtime on the basis of grouping nurses who have requisite skills for given clinical areas, generally on the basis of services or specialty areas; volunteers may identify shifts or days for which they will be available for overtime work; volunteers will be added to the roster in the order in which they volunteer. When two (2) individuals volunteer at the same time, bargaining unit seniority will prevail. If an employee who has volunteered for overtime is called for and works an overtime shift, that employee will be placed at the bottom of the roster.
S.04 Work Schedules
A.	The Employer will post a two (2) week schedule of each employee's assignment not less than twenty-eight (28) days in advance of the start of each work period. This schedule will remain in effect until it is superseded by a new schedule, or changed by agreement between the Employer and employees affected. Except in an emergency, an employee will be notified of a change of schedule at least seven (7) days in advance.
B.	Except in an emergency or at the employee's request, employees will not be required:
1.	to work more than seven (7) consecutive days;
2.	to work more than two (2) different shifts (day, evening or night) during a seven (7) day period;
3.	to work more than sixteen (16) consecutive hours in any twenty-four (24) hour period.
Employees shall have at least nine (9) hours off after completing work on their last shift prior to the beginning of their next scheduled shift, exclusive of shifts during which they are on-call.
C.	1.
a.	Effective January 1, 1984, the Hospital shall terminate compulsory rotation of shifts, and will establish permanent assigned shifts, to which incumbent employees may bid and will hire for permanent shifts; the Hospital, however, reserves the right to require employees to take assignments off their regular shift during the period of an emergency.
b.	Effective May 1, 1989, the Hospital will assign permanent shift hours.
15
2. Newly hired employees may be required to work alternative shifts for a maximum of six (6) weeks during the year following completion of the probationary period. Under this paragraph, shifts will not be altered for periods of less than one (1) week. This will apply to applicants hired after April 1,1986.
5.05 Overtime Work: Compensatory Time Off
Except with mutual consent of the Employer and employee, the Employer will not require an employee to take compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay. Compensatory time will be earned at the premium rate of time and a half (11A).
5.06 Layoff
A.	Notice
The Hospital shall provide thirty (30) days' notice prior to implementing any layoffs to both the Association and to the affected employee(s). Such notice shall be by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall be effective upon dispatch. Affected employee(s) shall be compensated to the extent such notice is deficient. Such notice to the Association shall include the effective date of the layoff, and the number and location of employees on probation as of the effective date of the layoff.
B.	Procedure
In the event of a layoff in a title covered by this agreement, probationary employees in that title in the affected management center shall be laid off first, without regard to their individual period of employment. Thereafter non-probationary employees within the identified title and management center shall be laid off in reverse order of their bargaining unit seniority with the least senior employee in the management center and title being laid off first.
The Employer recognizes that the role of per diems in a layoff situation is only to fill gaps in schedules and not to be regular staff in the affected areas.
C.	Rights of Affected Employees
An employee scheduled to be laid off (including an employee bumped) shall have the following options in this sequential order:
1.	Accepting a vacant position in her/his title provided the employee is qualified for the vacancy as determined by the Employer in accordance with Section 3.04 (F). Probationary positions shall be considered vacancies for this subsection 'C only.
2.	If there are no vacancies for which the employee is presently qualified, as determined by the Employer in accordance with Section 3.04 (F), or if the number of employees within the management center scheduled to be laid off exceeds the number of vacancies Hospital-wide (including probationers), the Employer shall identify the employees with the least amount of bargaining unit seniority within the management center until it reaches a total that equals the number of positions that are being eliminated in the management center. In order to ensure that higher titled employees retain the option to bump throughout all lower titles, the Employer shall add sufficient lower-titled positions. Employees
16
scheduled to be laid off may choose any of these positions for which she/he is qualified as determined by the Employer in accordance with Section 3.04 (F), with the most senior employees selecting first and the least senior employees selecting last.
3.	If no vacancies exist for which she/he is qualified as determined by the Employer in accordance with Section 3.04 (F), the employee may bump in her/his management center the least senior employee in a position for which she/he is qualified as determined by the Employer in accordance with Section 3.04 (F).
4.	If a management center closes or employees are bumped out of a management center or are unable to fill a position in a management center then such employees will be able to bump the least senior employee on a Hospital-wide basis for which she/he is qualified as determined by the Employer in accordance with Section 3.04 (F).
5.	Employees bumped/displaced/laid off as a result of the procedure described herein, shall receive thirty (30) days' notice or compensation to extent such notice is deficient. Such employees shall have all rights afforded under this section including bumping according to the pool of least senior employees as described under #2.
If, as a result of the foregoing, a nurse takes a position for which the Hospital requires a unit specific education (other than a core course) which she/he has not had previously, the nurse shall be given the unit specific education once. In addition, the nurse will be given orientation to her/his new area for a reasonable time to be determined by the Employer. In no event shall orientation, including the unit specific education, exceed six (6) months from the earlier of the start of the core course, if any, or transfer into the unit. The nurse must successfully complete unit specific education and achieve clinical proficiency within six (6) months.
If a nurse fails to achieve clinical proficiency during the orientation period, she/he shall be placed at the bottom of the recall list once. A nurse placed on the recall list for failure to achieve performance during orientation shall have the following limited recall rights:
A nurse may only be recalled to her/his former cluster, but shall not be recalled to the unit in which she/he failed to achieve satisfactory performance. Provided, however, a nurse on the recall list, may take an examination if she/he has verified successful completion of a study program for a different curriculum area approved by the Employer. The study program which entitles a nurse to retake the failed core course examination shall be at the nurse’s expense on her/his time and must be successfully completed by the time a vacancy in the unit is posted.
The recall period shall be six (6) months from the date of placement on the list (see Section 4.11{d}).
17
6.	In the event an employee does not obtain a position described by the procedures herein, the employee shall be deemed laid off and shall receive all terminal benefits described under Section 10.01. In addition, the Employer shall continue the NYSNA health benefits, per Section 9.02, until the end of the month in which the layoff occurs. Disputes under this paragraph shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of this agreement.
For the purposes of this section, "management center" shall be defined as one of the following locations:
Allen Pavilion Milstein/Harkness Ambulatory Services Babies/Sloane
5.07 Recall
Whenever a vacancy occurs in a title, employees who were reassigned to a lower title under paragraph 5.07 or who are on layoff in that title shall be reassigned to their original title or recalled in accordance with their bargaining unit seniority in the reverse order in which they were laid off or transferred to a lower title, provided they have previously demonstrated the experience and abilities to perform the work and assume the responsibilities required as determined by the Employer.
If a vacancy occurs in a title where no employee in that title has recall rights, then the laid off employee with the most bargaining unit seniority will be recalled, if that employee has previously demonstrated the ability and experience to perform the work and assume the responsibilities required, as determined by the Employer; if not, then the next senior employee laid off will be recalled until the list Is exhausted.
Probationary employees who have been laid off have no recall privileges.
Regular part-time employees on layoff shall have recall rights to regular positions only if they are willing to work the required full-time schedule of hours.
Employees to be recalled from layoff will be notified of their recall and return to work date by confirmed message to the employee's last known address. The Employer will not require employees to return to work in less than eight (8) days from the date notice is delivered.
Mailgrams shall be presumed to be delivered on the date confirmed by the company. If an employee is unable to return to work on time for medical reasons and so advises the Employer before the return date, the Employer may recall the next senior employee. The first employee will suffer no loss of seniority, and will be eligible for the next available position, upon presentation of medical evidence of illness and ability to return to work.
Disputes under this paragraph shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of this Agreement.
18
5.08 Flex-Time
The voluntary alternate work scheduling arrangement known as “Flex-time" will be continued as an optional scheduling arrangement during the term of this Agreement. Adoption, continuation or discontinuation of this scheduling arrangement by individual units or individual nurses shall be subject to the applicable provisions under Appendix A. The protocol for this arrangement is annexed hereto as Appendix A.
5.0	9 Experimental Workday and Workweek
Changes in the workday (5.01) and workweek (5.02) for the purpose of instituting an alternate workweek schedule will only be done with the mutual agreement of the Employer and the Association.
5.10	Weekend Plus One Plan
The protocol for this arrangement is annexed hereto as Appendix B.
5.11	Floating
Nurse Management will float nurses based on patient needs and the knowledge and skills required for the assignment When a nurse is required to float, the following procedure will be utilized:
1.	Staff will be floated within the assigned cluster, based on their level of clinical competence. On the unit from which the Employer decides to float a nurse, supplemental staff (i.e., float pool, per diem, agency, and overtime nurses) will be floated prior to regularly assigned full or part-time staff.
2.	Staff will have input into the orientation and competency development.
3.	Prior to a nurse being floated, the Employer will notify the receiving unit if the nurse lacks a particular skill set. If the Employer nevertheless decides to float the nurse, the assignment will be consistent with her/his capabilities.
4.	The floated nurse should conference with the designated nurse in charge of the unit should she/he identify a need to clarify the assignment.
5.	Float assignments will be within the clusters as described below; and assignments shall be rotated in reverse order of the employees’ bargaining unit seniority with the least senior qualified employees on the unit, on that shift, floated first.
6.	The Employer will make a good faith effort to float staff within the Management Center before floating a nurse to another Management Center. The final decision for floating a nurse between Management Centers rests with the Vice President of Nursing Care or her/his designee.
7.	The Employer will make a good faith effort to float staff as early in the shift as possible and limit floating a nurse more than once in a shift unless patient safety is at risk.
8.	The Employer will assign staff to float within the below defined clusters. Any unit not listed in the below clusters will be placed in a cluster by the Employer after it has consulted with the Association.
9.	Registered nurses with seventeen (17) or more years of bargaining unit seniority will not be required to float. If all registered nurses on a given shift
19
or unit have seventeen (17) years or more of bargaining unit seniority, they will float only in an emergency. Under no circumstances will they be required to float more than five (5) times per year.

*** Closed Unit
5.13	Temporary Partial or Temporary Total Unit Closure
If the Hospital experiences a temporary partial or temporary total closure in a unit, the Hospital shall either treat the matter under Section 5.07 or shall treat the matter pursuant to the following procedure after giving the Association and the affected employees seven (7) days’ written notice, except in an emergency. Any closure of three (3) months or less is temporary. In these instances, the employee shall voluntarily select either of the following options for the duration of the temporary closure, provided however, that the Employer shall not unreasonably deny selection of option 1 below.
1.	The employee may elect to utilize paid benefit time, which shall be limited to accrued vacation/personal days and/or the employee may elect to take an unpaid leave of absence.
A nurse who lacks enough accrued paid benefit time for the duration of the temporary closure, may return to work after the paid benefit time is exhausted. The nurse shall select from any remaining vacancies pursuant to this Article 5.13.
2.	The employee, in order of bargaining unit seniority, may select a vacancy for which she/he is presently qualified as determined by the Employer. Vacancies will consist of budgeted positions that are posted or approved and about to be posted, plus new temporary vacancies. Consideration will be given to transferring the nurse to the same shift and schedule that she/he currently works.
3.	If an affected nurse does not choose option 1 above and option 2 above does not include an opportunity to remain on the same shift and schedule, then the nurse shall receive a total of twenty-one (21) days' notice before going into a different shift and/or schedule. The twenty-one (21) days are comprised of the original seven (7) days' notice (referenced in the first paragraph of this clause) plus fourteen (14) days’ additional notice.
If the partial or total unit closure exceeds three (3) months, each affected employee shall have all rights afforded under Section 5.07. Any permanent positions which these employees temporarily occupied shall be placed on the vacancy list as described under Section 5.07. It is the parties' understanding that this section is for temporary purposes only. It is also agreed and understood that any affected employee accepting a vacant position will have the necessary orientation and her/his approved time off honored. Furthermore,
23
it is mutually agreed that bargaining unit seniority shall apply in any and all circumstances applicable under this section. If the unit is reopened at the end of the units’ temporary closure pursuant to this section, the employees will return to their previous position shift and schedule.
It is the parties’ express interpretation of the foregoing that if a nurse either has no paid time or chooses not to take paid time and the Hospital does not have a vacancy pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3, then Section 5.07 will be implemented.
5.14	Unit Relocation
When a unit is relocated within the Hospital, all nurses shall move to the relocated unit in the Hospital, except where employees are laid off as a result of such relocation then Section 5.07 shall apply.
Prior to any unit relocation, the Association and affected employees shall receive seven (7) days' written notice.
6.	MONETARY BENEFITS: COMPENSATION FOR TIME WORKED

6.02 Regular Compensation Rate
An employee's regular compensation rate will apply to all work time up to and including seventy-five (75) hours in fourteen (14) days. The regular compensation rate will include any shift differential, experience differential, educational differential or certification differential to which the employee is entitled pursuant to paragraphs 10.03, 10.04, 10,05 and 10.13 of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall constitute a guarantee of any minimum daily, weekly, biweekly or annual salary for an employee who does not work the normal hours during such period.

Al) hours of work in excess of seventy-five (75) hours in a fourteen (14) day pay period or in excess of seven and one-half (7%) hours in a single workday, shall be paid for at the rate of time and one-half (1!4) the individual employee’s annual regular compensation rate divided by 1950 in case of full-time employees. Employees who work seven and one-half (7%) hours or more of overtime in a fourteen (14) day pay period will receive a separate check less appropriate deductions for that overtime.
6.04 Premium Compensation Rate: Limitation

6.05 Pay
The frequency of payment shall continue as heretofore. Errors made in the calculation of regular pay (including “in charge" pay and “on call" pay) shall be
24
corrected within two (2) business days. Errors made, through no fault of the employee in the calculation of overtime and other payments shall be corrected within five (5) business days. Overtime errors, not caused by management, will be corrected in the succeeding paycheck.
The parties agree that on a date to be determined by the Employer, the pay day may be moved from Thursday to Friday and as a result of such change, employees will have expanded access to direct deposit arrangements.
6.06 Demotion or Voluntary Downgrade
An employee who moves to a lower title (demotion or voluntary) shall receive the incumbent rate for the new title.
6.07 Bargaining Unit Work
Bargaining unit employees working under this Agreement will be given an opportunity to fill open work shifts prior to Agency Nurses. The Employer and Association mutually recognize the valuable contributions registered nurses make to the quality of patient care delivered to the community served by the New York Presbyterian Hospital Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. Thereby, the parties agree to work together to resolve issues concerning the skill-mix or changes in care delivery in the interest of quality patient care.
A. If the Employer desires to convert a filled or unfilled RN position to a non-RN position, the following steps will be taken:
1.	Employer will notify the Association if it intends to convert a vacant or occupied RN position to a non-RN position. Thirty (30) calendar days written notice will be given to NYSNA and affected employees, if any, before the conversion occurs. During the thirty (30) day period the following shall take place:
2.	Employer provides the Association with written notice including the conversion proposal rationale and job descriptions of the proposed non-RN unit positions along with the notice in 1 above.
3.	A task force of Management and Association representatives shall meet to discuss the conversion plan within ten (10) days of submission of the notice and plan to the Association,
4.	Within ten (10) days after 3 above, the Employer holds meetings with the nurses impacted by the plan and the Association to receive additional input regarding the plan and to review recommendations.
5.	After following the above steps, if the Association and the Employer can agree to a conversion plan, said agreed upon conversion may be implemented by the Employer. If the above steps do not result in agreement with the Association, the Employer may go forward with the conversion subject to section 7 below. The Hospital agrees that no RN shall be laid off as a result of the conversion. If a proposed conversion involves the position of an incumbent nurse, the position occupied by the unit RN(s) with the least bargaining unit seniority in the title shall be the one(s) converted. The Employer shall also inform nurses in the affected unit of the responsibilities of the non-RN being introduced by the conversion.
25
6.	The Hospital shall have the right to convert up to thirty (30) positions in 2002, thirty (30) positions in 2003 and thirty (30) positions in 2004. Any unused part of the conversion limit shall carry over to the subsequent contract years. However, the total number of conversions shall not exceed ninety (90) during the term of the contract. The submission date of the proposed conversion by the Hospital to the Association will determine timeliness.
7.	Conversion of filled or vacated positions is arbitrable. If the Association and the Employer cannot agree to a conversion plan, the parties shall proceed to arbitration. The Association will file for said arbitration within fifteen (15) days after the thirty (30) days notice period. If the Association does not file for said arbitration within fifteen (15) days after the thirty (30) days notice period, the Hospital shall be free to convert a filled or unfilled position. In rendering its decision, the panel shall consider in all cases, only the following two standards: 1) is the Hospital’s proposal cost efficient and 2) does it maintain safe quality care. Thus, the Hospital’s proposed conversion of filled positions shall be sustained if a panel majority finds that the conversion meets the foregoing standards. However, if the Hospital's proposed conversion of filled positions does not meet with the standards, then the panel majority may deny in full or modify the Hospital’s proposal according to the standards. With respect to conversion of unfilled positions, the arbitrator is only authorized to choose between the Hospital’s and the Association's last/best offer.
The arbitration will be heard by a three (3) member panel, one member from the Association, one member from the Employer and John Sands. The panel shall issue a majority decision that shall be binding on the parties provided it does not exceed the numerical caps listed in section 6.
The Hospital agrees not to implement any RN to non-RN conversion (vacant or filled positions) unless the Association consents or unless and until the arbitration panel’s decision allows such conversion.
8.	If the Association wishes to convert a filled or unfilled non-RN position to a RN position, the following steps shall be taken:
a.	The Association shall provide to the Employer a conversion proposal rationale. The Employer will only be required upon request to provide the following information about non-RN positions: job descriptions, compensation, number of employees in each classification.
b.	Within ten (10) calendar days of notice, a task force of Employer and Association representatives shall meet to discuss such conversion plan.
c.	If the Association and the Employer can agree to a conversion plan, said agreed upon conversion may be implemented by the Employer. If the proposed conversion is not mutually agreed upon, it shall not be subject to arbitration but the proposed conversion is subject to section 9 below.
26
9.	The provisions and procedures contained in this Section 6.07 are in lieu of the parties' obligations to bargain under the National Labor Relations Act.
10.	In a mutual effort to accurately track vacant RN positions, the Hospital shall within thirty (30) days of ratification provide a written list to the Association of all current RN vacancies. Said list will consist of position number, title and location. Thereafter, as any RN position becomes vacant (i.e., due to resignation, transfer, retirement) the Hospital shall forward such information as provided above to the Association’s general representative. At monthly labor/management meetings, a standing agenda item will be vacancy update.
It is clearly understood that all provisions of this section supersede management’s rights to convert any RN position vacant or filled to non-RN positions.
6.08 Overtime Cancellation
In the event the Employer cancels an employee's overtime without a minimum of two (2) hours' notice, the Employer shall compensate the employee four (4) hours pay at the straight time rate of pay.

AND
NEW YORK PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL COLUMBIA PRESBYTERIAN MEDICAL CENTER
This Memorandum of Agreement supplements the collective bargaining agreement between the New York State Nurses Association and the Hospital-
Alternative Work Schedules
(AWS)
I.	Alternative Work Schedules (AWS) offer employees the opportunity to change their contractual normal workday (5,01) and normal work week (5.02) by working fewer days per week, but more hours per day. There will be no change in the employee's base compensation rate under any option selected,
II.	Nursing units and/or individual nurses may request to work AWS or remain on traditional schedules. These requests will not be unreasonably denied.
1.	The number of individual positions per cost center will be established by the Director of each department in coordination with the Nursing Care Clinician/Clinical Manager. The AWS (flextime positions}) will first be posted to the employees presently working within each cost center
2.	The initiation of, or changes to, AWS as described in this Memorandum of Agreement will be discussed at a meeting with recorded minutes between nursing administration and the nurses on the unit prior to implementation. Any proposed change to AWS that is not covered by this agreement must be negotiated between the Association and the Employer.
The Employer will make its best efforts to convert the following units to AWS by November 1, 1999: ORs, PACUs, ASU, Stepdown, Hemodialysis, Plasma Phoreses, Endoscopy, Bronchoscopy, Cardiac Catheterization, ER, URGI Care, Obstetrics Service, Interventional Radiology and Oncology, The Employer will make best efforts to convert all other units by March 1,2000.
Conversion will be done by bargaining unit seniority. RNs will be given a choice of shifts by bargaining unit seniority. If the conversion to flex involves a redistribution of nurses among shifts within each title, all nurses will choose their shift by bargaining unit seniority. The Hospital agrees that no RN shall be laid off as a result of the conversion. If the conversion to a standard schedule involves a redistribution of nurses among shifts within each title, all nurses will select their shift on the converted unit according to bargaining unit seniority. If conversion to a standard schedule involves reduction in the number of unit nurses within a higher title, the affected nurses shall have a choice of same title position in another unit for which she/he is qualified or staying on the same unit in a lower titled position according to bargaining unit seniority.
Nurses who choose to remain on standard shift will submit their request by August 15, 1999 to their nurse manager and every effort shall be made to grant such requests.

60
Hl. Employees who work an AWS are entitled to all of the same rights and benefits as set forth in the collective bargaining agreement between the parties except as amended below:

3.	It is agreed that employees may be disciplined for failure to meet their professional responsibilities to the Hospital which shall include the regular and timely reporting to work as scheduled; i.e., poor attendance, continued lateness, and leaving work early.
4.	Both parties recognize that sick calls that occur by the employees who work an AWS are more difficult to cover than normal schedule sick calls. Therefore, nurses who work an AWS will continue to assist the Administration in an effort to reduce the number of sick calls and provide coverage when they occur.
5.	For payroll purposes including the computing of overtime, the work year will be divided into thirteen (13) four (4) week periods (starting with the first day of the first pay period in January). During each four (4) week period, employee's work schedule will be one hundred and fifty (150) hours.
6.	Employees who work in excess of one hundred and fifty (150) hours during that period will be paid at the premium compensation rate. Employees working in excess of their normally scheduled workday will receive the premium compensation rate for that time, however, there shall be no pyramided overtime in any case. Where overtime is necessary, an employee on a flextime schedule will work no more than sixteen (16) hours at one time. Overtime checks will be issued in a separate check for seven and one-half (7Vi) hours or more.
IV.	Employees on AWS will accrue, earn, and be entitled to an equal amount of time in hours as an employee working a norma) schedule, except as amended below:
1.	Holiday time and Personal Days will be combined and will be called Elective Days.
2.	Elective Days will be as follows:

APPENDIX E
SIDE LETTER OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE NEW YORK STATE NURSES ASSOCIATION AND NEW YORK PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL COLUMBIA PRESBYTERIAN MEDICAL CENTER
This Side Letter of Agreement supplements the Contract between the Hospital and the New York State Nurses Association as follows:
In confirmation of our understanding regarding the implementation of the expedited arbitration process, the proposed list of arbitrators shall include only the following designated arbitrators to hear cases pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 of the letter dated January 15, 1986.
1.	Jonas Aarons
2.	Daniel Brent
3.	Janet Spencer

5.	Seymour Strongin
In regard to the procedure for selection of a particular designated arbitrator and the initial scheduling of a hearing date, the Hospital believes that if the parties have not mutually agreed upon the designation of one of the above designated arbitrators to hear a particular matter, the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") should then serially rotate through the list of designated arbitrators and appoint the next in line arbitrator. Departures from the serial rotation will occur only by agreement of the parties or if an arbitrator cannot provide a hearing date mutually agreeable to the parties within three months from the filing date of the Demand for Arbitration, in which case the next designated arbitrator will be consulted for an available date agreeable to all parties.
In regard to postponements of agreed upon dates, the Hospital agrees that all postponements will be by mutual agreement of the parties, which agreement will not be unreasonably denied by either party.

APPENDIX F
SIDE LETTER OF AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
THE NEW YORK STATE NURSES ASSOCIATION
AND
NEW YORK PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL COLUMBIA PRESBYTERIAN MEDICAL CENTER
This Side Letter of Agreement supplements the Contract between the Hospital and the New York State Nurses Association as follows:
This is to confirm that the following from Donald Canfield of the Hartford Life Insurance Company fully reflects our understanding of the administration of the "any occupation" stage of the "2 year own occupation, any thereafter" definition of disability.
Following is an explanation of our administration of the "any occupation" stage of the "2 year own occupation, any thereafter" definition of disability.
The formal definition of the occupation stage is as follows:
"...you must be so prevented from performing the essential duties of any occupation for which you are qualified by education, training or experience."
You will note that under this definition, the claimant would not be expected to pursue positions for which she or he had not had prior training or experience in. In addition, there is an implied earnings test on the any occupation definition. For example, a claimant would not be expected to pursue any position in which she or he could not earn an income reasonably comparable with that preceding the disability. Reasonably comparable would typically mean equal to or exceeding the percentage of prior earnings the disability benefit was replacing (e.g. 60% or 70% in the benefits you are considering).
The intent is certainly not to make a claimant pursue an unfamiliar or substantially lower paid position than that held prior to disability.
