Upon receipt of the FMCS panel the employer representative will immediately communicate directly with representative for the Union assigned for the purpose of selecting arbitrators to begin the process. Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of the FMCS list the parties will alternatively strike names to determine which one shall sit on the arbitration. The Union will decide which party will strike first for the first scheduled arbitration under this Agreement. After that case, the first strike will alternate between the two parties, unless they mutually agree otherwise. The parties must select an arbitrator, and schedule the arbitration date within thirty (30) working days of the Union's written notice to proceed to arbitration.
Either party may request a second (2nd) FMCS panel of arbitrators (limit of one (1) and the foregoing procedures shall be followed.)

By mutual agreement of the parties, a request of the arbitrator for a bench decision is allowed, and shall be mandatory upon the arbitrator if so notified upon acceptance of the dispute.

The Prescription Drug Benefits will be as follows:

Rx Retail Co-pay	Generic $7 Formulary $ 15 Brand $30 50% Life Style	PPL Gen $7 PPL Brand $15 Other Generic 20% or $ 15 Min. $30 Max. Other Brand 20% or $30 Min. $60 Max. Specialty 20% or $50 Min. $100 Max. *30 day supply

Effective 1/1/2011, there will be an annual combined out-of-pocket maximum on “specialty drugs” of $1200 per member.
The Company will complete an “Annual Performance Review” of the medical /prescription drug plan. This Annual Performance Review will be conducted in April of each year and look back at the period of January 1 through December 31. The first Annual Performance Review for the PPL penetration will be in April of 2011.
The Company will maintain the co-pay levels in effect if the PPL prescription penetration level is sixty-five percent (65%) for the 2011 Annual Performance Review, seventy percent (70%) for the 2012 Annual Performance Review and seventy-five percent (75%) in the 2013 Annual Performance Review. The PPL prescription penetration level will be measured as the number of PPL prescriptions issues versus the total number of all prescriptions issued. If the penetration levels fall short of the targeted levels the Company may increase the “Other” co-pay percentage by the shortfall percentage amount (retail and mail order). However, the dollar minimum will stay the same. If the targeted penetration level is achieved in a subsequent year the “Other “ copay will revert back to the appropriate level for the target achievement.
To the extent it is available, outpatient specialty drugs must be obtained through the pharmaceutical network and not the medical provider network.
37
Given the dynamics of specialty drugs, the parties have agreed to review the specialty drug program during the Annual Performance Review to determine the appropriate co-pay levels, maximums, coverage duration, etc.
JBS Quality Care
The Company and the Union have discussed several plan management measures intended to provide quality medical care and control cost without changing the plan design and the employee-co-pay structure outlined above. These measures would include, but not be limited to the implementation of the JBS Preferred Pharmacy List (PPL) and Condition Management/Condition Managers and a High Performance Network (HPN). In exchange for further plan design changes the parties have agreed to the following:
•	The employee weekly contributions for medical and prescription will be as follows:
o	Employee Only	$11.00
o	Employee+1	$16.00
o	Employee+2	$19.00
o	Employee+3	$22.00
o	Employee+4	$25.00
•	Effective January 1, 2011 the Company agrees to cover preventative/wellness benefits as discussed.
•	The Company and the Union have agreed to the methodology and have established medical cost benchmark of based on a per member per month (PMPM) net cost. The benchmark is based on a trailing three year period (January 1 through December 31) and will include paid claims, fixed costs, less stop-loss reimbursement and plus the medical inflation trend as reported in the Mercer annual survey. The performance of the Plan will be reviewed against this benchmark each year during the Annual Performance Review (April 2011, 2012 and 2013). The performance of the plan will be based on the preceding twelve (12) month period of January 1 through December 31 and will include paid claims, fixed cost less stop-loss reimbursement;
•	Ona semi-annual basis the Company will review the plant's medical and prescription drug cost experience, results of plan initiatives and trends with the Union;
•	The Company may implement its Condition Management program in addition to other nonplan design changes in order to enhance the medical care and maintain cost;
•	The Company will meet with and seek input from the Union prior to the implementation of these or any other plan initiatives;
•	In addition to setting the benchmark during the Annual Performance Reviews the Company and Union will review the performance of the Plan and will, if necessary, make changes to the Plan to maintain performance;
•	If the PMPM cost increases over the established benchmark the Company may implement plan design changes or contribution increases in order to bring cost back in line with the agreed-upon benchmark;
•	Changes in a single plan year will not exceed:
o In-network deductibles by one hundred dollars ($100) and three hundred dollars ($300) for individual and family respectively;
38
o Out-of-network deductibles by two hundred dollars ($200) and six hundred dollars ($600) respectively;
o In-network out-of-pocket maximum by five hundred dollars ($500) and one thousand dollars ($1,000) respectively;
o Out-of-network out-of-pocket maximum may go to "no maximum";
o Elimination of the PCP and Specialist office co-pay;
o The in-network coinsurance will not decrease by more than ten percent (10%) during the life of the Agreement;
o If there were no change in the plan design in a plan year, or the change was less than the annual maximum, the permissible subsequent one (1) year change would be the amount(s) not increased in the prior plan year(s) plus the amounts of the current plan year permitted above.
