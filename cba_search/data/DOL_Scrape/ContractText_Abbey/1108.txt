SECTION 4.	There shall be no discrimination against employees by reason of race, color, religion, nationality, origin, ancestry, age, or sex.
SECTION 5.	If the Union shall intentionally furnish employees to any Employer in any geographical jurisdiction of this Agreement, for the type of work covered by this Agreement, upon any more favorable terms or conditions (including wage rates, overtime work and fringe benefits) than those contained herein, the Union agrees that such more favorable terms and conditions shall automatically be extended to the Employers covered by this Agreement.

SECTION 1. The Employers agree that in the employment of employees to perform the various classifications of Labor required in the work under this Agreement, they or their representative shall, except under unusual circumstances, notify the Local Union within twenty-four (24) hours before hiring new employees so as to afford the Local Union an opportunity to refer applicants to such employment. They will not discriminate against applicants because of membership or non-membership in the Union. The Union in its referral of applicants to the Employers agrees that it will not discriminate against said applicants because of membership or non-membership in the Union.

The continued employment by the Contractor of employees covered by this Agreement shall be conditioned upon payment by such employees of the initiation fee and periodic dues as herein defined. The failure of any person to pay, or tender, the initiation fee and periodic dues shall obligate the Contractor who employs such person, upon written notice from the Union to that effect and assurance by the Union that membership as herein defined was and is available to such person on the same terms available to other applicants for such membership, to forthwith discharge such person within ten (10) days of notification.

The duly authorized Representative of the Union shall be permitted, as long as they do not unreasonably interfere with the progress of work, to call on Laborers on the job and to collect initiations or other assessments legally owing to the Union, and where necessary, the Employer shall furnish a pass to enter on such job, if possible.
SECTION 5.	The Employers agree to make reasonable efforts, when subcontracting Laborers' work covered by this Agreement, to subcontract said work to a firm or corporation who will abide by all conditions of this Agreement.
