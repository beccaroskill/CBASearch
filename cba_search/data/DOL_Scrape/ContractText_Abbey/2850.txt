18
his/her work location). Responding to short telephone inquiries or inperson conversations initiated by others shall be the only exception to the prior approval requirement (although such time shall be reported in the aggregate at the end of the day on a Request for Leave for Union Business Form). This form shall specify the Union activities, which are within the particular Union representative's jurisdiction with which to deal (as specifically provided in this Article 6). The form shall be submitted as far in advance as possible to the Union representative's designated management representative for approval before attending to Union business. In addition, the Union representative shall contact the designated management representative of the employee seeking assistance to schedule an appropriate time to discuss Union business, with due regard to the demands of the workplace if such assistance is provided during the duty hours of the employee involved. In the event of a bona fide emergency where it is impracticable for the Union representative to submit the Request for Leave for Union Business Form in advance, such form shall be completed and submitted immediately after attending to such emergency situation, with an explanation of the emergency circumstances involved and the time spent attending to them.
Union business leave shall be submitted to payroll as is the case with any other leave form, and shall be tracked in the payroll accounting system like any other leave of absence.

Section 6.4.	Access to Work.
The Chief Steward, a representative of Ohio Council 8, and the President or Vice-President of the Union may consult employees in the assembly area before the start of and at the completion of the day's work.

Any suspected abuse of these privileges shall be resolved through a meeting of the City and the Union.
Section 6.5.	Privileges of the Representative of Ohio Council 8 and Union President and Vice-President
The representative of Ohio Council 8, and the President and VicePresident of the Union shall have the privileges accorded to a Chief

The President and Vice-President of Local 1632, upon election to their post and as long as they continue in that post, will be permitted to devote their full time during the workweek to Union matters while continuing in their City job classification(s). The Union President's and Vice-President's entitlement to their hourly wage, fringe benefits and seniority accrual will continue as though they were performing their normal job-related duties.

Fines in an amount of one (1) to three (3) days only for violations of Central Work Rule number 5 (Attendance) or any future Central Work Rule addressing attendance may be offered by the Hearing Officer. If the employee agrees to the fine or forfeiture, such accrued leave shall be one (1) hour of accrued leave or fine for each one (1) hour of the proposed suspension. Accepting a fine or the type of leave (vacation or compensatory time) shall be the employee’s choice. The fine or forfeiture of the leave shall constitute corrective/disciplinary action of record, shall be accordingly noted in the employee’s personnel file, and shall constitute the final resolution of the departmental charges, which resolution shall not later be subject to challenge by the employee or the Union under the grievance procedure or in any other forum.

ARTICLE 11	- GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURES
Section 11.1.	Definition and Purpose.
(A)	The prompt presentation, adjustment and/or answering of grievances is in the interest of sound relations between employees and the City. The prompt and fair disposition of grievances involves important and equal obligations and responsibilities on the part of representatives of each party to protect and preserve the grievance procedure as an orderly means of resolving grievances.
(B)	A "grievance" is defined as a complaint arising under and during the term of this Contract raised by an employee or the Union against the City alleging that there has been a violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of an express written provision of this Contract.

Section 11.3.	Time Limits.
(A)	A grievance must be filed in writing within fourteen (14) days after the occurrence of the first event giving rise to the grievance, or within fourteen (14) days after the Union or the affected employee(s), through the use of reasonable diligence, could have known of the first event giving rise to the grievance.

32
(C)	The time limits prescribed in the following steps in this Article may be extended at any time by mutual consent of the parties involved. Similarly, any step in the grievance procedure may be eliminated by mutual consent. Mutual consent must be indicated in writing and signed by both parties involved.

Section 11.4.	Specificity Required in Written Grievances and Limitations on Expanding the Scope of a Grievance.
The written grievance shall specify the section or sections of this Contract that are allegedly violated, misinterpreted or misapplied; a detailed statement of the full facts on which the grievance is based; the specific relief requested; the name(s) of the aggrieved employee(s) and their position(s); the name of the lowest-level non-AFSCME supervisor(s) of the aggrieved employee(s); the date the grievance was filed; and the signatures of the aggrieved employee(s) and any union official assisting in the preparation of the grievance. After a grievance is filed, the employee or the Union may amend the grievance to clarify the relevant facts and circumstances or to correct clerical errors no later than with the Step 2 filing, but may not amend the grievance to assert new claims, contract violations or to expand the scope of the relief sought without the express written consent of the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee.
Section 11.5.	Grievance and Arbitration.
The following are steps that shall be followed in the processing of a grievance, and the parties will act in good faith to limit the number of people present at each hearing.
(A)	Step 1. A grievance shall be filed in writing (within the time limits and in the form specified in Sections 11.3 and 11.4) with the aggrieved employee's Appointing Authority or designee. The Appointing Authority or designee shall hold a hearing with the employee and the Chief Steward (or Local Union Vice-President in his/her absence) within seven (7) days after receipt of the grievance. The Appointing Authority or designee shall give a written answer, after review by the Appointing Authority’s office, to the employee and the Chief Steward (or Local Union Vice-President in his/her absence) within fifteen (15) days after the hearing. If the Union does not refer the grievance to Step 2 of the procedure within seven (7) days after receipt of the decision rendered in this Step, the grievance shall be considered to be satisfactorily resolved.
33
(B)	Step 2. (1) Step 2 Hearings for Non-Disciplinary Grievances. If the grievance is not satisfactorily settled at Step 1, the Union may, within seven (7) days after receipt of the Step 1 answer or within seven (7) days of when the Step 1 answer was due, appeal the grievance to the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee. The Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee shall hold a hearing with appropriate representatives of the grievant’s department and the employee, the Chief Steward, the Local Union President or the Vice-President, and/or a representative of Ohio Council 8 within ten (10) days after receipt of the grievance. The Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee, after consultation with the Appointing Authority or designee, shall give a written answer to the employee and the Local Union President within ten (10) days after the Step 2 hearing.
Step 2. (2) Step 2 Meetings for Disciplinary Grievances. In disciplinary cases, a grievance must be filed at Step 2 by the Union within fourteen (14) days of the Hearing Officer’s decision issued pursuant to Section 10.4 of this Contract. The Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee and appropriate representatives of the grievant’s department shall hold a meeting with the employee, the Chief Steward, the Local Union President or the VicePresident, and/or a representative of Ohio Council 8 within ten (10) days after receipt of the grievance. The hearing officer conducting the Step 2 disciplinary grievance meeting shall not be the same hearing officer who conducted the disciplinary hearing pursuant to Section 10.4. The review of disciplinary cases at Step 2 shall be a meeting to review the case, not a hearing. The Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee, after consultation with the Appointing Authority or designee, shall give a written answer to the employee and the Local Union President within ten (10) days after the Step 2 meeting.
(C)	Step 3.
(1)	If the grievance is not satisfactorily settled at Step 2, the Union may, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Step 2 answer or within thirty (30) days of when the Step 2 answer was due, submit the issue to arbitration. The Union shall notify the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee of its intent to submit the grievance to arbitration.
34
(2)	A permanent panel of five (5) arbitrators and three (3) alternates will be selected by the parties. An arbitrator shall be selected from the panel to hear grievances through random drawing. Once selected, the arbitrator’s name will no longer be available for selection until all remaining arbitrators on the panel have been selected.
(3)	The arbitrator shall be notified of his/her selection by a joint letter from the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee and the Union requesting that he/she set a date and time for the hearing subject to the availability of the City and Union representatives, provided that the hearing must be held within thirty (30) calendar days following the selection of the arbitrator. If the selected arbitrator is unable to schedule the hearing within the thirty (30) day period, the parties may select another arbitrator.
(4)	After all arbitrators on the panel have been selected once, the above process regarding random drawing will be repeated.
(5)	The parties may mutually agree to remove an arbitrator from the panel after he/she has issued at least one decision.
(6)	All arbitrations shall be held in the City of Columbus, Ohio. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the City and the Union. The arbitrator's decision shall be rendered within thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing or the submission of post-hearing briefs by the parties, whichever occurs later.
(D)	The arbitrator shall have no right to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to, or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall consider and decide only the question of whether there has been a violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of the specific provisions of this Contract based on the specific issue submitted to the arbitrator by the parties in writing. If no joint written stipulation of the issue is agreed to by the Union and the City, the arbitrator shall be empowered to determine and decide the issue raised by the grievance as submitted in writing at Step 1. The arbitrator shall be without power to make recommendations contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable laws or rules and regulations of administrative
35
bodies that have the force and effect of law. The arbitrator shall not in any way limit or interfere with the powers, duties and responsibilities of the City under law and applicable court decisions. The decision of the arbitrator, if made in accordance with the jurisdiction and authority granted to the arbitrator pursuant to this Contract, will be accepted as final by the City, the Union and the employee(s), and all parties will abide by it.
(E)	Grievance settlements reached at Step 1, shall be in writing, shall have a limited application to the area of responsibility of the Appointing Authority and not precedent setting for the City. Grievance settlements reached at Steps 2 and 3 by the Union and the City shall be in writing, and shall be final, conclusive, and binding on the City, the Union, and the employees.
(F)	A grievance may be withdrawn by the Union at any time from the grievance procedure, and the withdrawal of any grievance shall not be prejudicial to the positions taken by the parties as they related to that grievance or any other grievances.
Section 11.6.	Persons with Responsibilities Under the Grievance Procedure and Scope of Authority.
The Union shall maintain a current list of Union officers, Chief Stewards and Stewards listed by departments and divisions. This list shall be furnished to the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee together with revisions as changes occur. Persons whose names are not on this list shall not be recognized as officials of the Union for the purpose of this Article. Furthermore, the City emphasizes that all non-AFSCME supervisors have the responsibility for adjudicating grievances pursuant to the provisions of this Article. If requested to do so by the Union, the City shall provide a list of first-line non-AFSCME supervisors. Such responsibility shall prevail only over those employees assigned to that non-AFSCME supervisor. No employee in the bargaining unit shall have any authority to settle or respond to a grievance on behalf of the City.
Section 11.7.	Time Off For Presenting Grievances.
(A)	An employee and his/her Chief Steward or other Union representative authorized to act in the place of the Chief Steward as provided in Article 6 (Floating Chief Steward, Union President or Vice President) shall be allowed time off from regular duties with pay for attendance at scheduled hearings and meetings under the grievance procedure with proper notification to their respective supervisors. The
36
appropriate Union representative as provided in Article 6 shall have adequate time with pay for a proper investigation of each grievance as provided in Article 6.
(B)	The aggrieved employee and any necessary witnesses shall not lose any regular straight-time pay for time off the job while attending a grievance hearing, meeting or an arbitration hearing.
Section 11.8.	Specific Types of Grievances.
(A)	Disciplinary Grievances. The right of any employee to file an appeal pursuant to Section 149-1 of the City Charter is specifically waived. If an employee or the Union elects to challenge disciplinary action under the grievance procedure, the grievance must be filed at Step 2.
(B)	Grievances with City-Wide Application. A grievance with citywide application (i.e., involving a matter or issue of repetitive or general application) that may affect bargaining unit employees in different divisions and departments shall be brought directly to Step 2. Once a grievance on a matter or issue of repetitive or general application has been resolved by the parties on the merits (i.e., by a mutually agreed upon written settlement or an arbitration award on the merits), the Union will not advance to arbitration any further grievances on that particular matter or issue.
(C)	Grievances Involving Withholding of Terminal Pay. A grievance involving a claim that the City has improperly withheld money allegedly owed to the City by the employee from the employee's final pay (whether it be a final paycheck, vacation pay, pay for sick leave bank or other terminal pay) shall be filed directly at Step 2 of the grievance procedure.
(D)	A grievance classified, as a “class action grievance” must contain the following:
(1)	A community of interest shared by two or more employees; and
(2)	The classification of grieving employees; and
(3)	The identity of who will represent the grievants at hearings.

Section 11.9.	Use of Mediation.
The parties acknowledge that they have used mediation processes in the past to expeditiously resolve backlogs of grievances pending Step 3 (arbitration) proceedings. The parties agree that they may utilize the services of a mediator in the future to resolve pending grievances. The use of a mediator for such purposes shall be by mutual agreement of the parties as to an identified grievance or grievances and according to procedures mutually agreed to in writing in advance of the mediation process. The Union and City shall meet periodically to attempt to resolve matters prior to mediation or arbitration.
38
ARTICLE 12	- NO STRIKE OR LOCKOUT
Section 12.1.	No Strike.
(A)	The services performed by the City employees included in this Contract are essential to the public's health, safety and welfare. The Union, therefore, agrees that it will not authorize, instigate, aid, condone or engage in any strike, work stoppage or other action at any time, which will interrupt or interfere with the operation of the City. No employee represented by the Union shall cause or take part in any strike, work stoppage, slowdown or other action, which will interrupt or interfere with the operation of the City.

Subject to the protections provided to employees under Section 12.1(D), any or all employees who violate any of the provisions of this Article may be discharged or otherwise disciplined by the City.

When a vacancy in a job classification occurs within a division, the vacancy shall be filled from among employees in that job classification in that division as set forth below:
(A)	Position Assignments without Specialized Qualifications.

40
(B)	Position Assignments with Specialized Qualifications. Vacancies within a division, where the particular job assignment requires specialized qualifications that are not shared by all employees in the job classification, shall be filled on the basis of management’s evaluation of the specialized qualifications that correspond to the requirements, responsibilities and duties of the position as described by the division and associated specialized knowledge, skills, and abilities. Provided all of the above factors are equal, classification seniority shall determine which applicant is given the position in question.
The term "vacancy" is defined as a position to be filled, as determined by management, that results from one of the following circumstances:
(1)	An employee has separated from a position and the Appointing Authority has decided to fill the position;
(2)	An increase in the total number of positions in the class;
(3)	A reallocation of a position as approved by the Civil Service Commission; or
(4)	An increase in the total number of positions in a class on a specific shift or reporting location.

41
ARTICLE 14 - TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENTS
Section 14.1.	Transitional Return to Work.
The City agrees to make reasonable efforts to provide transitional return to work assignments for all employees who have sustained an occupational injury or illness or a reoccurrence/exacerbation of a preexisting condition or, in some cases, are returning from short-term disability leave. This Section 14.1 is not to be construed as requiring the assignment of transitional return to work in any case, but only that reasonable efforts to do so will be made. This will be done in accordance with the following:
(A)	During the time an employee is in a transitional return to work program, the employee will be assigned duties which the employee is capable of performing based upon the recommendation of the employee’s attending physician.

(B)	Employees shall be selected for both regular and overtime temporary duty assignments based upon their dependability and ability to perform the work of the job to which they will be temporarily assigned. Where ability and dependability are relatively equal, then seniority within the job classification shall control.
42
(C)	Employees who are temporarily assigned duties of a classification assigned a lower wage rate shall retain their classification and current rate of pay. The provision regarding compensation for temporary change of duty assignments is found in Section 26.7.
(D)	Employees who receive a temporary assignment of this nature shall continue to accrue seniority within their current classification.
(E)	A temporary assignment to fill a permanent vacancy shall not exceed one hundred twenty (120) days.

The Civil Service Commission is responsible for the establishment and enforcement of the rules governing layoffs, except as amended in this Article. Both the City and the Union agree to strictly adhere to the rules in effect since April 1, 2002, as follows or as may be amended by the provisions set forth in this Contract.
Section 15.2.	Notice to the Commission.
Whenever it becomes necessary because of a material change in duties, a reorganization or a shortage of work or funds, to reduce the number of full-time employees in any department of the City, the Appointing Authority shall file a notice with the Civil Service Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to the expected day of the layoff specifying the class(es) in which the layoff is to occur and the number of employees to be laid off in each class.
Section 15.3.	Certification of Layoff.
The Civil Service Commission shall certify to the Appointing Authority the names of those full-time employees to be laid off as determined by Civil Service Commission Rules, and the procedures approved by the Commission Executive Secretary except as amended by the procedures set forth in this Article. Layoffs shall be by class and based on seniority, but in accordance with status and appointment type using the following categories:
(A)	Temporary or Seasonal employees
(B)	Provisional full-time probationary employees
(C)	Provisional full-time non-probationary employees
(D)	Permanent full-time probationary employees
(E)	Permanent full-time non-probationary employees
43
Employees in the category st the top of the list are to be laid-off first. No employees from a higher category can be laid-off until all employees in the lower categories have been laid-off. The Appointing Authority shall notify any laid-off employee(s) at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the lay off.
Section 15.4.	Bumping.
A laid-off employee may have bumping rights within the same class to another division within the same department, to a lower class within the same class series or to a class in the same job family in which he/she previously served and for which he/she is qualified. No laid-off employee may bump another employee in accordance with the provisions of this section, unless he/she has more seniority and is in the same or a higher category as listed in Section 15.3 above. A bumped employee has the same bumping rights as a laid-off employee.
Non-bargaining unit employees shall have no bumping rights into an AFSCME bargaining unit classification(s).
(A)	Same class. A laid-off full-time employee in a division shall have bumping rights within the same class against the least senior full-time employee in the department in the order set forth in Section 15.3 above.
(B)	Class series. If an employee has no opportunity to bump within the same class, then such employee shall have bumping rights within his/her division (if none, then within the department) against the least senior full-time employee holding a position in the next lower class within the series. If no bumping opportunity is afforded, the same right shall extend to the next and each lower class until the class series is exhausted.
(C)	Job family. If an employee has no bumping opportunity within the class series, then such employee shall have bumping rights within his/her division (if none, then within the department) against the least senior full-time employee holding a position in a lower class in the same job family if the laid-off employee previously served in the class and if he/she is presently qualified; however, no such bump may occur in the presence of an appropriate competitive eligible list unless, in accordance with Civil Service Commission Rules, the laid-off employee will have permanent status in the previous class. A "lower class" for purposes of this Subsection means any class which has a maximum rate of pay lower than the minimum rate of pay for the class of the laid-off employee.
44
(D)	Part-time. In the event the laid-off employee has no bumping rights to a full-time position under (A), (B) or (C) above, then such employee shall have bumping rights within the same class against the least senior part-time employee within the division, or if none, within the department.
Section 15.5.	Eligible List Reinstatement
The names of any laid-off permanent employees shall be placed at the top of the appropriate competitive eligible list, as provided in Civil Service Commission Rule VIII(C)(3), in order of seniority, and shall be certified for appointment in any department in accordance with Civil Service Commission Rules when an Appointing Authority has a vacancy to fill. If the eligible employee at the top of the list was laid-off from that department, that person shall be appointed.
Section 15.6.	Recall.
The names of any laid-off provisional employees or employees in noncompetitive classifications shall be placed on the appropriate recall list, in order of seniority, for a period of eighteen (18) months. In the event that a vacancy in a department is to be filled in a class for which a recall list exists, then the appointment shall be made of the individual highest on the list who was laid-off from that department. Otherwise, appointment may be made as provided elsewhere by Civil Service Commission Rules. No recall list shall remain in effect after an eligible list for the class has been established.
Section 15.7.	Limited Positions.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, if a limited position is to be eliminated and the employee in the position was appointed subject to the availability of work or funding, then that employee shall be terminated in accordance with Civil Service Commission Rule X(F)(1). A limited employee who is bumped shall have the same bumping rights as other employees.

Section 16.2.	Changes in Normal Workweek and Workday.
(A)	Permanent Changes to Normal Workweek and Workday.
(1)	In situations where the City believes that alternate or flexible work schedules, different from those set forth in Section 16.1 above, are needed for operational efficiency and effectiveness, the City will give the Union President and Chief Steward for the Department (where applicable) written notice of the proposed work schedule and a list of those job classification(s)/position assignment(s) affected at least fourteen (14) days in advance of any proposed change(s). If the Union wants to bargain about the proposed change(s), one representative from the City's Labor Relations Section and two representatives from the Department involved shall meet with the Union President, Regional Director or designee and Chief Steward in the affected Department (where applicable), to negotiate the
46
proposed schedule changes as well as the impact of such change(s) on matters such as holidays, sick leave, vacation leave, etc. In the absence of an agreement being reached within the fourteen (14)-day period, the City may, at the end of the fourteen (14)-day period, implement its proposed work schedule.
(2)	The Union may file a grievance at Step 2 of the grievance procedure if it believes the schedule change is not reasonably related to operational needs. If an arbitrator finds in favor of the Union in such a grievance, the remedy shall be limited to directing the City to prospectively restore the preexisting work schedule pending further negotiations and/or agreement on a different schedule.
(3)	The process set forth in this Section 16.2(A) applies only to changes in work schedules or shifts that are of a permanent nature. "Permanent nature" is defined for purposes of this Section 16.2 to be periods of ninety (90) days or longer. No changes shall be made to work schedules or shifts unless they are of a permanent nature, except as provided elsewhere in this Article 16.
(4)	Employees affected by any changes in work schedules or shifts as a result of the process set forth in this Section 16.2(A) shall be given fourteen (14) days prior notice of a permanent work schedule or shift change. Reassignment of employees to new or revised work schedules or shifts established as a result of the process set forth in this Section 16.2(A) shall be done in accordance with Article 13 (Seniority).
(B)	Establishing an Alternate Work Schedule for a Vacancy. When a vacancy occurs, the City may, before filling the vacancy, decide to establish an alternate work schedule for the vacant position without following the procedures set forth in Section 16.2(A). When this occurs, the City may hire a new employee or transfer a current employee, pursuant to Article 13, on the condition they accept the alternate work schedule as a condition of employment or as a condition of accepting transfer into the vacancy.
47
(C)	Temporary Change In Shift Assignment. When any full-time employee is scheduled for a shift other than that to which he/she is regularly assigned in multiple-shift operations, he/she shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hours of pay at time and one-half his/her regular rate unless he/she has been given at least twenty-four (24) hours notice of a change in his/her regular shift assignment, in which case payment shall be at his/her regular hourly rate.
(D)	Temporary Change in Work Schedule. Temporary work schedule changes of less than ninety (90) days may be made in response to specific short-term operational reguirements. Such changes may be made without following the procedures set forth in Section 16.2(A). The Union may file a grievance at Step 2 of the grievance procedure if it believes the change is not reasonably related to operational needs.
Section 16.3.	Overtime Eligibility and Pay.
(A)	Calculation of Daily Overtime. Overtime will be calculated from shift to shift. Overtime will be paid if an employee works more hours than the hours of his/her regular shift. Time and one-half will be paid for time worked beyond the employee's regular shift provided the employee has completed eight (or more, if applicable) hours of straight-time work that workday (for example, an employee working a normal workday of ten (10) hours, shall be eligible for daily overtime after actually working ten (10) hours in the workday). For purposes of this Subsection (A), the term "time worked" shall mean only actual work time, and shall not include any paid or unpaid time that is not actually worked, except for paid lunch periods in continuous operations as referenced in Section 16.7. Time and one-half will also be paid for call-backs as referenced in Section 26.5, regardless of whether the employee has actually worked eight (8) hours in the day.
(B)	Calculation of Weekly Overtime - On First Regular Day Off. Time and one-half will be paid for time worked on an employee's first regular day off provided the employee has accumulated forty (40) straight-time rate hours in paid status during the workweek. For purposes of this Subsection (B), paid status will include periods of Union leave without pay, but shall not include sick leave, injury leave or disability leave.
48
(C)	Calculation of Weekly Overtime - On Second Regular Day Off. Double time will be paid for time worked on an employee's second regular day off provided the employee has accumulated forty (40) straight-time rate hours in paid status during the preceding six (6) days. A fourth shift employee’s second regular day off will start twenty-four (24) hours immediately preceding the start of the first regular shift of the next workweek. Alternative work schedules can establish when an employee’s second regular day off occurs and therefore when double time pay will apply to overtime. For purposes of this Subsection (C), paid status will include periods of Union leave without pay, but shall not include sick leave, injury leave or disability leave.
(D)	Inapplicability of Overtime When Changing/Trading of Work Days by Mutual Consent. Time worked due to work schedules being changed at the reguest of the employee or trading days off by mutual consent of employees and the prior consent of the Appointing Authority is not subject to overtime compensation, to the extent permitted by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
(E)	Inapplicability of Overtime for Scheduled Shift Changes. Time worked by employees who are subject to a regularly scheduled three (3) month shift change rt the time a shift change is scheduled, or time worked by employees at the time a shift change is scheduled in a twenty-four (24) hour-a-day operation and/or a continuous seven (7) day-per-week operation, is not subject to the compensation set forth in this Section 16.3, unless subject to the overtime payment reguirements established in the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Section 16.4.	Distribution of Overtime.
(A)	Overtime Eligibility. Employees within the same classification and with the same work capabilities within the same reporting location who are participating in the overtime provisions shall have an egual opportunity to earn voluntary overtime pay. Classifications which include different work capabilities shall be identified to the Union prior to the formation of a separate overtime list. It is the Appointing Authority’s burden to prove that work capabilities needed are different.
49
Employees desiring to work voluntary overtime shall so indicate in writing to their immediate supervisor. All employees who choose to participate in overtime will be given an equal opportunity to earn overtime on a continuing basis. The opportunity for overtime work shall be computed by totaling overtime earned plus overtime offered but declined. If overtime is cancelled by management the hours will not be charged. Post-training new hires, transferees, and those employees returning to the reporting location from an extended leave who desire to work voluntary overtime shall be initially assigned the highest number of overtime hours in the assignment unit in order to place them on the overtime equalization list. All overtime, whether in class or out of class, shall be recorded on the same overtime equalization list.
(B)	Overtime Distribution Procedures.
(1)	On each occasion the opportunity to work scheduled overtime shall be offered to the employees desiring to work overtime who have the least number of overtime hours to their credit at that time. If an employee does not accept the assignment, the employee with the next fewest number of overtime hours to his/her credit shall be offered the assignment. This procedure shall be followed until the required number of employees has been selected for the overtime work.
(2)	If an employee turns down overtime or is unable to respond when contacted for overtime, the number of hours offered to him/her shall be credited to his/her overtime hours. Employees who have declined to participate in the voluntary overtime shall be automatically charged for overtime hours worked in the classification at the reporting location.
(3)	Employees on military leave not exceeding twenty-two (22) eight (8) hour work days (176 hours) shall not be contacted or charged for overtime work during that period.
(4)	An employee on leave shall not be contacted for voluntary overtime, but shall be charged for overtime work during such leave as long as the employee comes up for overtime work during that period.
However, an employee on holiday; jury duty; vacation leave or compensatory time of three (3) workdays or less; or his/her regularly scheduled days off shall be contacted for voluntary overtime subject to the provisions of this Section 16.4.
50
(5)	If an employee is not offered the opportunity to work overtime when qualified and entitled, he/she shall be offered the next opportunity to work overtime consistent with the terms of this Article. Those hours not offered when initially entitled shall not be included in hours credited when worked.
(C)	Posting of Overtime Equalization List. A record of the overtime hours worked and of overtime hours offered but not worked, by each employee, shall be posted on a bulletin board within the employee's general work area. Each time overtime is offered and charged the list will be updated.
Section 16.5.	Overtime Scheduling.
(A)	Where practical, overtime shall be administered on a voluntary basis; otherwise, it shall be mandatory that each employee scheduled to work overtime must perform the job assignment within his/her given classification.
(B)	Mandatory Overtime. Mandatory overtime may be required when volunteer(s) cannot be found to work the overtime. An exception to the application of mandatory overtime scheduling shall be permissible when a valid reasonable request is made by an employee. Mandatory overtime shall be distributed in an equitable manner starting with the least senior employee on the first mandatory occasion. Thereafter, the next least senior employee shall be assigned to the next mandatory occasion, until all employees have worked a mandatory overtime assignment.
(C)	In cases of overtime scheduled as a result of holidays or extreme emergencies involving a departmental operation, it shall be the established procedure for the department or division head to confer with the employee's Union representative when available regarding a mutually acceptable work schedule.
(D)	Working overtime out of class in a lower classification shall be scheduled by using the lowest number of hours worked among persons with the ability and dependability to do the work.
(E)	Pre-scheduled overtime shall be offered no later than the end of the employee’s workday prior to the overtime.
51
Section 16.6.	Rest Periods.
(A)	All employees' work schedules shall provide for a fifteen (15) minute rest period during each half shift. The rest period shall be scheduled at the middle of each half shift whenever feasible. When practicable, rest periods shall be taken within the work area or in close proximity to the work area that shall afford no more than the allotted fifteen (15) minutes. Rest periods shall not be taken at the beginning or end of each half shift, and shall not be used to extend a lunch break.
(B)	Employees who for any reason work beyond their regular quitting time shall receive a fifteen (15) minute rest period before they start to work on the extended shift. In addition, they shall be granted the regular rest periods that occur during the extended shift.
Section 16.7.	Lunch Period.
All employees shall be granted a lunch period during each full shift. Whenever possible the lunch period shall be scheduled st the middle of each full shift. Employees who work in a twenty-four (24) hour operation shall receive a paid lunch period; all other employees shall receive an unpaid lunch period. When there is an extension of the regular shift as a result of an emergency or scheduled overtime, a lunch period shall be granted when the extension exceeds four (4) hours.
Section 16.8.	Tardiness.
Employees are required to be punctual at all times. A grace period of six (6) minutes from the shift starting time will be allowed without disciplinary action unless frequent abuse occurs.
Section 16.9.	Reporting Off Work Procedure.
The failure of any employee to report off duty in any twenty-four (24) hour City operation at least one (1) hour before his/her scheduled starting time shall constitute away without leave for all scheduled hours which were not worked. All other employees shall report themselves off duty at least thirty-(30) minutes prior to their regularly scheduled starting time. Failure to so report shall constitute away without leave for all scheduled hours not worked. The provisions of this Section 16.9 shall not apply when it is impossible for the employee to so report due to circumstances beyond his/her control, provided that the employee will then report at the earliest opportunity followed by a written explanation of the circumstances which made it impossible for him/her to report as directed.
52
Section 16.10.	Compensatory Time.
(A)	The amount of compensatory time earned may be calculated at the straight time rate, or in lieu of payment of overtime, by one and one-half (1-1/2) when time and one-half is applicable or by two (2) when double time is applicable by the number of hours actually worked on an authorized overtime basis. The compensatory time account balances shall be maintained in units of hours.
(B)	Eligibility. A compensatory time account may be established for full-time employees. Compensatory time may only be earned in lieu of cash payment for authorized time worked on a premium basis. The employee may, d his/her option, receive either cash payment or compensatory time for time worked on a premium basis.
(C)	The following conditions shall govern the use of compensatory time:
(1)	Compensatory time upon request by the employee may be taken by the employee at such time or times as may be approved by the Appointing Authority.
(2)	An employee who is about to be separated from city service for any reason and who has an unused compensatory time account balance to his/her credit shall be paid such account balance upon separation. Such payment shall be calculated by multiplying the employee's regular hourly straight time wage rate by the number of hours in his/her compensatory time account upon separation.
(3)	Any compensatory time account balance above eighty-(80) hours shall be paid off at the employee's hourly rate. Pay out of compensatory time over the approved balance will be paid once per year unless the Union and the Appointing Authority agree to a different pay-out schedule.

61
Section 20.3	Sick Leave Documentation and Suspected Sick Leave Abuse.
If an employee has sufficient sick leave accruals, and there is no evidence of sick leave abuse, the Appointing Authority shall grant sick leave upon the written request of the employee. In cases of extended illness, that is, illness which lasts more than three (3) consecutive workdays, or suspected abuse, as determined by the Appointing Authority or designee, the Appointing Authority or designee may require evidence as to the adequacy of the reason(s) for an employee's absence during the time for which sick leave is requested. Any sick leave use protected by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) shall not be considered as sick leave abuse.
(A)	Sick leave abuse may be indicated by any or all of the following:
(1)	Excessive use of sick leave within a twelve (12) month period which has not been substantiated by a physician’s or other licensed health care provider’s statement;

The Appointing Authority or designee shall review the situation not longer than every one hundred twenty (120) days to determine if the problem has been abated. Upon receipt of the written notice, the employee may request a meeting with the
62
Appointing Authority or designee to discuss the requirement to provide such documentation. The employee may, upon request, be accompanied by a Union representative at such meeting.
(C)	Failure to correct sick leave abuse or provide medical documentation when required to do so may result in disciplinary action consistent with the provisions of Article 10 of this Contract.
(D)	Falsification of a physician's or other licensed health care provider’s statement may also be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.
(E)	If the Appointing Authority or designee questions the reason(s) offered by the employee for his/her sick leave, the Appointing Authority or designee may require the employee to be examined by a licensed physician identified by the Appointing Authority or designee. Failure to submit to the examination shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action.
(F)	Each Appointing Authority or designee shall develop a procedure for his/her department to implement the provisions of this section.
Section 20.4.	Sick Leave Reciprocity.
(A)	Entitlement. During January of each year, each full-time employee has the option of receiving payment in cash for unused sick leave hours at the end of the preceding fiscal year, provided such employee was entitled to sick leave benefits during all of the twenty-six pay periods of the previous year and is in paid status or on authorized leave without pay, based on the following calculation table:
63
CASH BENEFIT CALCULATION TABLE
Hours of Sick Leave Taken (New Sick Accrual or Old Bank)	Cash Benefit Hours Allowed
0-8	48
9-16	40
17-24	32
25-32	24
33-40	16
Greater than 41	0
Any disallowance of sick leave credit by the Appointing Authority as provided for in Section 20.1, and any hours paid on disability leave will be considered as hours of sick leave taken during the year for the purpose of computing paid sick leave hours available to an employee under the reciprocity plan. If an employee uses five (5) days or less of injury leave (regardless of the number of claims) during the year, this leave shall not be considered sick leave taken for computing sick leave reciprocity. If an employee uses more than five (5) days of injury leave, all injury leave used during the year will be considered hours of sick leave taken in computing sick leave reciprocity.
(B)	Procedures. Each full-time employee who qualifies for sick leave benefits as of the first pay period of each year shall notify the Appointing Authority by February 1 of that fiscal year, on a form to be provided by the City, if the employee wishes to participate in the reciprocity plan. The payment will be made in January following the fiscal year. The payment will be calculated at the employee's hourly rate in effect as of the final pay period of the fiscal year preceding payment. The period to be utilized in calculating sick leave reciprocity benefits shall be the fiscal year for which payment is to be made. Any employee may withdraw from the plan prior to the end of the twenty-fourth (24th) pay period of each fiscal year upon the written notification to the Appointing Authority.
(C)	Effect on Unused Sick Leave. The number of reciprocity hours paid each employee will be subtracted from his/her total accrued unused sick leave. The remainder of his/her unused sick leave will be carried forward each year as his/her current sick leave account.
64
(D)	An employee who is eligible to participate in the provisions of this Section 20.4 is limited to and must elect only one of the following options:
(1)	Not to participate in any of the provisions.
(2)	To participate solely in the provisions of Paragraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this Section.

(B)	Sick leave may be withdrawn from the old sick leave bank, at the value provided in this Section 20.6 for the sick leave purposes outlined in Section 20.2(A), provided the employee has exhausted his/her current sick leave accrual to date. An employee may withdraw from the old sick leave bank the number of hours or tenths of an hour necessary to compensate the employee at not greater than his/her current regular straight time hourly rate for approved sick leave time.
(C)	An employee who experiences a break in continuous City service through retirement, discharge, resignation or layoff shall receive pay for unused sick leave or, in lieu thereof, may elect to transfer such sick leave to another governmental unit. Beginning with the effective date of this Contract and for the duration of the Contract, if the employee elects payment, his/her account balance shall be valued as of the time of the break in continuous service at one hundred
65
percent (100%) of the amount obtained by multiplying the number of unused sick leave hours by the employee's straight-time hourly rate in effect on March 31, 1987. At such time, the employee who is not transferring such sick leave to another governmental unit must elect one (1) of the following options: (a) immediate payment in a single lump-sum; or (b) two (2) equal installment payments, the first to be paid at the time of retirement or separation and the second to be paid one (1) year thereafter; or (c) three (3) equal installment payments, the first to be paid at the time of retirement or separation, the second to be paid one (1) year thereafter, and the third to be paid one (1) year after the second payment. However, the City must approve those employee elections which provide for payment in other than a single lump-sum.
(D)	For the purposes of this Section 20.6, all sick leave in an employee's old sick leave bank that represents sick leave transferred from another governmental unit shall be valued using the unit's sick leave separation payment plan existing on March 31, 1987 and the employee's regular straight-time hourly wage as of March 31,1987.
Section 20.7.	Payment of Sick Leave Balances at Time of Separation.
(A)	An employee who experiences a break in continuous City service through discharge, resignation, retirement or layoff may elect to receive pay for accumulated current sick leave or to tansfer said sick leave to another governmental unit, provided such election is made within a period of not more than one (1) year. If an employee elects to receive a lumpsum payment, said payment shall be computed as follows:
(1)	One (1) hour pay for each four (4) hours of unused sick leave in the new bank for all accruals up to and including nine hundred and fifty (950) hours.
(2)	One (1) hour of pay for each three (3) hours of unused sick leave in the new bank for all accruals from nine hundred and fifty-one (951) hours up to and including seventeen hundred and fifty (1,750) hours.
(3)	One (1) hour pay for each two (2) hours of unused sick leave in the new bank for all accruals from seventeen hundred and fifty-one (1,751) hours up to and including twenty five hundred and fifty (2,550) hours.
66
(4)	One (1) hour pay for each hour of unused sick leave in the new bank for all accruals in excess of twenty five hundred and fifty (2,550) hours.
(5)	Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph (1) above, no payment of any unused sick leave upon separation shall be made to any employee with less than four-hundred (400) hours accrued sick leave credit. However, an employee who is temporarily laid-off for thirty-five (35) calendar days or less and who has less than four hundred (400) hours of accrued sick leave at the time of layoff, shall be credited at the time of rehire with the actual number of sick leave hours accrued prior to the temporary layoff of thirty-five (35) calendar days or less.
(B)	The City reserves the right to deduct from any final sick leave payment to the employee any amounts which the employee owes to the City.
Section 20.8.	Payment of Sick Leave Balances at Death.
If an employee dies while in paid status, his/her unused sick leave account balance shall be paid to his/her surviving spouse. In the event that the employee has no surviving spouse, said balance shall be paid to the employee's estate. The employee's account balance shall be valued as of the time of death in the manner as set forth in this Article for new and old sick leave, as applicable, less any amounts owed by the employee to the City.
ARTICLE 21	- DISABILITY LEAVE
Section 21.1.	Eligibility and Waiting Period.

In the event Injury Leave and/or Workers’ Compensation benefits were denied and the employee chooses to apply for short-term disability benefits for the same disabling condition, the employee must submit the proper forms for short-term disability benefits within thirty (30) days of the occupational injury denial.
Section 21.3.	Disability Benefits.
Disability benefits shall be based on eighty one percent (81%) of the employee's standard gross wages. Applicable federal, state and local flat tax rates will be deducted. The employee may, if he/she so desires, elect to use all, or part of, his/her accumulated but unused sick leave in order to make up any difference between one hundred percent (100%) of his/her gross wages and the amount which he/she receives under the disability program, provided that all new sick leave accruals are exhausted before an employee may use the available balance in his/her old sick leave bank. If an employee exhausts all sick leave benefits, other approved leave may be granted by the Appointing Authority. If, while receiving disability payments, the employee performs work for the City, the amount of payment under the disability program shall be reduced by the compensation which he/she receives during that time period.

Signatures of the employee’s immediate supervisor, the Division Administrator, and the Appointing Authority are required thereafter. Claims are to be submitted to the Human Resources Department within a total of twenty-eight (28) days from the date the injury occurs (provided, however, that an employee's eligibility for injury leave shall not be prejudiced by a delay in filing caused by supervisors if the employee has complied with his/her fourteen (14)-day filing deadline).

Such a grievance shall be filed at Step 2 of the grievance procedure.
Section 22.7.	Use of Other Leaves Pending Decision on Injury Leave.

If an employee who has been granted injury leave does not begin receiving payments in lieu of wages from the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation by the time the injury leave has been exhausted (i.e., after sixty (60) workdays), and the employee has filed a timely claim under the Ohio Workers' Compensation laws for such payment, then the City shall pay the employee seventy-two percent (72%) or sixty-six and 2/3 percent (66-2/3%), whichever is applicable, of his/her wages until such time as payments from the Bureau are received or the claim is denied by a Staff Hearing Officer of the Industrial Commission of Ohio. In any instance of payment by both the City and the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation for the same day or days, the employee shall promptly provide full reimbursement to the City as determined by the City; to this end, the City will require the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation to send the first temporary total payment to the City as payment towards the employee’s extended injury leave liability (i.e., for payments after sixty (60) workdays).

(B)	Whenever employees are required, as a term of their employment, to appear in Court to testify as a witness, they shall not be required to furnish their home addresses or telephone numbers, unless directed to do so by the Court.
Section 23.5.	Disaster Leave.
Time off with pay shall be allowed to a fully qualified employee for service in specialized disaster relief service for the American Red Cross. Said leave shall be granted only after the requisition of the individual serving in such capacity by the American Red Cross. Eligibility of any employee for such service shall be established prior to the granting of leave and subject to the approval of the Appointing Authority for the individual involved.
76
ARTICLE 24	- LEAVE WITHOUT PAY
Section 24.1.	Away Without Leave.
An employee who is absent from work with the approval of the Appointing Authority or designee, whether in paid or unpaid status, is excused and shall not be subject to disciplinary action. An employee who is away without leave, or AWOL, may be subject to disciplinary action. AWOL includes, but is not limited to, the following situations:
(A)	The employee does not call off by following the proper procedure and does not report for work;
(B)	The employee does not have enough accrued leave time to cover his/her absence;
(C)	The employee leaves the workplace without notifying and/or securing the approval of his/her supervisor;
(D)	The employee leaves the workplace without adequate approval, e.g., he/she leaves a written request for leave but leaves without finding out if his/her supervisor approved the request;
(E)	The employee fails to show or call off for scheduled overtime;
(F)	The employee reports to work but is seven (7) or more minutes late; and/or
(G)	The employee fails to follow the proper call off procedure.
These instances of AWOL are not equivalent for purposes of discipline, and discipline will be commensurate with the offense.
Section 24.2.	Unpaid Personal Leave.
The Appointing Authority may at his/her sole discretion grant unpaid leave to employees for good cause. Such leave shall not normally exceed sixty (60) days, except that the Appointing Authority at his/her sole discretion may extend beyond the sixty (60) day period.
77
Section 24.3.	Unpaid Educational Leave.
Employees may be granted a leave of absence without pay by the Appointing Authority, for educational purposes. Such leave shall initially be limited to sixty (60) calendar days with possible extensions up to one (1) year provided such further educational pursuits are related to the operations of the City.
Section 24.4.	Unpaid Union Leave.
(A)	Long Term. At the request of the Union, a leave of absence without pay shall be granted to any classified employee who is a member of the Union and who is selected for the Union office or employed by a Union for a fixed term of office, subject to the approval of the Appointing Authority. Such leave shall initially be limited to sixty (60) calendar days with possible extensions up to one (1) year. Such service will not constitute a break in service for seniority rights or promotional examination administered by the Civil Service Commission.
(B)	Short Term. At the request of the Union, a leave of absence without pay shall be granted to any classified employee who is a member of the Union to attend a convention or other similar functions of short duration subject to the approval of the Appointing Authority. Such leave of absence will affect neither his/her sick leave and vacation leave accruals, premium pay computations, and/or anniversary date for increases or seniority; nor will it constitute a break in service for computing service credits for Civil Service examinations.
Section 24.5.	Leave of Absence to Accept Provisional Appointment
An employee with permanent status who accepts a provisional appointment shall be granted a leave of absence for a period of two (2) years from his/her permanent classification position. This section does not prohibit an employee from requesting a leave of absence in excess of two (2) years. Such leave may be granted by the Appointing Authority.
Section 24.6.	Military Leave of Absence.
An employee shall be granted a leave of absence to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States of America or any branch thereof. The City shall comply with all applicable Federal laws relating to the granting of military leave and reinstating employees upon the conclusion of said leave. Such leave of absence shall be governed by the following principles:
78
(A)	No employee shall lose his/her rank, grade or seniority enjoyed at the time of his/her enlistment (no re-enlistments permitted), induction or call into the active service of the Armed Forces of the United States of America or any branch thereof.
(B)	Any employee, upon his/her discharge from the Armed Forces, other than a dishonorable discharge, shall be returned to the position he/she held immediately prior to his/her enlistment or induction into the Armed Forces or to a position of equal rank and grade. This reinstatement is conditioned on the employee establishing the fact that his/her physical and mental condition has not been impaired to the extent of rendering him/her incompetent to perform the duties of the position he/she previously held. Such employee must request restoration to his/her position within ninety (90) calendar days of receiving a discharge, other than a dishonorable discharge, from the Armed Forces or his/her position will be declared vacant. Nothing contained in this Section 24.6 shall obligate the City to pay an employee who is on military leave of absence except under the conditions set forth in Section 23.1 of this contract.
(C)	An employee selected from an eligible list and having completed the probationary period who is serving in a position vacated temporarily due to the previous incumbent being in the Armed Forces, shall be determined to have been given a permanent appointment if the returning employee does not return to work within the prescribed time.
(D)	The term 'Armed Forces of the United States" as used in this Section 24.6 shall be deemed to include such services as designated by the Congress of the United States.
(E)	Any employee who is transferred or advanced to a position by reason of a vacancy caused by an employee serving in the Armed Forces shall be returned to the position he/she held before said transfer or advancement or to a position of equal rank or grade, upon the return of the employee from the Armed Forces.
(F)	An employee appointed from an eligible list for assignment to a temporary position with the City, becoming available by virtue of an employee enlisting or being inducted or called into the Armed Forces, shall be reinstated to the eligible list upon completion of the temporary employment.
79
(G)	In any case where two (2) or more employees who are entitled to be restored to a position left the same position in order to enter the Armed Forces, the employee with greatest seniority in that classification shall have the prior restoration right without prejudice to the reemployment rights of the other employee or employees to be restored.
(H)	Where service in the Armed Forces results from induction or call to active duty, leave shall be granted for the duration of such call.
(I)	Where service in the Armed Forces results from enlistment, leave shall be granted for not more than one (1) voluntary enlistment.
Section 24.7.	Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Leave.
(A)	Employees who have worked for the City for at least twelve (12) months, and have worked for at least 1,250 hours over the twelve (12) month period preceding the leave, shall be eligible for up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave per twelve (12) month period for the following:
(1)	For birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the newborn child;
(2)	For placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care. Adoption is limited to a child of eighteen (18) years of age or younger unless the child is incapable of self-care because of a physical or mental disability;
(3)	To care for the employee's spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition;
(4)	Because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's job.
(B)	For the purposes of Section 24.7(A):
(1)	FMLA leave shall be granted for an employee's "spouse" as defined by Ohio law (i.e., unmarried domestic partners are not included). If both spouses are working for the City, their total leave in any twelve (12) month period shall be limited to an aggregate of twelve (12) weeks if the leave is taken for either the birth or adoption of a child or to care for a sick parent.
80
(2)	"Child" means a child either under eighteen (18) years of age or eighteen (18) years or older who is incapable of self-care because of mental or physical disability. An employee's "child" is one for whom the employee has actual day-to-day responsibility for care and includes a biological, adopted, foster or stepchild or the child of one standing in loco parentis.
(3)	"Parent" means a biological parent or an individual who stands or stood in loco parentis to an employee when the employee was a child. This term does not include parents "in law."
(4)	An employee's right to leave for the birth or adoption of a child ends twelve (12) months after the child's birth or placement with the employee.
(5)	The City retains the option of choosing a uniform method to compute the twelve (12) month period, including a rolling twelve (12) month period measured backward from the date leave is used.
(6)	The City retains the right to require written documentation of the family relationship, when applicable.
(C)	For the purposes of Sections 24.7(A)(3) and (4), a "serious health condition" means an illness, injury, impairment or a physical or mental condition that involves:
(1)	Any period of incapacity or treatment in connection with or consequent to inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital, hospice or residential medical facility;
(2)	Any period of incapacity requiring absence from work, school or other regular daily activities of more than three (3) calendar days, and that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health care provider; or
(3)	Continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health care provider for a chronic or a long-term health condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not treated, would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three (3) calendar days; or
81
(4)	Prenatal care by a health care provider.
(D)	Employees may take FMLA leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only when medically necessary because of the employee's own serious health condition or the serious health condition of the employee's spouse, child or parent. If leave is requested on this basis, however, the City may require the employee to transfer temporarily to an alternative position which better accommodates recurring periods of absence or a part-time schedule, provided that the position has equivalent pay and benefits.
(E)	Upon return from FMLA leave, the employee shall be returned to the position held prior to the leave or an equivalent position.
(F)	The City shall maintain health insurance benefits for the duration of FMLA leave at the level and under the same conditions (including employee premium contributions) and coverage that would have been provided if the employee had continued in active work status for the duration of the leave.
(G)	During an unpaid FMLA leave, subject to Section 13.2 (regarding accumulation of seniority) an employee shall not continue to accrue seniority and shall not accrue any employment benefits for the period of the leave, except for continuation of insurance benefits as provided in Paragraph (F) immediately above.
(H)	All accrued sick leave benefits must be utilized for any FMLA leave taken for any reason which qualifies for sick leave under Article 20 of this Contract. All accrued vacation leave benefits must be substituted for all or part of any unpaid FMLA leave taken after sick leave benefits have first been exhausted or for any FMLA leave for which sick leave is not applicable.
(I)	The following notice and scheduling requirements shall apply to FMLA leave requests, unless the FMLA leave is being charged to sick or vacation leave, in which case the notice requirements for sick leave in Article 20 or for vacation leave in Article 19 of this Contract shall apply.
82
(1)	Employees must give thirty (30) days notice to the City before taking FMLA leave, if the need for leave is foreseeable. If the need for leave is not foreseeable, the employee must notify the City as soon as is practicable (normally no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the need for the leave becomes known).
(2)	If an employee has actual notice of the notice requirement stated in 24.7(l)(1) above (this requirement of actual notice is fulfilled by posting a notice at the worksite), and fails to provide the City with thirty (30) days notice for a foreseeable leave with no reasonable excuse for the delay, the City may deny the taking of leave until at least thirty (30) days after the employee provides notice.
(3)	Employees shall provide at least verbal notice sufficient to make the City aware that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. The City may inquire further of the employee when additional information is needed to determine whether FMLA leave is to be taken.
(4)	If an employee takes leave based on the serious health condition of the employee or to care for a family member, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment so as to not unduly disrupt the City's operation. If an employee does not initiate discussions with the City to attempt to arrange a mutually agreeable treatment schedule, the City may initiate such discussions and require the employee to attempt to make such arrangements, subject to the approval of the health care provider.
(J)	The following medical certification requirements shall apply to FMLA leave requests:
(1)	Employees who request leave because of their own serious health condition or the serious health condition of a covered family member shall be required to provide a certification issued by the health care provider of the employee or the employee's family member on a form acceptable to the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee in accordance with Department of Labor regulations. For the employee's own medical leave, the certification must include, among other things, the date the
83
condition commenced, probable duration of incapacity, a statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of the employee's position, and a statement of the regimen of treatment prescribed for the condition by the health care provider (including estimated number of visits, nature, frequency, and duration of treatment). For leave to care for a seriously ill child, spouse or parent, the certification must include, among other things, the date the condition commenced, probable duration of incapacity, a statement that the patient requires assistance for basic medical, hygiene, nutritional needs, safety or transportation, or that the employee's presence or assistance would be beneficial or desirable for the care of the family member, and an estimate of the amount of time the employee is needed to provide care.
(2)	The City shall give employees requesting FMLA leave written notice of the requirement for medical certification.
(3)	In its discretion, the City may require a second medical opinion and periodic re-certification at its own expense. If the first and second opinions differ, the City, at its own expense, may obtain the binding opinion of a third health care provider, approved jointly by the employee and the City.
(4)	Employees must provide the requested certification to the City within the time frame requested by the City, unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to do so despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts. The City must allow at least fifteen (15) calendar days after the City's request for certification.
(5)	In most cases, the City shall request that an employee furnish certification from a health care provider at the time the employee requests leave or soon after the leave is requested or in the case of unforeseen leave, soon after the leave commences. The City may request certification or re-certification at some later date if the City has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration, if circumstances have changed significantly or if any extension of the leave is requested. If the City believes the certification is incomplete, it shall notify
84
the employee and allow an opportunity to correct the deficiency. In the case of a complete certification which is unclear, the City's health care provider may, with the employee's permission, contact the employee's health care provider to clarify and authenticate the certification.
(6)	Certification shall be submitted using a form approved by the Director of the Department of Human Resources for use by employees consistent with the FMLA.
(7)	All employees who take FMLA leave because of their own serious health condition shall be required to provide medical certification of their fitness to report back to work. The City may seek fitness for duty certification only with regard to the particular health condition that caused the employee's need for FMLA leave.
(K)	The City may require an employee on FMLA leave to report periodically on the employee's status and intent to return to work. An FMLA leave will not be granted to permit an employee to accept gainful employment elsewhere, including self-employment. If an employee gives unequivocal notice of intent not to return, the City's obligations under FMLA to maintain health benefits (subject to COBRA requirements) and to restore the employee cease.
(L)	Leaves that are granted under any other provision of this Contract or under State law, whether paid or unpaid, including sick, disability and injury leave as provided in Articles 20, 21 and 22, respectively, for purposes which are covered under the Family Medical Leave Act, shall be charged as FMLA Leave and shall be subject to the twelve (12) week per year limitation for the length of an FMLA leave.
(M)	The City, in its discretion, may implement the FMLA consistent with the foregoing provisions of this Section 24.7 and in accordance with any Department of Labor regulations, which may be in effect from time to time.
85

(C)	Possessing, using, being under the influence of, selling, purchasing, manufacturing, dispensing or delivering any illegal drug at any time and at any place; or
(D)	Abusing, illegally distributing or selling any prescription drug; or

(F)	Using any adulterants or otherwise tampering with the specimen; or
(G)	Refusing to take a drug and/or alcohol test.
Section 25.2.	Testing to be Conducted.

When the City has reason to believe an employee is: 1) under the influence of alcohol, or consuming or possessing alcohol in violation of this Article; or 2) is possessing, using or under the influence of illegal drugs; or 3) is abusing prescription drugs, the City shall require the employee to submit to drug and alcohol testing. The parties will work together to improve the process of reasonable suspicion testing.
The City shall hold harmless any employee or supervisor, who, in good faith and with just cause, recommends that an employee be tested for drugs and/or alcohol.
(B)	Random Testing. All employees required to possess a Commercial Drivers License (CDL) shall be subject to random drug and alcohol testing pursuant to federal law and guidelines and the Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy in effect on April 1,2002.
86
Section 25.3.	Procedures.
(A)	Any employee who tests positive for drugs and/or alcohol shall be relieved of duty without pay (unless the employee elects to use his/her available vacation or compensatory time balances) and referred to the City’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Before returning to work after a positive test result, an employee must take a return-to-duty test and test negative. An employee shall be subject to follow-up testing for one (1) year.
(B)	Any employee who voluntarily requests drug and/or alcohol education and/or treatment shall not be disciplined in connection with that request, if the request is done prior to selection for random testing.

(D)	Any employee that has completed his/her initial probationary period who tests positive the first time will not be disciplined for the positive result, although he/she may be disciplined for other work rule or policy violations in connection with that positive result. A second positive drug or alcohol test shall result in discipline up to and including termination of employment.
(E)	Any employee who tests between .04 - .06 of alcohol shall be relieved of duty for the remainder of his/her scheduled work day, but may elect to use vacation leave or compensatory time to cover this absence.
(F)	The City shall maintain a policy and procedure for drug and alcohol testing consistent with the terms and provisions of this Contract.
(G)	The City will continue to conduct training on the reasonable suspicion and the random drug and alcohol testing process. This training will be provided to all affected employees, supervisors and Union representatives.
(H)	The City and the Union will make reasonable efforts to encourage self-referral to the EAP for education and treatment programs, upon request.

-88-
(D)	The City shall, in reporting and making remittances to the Public Employee Retirement System of Ohio, report that each employee's contribution has been made as provided by statute.
(E)	The City hereby declares that the sum paid hereunder by the City on behalf of an employee, (i.e., eight and one half percent (8.5%) for full-time employees and six percent (6%) for part-time employees) of the employee's earned compensation, is not to be considered additional salary or wages and shall not be treated as increased compensation. For purposes of computing the employee's earnings or basis of his/her contribution to the Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio, the amount paid by the City on behalf of an employee as a portion of his statutory obligation is intended to be and shall be considered as having been paid by the employee in fulfillment of his/her statutory obligation.

The hourly rate of pay of each employee of the City shall be at the sole pay rate for employees whose classes are assigned to Pay Range 29 or below. Employees whose classes are assigned to Pay Range 30 or above shall be paid as provided herein, or at an hourly rate authorized for that pay range as provided in Subsection (B), (C), and (D) below. Changes in pay made to any rate in Pay Range 30 and above shall be effective at the beginning of the next pay period following written notice by the Appointing Authority to the Civil Service Commission. Except as set forth in this Article, the City will not unilaterally change an employee’s Pay Range.
-89-
(B)	New Hiring Rate. The hiring rate for a class shall be at the lowest pay rate in the range except as otherwise provided herein. Where a multiple pay range is established for a classification, the Appointing Authority will designate the range at which the employee shall be paid in Step 0.
(C)	Demotion. Whenever an employee is reduced from his/her class to a class which is assigned more than one pay range or more than one pay rate, the Appointing Authority shall have the sole discretion as to which range or rate the employee is entitled to be paid within the new class.
(D)	Local 1632 Merit Increases. The City shall continue a merit pay review system for bargaining unit employees assigned to classifications with variable pay ranges and/or pay ranges 30 and above. Each employee shall be evaluated once every two (2) years based on the employee's classification seniority date. If an employee meets or exceeds the requirements of the merit pay review system, the Appointing Authority or designee may approve a merit pay increase for him/her. If an employee has reached the highest step of the highest pay range(s) assigned to his/her classification, and otherwise qualifies for a merit increase, the Appointing Authority or designee may give that employee a merit bonus of one hundred dollars ($100), less taxes and appropriate deductions. If an employee is denied a merit pay increase, the employee shall be provided the reason(s) for such denial in writing. A merit increase will not be denied solely on the basis of a lack of funding. For employees whose classification seniority anniversary date occurs on or after April 1, 2003, employees who have reached the highest step in a single pay range, and otherwise qualifies for a merit increase, may receive a merit bonus of one hundred ($100) less taxes and appropriate deductions.

(2)	Any employee who seeks or obtains additional City employment beyond his/her present appointment, shall first obtain, in writing, the approval of the Appointing Authority of his/her present position. Such written approval must be filed with the employee's personnel file. Failure to obtain written permission shall subject the employee to possible disciplinary action. In such cases where total City employment exceeds forty (40) hours in a workweek, the overtime provisions of Article 16 of this Contract shall apply.
(3)	Upon approval of additional employment with the City, the Appointing Authority for his/her present position shall, at that time, determine in writing whether the employee shall be entitled and shall receive additional vacation and sick leave benefits pursuant to the provisions of this Contract. In no event shall the employee receive injury leave or insurance coverage beyond that provided for an employee occupying only one position.
(F)	Additional Compensation or Benefits. Except as provided in Section 26.7 of this Contract, no employee shall receive, and the City Treasurer shall not draw any checks or any additional compensation in any form, sick and injury leave, vacation, insurance coverage and any and all other benefits and privileges, for any employee who substitutes or acts for another in the position of another, other than the position to which he/she was appointed pursuant to the Ohio Constitution, City Charter provisions, and the rules and regulations of the Civil Service Commission. No Appointing Authority shall appoint any person or submit any personnel action form contrary to said constitution, charter, rules and regulations, and the provisions of this Contract.
(G)	Payroll Deductions. Payroll deductions shall be governed first by the ability of the City Auditor's payroll system to handle them, and secondly, upon a determination by the City of the type of payroll deductions which are to be offered to employees and also based upon which ones will benefit the largest number of employees. Deductions or withholdings, except where demanded or required by law, must be agreed to in writing by the employee with the specific reason stated in writing and filed with the Appointing Authority.

All written notices not to report shall be countersigned by the employee affected.

This Section 26.4 shall not apply in hazardous weather conditions as set forth in Section 30.12.
Section 26.5.	Call-Back Pay.
A call-back is defined as an unscheduled work assignment which does not immediately precede or follow an employee's scheduled work hours (this provision, for example, does not apply to a pre-scheduled early call-in or in cases of overtime authorized as an extension of a regular shift). In any situation where notification of the overtime is given prior to the end of a scheduled shift, call-back pay shall not apply. When any full-time employee is required by the Appointing Authority or his/her designee to report to work after he/she has been relieved of duty upon the completion of the employee's regular schedule and he/she does so report, he/she shall be paid for a minimum of four (4) hours at time and one-half his regular hourly rate, except that if the call-back occurs on the second regular day off and the employee is eligible for double time, he/she shall be paid at the double time rate for a minimum of four (4) hours. If the callback occurs within two (2) hours of the start of the employee's regular shift, he/she shall be paid a minimum of two (2) hours at time and one-half his/her regular hourly rate.

(B)	A differential in pay of thirty-seven cents (370) per hour over the regular hourly rate shall be paid to employees who are assigned to work eight (8) hours on the second shift; a differential of forty-five cents (450) per hour over the regular hourly rate shall be paid to employees who are assigned to work eight (8) hours on the third shift.

Section 26.8.	Service Credit
A service credit payment shall be paid during December of each year to those full-time employees of the City, who are in active service, paid status or authorized leave without pay as of November 30 of each calendar year. The computation of the total years of continuous service as set forth in the following schedule shall be based upon paid status as a full-time employee as of November 30 of the appropriate calendar year.

Section 30.5.	Mandatory Comprehensive Physicals and Respiratory Protection.
(A)	Examinations/ldentification Potential Hazardous Working Conditions. The City has the responsibility to provide a safe working environment for all employees. In recognition of this responsibility and in order to provide a means to carry out the same, the City shall continue a program to conduct mandatory comprehensive physical examinations for the purpose of collecting and establishing baseline statistical data to determine and identify potential hazardous working conditions and locations. Further, these physical examinations will be for the purpose of enabling the City to comply with legal obligations imposed upon it as an employer under applicable federal, state and local laws together with administrative rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, such as, but not limited to, the Public Employment Risk Reduction Program (O.R.C. Chapter 4167).
Other than for the purposes specified herein, the data collected during the physical examination shall remain confidential, unless the employee waives such confidentiality in writing.
-118-
Refusal to submit to the physical examination may be grounds for discipline, up to and including termination.
The physical examination shall not in any way be used for alcohol, drug, or substance abuse testing, nor shall the results of the examination be used to relieve an employee of duty involuntarily without due process.
(B)	Respiratory Protection. It is agreed that the City will take the appropriate steps necessary to comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws, including but not limited to Ohio’s Public Employment Risk Reduction Program (O.R.C. Chapter 4167), dealing with respiratory protection. To that end, the City will provide respirators that are applicable and suitable for the purposes intended consistent with applicable provisions of law. Employees shall use the respiratory protection provided in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, training provided, and all applicable provisions of law. Further, employees will be fit-tested for respirators in order to ensure that a proper facial seal exists as prescribed and mandated by current law. The City will require employees to correct conditions which prevent, impair, or impede a proper facial seal, including but not limited to, a growth of beard, sideburns, any object worn that projects under the facepiece, or temple pieces on glasses. The refusal or failure of any employee, after being advised by management, to take corrective action to remedy those conditions which prevent, impair or impede the proper fit of a respirator may subject such employee to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
Employees who are assigned a respirator shall be required to undergo a physical examination to determine their fitness to wear the respirator. No employee will be assigned a task requiring the use of a respirator unless found physically able to perform the work while wearing the respirator.
Certain provisions of applicable occupational health and safety laws require site and/or job specific policies, procedures and protocols. It is further agreed that the City will promulgate and employees will comply with such site and/or job specific policies, procedures and protocols. Failure of an employee to comply such policies, procedures and protocols may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
Section 30.6.	Contract Copies.

(B)	Prior to the effective date of implementation, upon written request by the Union, a joint conference shall be scheduled for the purpose of discussion with respect to the following subjects: transfer to comparable work, retraining for transferred employees or the disposition of displaced employees resulting from the institution of such new methods, machinery or equipment.
Section 30.8.	Errors and Omissions Policy.
It is the policy of the City to cover employees for errors and omissions by such employees while performing duties within the scope of their employment by the City.
Section 30.9.	Application of Contract to Part-Time Employees.
Except as otherwise specifically provided elsewhere in this Contract, parttime employees in the bargaining unit shall not be eligible for any fringe benefits under this Contract (other than specifically noted), including but not limited to sick leave, other leaves of absence, holidays, vacations, service credit, and tuition reimbursement.
Section 30.10.	Employee Address.
Employees shall provide their payroll clerk or other individual designated by the Appointing Authority with their correct current name, home address, and home telephone number (if any), and shall update this information with their payroll clerk to keep it current at all times.
Section 30.11.	Employee Assistance Program.
The City and the Union recognize the significance of employees' personal problems and the effect those problems may have on personal well being and productivity. The City and the Union agree to utilize the City's Employee Assistance Program to refer employees with potential problems to the appropriate assistance program. Employees referred to the EAP will be granted up to a maximum of three (3) free visits per calendar year to the EAP for assessment, referral and follow-up without being charged with time off.
-120-
(A)	Professional assistance should be encouraged and sought by employees with problems related to stress, substance abuse, mental or emotional illness, finances, legal issues or family crisis; however, employee participation shall be strictly voluntary.
(B)	Employees participating in this program should be made aware that treatment records may be maintained and such records shall remain confidential.
(C)	All employees receiving treatment shall remain in paid status, until the employee's accrued vacation and sick leave credits are exhausted. After the exhaustion of these benefits, the City may, at its option, advance sick leave through a pay back arrangement. Should termination occur, sick days borrowed shall be repaid from wages and benefits due at the time of termination.
(D)	The City's designated disciplinary hearing officer may order an employee to EAP as part of a disciplinary order.
Section 30.12.	Hazardous Weather Conditions.
In cases of severe wind, rain or electrical storms, severe temperatures/wind chill factors or severe snowstorms and ice blanketing, no employee shall be unnecessarily compelled to work under conditions, which involve a physical risk to his/her health and personal safety. In the event the Union believes employees are being compelled to work under such conditions, the Local Union President or designee has the right to discuss the matter with the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee. However, such discussion shall not affect the City's rights under this Section 30.12. If, after such discussion, the City maintains that employees should work under such conditions, the City shall provide such employees with the protective, foul weather gear and clothing as provided in Section 29.2(F).
Section 30.13.	Effect of Article and Section Headings.
The article and section headings contained in this Contract are included only for convenience of reference and do not define, limit, explain or modify this Contract or its interpretation, construction or implementation.

ARTICLE 31	- RELATION TO OTHER LAWS AND SEPARABILITY
Section 31.1.	Savings Clause.
If any article, section or appendix of this Contract should be held illegal by operation of law or by any tribunal of competent jurisdiction; or if compliance with or enforcement of any article or section should be restrained by such tribunal pending a final determination as to its legality, the remainder of this Contract or the application of such article, section or appendix to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it has been held illegal or as to which compliance with, or enforcement of, has been restrained, shall not be affected. It is understood by the parties that nothing in this Contract shall be deemed to conflict with Federal laws, and the Constitutions of the State of Ohio and the United States of America.
Section 31.2.	Negotiations.
(A)	In the event any article, section or appendix is declared illegal, this Contract shall be reopened on such article, section or appendix. The City’s Chief Negotiator and the Union shall meet within thirty (30) calendar days for the purpose of negotiating a lawful alternate provision. However, such negotiations shall not affect the enforcement or validity of any other provision of the Contract.
(B)	No ordinance or resolutions dealing with negotiated wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment shall be submitted to City Council or to the Board of Health until negotiated and approved by the City and the Union with the exception of those classifications in a federally funded program wherein the imposition of federal constraints negate the bargaining process.
Section 31.3.	Effect of Subseguently-Enacted Legislation.
It is agreed that, in the event the Ohio General Assembly or the United States Congress passes legislation which becomes law and which affects the City of Columbus and this Contract, the Contract can be reopened only for purposes of amending said Contract to conform to such law or laws. Either party hereto shall have the right to call for a reopening of the Contract under such circumstances by giving notice to the other party in writing; said notice may be given at any time after such legislation is signed into law and prior to the effective date of such law or laws.

-122-
ARTICLE 32	- ENTIRE AGREEMENT/MID-TERM MODIFICATIONS
Section 32.1.	Entire Agreement/Precedence of Agreement.
This Contract, upon ratification, supersedes all prior practices and agreements, whether written or oral, unless expressly stated to the contrary herein, and constitutes the complete and entire agreement between the parties, and concludes collective bargaining for its term. Therefore, except as provided in Articles 31 and 32, the parties, for the duration of this Contract, each voluntarily waives the right and obligation to bargain collectively with respect to any subject covered by tiis Contract. This Contract is not intended, however, to render null and void prior arbitration, judicial and applicable administrative agency decisions involving the parties to the extent that such decisions involve contract language which remains unchanged and to the extent that the governing law involved in such judicial and administrative agency decisions remains unchanged.
Section 32.2.	Changes in Conditions of Employment Which Are Not Specifically Established by Contract.
Any term and/or conditions of employment not specifically established by this Contract shall remain within the discretion of the City to modify, establish or eliminate; provided, however, that no such determination shall be implemented prior to consultation with the Union, as provided below in Subsections (A) and (B):
(A)	Changes in Mandatory Subjects Not Specifically Established by Contract. The parties agree the City may implement changes in terms and conditions of employment during the term of the Contract where the subject matter of the change is a mandatory subject of bargaining under Ohio Revised Code (ORC), Chapter 4117, and where the Contract does not expressly address the subject matter of the change after giving the Union notice of the proposed change and a reasonable opportunity to bargain about it. In the event the parties do not reach an agreement about the proposed change, the parties agree that the Union may choose to grieve the matter to arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provisions of Section 11.5(D). The City will not implement its proposed change until the arbitrator issues an award, unless the Union chooses not to grieve in which case the City may implement its final proposal.
-123-
(B)	Changes in Permissive Subjects Not Specifically Established by Contract. It is further agreed that this bargaining obligation referenced in Subsection (A) above does not apply to any change which does not constitute a mandatory subject of bargaining under ORC Chapter 4117. The City retains complete discretion to modify, establish or eliminate any term or condition of employment which is not expressly addressed in the parties' Contract. If the City intends to modify, establish or eliminate any term or condition of employment which is not expressly addressed in the parties' Contract, and which is not a mandatory subject of bargaining under ORC Chapter 4117, the City may do so after consultation with the Union. The City also shall comply with the posting and notification requirements set forth in Article 8 of the Contract, when applicable. If the Union disagrees with the change in terms and conditions of employment after the City implements it, the Union may choose to grieve the reasonableness of the implemented term or condition of employment under the grievance procedure of the Contract.
Section 32.3.	Changes in Conditions of Employment Which Are Specifically Established by Contract.
The parties may, by mutual agreement, reopen negotiations to expand, clarify, modify or amend provisions of this Contract. In order to amend the Contract, the party proposing the amendment shall identify to the other party the specific section(s) of the Contract to be reopened. Except as stated in other sections of this Contract, neither party shall be obligated to agree to reopen the Contract.
In addition to reopening this Contract for the purpose of amendment, the parties may enter into written memoranda of understanding that define, clarify, interpret or construe the meaning of specific contract sections. Such memoranda of understanding shall not be valid until signed by the City’s Chief Negotiator or designee and appropriate Union officials. Such memoranda of understanding cease to exist at the date stated therein or the expiration of the current contract (whichever is less) unless the parties specifically incorporate them by reference into the successor contract. Any action taken by the Civil Service Commission which would change Appendix A of this Contract shall be accomplished by a memorandum of understanding.
Neither party hereto shall attempt to achieve the alteration of this Contract by recommending changes in, additions to or deletions from ordinances or resolutions of the Columbus City Council.
-124-
ARTICLE 33-TIME DONATION PROGRAM
Section 33.1.	Purpose.
Effective ninety (90) days after the effective date of this Contract, a time donation program will be established to assist full-time employees, eligible to earn accruals, who have exhausted all accumulated paid leave and all disability leave benefits available as a result of a catastrophic illness or injury that is not job related. This program neither supersedes nor replaces other disability programs covered by this Contract.
Section 33.2.	Conditions.
An employee may utilize the time donation program only if all of the following conditions are met:
(A)	Prior to requesting approval for donation of vacation leave, the employee must have exhausted all paid leave and disability leave benefits available to him/her; and
(B)	The employee shall submit an application requesting donation of vacation leave from other bargaining unit employees in the same division to the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee. The application shall include acceptable medical documentation of a catastrophic illness or injury that is not job related, including diagnosis and prognosis. The injury or long-term illness must require the employee to be away from work for at least two (2) full pay periods. This application shall be on a form mutually agreed to by the City and the Union; and
(C)	The Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee shall determine that the injury or long-term illness is catastrophic in nature and that the employee is eligible to receive vacation leave donations from other bargaining unit employees in the same division; and
(D)	The approved application shall be forwarded to Local 1632. The Local shall post a notice on the Union bulletin boards to other bargaining unit employees in the same division that the eligible employee may receive donations of vacation leave; and
-125-
(E)	If the eligible employee is in a probationary period, the probation will be extended by the number of days the employee is off duty receiving leave donations. The Civil Service Commission must be notified of an extension of any probationary period; and
(F)	Donated leave shall be considered sick leave but shall never be converted into a cash benefit.
Section 33.3.	Employees Donating Vacation Time.
(A)	An employee desiring to donate vacation leave shall submit a completed time donation form to the Division payroll office.
(B)	It is understood that all vacation leave donations are voluntary and once vacation leave is donated, it will not be returned to the donating employee.
(C)	All donated vacation leave shall be paid at the regular hourly rate of the employee receiving and using the donated leave, not at the regular hourly rate of the employee donating the leave.
(D)	Vacation leave may be donated in increments of at least four (4) hours.
This is a completely voluntary program. A decision made by the City regarding implementation, acceptance or rejection of an application for donations shall be final and the same shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.
-126-
ARTICLE 34 - DURATION OF CONTRACT
This Contract signed on, shall be effective as of April 1,2002, and shall remain in full force and effect through March 31,2005 unless either party gives written notice to the other of its intent to terminate or modify at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to its expiration date.

Unless specifically amended by this Memorandum of Understanding (hereinafter referred to as MOU), all wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment shall be administered in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Contract (hereinafter referred to as Contract).
For several years Information Services has scheduled its shift workers on an eight (8) week rotation changing their days off. This schedule allows more frequent days off of Saturday and Sunday as opposed to the three (3) month rotation outlined in the Contract. The number of positions allocated to a shift will determine the frequency of Saturday and Sunday days off.
The shift rotations are started at midnight Saturday night. The shift rotations may result in an employee having less than forty (40) straight time rate hours in paid status between the regular days off under the old schedule and the regular days off under the new schedule. This MOU is being executed to clarify the treatment of overtime worked on the first or second regular day off of the new schedule for the first seven calendar days of the new schedule as follows:
1.	With respect to Section 16.3(E) of the collective bargaining contract, for purposes of this MOU, the reference to the three (3) month schedule change will apply to this eight (8) week schedule change.
2.	If an employee works his/her first regular day off during the first week of the new schedule and in the previous five calendar days does not have any AWOL, sick, injury or disability time off, the employee will be paid at time and one-half (1.5) for any time worked on the first regular day off of the new schedule. If an employee works his second regular day off during the first week of the new schedule and in the previous six calendar days does not have any AWOL, sick, injury or disability-time off, the employee will be paid at double time (2.0) for any time worked on the second regular day off. Any AWOL, sick, injury or disability time taken will be replaced hour for hour with straight time before receiving any premium pay.

Regarding Communication Technicians/Small Craft Activities
It is essential that Communication Technicians be immediately available to answer telephone calls from the public as well as other police personnel. To that end, Communication Technicians are assigned to consoles to answer such incoming calls. Although Communication Technicians are available, there are times when incoming telephone calls are not constant. It is not practical to permit Communication Technicians to leave their respective consoles when they are awaiting incoming telephone calls.
In order to promote the alertness of Communication Technicians awaiting incoming telephone calls, it is agreed that they be permitted to work on small craft activities at non-emergency telephone consoles in the Police Communications Center. Small craft activities include such things as knitting, cross-stitching and needlework. It is essential that the individual be able to immediately stop the craft activity in order to answer incoming calls. Small craft activities shall not be permitted at consoles receiving incoming 9-1-1 calls.
No activity shall involve the use of any liquids, scraps, or other fragments which may deter the Communications Bureau’s equipment or operations.
Permission to engage in small craft activities shall be subject to guidelines formulated by management. The privilege to engage in such activities may be temporarily or permanently revised, rescinded or otherwise modified by management at any time. Any Division of Police supervisor may order an individual to cease small craft activity at any time.
