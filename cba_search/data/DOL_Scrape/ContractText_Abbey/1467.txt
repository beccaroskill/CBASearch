WHEREAS, The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers and/or subordinate subdivisions thereof embrace within their membership large numbers of qualified journeymen who have constituted in the past, and continue so to do, a majority of the employees employed by the Employer herein;
WHEREAS, The Contractor and the Brotherhood recognize that this Agreement must take into consideration the transitory nature of the work done by the Contractor; and
WHEREAS, The nature of many of the products of the Contractor is such that a sufficient proportion of skilled and trained workers is required to construct them safely, economically and well; and
