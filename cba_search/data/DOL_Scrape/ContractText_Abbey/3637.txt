When a vacancy or anticipated vacancy develops, the District shall post the vacancy or anticipated vacancy for a minimum of five (5) working days listing the position to be filled, job description, qualifications and rate of pay. When additional vacancies of the same classification occur within three (3) months of the original posting, the District shall have the right to utilize applications received on the most recent posting as an applicant pool, provided that any employee who has previously submitted ah interest card for the classification or locations known to be involved but has not elected to apply shall be provided an additional five (5) day period to submit an application.

The posting shall be at all locations where members of the bargaining unit work.
Any employee who wishes to apply for a position vacancy shall submit a completed application for classified employees to the Personnel Services Office within the period specified in the posting.
Employees who are on authorized leave of absence during the posting period must apply for the vacancy no later than five (5) working days after the posting period ends. Employees who are not employed during the summer months or who are off-track at a CSP school or who are on authorized leave and who wish to be notified of vacancies which occur during that time must submit written notice to the Personnel Services Office prior to their absence or leave; such notice must include the employee's mailing address.

addressed to the employee at the address said employee submitted to the Personnel Services Office.
On a pilot program basis, the parties jointly agree to implement paragraphs 1, 2 & 3 below until June 30, 2000. This agreement does not constitute a change in the District’s Rights under this current agreement. However, the USWA Local 8599 shall have the right prior to June 30, 2000, to notify the District to discontinue the pilot program (as expressed in the new language) as of June 30, 2000, if the USWA feels the changes are not working effectively.
When filling any vacant bargaining unit position, the District shall use the following factors when choosing the most qualified applicant:
1.	Skill and ability to perform the Work as demonstrated by prior successful experience and competence.
2.	Physical fitness.
3.	Length of continuous service.
The District shall, in evaluating criterion 1 (above) include a review of the employee’s current job performance and history of disciplinary activity within the past year provided that the employee shall have had prior notification of the areas of performance concern.
When, in the judgment of the District, a junior employee or an outside applicant exceeds a senior employee in connection with factors 1 and 2 listed above, then the District may select the junior employee or outside applicant for the vacant position. When factors 1 and 2 above are relatively equal, length of continuous service shall be controlling.
A promotion includes, but is not limited to, an upward movement in range and/or an upward change in job classification.

A transfer is defined as a lateral movement from one job classification as listed on the classified salary schedule to the same job classification in the same or any other office, site, or department. Employees who request transfer under this definition must submit the same completed application for classified employment as is required for promotions,, and will be subject to the same selection process as applicants for promotion.
When filling any vacant bargaining unit position, the District may, after adhering to the procedures in this Article, select any bargaining unit member or any other applicant who is not currently a member of the bargaining unit for the appointment to the vacant position.
In cases of reduction in force, the following factors shall apply:
1.	Length of continuous service.
2.	Skill and ability to perform the work as demonstrated by prior experience and competence.
3.	Physical fitness.
When factors 2 and 3 above are relatively equal, length of continuous service shall be controlling.
For purposes of this clause, the phrase "length of continuous service" shall mean continuing service as a classified employee of the Fontana Unified School District from the date the employee first renders paid service to the District in probationary status, provided, however, that ah employee does not accumulate seniority during probation; following completion of probation, and employee's seniority will revert to the date he/she first rendered paid service in probationary status.
Length of continuous service shall be broken only by:
1.	Termination for Just Cause.
2.	Quit.

3.	Retirement.
4.	Lay-off for a period of two (2) years.
5.	Failure to return after authorized leave of absence.
Acceptance of the definition of "length of continuous service" by the Union constitutes on its behalf of the employees in the bargaining unit a clear, specific and unequivocal waiver of its rights and the rights of employees it represents, under Section 13746 of the Education Code and its successors, if any, including, but not limited to, Section 45308 of the Education Gode.
Effective April 4, 1994, it is agreed and understood by and between the District and the Union that the following procedure will be followed when two (2) or more employees render probationary service on the same day:
1.	In the event that two or more employees render probationary service in a classification on the same day, the order of employment shall be determined by lot drawn by the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services, or designee.
2.	The drawing by lot will be done in the Personnel Services Office, and present at such drawing will be the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services/Designee, the Union President/Designee, and a third person, to be appointed by the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services.
3.	In the event that an employee has previously been a substitute employee in the District in the classification being filled, such substitute service will be considered in the allocation of hire date for seniority purposes.
For example, if three (3) individuals.are hired on the same date and one of them has been a substitute employee for nine (9) months, and another one has been a substitute employee for six (6) months, and the third individual has had no substitute experience, the individual with the nine (9) months of substitute service will be counted as

having seniority over the other two individuals. In no event is it to be construed that the

original date of substitute service will be the original date of hire. The date of hire will be the date which the employee is approved for permanent employment in this District. Accordingly, it is the intent of the District to acknowledge length of service as a substitute employee only as it pertains to assigning a'date of hire.
4.	When the order of employment has been established, such a notice shall be entered on the employee's record.
5.	This procedure is to be utilized only for the purpose of assigning a date of hire when there are multiple applicants. All other rules and procedures will continue in effect pursuant to present Board Policy and laws.
Grounds Department Equipment Operator Vacancies
1.	In the event that a vacancy occurs within the Grounds Department in one of the Range 15 positions, the vacancy-will be filled immediately on an interim basis by the Supervisor of the Grounds Department. Seniority will be taken into consideration, amongst other factors of skill and ability and physical fitness, but it shall not be the controlling factor in the selection process. Employees assigned to these positions shall be compensated at Range 15 to commence with the first day of service.
2.	The District agrees to staff the Grounds Department with the number of positions that are required to operate daily the existing equipment and to perform the more independent responsible grounds and gardening work that can reasonably be considered appropriate under the current job description. The distinction in the equipment that is appropriate for Groundskeepers (Range 12) and Equipment Operator (Range 15) is the concept of “hand equipment” (e.g., hoes, rakes, brooms, and other hand-held tools such as trimmers, etc.) as opposed to- larger than hand-held equipment (e.g., large power movers, power edgers, power trimmers, trucks, skip loader, back hoe, and tractors).

STEP 2:
The standard approach identified in clause 4 for determining the schedule and amount of repayment per pay period will be implemented except where the employee requests a case-by-case analysis due to hardship.
STEP 3:
Where the implementation of the standard payback: approach would create a severe hardship due to such factors as fluctuation in payroll impact on fringe benefits change in the standard work year, reduction in classification or hours, or a major episodic financial hardship, the Payroll Department will work with the employee to develop a reasonable repayment plan which will recover the overpayment as soon as possible. If scheduled Payroll Department deadlines prevent the consideration Of such hardship before the payroll warrant is processed, the District will make every effort to utilize alternative payment procedures to correct any arrears or ameliorate approved hardships.
CRITERION: STANDARD PAYBACK APPROACH
a.	If the amount to be recovered is less than five percent (5%) of net income for the pay period, it may be recovered in one lump sum.
b.	If the overpayment occurred in less than one year and the amount is more than five percent (5%) of a pay period, it will be recovered by deductions in the number of pay periods equal to the number of pay periods in which the overpayment occurred.
c.	If the overpayment occurred over a period of more than one year, the recovery will normally be accomplished by equal payments, scheduled to be completed either by the end of the fiscal year or the end of the tax year, whichever is later, unless the amount of the payments deducted would exceed fifteen percent (15%) of net income.
d.	If approaches “a” through “c” do not fit the circumstances of amount of the overpayment, a meeting will be arranged to develop a reasonable recovery plan.

EXCEPTIONS:
1)	Notwithstanding the standard payback approaches identified above, the overpayment can be recovered from “ back pay” or other payment in arrears (not including current overtime pay). The overpayment will be recovered in one lump sum to avoid creating of a new overpayment. This provision will apply except on a case-by-case basis where an approved hardship exists as noted in Step 3 above.
2)	All of the above provisions will be suspended whenever the district terminates an employee or receives a letter of resignation or *an approved leave of absence request for six months or more. In such cases recovery of overpayment will be scheduled for completion by the effective date of the leave of absence, resignation, or termination, if at all possible.
‘(Specific exceptions to the above are leaves under the provisions of California Family Rights Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Industrial Accident (USWA Article 28, FTA Article 12.12), Military (USWA Article 26, FTA Article 12.11).

PROBATIONARY PERIOD
Bargaining unit members shall be on probation during the first ninety (90) working days of employment with thirty (30) additional workdays' probation at District option.
During this period, they may be discharged without assigning any cause therefore; and said discharge is specifically excluded from the Grievance Procedure. No seniority is acquired during the probationary period.
Upon receiving permanency in a position, seniority shall revert to the date of hire.
For purposes of this Article, workdays shall be defined as those on paid status.

The probationary period, at the District option, may be extended thirty (30) workdays. This equates to six (6) months. All bargaining unit members with an extended probationary period of thirty (30) work days shall remain on Step 1 and, if awarded permanency, move to Step 2 after six (6) months.
Bargaining unit members hired prior to the 6th day of the month shall advance to Step 2 on the first (1st) day of the month in which permanency is earned.
Bargaining unit members hired on the sixth (6,h)through the twentieth (20th) day of the month shall advance to Step 2 on the sixteenth (16th) day of the month in which permanency is earned.

SUSPENSION/DISCHARGE CASES
The District recognizes that an effort shall be made to remediate any unsatisfactory job performance displayed by classified employees prior to taking any disciplinary action by management personnel. Making classified employees aware of employment standards, as well as the consequences for non-compliance with the tankards, shall precede corrective or disciplinary steps which shall include, but not be limited to, in-service and/or hands-on training. In cases where a unit member’s job performance is at issue due to chemical use or dependency, the District shall provide an opportunity for the unit member to participate in a chemical dependency intervention program. This recognition of progressive discipline, however, shall not preclude the District from seeking immediate dismissal of classified employees for serious acts of misconduct which might include, but not be limited to, theft, assault and/or battery or other serious types of misconduct.
In the event that a classified employee is alleged to have acted in such a manner as to warrant a suspension, demotion and/or discharge, he/she shall be furnished with a copy of the reason(s) for the action. The Union shall be notified in writing within five (5) working days whenever a bargaining unit member is charged with serious misconduct that might result in suspension, demotion or a recommendation to the Board for dismissal.
The procedures for classified suspension, demotion or dismissal are set forth in Board Policy dated September 23, 1994, and are to be complied with regarding all classified discipline matters.

Credit for sick leave need not be accrued prior to taking such leave by the employee and such leave of absence may be taken at any time during the year. However, a new employee of the District shall not be eligible to take more than six (6) days or the proportionate amount to which he/she may be entitled, until the 1st day of the calendar month after completion of six (6) months of active service with the District.
If the employee does not take the full amount of leave allowed in any year, the amount not taken shall be accumulated from year to year.
A regular classified employee shall once a year be credited with a total of one hundred (100) working days of paid sick leave in addition to sick leave to which he/she is entitled under paragraphs 2 and 3 above. Such days of sick leave, in addition to those required by paragraphs 2 and 3 above, shall be compensated at fifty percent (50%) of the employee's regular salary and shall be available after all other paid leave entitlement has been exhausted, but shall not be cumulative from year to year. Benefits accrued while on paid sick leave shall be the same as the benefits which would have been accrued had the employee worked. Each day of absence claimed under this paragraph must be supported by a physician's statement that will verify the inability of the employee to work.
It is agreed and understood by and between the Fontana Unified School District (“ District”) and the United Steelworkers of America, Local 8599 (“ Union”), as follows:
1.	In accordance with Article 19 of the Master Agreement between the FUSD and the USWA, which requires that “all other paid leave entitlements” be exhausted prior to utilization of the 100 day half-pay provisions, it shall be agreed that all accumulated Sick Leave will be utilized prior to commencing the 1100 day pay provisions, but earned vacation time may still be held in abeyance for future use by the employee.
2.	In accordance with Article 28 of the Master Agreement between the FUSD and the USWA, the District shall provide the employee, prior to the conclusion of the sixty

(60)	day entitlement, with a written statement providing the two options that are available regarding Temporary Disability Indemnity Leave after the sixty (60) day entitlement has been exhausted. Option 1 shall be the utilization of Sick Leave that when added to the disability benefits will result in a full paycheck, and Option 2 would allow an employee to receive the disability benefits only.
3.	In accordance with Option 1 an employee who elects to utilize accumulated Sick Leave, that when added to the disability benefit will result in a full pay check, will automatically continue into his or her 100 day half-pay bank at whatever point their accumulated Sick Leave entitlement is exhausted. When either accumulated Sick Leave or 100 day half-pay bank provisions are used in conjunction with temporary disability benefits, they shall be reduced only in that amount to provide a full days salary when added to the Temporary Disability Indemnity contribution.
It is agreed and understood, that classified employees are not required to utilize all their vacation time in conjunction with half-day pay. They may save enough vacation time to cover the mandatory vacation days during the calendar year so as not to be in an unpaid status at those times.
Verification of illness may be required by the District for any absence for which sick leave is claimed.
The administration, subject to the approval of the Governing Board, shall prescribe rules and regulations indicating the manner of proof of illness or injury. However, regulations shall not discriminate against treatment and the need thereof by the practice of the religion of any well-organized religious sect, denomination or organization.

No Governing Board shall adopt any policy or rule, written or unwritten, which requires classified employees transferring to the District to waive any part or all benefits which they may be entitled to have transferred.
Utilization Of Sick Leave During Periods of Vacation
Personal illness or injury occurring during a scheduled vacation may be charged to sick leave provided medical substantiation of illness is furnished by the employee. An absence due to personal illness or injury that occurs prior to and extends into a scheduled vacation may be charged to sick leave.
The District and Union agree to meet and develop an attendance incentive program, if cost-effective, for implementation, prior to the termination date of this contract, which will provide bonus payment to employees from savings, incurred through decreased sick leave and personal necessity leave.
Sick Leave Incentive
In accordance with the provisions of Article 19 Illness and Injury (Sick Leave), the District and the Union representatives have met and agreed to the adoption of an Incentive Program. The program would cover the absences occurring between July 1 and June 30 of each school year. The plan provides incentive payments to those employees who maintain an attendance record with no or little use of illness, personal necessity or industrial accident leave during the school year. New employees hired after July 15 in any fiscal year who are eligible for a bonus payment shall receive a pro-rated amount. It is anticipated that eligible qualifying employees would be paid the earned bonus on a regular

For purposes of all attendance incentive programs, “ light duty” assignments will count as days worked and the first five days (5) including the day of occurrence of an industrial injury will not be counted in the calculation of lost time on any employee’s record. The incentive schedule below will apply to all bargaining unit members with the exception of those individuals in the Transportation and Maintenance & Operations (See MOU, page 114) departments who have a separate schedule.
The following schedule of incentives will apply:

The donation by any employee of sick leave days to the Catastrophic Leave Bank will not be included in the calculation of used sick leave for the purposes of this agreement. Note that withdrawals of sick leave by any employee from the CLB would be included in the calculation of used sick leave for this agreement for that individual employee.
Both parties agree to meet and confer regarding the cost effectiveness of this program and any possible modifications. The District will agree to continue the sick leave incentive program through June 30, 1999. Should the analysis of the 1997/1998 sick leave incentive program indicate that the program is not cost effective as per Article 19, page 54, lines 11-15, the program will be automatically discontinued effective July 1, 1999. This plan will be evaluated on an annual basis for a cost benefit analysis. In any fiscal year that the cost benefits’ analysis does not show positive cash flow from the sick leave incentive program, the program will be automatically discontinued effective July 1 of the subsequent fiscal year. It is agreed that these consultations shall not constitute reopening of a contract article as per Article 41 of the Master Contract.
CATASTROPHIC LEAVE BANK

ARTICLE 44
DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING
A drug-free and alcohol-free workplace promotes employee safety and health. The District may require that an individual employee submit to a drug test in instances where the employee’s demeanor, appearance, and/or conduct present reasonable suspicion that the individual’s judgment is possibly impaired as the result of drug or alcohol consumption. Reasonable suspicion must be determined by a trained district administrator.
The District agrees to provide such tests at no cost to the employee. The District further agrees that such tests be administered while the employee is on the paid time of the District. The employee will be placed on a paid administrative leave basis pending the outcome of the drug/alcohol test. If the test is negative, the employee will be so notified and returned to work. If the test is positive, the test results will be used to offer the employee the opportunity to participate in a rehabilitation program through the District-sponsored employee assistance program or medical benefit program, and any other progressive disciplinary action.
In the event that an employee refuses to submit to a drug or alcohol test; such refusal will be the equivalent of a positive test result.
A letter of intent clarifying the application of this Article as follows:
1.	That the article in no way relates to implementation of random or post accident testing pursuant to the Federal Omni-bus Transportation act.
2.	That the Article in no way modifies the District’s position as stated in Article 15, lines 15-19.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
(REVISED) '
It is agreed and understood by and between the Fontana Unified School District ("District") and the United Steelworkers of America, Local 8599 ("Union"), as follows:
Whereas, the District frequently has openings for aides at school sites, and
Whereas, frequently there are more applicants for these positions than there are available openings, and
Whereas, it is the desire of the District and the Union to first offer these positions to employees who are already employed in that same class at the site where the vacancy exists,
Now therefore, effective December 11, 19 89, it is agreed and understood by and between the District and the Union that when an aide position becomes vacant at a site, the following procedure shall be followed:
1.	The vacancy shall first be posted by the site administrator at that site only for a minimum period of five (5) days;
2.	Applications shall be accepted by the site administrator only from employees who are currently employed at that site;
3.	The site administrator and at least one teacher from the appropriate department shall interview those applicants, and
4.	The site administrator shall select the successful candidate pursuant to Article 10 of the collective bargaining agreement, to wit:
1.	Skill and ability to perform the work as demonstrated by prior experience and competence.
2.	Physical fitness.
3.	Length of Continuous Service.
When, in the judgement of the District, a junior employee exceeds a senior employee in connection with factors 1 and 2 listed above, then the District may select the junior employee for promotion.
When factors 1 and 2 above are equal, length of continuous service shall be controlling.
102
5.	If, after adhering to these procedures, either no applications are received from employees at that site, or, in the judgement of that site administrator, a suitable candidate cannot be found from the sice-only applicants, then the position in question may be posted District-wide pursuant to the provisions of aforementioned Article 10 of the collective bagaihing agreement.
It is further agreed that this agreement shall exclude all campus aide positions and further, that this agreement shall remain in effect until such time as the District and the Union shall by mutual agreement modify said agreement.

AGREEMENT
Recognizing that changes in payroll procedures for employees many times result in’unforeseen difficulties for employees, and
Recognizing that it is the desire of the District and USWA Local 8599 to prevent such difficulties, and
Recognizing that such difficulties often negatively impact employee morale and loyalty.
The Fontana Unified School District and USWA Local 8599 hereby agree that all future changes in payroll procedures and pdlicies which affect employees’ actual dollar amounts received per pay period, or which affect the number of paychecks employees receive in a fiscal year, or policies and procedures which in any other manner may alter amounts or frequency of paychecks, shall include union input and shall not be implemented until and unless such opportunity to participate in proposed changes in policy or procedure has been accorded to the Union.
This agreement shall not be interpreted to mean that payroll procedures are subject to formal negotiation procedures. The sole purpose of this agreement is to provide both parties with an opportunity to present proposals and voice concerns regarding payroll procedures so that fewer employee difficulties arise when in the course of conducting .District business, changes are necessary in payrp11 po1ici e s.
Finally, it is agreed that the employees whose names appear below shall, from this point forward, in each succeeding fiscal year, continue to be compensated on an "actual earnings" basis rather than the District's present "even-pay" policy. This practice shall continue on a year-to-year basis and does not require each individual employee to request such payment each year. If an affected employee requests removal from this procedure, or because of a change in work status no longer qualif ies for such special consideration, that employee shall subsequently be precluded from returning to such status absent a new agreement to that effect.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
WHEREAS, the District and the Union have recently participated in a joint pilot program for daytime custodians at the elementary level, and
WHEREAS, this pilot program has proven to be effective and successful, and WHEREAS, it is the intent of the District and the Union to implement this pilot program throughout the district where feasible,
It is therefore agreed as follows:
1.	Daytime Custodian positions will be offered to Range 12 Custodians who are currently .working the cafeteria load at the selected elementary schools indicated below.
2.	In the event a cafeteria load custodian declines the above position, the day position shall then be offered to the next most senior District-wide, Range 12 Custodian working at that specific site.
3.	If all Range 12 Custodians at that site dedine the daytime position, the District shall open .that daytime position to all Range 12 Custodians throughout the District The selection for the daytime custodian shall then be made pursuant to our current custodial transfer policy, the het result of which will be the least senior custodian at that site being involuntarily transferred to another site to accommodate the new custodian transferring in.
4.	The offer to assume the daytime custodian position shall be offered to the person performing the cafeteria load at each site as of January 10,1991.
5.	The Union understands and acknowledges that the custodian transferred into the new day shift shall no longer receive the five percent B-shift differential pay, effective upon the date the daytime custodian assumes his new duties.
6.	The District will delete one B-shift Range 12 Custodian per affected site, and will create one Range 13 Senior Custodian at each affected site. Each custodian who assumes the new day position shall be reclassed to Range 13 Senior Custodian, with no change in their step and/or hire date.
7.	The following elementary sites shall implement daytime custodians pursuant to this agreement:

Maple
Oak Park
Cypress
North Tamarind
106
Oleander

If, in the future, any of these schools are able to enter this program, all of the above procedures shall be adhered to and followed when selecting the intitial daytime custodians for those sites.
8.	These procedures for selecting daytime custodians shall be effective only for the initial selection of a daytime custodian at each elementary site. Vacancies which occur when the original daytime custodians vacate their positions shall be filled pursuant to the then-current Collective Bargaining Agreement which addresses job vacancies, and the custodial transfer policy which is contained in the Custodial Handbook. The implementation of this District-wide program effectively ends the pilot program currently underway at Maple and Oak Park Elementary Schools, and upon implementation of this new program, those daytime custodians currently receiving B-shift differential pay at those sites shall cease receiving such pay.
9.	All parties agree to meet in the future as necessary to address any problems or concerns which may be a result of this daytime custodian program. Any decision to delete or substantially modify the daytime custodian position at an elementary site shall first be preceded by a meeting between the Union; personnel, management representatives, and affected site administrator.

Policy on Calling Substitute Workers During the Summer
On Friday, June 6,1990,1 met with Betty Bell, Cecelia Amato, and Ken Ross to discuss the policy for calling substitute food service workers during the summer.

Because questions have arisen this year regarding this same matter, I checked with Irene Keating, Food Service Coordinator at Fohi, to determine whether or not these procedures were, in fact, followed last summer. Irene stated that yes, these were the correct procedures, and they were utilized during the summer of 1990. Therefore, the procedures referenced below will be adhered to this summer when calling substitute food service worker employees.
1.	FOOD SERVICE WORKERS

UNITED STEELWORKERS OF AMERICA, LOCAL 8599 Regarding Bilingual Translation/Extra Duty Assignment
This is a Memorandum of Understanding for a pilot program which will be in effect for the 1996-97 school year and which will be evaluated on an annual basis. The pilot period is to be considered a trial period with a reevaluation of the feasibility of this process at the end of the 1996-97 school year.

After asking for volunteers from among full-time employees at the sites, employees will be nominated for the bilingual translation extra-duty assignment authorization by the principal or department head on the basis of the following criterion: 1) level of need for unscheduled translation services; 2) feasibility of assignment of these duties given consideration of employee’s availability and
114
other dirties; 3) principal’s informal assessment of language fluency; 4) the employee is willing to accept this assignment

Therefore, the minimum time recorded on the timesheet will be one hour.
5.	All hours identified on the timesheet will be compensated at a rate of six dollars ($6.00) per hour bonus payment fin addition to the employee’s regular hourly rate).

Problem 2: Due to the different work years involved in CSP, many aides receive very small checks periodically throughout the year making it difficult to finance the costs of health and welfare benefits.
The District offers the following solution to the Union Concerns:
The District recommends that the aides on the various CSP tracks take certain days of vacation throughout the year when they would be in a non-work status in such a way that the vacation days would correspond to traditional holidays. In so doing, CSP aides would qualify for additional holiday pay increasing their annual salary.
In regard to leveling the compensation received over the work year, this approach to taking vacation days in relationship to holidays will provide more consistent salary on a check-by-check basis.
This offer of settlement in no way sets a precedent for present or future concerns. This offer constitutes full and final settlement of this Union concern.
