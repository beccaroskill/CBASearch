Section 1
(a)	Each respective Union shall have the exclusive right to the checkoff and transmittal of dues on behalf of each employee in a title which is associated with that respective Union under the terms of the agreement among such respective Unions dated April 3, 1981. Procedures established under City of New York Mayor's Executive Orders 98 and 99, both dated May 15th, 1969, shall remain in effect until successor University procedures are promulgated.
(b)	Any employee, other than one excluded from Union membership pursuant to Article I, Section 3, may authorize the deduction of dues from the employee's wages and designate the respective Union as the recipient thereof. Such authorization shall be in a form acceptable to the University, and shall bear the signature of the employee.
Section 2.
The University and the Union agree that employees shall be subject to an agency shop fee deduction to the extent permitted by applicable law and in accordance with procedures contained in a separate agreement hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
Section 3.
Each respective Union shall have reasonable access to its dues check-off authorization cards in the custody of the University.
Section 4.
To the extent practicable when an employee transfers from one College to another but remains in a title represented by the same respective Union, the employee shall continue to be covered by the same dues check-off authorization card and not required to sign another authorization card. The College where the employee was formerly employed shall transfer the check-off authorization card to the employee's new College.
The University will issue appropriate administrative instructions to all Colleges to insure compliance with this provision.
Section 5.
When an employee is promoted or reclassified to another title represented by the same respective Union as that which represents the employee's former title, the dues check-off shall continue uninterrupted.
The University will issue appropriate administrative instructions to all Colleges
WHITE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000-2002
PAGE 6
regarding this provision.
Section 6.
When an employee returns from an approved leave of absence without pay or is reappointed or temporarily appointed from a preferred list to the same College in the same title, or in another title represented by the same respective Union, any dues check-off authorization in effect prior to the approved leave or layoff shall be reactivated.
The University will issue appropriate administrative instructions to all Colleges regarding this provision.
Section 7.
(a)	Where orientation kits are supplied to new employees, the respective Unions representing such employees shall be permitted to have union literature included in the kits, provided such literature is first approved for such purpose by the University Office of Faculty and Staff Relations.
(b)	The University shall distribute to all newly hired employees information regarding their Union administered health and security benefits, including the name and address of the fund that administers said benefits, provided such fund supplies the University the requisite information printed in sufficient quantities.
(c)	The University and/or the Colleges shall distribute information regarding the New York City Health Insurance Program and enrollment forms to eligible employees prior to the completion of thirty (30) days of employment.
Section 8.
(a)	The University shall furnish to each respective Union which makes a request, once a year between March 15 and July 1, or such other 3 % month period as the University shall designate, a listing of employees by job title code, home address when available, social security number and college code number, as of December 31st of the preceding year, or such date as shall in like manner correspond to the 3 % month designated period.
(b)	The University will furnish annually to the New York State Nurses Association seniority lists by college and will correct such lists from time to time as may be necessary. Such lists shall reflect each employee's date of original appointment and length of service in the employee's current title. The list will conclusively establish an employee's seniority in the College, unless the employee protests it, in writing, within thirty (30) days from the time it is furnished or, if the employee is on a leave of absence or vacation or otherwise unable to so protest it within such time, within thirty (30) days after the employee returns from such leave or vacation or such disability is removed.

The term Union in sections 9 and 10 of this Article shall mean Union or respective Union.
The Union may post notices on bulletin boards in places and locations where notices usually are posted by the University for the employees to read. All notices shall be on Union stationery, and shall be used only to notify employees of matters pertaining to Union affairs. Upon request to the Office of Human Resources of a College, the Union may use College and/or University premises for meetings during employees' lunch hour, subject to availability of appropriate space and provided such meetings do not interfere with a College’s and/or University’s business.
Section 10.
Time spent by employee representatives in the conduct of labor relations with the University and on union activities shall be governed by the terms of New York City Mayor's Executive Order No. 75, as amended, dated March 22, 1973, entitled "Time Spent on the Conduct of Labor Relations between the City and Its Employees and on Union Activity."

Section 1.
(a)	Unless otherwise specified, all salary provisions of this Agreement, including minimum and maximum salaries, advancement increases, general increases, education differentials and any other salary adjustments, are based upon a normal work week of 35 hours (37.5 hours for Staff Nurses employed on other than annual salary basis).

WHITE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000-2002
PAGE 31
1.	Only service in pay status shall be used to calculate the 15 years of service, except that for other than full time per annum employees only a continuous year of service in pay status shall be used to calculate the 15 years of service. A continuous year of service shall be a full year of service without a break of more than 31 days. Where the regular and customary work year for a title is less than a twelve month year, such as a school year, such regular and customary year shall be credited as a continuous year of service counting towards the 15 years of service. If the normal work year for an employee is less than the regular and customary work year for the employee's title, it shall be counted as a continuous year of service if the employee has customarily worked that length of work year and the College Appointing Authority verifies that information.
College Assistants are eligible for the Longevity Increment if they were employed in that title for 500 or more hours in each of 15 contract years (July 1 to June 30). If a College Assistant worked fewer than 500 hours in a contract year due to the fiscal problems of 1975 - 1977, but worked 400 or more hours in such year it can be credited as a 500 hour year. If he/she worked fewer than 400 hours in such a year, that year can be bridged (but not credited).
The Longevity Increment for College Assistants is forty-four cents per hour ($0.44/hr) as of January 1, 1996, for College Assistants who have fifteen years of service, and is payable no later than the January 1 or July 1 following the completion of 500 hours in the fifteenth year of creditable service retroactive to the date of completion of 500 hours in the fifteenth year.
2.	Service in pay status prior to any breaks in service of more than one year shall not be used to calculate the 15 years of service. Where an employee has less than seven years of continuous service in pay status, breaks in service of less than one year shall be aggregated. Where breaks in service aggregate to more than one year they shall be treated as a break in service of more than one year and the service prior to such breaks and the aggregated breaks shall not be used to calculate the 15 years of service. No break used to disqualify service shall be used more than once.
3.	The following time in which an employee is not in pay status shall not constitute a break in service for the purpose of longevity increment as specified in paragraph 2 above:
a.	time on a leave approved by the proper authority;
b.	time of up to one year, prior to a reinstatement;
WHITE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000-2002
PAGE 32
c.	time on a preferred list pursuant to Civil Service Law Sections 80 (Suspension or demotion upon the abolition or reduction of position) or any similar contractual provisions and 81 (Preferred lists; certification and reinstatement therefrom) or any similar contractual provision; or,
d.	time not in pay status of 31 days or less.
Notwithstanding the above, such time as specified in subsections a, b and c above shall not be used to calculate the 15 years of service.
4.	Once an employee has completed the 15 years of "City" service in pay status and is eligible to receive the $500 or $800 longevity increment, the $500 or $800 shall become part of the employee's base rate for all purposes except as provided in paragraph 5 below.
For the purpose of this section only, "City Service" shall mean service in The City University of New York and/or service with the following agencies and public employers:
The City of New York (includes the Office of any elected official in New York City Government)
Triboro Bridge & Tunnel Authority (Non-unique titles in classified service only)
New York City Housing Authority
Health & Hospitals Corporation
Court Systems while under NYC Jurisdiction (to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis)
Offices of the District Attorneys of the five counties in NYC Model Cities
NYC Transit Authority
Addiction Services Agency
Board of Education
Off-Track Betting Corporation
Fashion Institute of Technology
5.	The $500 or $800 longevity increment shall not become pensionable until fifteen months after the employee becomes eligible to receive such $500, or $800 increment. Fifteen months after the employee becomes eligible to receive the $500 or $800 longevity increment, such $500 or $800 longevity increment shall become pensionable and, as part of the employee's base rate, the $500 longevity increment shall be subject to the general increases provided in Section 3(a) of this Article III.
WHITE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000-2002

Section 8.	Training Funds
(a)	Effective January 1, 1996, a training fund contribution at the rate of $25 per annum shall be made to the District Council 37 Education Fund on behalf of each full-time employee in a title listed in the Clerical Group, Reprographics Group, Gittleson Group, Accounting Group, Engineering and Architectural Group and EDP Group, in Section 7a of this Article.

This Subsection shall be subject to the provisions, including the waiver, of Article IV, Section 3 of this Agreement.
Section 9.	Assignment Differentials
(a)	Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, an assignment differential provided for in this Section shall be paid at the indicated rate only upon the authorized assignment of an employee to qualifying duties and during the period of the indicated assignment. The maximum salary of a title shall not be a bar to the payment of an assignment differential.
The payment of such differential shall not be considered a promotion or change of title. An assignment differential shall not be part of the basic salary.
(b)	An assignment differential at the rate of $598 per annum effective 7/1/00, and $622 effective 7/1/01, shall be paid to each employee in the title of CUNY Office Assistant Level II or III or CUNY Secretarial Assistant Level II or Level III or in the title of Office Aide (Level III only), who was assigned regularly to the preparation, reconciliation, certification and/or auditing of payrolls of University personnel prior to July 1, 1985, and remains so assigned.

Such a differential shall be paid commencing the 31st day of such assignment within a two month period.
Section 10.	Staff Nurse Education Differential

Employees shall be listed in order of receipt of the request by the University Director of Human Resources for Management Services.

All applications for a newly established College, if applicable, received by the University Director of Human Resources for Management Services within 30 days of a Board of Trustees resolution to establish that College, shall be considered on the basis of seniority alone.
All applications for transfer by employees in titles not previously covered by a transfer policy, which are received within 60 days of the signing of this Agreement shall be considered on the basis of seniority alone.

a)	after appointment from a list, or
b)	after a voluntary transfer, or
2.	He or she has served for at least one year after a promotion. Advancement to a higher assignment level, through designation by the
WHITE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000-2002
PAGE 83
College, shall be considered as a promotion for purposes of this Article and require an additional year of service unless transfer is at the previously held level, pursuant to Section 2(b). Where advancement to the higher level is mandatory upon the attainment of a specified period of service, such advancement shall not be a bar to immediate placement on the transfer roster; and
3.	There is no disciplinary action pending or in process against him or her and no disciplinary penalties were imposed in the preceding 3 years; and
4.	He or she did not have an unsatisfactory service evaluation during the immediately preceding 2 year period.

(e)	An employee who has been transferred from one borough to another because of layoff, and has applied for transfer back to his or her previous College, shall be given priority over employees who are at their present location for reasons other than layoff and over employees who are on a preferred list of employees who were laid off from the College to which transfer is sought.
(f)	The existence of a promotion list with the names of three or more candidates in active service in the subordinate title at a College shall bar the use of a transfer roster to that College for that title. A promotion list established by merging college lists on a borough or university basis may be used interchangeably with a transfer roster, at the discretion of the College Director of Human Resources.
The existence of a preferred eligible list shall bar the use of a transfer roster for that title for transfer to the College from which any employee on the preferred eligible list was laid off, except as provided in Section 1, subsection (e).
(g)	The existence of a transfer roster shall not be a bar to the reinstatement of a person at the college from which he or she has resigned.

ARTICLE XXIX	- DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE

(b)	The forms of discipline shall include, but not be limited to, a written reprimand, a fine not to exceed $200, demotion, suspension not to exceed 60 days without pay, termination.
(c)	The procedures in this Article shall be the exclusive procedures for disciplinary action and resolving disputes relating to such disciplinary action.

Section 2.	Initiating a Disciplinary Action
Other than in exceptional situations requiring immediate action, such as, but not necessarily limited to, those involving potential injury to persons or property or unreasonable disruption of University operations, if a College has cause to believe an incident has occurred or circumstances may exist warranting disciplinary action, it shall investigate such incident or circumstances prior to taking disciplinary action. As part of the investigation, the College shall make reasonable efforts to interview any employee(s) who may be subject to disciplinary action. In those exceptional situations requiring immediate action, as described above, an employee may be immediately suspended. Such a suspension without pay pending a decision of the hearing officer may not exceed 30 days except where the charges relate to the alleged commission of a criminal offense relating to employment, in which case the suspension may continue until completion of the Criminal Court procedures, and in which case the suspension will be reviewed periodically at the request of the employee and/or the Union.
An employee who is being interrogated concerning an incident or action which may subject him or her to disciplinary action shall be notified of his or her right to have a Union representative present upon request. This provision shall be applicable to interrogation before, during, or after filing a charge against an employee. The provisions of this Section shall not be interpreted to prevent a supervisor from questioning a employee in relation to his or her employment nor to preclude the questioning of an employee during or immediately following an incident.
Section 3.	Disciplinary Charges
Following an investigation, if it is necessary in the judgment of the College to charge an individual employee with incompetency or misconduct, the college official vested with such responsibility shall furnish the employee with a written statement of the charges, specifications and possible penalties.

The statement shall be hand-delivered to the employee or sent by "Certified Mail -- Return Receipt Requested" to the employee's last address on file at the College. The statement shall indicate the date, time and place, within ten days, for the first step hearing at the College. The statement shall also indicate the employee's right to representation at such hearing.
A.	First Step
The hearing officer shall issue a written decision with regard to the charges and shall state the disciplinary penalty, if any, within ten working days of the conclusion of the hearing, or record closed by the Hearing Officer, whichever is applicable. The College may implement a penalty, other than termination, upon issuance of the Step One decision.
The decision shall inform the Respondent employee that he or she may accept the penalty or appeal to the Chancellor’s Designee for a Step II hearing within 10 calendar days of the receipt of the Step I decision. Unreturned mail shall be presumed to have been received on the date following transmittal. The appeal must
WHITE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000-2002
PAGE 103
state what choice the employee has made between the two final review options: a) review by an arbitrator, or b) review by the City University Civil Service Commission. Choice of arbitration as a final step may be made only with the concurrence of the Union.
In the event such a request is not filed within the time limit, the Step I decision shall be deemed to have been accepted and except as otherwise provided in Section 4 of this Article, no issue stemming from or relating to the disciplinary action shall be subject to any further appeal.
A Step I decision to terminate employment shall be effective upon failure to appeal to Step II.
B.	Second Step
A Step II hearing shall be scheduled within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of a request by the Chancellor's Designee. A written decision shall be delivered to the Union and the Respondent employee within fourteen working days from the conclusion of the Step II hearing, or record closed by the Hearing Officer, whichever is applicable.
A Step II decision to terminate employment shall be effective upon issuance of the Step II decision by the Chancellor's Designee.
Within thirty (30) working days of receipt of the Chancellor’s Designee’s written decision at Step II, the Union may make a written request for arbitration, or within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of the Chancellor's Designee's written decision at Step II, the Union may make a written request for review by the CUNY Civil Service Commission, or the employee may make a written request for review by the CUNY Civil Service Commission, in accordance with the choice indicated when the appeal of the First Step decision was filed. Unreturned mail shall be presumed to have been received on the date following transmittal.
Any disciplinary decision at or above step two and any appeal of a disciplinary decision may be resolved by settlement agreement only if agreed to in writing by The University Office of Faculty and Staff Relations, the employee and an authorized representative of the respective union.
C.	Third Step (Arbitration)
A request for arbitration shall be made to the American Arbitration Association with a copy of such request sent to the Chancellor's designee by Certified mail.
The Association shall designate an arbitrator from a panel agreed to by the parties and shall notify the Union and the Chancellor's designee of the arbitrator named. In cases involving termination of employment, the date of the arbitration shall be within fourteen calendar days of receipt of notification by the arbitrator of his or her appointment.
WHITE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000-2002
PAGE 104
The arbitrator is authorized to make awards as to arbitrability.
All arbitrations shall be based upon the official rules of the American Arbitration Association.
In cases involving termination of employment, the arbitrator shall issue his or her award within 14 calendar days of the termination of the arbitration proceedings.
The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and enforceable in any appropriate tribunal in accordance with Article 75 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. An arbitrator may provide for and direct such relief as the arbitrator deems necessary and proper, subject to the limitations of this Agreement and any applicable limitations of law.
In any arbitration under this Section, the arbitrator may apply either the standard of "preponderance of the evidence" or the standard of "clear and convincing evidence" in determining whether the University has met its burden of proof.
D.	Third Step (Civil Service Commission)
Appeal to the CUNY Civil Service Commission shall be on the basis of the record at Step II and decisions established at Step I and Step II. The employee and/or the Union may state the basis for their appeal in their request or within 15 working days following their request unless otherwise provided by the rules of the commission. A copy of such communication shall be sent to the Chancellor's Designee. The University may respond in writing within 10 additional working days.
The CUNY Civil Service Commission, at its discretion may consider oral or written arguments based on the record and the Commission, or its designated Hearing Review Officer, shall hear and consider any new evidence not in existence at the time of the Step II hearing which may effect its determination. The Commission may provide for and direct such relief as it deems necessary and proper, subject to the limitations of this Agreement and any applicable limitations of law.
Section 4.	Disciplinary Procedure for Job Abandonment
(a)	In addition to the established procedures of this Article XXIX as related to absences from work, an employee who is absent without authorization and fails to notify or communicate such absence in the manner prescribed by the College Director of Human Resources for a period of ten (10) or more consecutive work days shall be subject to disciplinary action which may result in termination of employment
(b)	Such employee shall be brought up on disciplinary charges of job abandonment prior to the imposition of any disciplinary penalty. Upon filing disciplinary charges for job abandonment, the matter will proceed directly to a Step II hearing before the Chancellor’s Designee. Prior to the Step II hearing, the employee and/or union on the employee’s behalf, must indicate in writing to the Chancellor’s Designee what choice has been made between the two final review options: a) review by an arbitrator, or b) review by the CUNY Civil Service Commission. Choice of arbitration
WHITE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000-2002
PAGE 105
as a final Step may be made only with the concurrence of the Union.
(c)	Notification of such disciplinary action must be hand delivered to the employee or sent by regular and certified mail to the last address on file in the College Human Resources Office, in accordance with Section 3 of this Article. As is true of all disciplinary hearings, the hearing may be conducted as scheduled even if the employee fails to attend such hearing, provided that the required procedures have been followed to notify said employee of the scheduled date, time and location of the Step II hearing.
(d)	In the event the employee fails to appear at the Step II hearing, the decision rendered at Step II shall be final and binding and will not be subject to any further appeal, except for the limitations set forth below.

Gentlemen:
We have carefully reviewed the revised positions put forth by you in our discussions of May 5 and 27, 1986, and reconsidered the earlier positions as set forth in the September 12, 1985, February 13, 1986, and May 14, 1986 documents, in the light of your new concerns. We are now prepared to make a final best offer, which we believe is a reasonable basis for agreement at this time.
As you know, there have been significant and substantive recent gains in the salaries of the CUNY employees you represent. These salary advances were put into effect as a good faith reflection of the fact that, since September, 1985, we were in evident agreement on all but a few minor details.
As I am sure you also realize, the next round of bargaining is not far off, and it will provide an appropriate opportunity to discuss any continuing concerns, such as the possibility of an additional sub-level, in the Tight of actual experience with the new titles.
The University's final best offer is as follows:
1.	Local 375 is recognized as the respective union representing the following titles as part of the Non-Ins truetional Clerical, Administrative, and Professional Bargaining Unit (CUNY White Collar Unit). These titles were established by The Board of
Trustees of The City University of become effective on July 1, 1985: Univ. Arch. Intern Univ. Asst. Architect Univ. Arch. Levels I, II, III Assistant Chief Architect

Univ. Engineering Tech. Trainee
Univ. Engineering Technician
Univ. Engineering Intern
Univ. Asst. Engineer
Univ. Engr. Levels I, II, III Assistant Chief Engineer
2
2.	The salary rates for these titles and levels are summarized in tlTe following table, and are based on the salary levels discussed previously as "pre-coalition" rates. The table applies the 1984-87 Municipal Coalition Economic Agreement (MCEA) to the titles that were restructured (n accordance wiy.'A our discussions.

Mr. Martin Lubin, Deputy to the Associate Director District Council 37, AFSCME 125 Barclay Street
New York, N.Y. 10007
--Gentl emen: _ -	_	-
I write to confirm~the understandings we reached during our discussion of December 19, 1985, regarding The City University of New York titles represented by Local 1407 -- College Accounting Assistant and College Accountant.
1.	We have agreed that the number of conversions and appointments to new College Accountant positions, both filled and projected” to be filled, as outJined by CUNY at our meeting of October 15 1985 , brings -CUNY into substantial compliance with the timetable we have agreed upon based on Arbitrator Ornati1s award. We made all 28 conversions or new appointments by February 1, when two (-2) College Accounting Assistants attained their degrees and were promoted to College Accountant. In addition, CUNY anticipates that several additional College Accountant positions will be developed by the end of this fiscal year.
2.	We have agreed that it is appropriate to promote both Mr. Nicholas Saccone at the College of Staten Island and Mr. Teodoro Rodriquez at Bronx Community College to the title College Accountant on the basis of their current permanent status in the • title College Accounting Assistant ajid of their having passed the 1 New York City promotion examination for the title Accountant.
These promotions will be expedited. These personnel actions will mark the. last time CUNY contemplates using any competitive list that is certified by the New York City Department of Personnel for an accounting title, other than the CUNY titles College Accounting Assistant and College Accountant. 3
3. We have agreed that the job specifications for College Accountant are to be amended immediately to provide explicitly for supervision at Level II. The revised specifications, drafted by CUNY and reviewed by us at the December 19 meeting, are to be the basis of the new specifications, except that, at your suggestion, we will provide that if a Level II College Accountant supervises one or more Level II College Accountants, the supervisor must receive a salary no lower than the salary he or she received prior
to the assignment of supervisory duties involving Level II College Accountants plus the promotion guarantee for Level III. The maximum salary of the title shall not be a bar to the payment of such salary to the supervisor.
4	. We have agreed that those persons who were originally reclassified from _the New York City title Accountant or Associate Accountant to College Accountant Level II and who have grieved that such assignment level is inappropriate (under the specifications now to be modified by paragraph 3 above) because they perform supervisory duties_, will be reclassified to Level III. They will receive the,advancement increase for Level III effective the respective date each of the grievances was filed. We agreed that such action will resolve each such grievance filed prior to the date the specifications are amended.
5	.' We agreed to the following provisions, which may be grouped underthe heading "Equity":
Ja) Any CUNY employee in the title Col lege-Account i ng Assistant-~ who was converted from the New York City title Assistant Accountant shall receive any longevity differential he or she would have received had he or she remained an Assistant Accountant. Paragraph A.3. of the April 11, 1984, agreement between Local 1407 (DC 37) and CUNY is to be modified to reflect this change.
-- b) Any CUNY employee in the title College Accountant at Level I or 'Level-II , who. is already receiving a Service increase pursuant to_paragraph B.5. of the April 117 1984, agreement between Local 1407 (DC 37) and CUNY,-shall be paid no less than the salary, including service increase, that he or she would have received had he or she remained in the New York City title from which he or she converted: Accountant or Associate Accountant. Any adjustment to the service increase provided by the 1984-87 Equity Panel awards shall be included in such -computation. [Paragraph B.5. of our April 11, 1984, agreement is to be modified to reflect this change].
Increase of salary (including service increase), if any, paid pursuant to this-provision shall not result in a salary rate at Level 1A greater than the rate that would have been paid in Level 1A absent this provision.
c) The following shall apply to any person now serving in the title College Accountant who had served in the New York City titles Assistant Accountant, Accountant, Senior Accountant, or Associate Accountant prior to appointment to a title in the HEO
or Business Manager series.
1.	Service in the HEO or Business Manager series title of less than one (1) year shall be bridged, that is, it shall not be credited but neither shall it break the continuity of accounting title service.
2.	The person so serving shall be given credit for the prior New York City Accounting title service for service increase purposes only if his or her present salary, including any service increase received in the College Accountant title, is less than the salary he or she would be receiving had he or she remained in the last New York City Accounting title held prior to his or her HEO or Business Manager series appointment. In such case, hi~s or her salary shall be adjusted to equal the salary that would have been paid.
3.	~ The prior New York City Accounting title -service will be credited for salary purposes as specified above and only such other purposes as may be required by applicable rule, regulation, or law.
6.	We have, at your request, reviewed the status of the people -^currently serving in_the College Accountant title who passed the promotion examination for the New York City title Associate Accountant. We find that all but one of these persons has already been advanced to Level II.	_
7.	CUNY has examined the number of College Accountant title positions allocated to Level IV. We find that there is great likelihood that additional positions at this level will be identified and filled within the next several months. One position is at John Jay College; another, involving the possible reassignment of duties, is at Brooklyn College. We have agreed that where a change in assignment level is the result of a change in duties, an advancement increase is appropriate.
J8. — 11 is our understanding that the relevant portions of these agreements, as well as the April 11, 1984, agreements, will be incorporated into the 1984-87 White Collar unit agreement.
It is our further understanding that this letter, together with the April 11, 1984 agreements, resolves all of the outstanding issues between us regarding the CUNY titles represented by Local 1407 __ college Accounting Assistant and College Accountant. If you concur, please sign the copy of this letter and return it to me.
I am pleased that we have been able to resolve all of the outstanding issues, and I look forward to a continuing cooperative relationship.

Dear Mr. Sullivan:
I write to confirm the understanding of the parties set forth below pertaining to the interpretation of Article VIII, Section 3, as read in conjunction with Article VIII, Section 16 of both the White Collar and Blue Collar Agreements for the period 2000 - 2002. The language is as follows:
In the event that authorized voluntary overtime results in an employee, who is covered by the provisions of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) actually working in excess of forty (40) hours in a payroll week, such hours worked in excess of forty hours shall be compensated in time off at the rate of time and one-half (1-1/2 x) provided that the employee does not thereby accrue more than 240 hours of FLSA compensatory time. Any hours of authorized voluntary overtime that would be in excess of 240 hours shall be paid in cash at the rate of time and one-half (1-1/2 x).
If this accords with your understanding, please execute the signature line below. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact my office.
