This Agreement, entered into by and between ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHAPTER, National Electrical Contractors Association, Inc., and LOCAL UNION NO. 68, of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
It shall apply to all firms who sign a Letter of Assent to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
As used hereinafter in this Agreement, the term "Chapter" shall mean the Rocky Mountain Chapter, National Electrical Contractors Association, Inc., and the term "Union" shall mean Local Union No. 68, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
The term "Employer" shall mean an individual firm who has been recognized by an assent to this Agreement.
BASIC PRINCIPALS
The Employer and the Union have a common and sympathetic interest in the Electrical Industry. Therefore, a working system, and harmonious relations are necessary to improve the relationship between the Employer, the Union, and the Public.
Progress in the industry demands a mutuality of confidence between the Employer and the Union. All will benefit by continuous peace and by adjusting any differences by rational, common sense methods.
Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:
i

The Council's decisions shall be final and binding.

ARTICLE II EMPLOYER RIGHTS- UNION RIGHTS
Section 2.01. Certain qualifications, knowledge, experience and proof of financial responsibility are required of everyone desiring to be an Employer in the Electrical Industry. Therefore, an Employer who contracts for electrical work is a person, firm, or corporation having these qualifications and maintaining a place of business, a suitable financial status to meet payroll requirements and employing not less than one Journeyman Wireman.
MANAGEMENT RIGHTS:
Section 2.02. The Union understands the Employer is responsible to perform the work required by the owner. The Employer shall, therefore,
4
have no restrictions except those specifically provided for in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, in planning, directing, and controlling the operation of all his work, in deciding the number and kind of employees to properly perform the work, in hiring and laying off employees, in transferring employees from job to job within the Local Union's geographical jurisdiction, in determining the need and number as well as the person who will act as Foreman, in requiring all employees to observe the Employer's and/or owner's rules and regulations not inconsistent with this Agreement, in requiring all employees to observe all safety regulations, and in discharging employees for proper cause.
FOREMAN CALL OUT BY NAME:
Section 2.03. The Employer shall have the right to call by name one (1) Group I applicant properly registered on the out-of-work list, per job, for supervision. He shall be paid the applicable rate of pay, plus any applicable percentages. Such individual shall have his employment terminated by the Employer upon completion of said job.
WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE:
Section 2.04. For all employees covered by this Agreement, the Employer shall carry Worker's Compensation Insurance with a company authorized to do business in this State, Social Security and such other protective insurance as may be required by the laws of the State in which the work is performed. He shall also make contributions to State Unemployment Compensation Commission regardless of the number of employees except in the case of an owner/operator.
SURETY BOND:
Section 2.05. Each contractor signatory or bound to this Agreement shall provide a bond conditioned upon payment of all fringe contributions, all wages and all working dues, which bond shall be backed by a corporate surety licensed to engage in the insurance business in Colorado, as more fully set forth herein.
5
There shall be no bonding obligation on any contractor, except that at any time a contractor is delinquent in fringe contributions for any two months during the term of this Agreement, or any successor agreement, or is delinquent or otherwise defaults on any payroll payments, it shall provide a payment bond in an amount not less than three times the average monthly amount of fringe contributions payable by said contractor over the last 12 months, and four (4) times the gross weekly payroll computed over the last six months, and the working dues amount corresponding to the payroll amount. The calculation of this amount shall be performed by the appropriate trust fund.
The bond shall be in the form attached hereto and shall be filed with the local union (see Exhibit A).
The local union may, in its discretion, in lieu of the payment bond, accept an irrevocable letter of credit from a commercial bank lawfully doing business in Colorado, or it may accept a promissory note from the contractor and from such responsible officials of the corporation, as it deems appropriate to secure payment.
At any time the obligation to file the bond attaches, the local union may, in addition to the bond requirement, withdraw all employees from the contractor’s jobs and refuse to supply replacements. In such an event, the agreement shall continue to apply.
The obligation to maintain the bond will terminate when the contractor has had twelve (12) consecutive months of no paycheck defaults and no delinquencies in trust payments.
UNION RECOGNITION:
Section 2.07. (a) The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive representative of all its employees performing work under the Collective Bargaining Agreement within the jurisdiction of the Union for the purpose of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment and other conditions of employment.
6
(b) The Employer understands that the Local Union's jurisdiction both trade and territorial is not a subject for negotiations but rather is determined solely within the IBEW by the International President and, therefore, agrees to recognize and be bound by such determinations.
NON-RESIDENT EMPLOYEES: (Portability)
Section 2.09. An employer signatory to a collective bargaining agreement or to a letter of assent to an agreement with another IBEW Local Union, who signs an assent to this Agreement, may bring up to four bargaining unit employees employed in that Local Union’s jurisdiction into this Local’s jurisdiction and up to two bargaining unit employees per job from that Local’s jurisdiction to this Local’s jurisdiction for specialty or service and maintenance work. All charges of violations of this section shall be considered as a dispute and shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of this agreement for the handling of grievances with the exception that any decision of a local labor-management committee that may be contrary to the intent of the parties to the National Agreement on Employee Portability, upon recommendation of either or both the appropriate IBEW International Vice President or NECA Regional Executive Director, is subject to review, modification or rescission by the Council on Industrial Relations.
FAVORED NATIONS:
Section 2.10.

Each member shall be appointed for a 3-year term, unless being appointed for a lesser period of time to complete an unexpired term.

26
required to constantly watch the apprentice. Supervision will not be of a nature that prevents the development of responsibility and initiative. Work may be laid out by the employer's designated supervisor or journeyman based on their evaluation of the apprentice's skills and ability to perform the job tasks. Apprentices shall be permitted to perform job tasks in order to develop job skills and trade competencies. Journeymen are permitted to leave the immediate work area without being accompanied by the apprentice.
Apprentices who have satisfactorily completed the first four years of related classroom training using the NJATC curriculum and accumulated a minimum of 6,500 hours of OJT with satisfactory performance, shall be permitted to work alone on any job site and receive work assignments in the same manner as a Journeyman Wireman.
