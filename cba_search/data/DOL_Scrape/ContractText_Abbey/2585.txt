The Employer and the Union agree that all employees working in classifications listed in Exhibit 1 are properly within the bargaining unit. Any classification established by the Employer not listed in Exhibit 1, where all of the employees’ duties are covered by this Agreement, shall be a part of this Agreement at a wage rate comparable to related job classifications.
(b)	For clarification, “all employees” as used in Subsection 1.01(a) includes workers the Employer may obtain from a temporary labor source, employment agency or other source besides the Employer’s own hiring process regardless of whether the workers are on the Employer’s payroll or that of another entity and regardless of the job classifications or titles assigned to them by another entity, as long as they are performing work at the Employer’s facility that is associated with the classifications listed in Exhibit 1. Temporary workers performing such bargaining unit work are covered by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Employer shall make contril/.'.tions to benefit funds called for by this Agreement for all hours temporary workers perform such bargaining unit work.

The Employer shall not enter into any arrangement with any source of temporary workers unless the Employer has the right under such arrangement to obtain and share with the Union the information described herein and shall terminate any arrangement for temporary workers as soon as it has the legal right to do so if the arrangement does not give the Employer the right to obtain and share with the Union the information described herein.

The provisions of Article 21 may be invoked as to persons employed in such classifications solely for the purpose of processing grievances limited to disputes or differences involving the meaning, interpretation, and/or application of the Articles specified above.

6.01. Cause for Discharge.
(a)	No regular employee or steady extra, after having completed the probationary period under Section 20.01, shall be discharged except for just cause except as provided for in 10.07(a). Prior to any discharge for reasons other than dishonesty, willful misconduct, drunkenness, drinking on the job, being under the influence of a controlled substance on duty, unlawful possession of a controlled substance, or using a controlled substance at any time while on the Employer’s premises, unlawful sale of a controlled substance, refusing to submit to testing for drug or alcohol usage-in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.01(b) of this Agreement, serious improper behavior or discourtesy toward a customer or guest, insubordination, failure to report for work without just cause, or walking off the job during a shift, such an employee must be given a written warning and a reasonable opportunity to correct the deficiency. The above provisions relating to controlled substances will not apply to medicine lawfully prescribed for the employee using the substance by a licensed physician and used in accordance with the prescription. Upon the discharge or suspension of any employee for reasons other than dishonesty, the reason therefore shall be given to the employee in writing, and a legible copy thereof shall be mailed or given to the Union within seventy-two (72) hours after the discharge or suspension. When an employee is discharged or suspended for willful misconduct, the notice shall contain the specific conduct or offense deemed by the Employer to constitute willful misconduct. Upon request by the Union, legible copies of all documents relied upon by the Employer in making the discharge or suspension, including copies of any written complaints or reports concerning the employee, either by a customer, an outside agency, or by the Employer’s own employees, and copies of any relevant cash register tapes, shall be furnished to the Union within three (3) working days after such request. The names and addresses of customers who make written complaints against an employee shall be furnished to the Union on request if such are relied on by the Employer as a basis for discharge or suspension of the Employee. A statement based on a complaint that first appeared on a social media site, e.g., YELP, Trip Advisor, etc., where the guest identifies the employee by name or the company has sufficient information from the social media post and the guest to clearly identify the employee using the Employer systems and/or records, and where the Employer had sufficient information to allow it to contact the guest to verify the guest’s identity may be handled the same way as a written guest complaint For these types of complaints, copy of the social media post., the resulting guest statement, aod the user name associated v ith the post will be provided with the guest ( ontact

information, including email address. An employee may not be discharged solely on the basis of verbal complaints by customers. The Union shall furnish the Employer with copies of its inquiry to guests and of the guests’ responses to any Union inquiry within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt. Copies of videotapes shall also be provided upon request, provided the Employer has the copying capability and if the Union pays the reasonable costs for furnishing the copy.
(b)	Where there is reasonable cause to believe that an employee is under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, or if there is evidence that an employee has directly and actively contributed to an accident that causes property damage or personal injury to the employee or to any other person, such as unusual conduct or a pattern of injuries, the employee, after being notified of the contents of this subsection, must consent to an immediate physical examination at an independent medical facility or suffer the penalty of discharge. The foregoing provision shall not be interpreted to require consent to post-accident testing if, at the time consent is requested, circumstances known to management establish that the accident was caused solely by a reason unrelated to the employee being under the influence.
The Employer shall pay for the cost of the examination, and the employee shall be paid for all time required for the examination. A blood alcohol level at or in excess of the cunent level allowed by law provides an absolute presumption that an employee is under the influence of alcohol. A positive gc/ms blood test result for a controlled substance provides an absolute presumption that an employee is under the influence of the identified controlled substance.
(c)	Employees with less than two (2) years’ service, and Bell Captains regardless of years of service, may be offered by the Company, no later than thirty (30) days following Employer’s receipt of the Union’s demand for arbitration, two (2) months’ pay including the higher of declared or assigned tips in lieu of processing a grievance and arbitrating the discharge.

In the event a positive determination is made, and the Union processes the discharge to arbitration, the arbitration procedure to be used, i.e., either type of expedited procedure or the regular arbitration procedure, shall be determined by the Employer notwithstanding the provisions of Section 21.03(3) and (2).
6.02. Warning Notices.
Warning notices issued to employees must specify the events or actions for which the warning is issued. Warning notices shall be issued to employees as soon as possible after the Employer is aware of the event or action for which the warning notice is issued and has a reasonable period of time to investigate the matter; but in any event, warning notices shall be issued to employees only at the end of a shift. A legible copy of any written warning notice issued to employees shall be mailed or given to the Union within seventy-two (72) hours after its issuance by the Employer. Upon request by the Union, legible copies of all documents relied upon by the Employer in issuing the warning notice, including copies of any written complaints or reports concerning the employee, either by a customer, an outside agency, or by the Employer’s own employees, and copies of any relevant cash register tapes, shall be furnished to the Union within three (3) working days after such request.

An employee may not be issued a warning notice solely on the basis of verbal complaints by customers.

In any dispute over the amount of back pay due to an employee under an arbitration award, the Arbitrator shall have no authority to award any back pay to that employee unless that employee or the Union has affirmatively proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee has fulfilled his/her duty to mitigate damages at all times since his/her discharge.

(f) It is the intent of Bally’s Las Vegas to reasonably enforce its corkage fee policy established to persuade hotel guests not to bring their own food and beverage items on property and to use Bally’s established food and beverage services.
For purposes of this section, a corkage fee may be assessed for cocktail parties/hospitalities where there is a gathering of more than ten (10) persons in a private room or suite in which authorized alcoholic beverages, mixes, glasses, ice or food are delivered.

Bally’s Las Vegas
Management reserves the right to apply the corkage fee in appropriate situations after being investigated by Food and Beverage Management. Under no circumstances is a Room Service Server to negotiate with a hotel guest the issue of corkage fees. The Room Service Server is to immediately advise a Food and Beverage Manager of the situation for further investigation of the remedy. The Food Server will be given the opportunity to accompany the Food and Beverage Manager when investigating the incident, but, shall allow the Manager to effect the settlement with the guest.
A corkage fee will only be assessed in situations where the Room Service Food Server(s) have performed services including: e.g., delivering and setting up glasses, ice, bar, fruits, napkins, stir sticks and general cleanup.
Under no circumstances will a Food Server be entitled to a guaranteed gratuity if no service is provided to the guest.
Room Service Food Server(s) who work the function, shall be paid a gratuity computed on the basis of seventeen percent (17%) of the corkage fee schedule (the applicable Room Service Menu prices less fifty percent [50%]). The seventeen percent (17%) gratuity will be split; four percent (4%) to Room Service Management and thirteen percent (13%) to the Food Servers.
If management acknowledges an event whereby a corkage fee would be assessed to a guest who has a sales contract with the hotel, but does not collect a corkage fee, Server(s) working said event shall receive a one (1) time guaranteed gratuity of seventeen percent (17%), four percent (4%) to Room Service Management and thirteen percent (13%) to the Food Servers, of the uncollected corkage fee not to exceed One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per Server.

All layoffs will be conducted in compliance with the provisions of the Stardust arbitration award of 1997. It is the responsibility of the employee to advise the Employer of a change in either address or telephone number. In accordance with their seniority, employees in layoff status will be offered, but not required to perform (subject to subparagraph [c]), all extra work in their classifications except for banquets or parties, before extra employees are hired, before steady extra employees are offered such work, and, to the extent practical, before regular employees are assigned to work their sixth (6th) day; provided, however, that such employees who are offered and accept extra work shall be paid as extra employees for such work in accordance with Section 10.05, but shall not be covered by the provisions of Section 9.03.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee may declare unavailability for extra work for a definite period while on layoff.
(d)	Employees shall be recalled to their regular job classifications in accordance with the following procedures:
(1)	If a position is restored less than ninety (90) days of when it was eliminated, and if the person who held it is still actively at work, the person is returned to the position, or if the person who held it is on layoff, the most senior person on layoff is recalled to it, ■ except that if multiple oecple on layoff are to be recalled at about the same time to
63
Bally’s Las Vegas
several positions that have been restored or created, and the person who formerly held the position is one of those to be recalled, then the person is returned to his/her former position regardless of the relative seniority among those to be recalled.
	(2)	If a position is restored ninety (90) days or more after it was eliminated, or a new position is created, it is put up for bid. This is true even if the person who formerly held the position is still actively at work. All regular employees may bid, but laid off employees may not bid. If there are no bidders, the most senior person on layoff is recalled to the position and cannot refuse it. (3)	Employees who obtain a position by bidding shall not be eligible for another transfer under this subsection or under Section 20.04(b) for six (6) months. Those who are transferred to a position without bidding remain eligible for transfer under those provisions.

The Employer shall explain to the Union the intended function of the technology, the nature of the technology and who will develop it, the timing of its planned implementation, and the expected work needed to implement the technology and keep it running. If the Union questions or objects to the change, the Employer shall promptly negotiate the foregoing matters with the Union. The Employer shall share prototypes with the Union subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement. The Employer shall not implement any technology unless the Employer has carried out these duties to the Union. (iv)	Any employee laid off due to technological change shall be entitled to recall to the classification from which the employee was laid off for 24 months following the date of layoff and to preference for other job openings, in or out of the bargaining unit, after all other preferences possessed by incumbent employees have been exercised but before new employees are hired, provided the employee is qualified for the position or can be qualified in a reasonable period of time with adequate training provided by the Employer. The preference for jobs other than in the classification and at the hotel from which the
64
Bally’s Las Vegas
employee was laid off shall include all Las Vegas-area Caesars Entertainment hotelcasinos, hotels or condos.
(v)	The Employer and Caesars Entertainment will make all non-supervisory job postings accessible to employees laid off under this subsection and to the union to assist employees in their job searches.
(vi)	While employees are waiting for an offer of a permanent position, the Employer shall offer all available extra work to them in order of classification seniority.
(vii)	If an employee laid off under this subsection is recalled to (A) another position within the Union’s bargaining unit at the Employer, the employee shall retain his or her house seniority and continuous service for vacation purposes, (B) another position within the Union’s bargaining unit at a different Caesars Entertainment property, the employee’s seniority and continuous service shall be determined by application of the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement covering that property, or (C) to a position outside any bargaining unit represented by the Union, continuous service with the Employer shall be recognized for vacation and all other purposes except competitive seniority.
(viii)	No employee who has completed his or her probationary period and is recalled pursuant to this subsection shall be required to complete a new probationary period but if the employee cannot perform satisfactorily the work on the shift or station to which recalled he or she may transfer or be transferred back to his/her former job within thirty (30) shifts after his/her date of transfer.
(ix)	The Employer shall continue to make contributions to UNITE HERE Health at the minimum level necessary to maintain existing benefits under the Plan, less any contributions made for extra hours worked following the date of layoff, for 6 months following the date of layoff.

(xi)	This subsection does not supplant the rale that layoffs must be due to reductions in force. If technological changes reduce the duties of a classification without eliminating them, the classification shall continue in existence but the Employer may adjust staffing levels, or with the agreement of the Union the Employer may distribute the remaining duties to other bargaining unit classifications. If new technologies require human operation of the machines, the machines shall be operated and maintained by bargaining unit employees and the Employer shall train employees in the affected classification to operate and maintain them. The Employer may limit training to those employees who volunteer to be trained. Training opportunities shall be offered in accordance with house seniority among those in the affected classification. The Employer shall allow up to two (2) Union representatives to be present to observe the training but to not participate in it. If operation requires a level of skill which may practically be obtained only through academic study and the necessary courses are offered at Las Vegas-area educational institutions, the Employer shall pay the tuition and fees required for employees who volunteer for this training to take the courses but shall not be obligated to pay for the time employees spend in the coursework. If an employee completes the coursework successfully (average grades at least “C”), the Employer shall offer the employee the work of operating the machine(s) associated with the employee’s former job functions. Such offers shall be for the next permanent positions performing this work following the employee’s completion of the coursework.
20.04. Promotions and Preference for Shifts.
(a)	When the Employer promotes an employee to another classification, the Employer will consider the employee’s seniority, qualifications to perform satisfactorily the work in other classifications, and prior performance, provided that a Food Server, before being promoted to Captain, must have passed the Captain’s examination conducted under the auspices of a committee, at least one (1) member of which shall be qualified and experienced in the craft, shall be designated by the Employer, and provided further, any employee before being promoted to the classification of Bartender must have passed the craft examination for the Bartenders conducted by the Union. Where qualifications to perform the work in the other classifications are relatively equal among employees, the senior employee shall be the one promoted. For purposes of this paragraph (a), a “promotion” shall be a transfer from one classification to another, regardless of any change in compensation. Permanent vacancies to be filled by promotion under this paragraph shall be posted for seventy-two (72) hours near the employees’ time clock or other location to which employees have regular access. The Employer may fill the vacancy temporarily during the posting period. An employee promoted under this Section who cannot perform satisfactorily the work of the job to which promoted shall be transferred back to his/her former job, shift and station within thirty (30) shifts worked after the date of the promotion.
All promotional opportunities within the bargaining unit shall be posted. The Employer will give preferential consideration to qualified bargaining unit employees for these openings. The Employer and the Union agree that the goal is to maximize the availability of promotions for qualified employees. The Employer’s promotion decisions will not be arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory. Employees who successfully complete the Southern Nevada Joint Management Culinary & Bartender Training Fund training program or the Employer’s in-house‘ raining
66
Bally’s Las Vegas
program for a classification covered by this Agreement shall be considered qualified for that classification for purposes of this Section.
(b)	When there is a permanent vacancy, or a temporary vacancy of at least ninety (90) days, on a particular shift or station, employees in the same job classification on other shifts or stations who desire to transfer to the vacancy will be transferred on the basis of their classification seniority, provided that the senior employee desiring transfer is qualified to perform satisfactorily the work on the shift and/or station applied for and that a qualified employee is available to replace the employee desiring to transfer. An employee transferred under this Section shall assume the weekly schedule of days of work and days off, and the daily shift scheduled, applicable to the vacant position to which he/she transfers, and the employee shall not be eligible for another transfer under this Section for six (6) months. An employee transferred under this Section who cannot perform satisfactorily the work on the shift or station to which transferred shall be transferred back to his/her former shift and/or station within thirty (30) shifts worked from the date of transfer. The resulting vacancy or vacancies created by a transfer under this Section shall be filled by the next senior qualified employee(s) from another shift and/or station who desires to work on the shift or station where the vacancy exists.

Where, in a discharge case, reinstatement is ordered by an arbitrator with less than full back pay, the costs of arbitration shall be divided evenly between the parties.
21.	04. Extension of Time Limits.

EXHIBIT 8 - RE: IMMIGRATION
General Principles. The Union and the Employer have a mutual interest in avoiding the termination of trained employees. Accordingly, to the extent not addressed by this Agreement, at the request of the Union, the Employer will meet and discuss issues related to compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act and any other current or future legislation, government rules or policies related to immigrants which impact bargaining unit employees.
(a)	Leaves of Absence.
(i)	In the event that the employer determines that a post-introductory employee cannot or has not provided acceptable documentation of the employee’s right to work in the United States, the Employer shall notify the Union by facsimile or electronic mail. Upon the Union’s request, the Employer shall meet with the Union to discuss the nature of the issue to see if a resolution can be reached. Whenever possible, the meeting shall take place before any action is taken by the Employer, provided, however, the Union acknowledges and agrees that the Employer may take any action at any time which is required to ensure the Employer's compliance with any and all immigration and/or employment authorization statutes, laws, and regulations.
(ii)	The Employer will provide an employee with a least sixty (60) days’ notice that the documents provided by the employee demonstrating work authorization are scheduled to expire and that the employee will need to re-verify their 1-9 documentation and provide valid evidence of continued work authorization. Such notice will be provided to an employee through an electronic message to the employee's account in the Employer’s human resource system. If the human resource system is unavailable, the Employer may provide notice to the employee at the time clock and/or by direct communication from the employee's manager. As part of the Employer’s notification process, whenever possible the Employer agrees to share with the Union the names of employees whose work authorizations are going to expire.
(iii)	Upon request, employees shall be released for up to five (5) unpaid working days during the term of this Agreement in order to attend to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (“USC1S”) proceedings and any related matters for the employee only. The Employer may request verification of such absence.
(iv)	A post-introductory employee who is not authorized to work in the United States and v hose employment has been terminated for this reason shall be immediately
108
Bally’s Las Vegas
reinstated to his or her former classification without loss of prior seniority provided the employee produces proper work authorization within twelve (12) months of the date of termination, and to his or her former shift and station if the employee produces proper work authorization within ninety (90) days of the date of termination. If the employee produces proper work authorization within twelve (12) months from date of termination, the employee would return, without loss of prior seniority, to his or her former classification displacing the least senior employee in that job classification. Employees do not accrue vacation or other benefits based upon particular Plan policies during such absences.
(v)	If the employee needs additional time, the Employer will rehire the employee into the next available opening in the employee’s former classification, as a new hire without retaining seniority, upon the Former employee providing proper paper work authorization within a maximum of twelve (12) additional months from the date the employee notifies the Employer that he or she needs additional time. The parties agree that the employee would be subject to an introductory period upon rehire in such event.
(vi)	The Employer shall grant a leave of absence of up to five years to any post-introductory employee who has lost work authorization status solely as a result of change in DACA, DAPA, or TPS Status. If the employee obtains appropriate work authorization within the five-year period, the employee must provide documentation of the work authorization and return to work within six months after obtaining it or forfeit the leave provided in this subsection. The reinstated employee will displace the least senior employee in the employee’s former job classification. An employee will not accrue vacation or the other benefits based upon particular Plan policies during such absence.
(b)	Change of Status/Immigration. On the day an employee becomes a U.S. citizen, the Employer will compensate the employee with a one (1) time paid personal holiday in recognition of his or her citizenship.
(c)	Reverification. The Employer shall not require or demand proof of citizenship or immigration status, except as required by 8 USC § 1324a or as otherwise required to do so in order to comply with the law. No employee employed continuously since November 6, 1986 or whose circumstances constitute “continuing employment” as defined in 8 CFR § 274a.2(b)( 1 )(viii) shall be required to provide such proof.
(d)	Social Security No Match Letters. Subject to applicable law, in the event that the Employer receives notice from the Social Security Administration (“SSA”) indicating that one or more of the bargaining unit employee names and Social Security Number (“SSN”) that the Employer reported on the Wage and Tax Statement Forms (“Forms W-2”) for the previous year do not agree with SSA’s records, or any other notice of a discrepancy with an employee’s social security number , the Employer shall:
(i)	provide a copy of the notice to the employee and the Union upon receipt;
109
Bally’s Las Vegas
(ii)	not take any adverse action against any employee listed on the notice solely because of the receipt of a no-match letter or other notice of discrepancy; or
(iii)	not require that an employee listed on the notice present a Social Security card for review, complete a new 1-9 form, or provide new or additional proof of work authorization unless the Employer has another basis for requesting verification or re-verification of the employee’s work authorization.
(e)	Workplace Immigration Enforcement. The Employer shall:
(i)	Notify the Union by facsimile or electronic mail within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt of a search and/or arrest warrant, an administrative warrant or subpoena from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), unless it is legally prohibited from doing so.
(ii)	Require DHS to present a search and/or arrest warrant, administrative warrant, subpoena or other legal process prior to conducting official business in the workplace, unless the Employer is otherwise required by law to admit such persons and/or emergency circumstances exist.
(iii)	Permit DHS to inspect 1-9 forms, or documents other than the 1-9 forms, only if and when compelled to do so by a valid written notice, arrest, search and/or administrative warrant, subpoena or other legal process, or as otherwise required by law.
(iv)	If DHS notifies the Employer that certain employees do not appear to be authorized for employment, the Employer will provide the affected employees with the maximum amount of time permitted by law to present documents to establish employment authorization.
(f)	(i) The Employer shall not discipline, discharge, or discriminate against any
employee because of national origin or immigration status, or because the employee is subject to immigration or deportation proceedings, except as required to comply with the law. An employee subject to immigration or deportation proceedings shall not be discharged solely because of pending immigration or deportation proceedings, so long as the employee is authorized to work in the United States. If the Employer is notified that an employee has been detained or incarcerated as a result of pending immigration or deportation proceedings, the Employer will place the employee on unpaid leave of absence for a period of twelve (12) months. If the employee is released and provides appropriate work authorization documentation within the twelve (12) month period, the employee will be returned to work without loss of seniority to his/her former job classification, displacing the least senior employee in that job classification. Employees on leave of absence under this Exhibit 8 (a) shall not accrue vacation or other benefits during the leave of absence.
(ii)	The Employer shall not take any adverse action against an employee because of changes to the employee’s name or social security number, provided that the employee can provide acceptable proof of correct identity and is authorized to work in the United States.
110
Bally’s Las Vegas
(g)	The Union and the Employer agree that this Exhibit 8 shall not be interpreted to cause or require the Employer to violate 8 USC § 1324a or any other applicable law.
EXHIBIT 9 - ATTENDANCE POLICY
Attendance: Being the best means being on time to provide fast and flawless service every shift. If you are excessively absent or late, you create inconvenience for our guests. In addition, it places an unfair burden on co-workers who may have to perform additional work or may be called in on their day off.
The schedule in each department is designed to provide the best guest service. The Attendance policy is designed to be fair and consistent in recording punctuality and attendance.
The Attendance policy is based on a twelve (12) point system. Points are accumulated when an employee is late, leaves early, is absent from work. A total of twelve (12) points in any rolling twelve (12) month period results in Separation of Employment.
It is your responsibility to notify your supervisor at least two (2) hours prior to the start of your shift if you are going to be late or absent. If you do not follow your department call-in procedures, it will result in progressive discipline. Being on time means being at your workstation, fully prepared to begin work at your scheduled start time.
Absences will be recorded as follows:
JINCiDENT^^;"^ > "	<..

SIDE LETTER #3 RE: CROSS-UTILIZATION
The Union and the Employer (the “Parties) agree there is potential merit in permitting bargaining unit employees to work in classifications for which they are qualified at more than one venue within an Employer’s property and at venues at other properties owned and/or operated by Caesars Entertainment on the Las Vegas Strip (“cross utilization”).

The Committee will be assisted by Caesars Entertainment management office with respect to organizations, logistics, planning, deadlines, etc.
The Committee will begin work within ninety (90) days after ratification of the 2018 collective bargaining agreements (“2018 CBAs”) and will report to a joint meeting (or conference call) of the respective leaderships of the Parties every ninety (90) days thereafter. It is the intention of the Parties that the Committee completes its work by making a presentation if its report and recommendations to the respective leaders of the Parties within twelve (12) months form the commencement of its work. The Parties will then have no more than ninety (90) days after the presentation to digest and evaluate the Committee’s report and recommendations. During such ninety (90) day period the Parties may agree to meet on one or more occasions to discuss the report and recommendations.

In addition to the provisions of Article 6, an employee on the Steady Extra Board may be terminated without recourse to Article 21 because the employee fails, refuses, or is unavailable to work more than twenty-five percent (25%) of all daily and weekly shifts made available to him/her in any rolling sixty (60) day period, provided that at least twelve (12) shifts have been made available during that rolling sixty (60) day period.
All Part-Time/On-Call/Steady Extra employees must be available for work at all times until they have worked five (5) shifts or four (10) hour shifts in a week. The following outlines the 25% rule.
(a)	Designated Call Times.
All part time/on call/steady extra employees will be called for all work available during three designated times based on Management’s discretion. The designated time must be posted. If these designated times require changes, the Employer will post a revised notice giving employees at least two (2) weeks’ notice of change. Management may call outside of these designated times in cases of emergency.
If an employee does not answer their phone the manager/scheduler will leave a message.
(b)	Shift Calls Outside Designated Call Times.
For shift calls that occur outside of the designated call times, the manager/scheduler will leave a message and provide a wait time of five (5) minutes before moving on to the next employee, but such time shall be based on business demands and call volumes. Calls made outside the designated call times that are not returned shall not count toward either the 25% or the 12 shifts made available.
(c)	Shift Calls during designated call times.
1.	For shift calls during designated call times, the manager/scheduler will move on after two (2) minutes to the next part time/on call/steady extra employee. If the employee returns the call and a shift is still available, the employee can pick up the shift and not receive a refusal. If the employee does not pick up the shift or there is no longer a shift available, the employee will receive a refusal.
2.	An employee will receive a refusal for a shift if the Employer is unable to reach the employee at the telephone number designated by the employee for contact regarding work and if the employee does not return the phone call within two (2) minutes, or the employee does not qualify for a pass.	,

3.	Employees cannot accrue more than one (1) refusal in a calendar day.

2.	It is the employee’s responsibility to provide a current telephone number to their respective department for purposes of being contacted for work.
3.	There is a minimum of eight (8) hours off between shifts. *For example: If you work a 6p-2a shift you may be called in for a 10am shift the following day.
4.	Employees will be given a minimum of two (2) hours to come in for any shift that they have been called in for. The end time of the shift being filled may not be adjusted after the shift is offered to the employee.
5.	Employees who choose five (5) days are entitled to two (2) days off and will not be issued refusals for offers in excess of five (5) days.
(e)	Pass.
1.	An employee who is offered a shift can pass the offer only if there are part time /on call/steady extra employees below them. In such cases, the pass will not be considered a refusal. However, if the lower part time/on call/steady extra employees are unavailable or refuse offered shifts, additional offers will be made moving back up the list from the bottom up. If an employee is offered a shift on a return call, and is unavailable or refuses such shift, it will be counted against the twenty-five percent (25%) rule.
2.	As referenced, an employee can pass an offered shift, but upon a refusal, the employee will no longer be eligible for shift offers for the remainder of that day. Employee may only receive one (1) refusal per day.
(f)	Peak Periods and Holidays.
