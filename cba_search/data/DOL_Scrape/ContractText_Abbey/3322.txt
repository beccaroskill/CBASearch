Furthermore, teachers will not receive credit more than once for the same course.
All in service courses will be given for fifteen (15) sessions of two (2)
13
hours per session. Each fifteen (15) class hours equals one (1) in service credit. Criteria for qualifying for an in service course will be established by the instructor.
No more than two (2) will be permitted in any one (1) course —late registration is counted as an absence.
In order to start a course, there must be a minimum of fifteen (15) teachers in regular attendance.
Teachers seeking in service credit for courses taken outside the District must request and receive approval prior to attending classes. The request and approval shall be in writing.
Additionally, proof of successful completion of each in service course is required prior to approval to count such credits towards lane changes.
Courses sponsored by organizations such as BOCES, etc., will also be given two (2) in service credits if prior approval is received from the Director in the appropriate area. NDEA, NSF, courses taken under scholarships and foundation grants, and other similar courses for which no official transcript is given, will also be granted two (2) credits of in service credit. Upon approval of a special project by the instructor, it may be designated as a "200" digit course. When an official transcript is given by an accredited university, the number of credits given by the university will be honored.
Verification of the successful completion of such courses must be submitted to the Office of Personnel together with the approved project. Personnel participating in such courses are responsible for the submission of such verification by the instructor.
In the event that such in service credit shall entitle the employee to a lane change, then the Board shall pay such increments retroactive to the date said employee became entitled to the lane change, if such proof of completion is not furnished until some time subsequent to said date. Retroactive payments made hereunder shall not exceed two (2) years.
b.	Student Teacher Assignments

If the grievance involves a dispute as to the interpretation of any provision of the written agreement as it applies to the grievance, either party may request interpretation of the provision of the agreement which is in dispute in an arbitration which shall be final and binding upon the parties thereto only with respect to that part of the Arbitrator's award which decides the issue of interpretation. The Arbitrator shall be so advised.
The appeal shall be taken by submitting to the Arbitrator, via the American Arbitration Association, with a copy to the other party, a written statement signed by the appealing party and which statement shall contain:

The decision shall include a statement of the Arbitrator's findings of fact, conclusions, recommendations and, in the case of
49
binding arbitration, the decision as to interpretation of the provision of the written agreement which is in dispute between the parties.
j.	The Board has the legal responsibility to make a determination in cases of advisory awards. However, the Board pledges to give careful consideration to and be guided by the recommendations of the Arbitrator in exercising this responsibility. Action will be taken within thirty (30) days unless an earlier time limit is indicated by the Arbitrator in his award.

D.	Representation
Any employee may informally present a complaint or grievance orally to the immediate supervisor at any time without being represented. When an employee wishes to present a grievance formally according to the grievance procedure as set forth in the current Agreement in the 1st Stage and in the 2nd Stage, the grievance shall be presented only through representatives designated by the Federation who shall first investigate the circumstances of the grievance prior to its presentation. Thereafter, the employee shall be represented only by Federation designated representatives.

15.	TRANSFERS
Qualified applicants for a position in a building other than the one they are teaching in or from a position in a special field to classroom teacher or vice versa shall be considered by the administration and the position shall be filled in order of system-wide seniority from among candidates with comparable ability.
The Board and the Federation recognize that certain magnet positions, by virtue of their unique nature, require the services of teachers with specialized training or experience. Areas which the Board and the Federation agree will require additional qualifications are as follows:
A.	Dance, drama, media, photography, graphic reproduction, Paideia, Foxfire, Montessori and computer science (such as the programs presently at Gorton, Fermi, King, Emerson and Twain). Such additional qualifications will be developed jointly by the Board and the Federation. Applicants for the above positions will be selected by the Board in order of system-wide seniority from among the candidates who have met the qualifications.
B.	In addition to the above identified magnet positions, the Board and the Federation will continue to meet to consider the establishment of threshold qualifications for magnet and non-magnet positions that may require such specialized qualifications.
51
C.	Facilitators/Trainers, In-House Suspension and Dean positions will be posted but may be filled by the Board without regard to seniority and without regard to whether the individual to be selected has submitted an application.
Teachers who have received twenty (20) hours or more of programspecific training (e.g., 4th grade ELA) shall remain in such positions for one (1) full school year following the completion of such training. By mutual agreement between the teacher and the Superintendent, the requirement to remain in such a position may be waived.
Teachers on sick leave of not more than one (1) year's duration shall continue to accumulate seniority during the period of leave.
In all other leaves of absence, teachers shall retain the seniority acquired at the time of taking leave, and the leave of absence shall not constitute a break in consecutive employment; but teachers who resign their positions and are later re-employed shall lose that seniority acquired before resignation.
In the case of a leave of absence of not more than one (1) year's duration, a teacher shall be entitled to return to the same building and retain his/her seniority status in that building in which he/she was teaching at the time he/she went on leave.
Involuntary transfers may be made only when new buildings open, when an old facility is closed, when staff needs cause a reduction in staff, or when judged to be in the best interest of the school system. Transfers made for the best interest of the school system which supersede seniority shall only be for one of the following reasons:
(1)	To protect the health and safety of the students/teachers.
(2)	To provide students with a unique educational skill or learning experience which cannot be satisfied by a transfer under the seniority system.
(3)	Such other reasons limited to identifiable mutually understood and accepted past practices under transfers made in the best interest of the school system.
Any teacher transferred on the latter basis may appeal the transfer to a committee of three (3) teachers appointed by the
52
President of the Federation and three (3) persons appointed by the Superintendent. Said appeal must be filed with the Superintendent within ten (10) days of the notification of transfer. The decision of the committee shall be binding on all parties. In the event the committee cannot reach a decision, the appeal is referred to the Superintendent whose decision shall be binding.
When it becomes necessary to transfer a teacher, that person in the building or department involved shall be transferred who has least seniority. If the transfer is within the building, building seniority shall apply, otherwise system-wide seniority shall apply.
When system-wide seniority is equal between two (2) or more teachers, seniority shall be judged according to (a) building seniority; (b) tenure area seniority; (c) grade level seniority, in that order, until an inequality develops.
Special Education teachers shall be considered to have separate building seniority which shall be equal to their tenure area seniority.
If two (2) or more teachers have equal seniority after the above steps have been exhausted, the Superintendent shall have the final decision.
When a position is reopened after having been closed for three (3) years or less, the transferred teacher shall be notified and shall be reinstated if he/she wishes to return to that position. In the case of transfers made after the closing of the school year because of temporary or unforeseen changes in school enrollment, the teacher may return to the school from which he/she was transferred provided that a position is open for which he/she is qualified. Should no vacancy occur in the school from which the teacher was transferred, said teacher shall not be required to transfer again for two (2) years unless to do so would require the bumping of a more senior teacher.
Teachers who have attained tenure shall retain their tenure status when they are transferred within the system in the same tenure area.
Probationary teachers who are involuntarily transferred from one tenure area to another shall have their prior probationary
53
service credited toward the completion of their probationary period.
D.	When a special education position is relocated to another building, that person in the building from which the position is being relocated with the least system wide seniority shall be excessed.
When a special education position is relocated to another building and the majority of students do not follow, then this position shall be posted. When a special education class moves to another building and the majority of students follow that class, then the teachers shall follow the class. When a special education Kindergarten class moves, the teacher shall follow the class. In the last two situations, if teachers do not wish to follow the class, they may post out.
When in a building, the number of special education positions remain but the types of special education classes change, then the teachers in that building shall have the right to shuffle within the building for the new classes using system wide seniority.
E.	The parties continue to support the concept that there should be no discrimination against any teachers on the basis of race, color, or national origin. However, recognizing the desirability of achieving as integrated a staffing pattern as possible, the parties agree that a further integration of staff will be achieved by:
(1)	The establishment of no more than twenty-five (25) specific new positions other than those in existence at the end of the 1980-81 school year to which teachers will be assigned to further integrate school faculties on the basis of race, experience and training.
(2)	Waive seniority as a requirement for assignment to said positions for teachers currently employed who elect to apply.
(3)	Transfer to such a position will be under the following provisions:
a.	All assignments to these positions shall be on a voluntary basis.
54
b.	No teacher shall be excessed from a school building as a consequence of such position being created in that school.
c.	No position shall be eliminated in the affected school building as a result of the creation of such a position.
d.	No position shall be eliminated in any other school building as a result of the creation of such a position, other than in those positions as a result of attrition or declining enrollment.
e.	Teachers in such positions shall continue to be subject to all other contractual and legal requirements.

56
June posting shall have the right to select from among any unfilled positions remaining after the June posting plus any new positions which have been made available as a result of the May/June transfers or which have been projected for September but which have not been posted. Such teachers shall be apprised of all available positions by mail during the summer and will respond in writing within the designated time period and will prioritize their selections. Teachers who do not respond to the notice in a timely manner will be deemed to have waived any rights of selection to the position listed and will be assigned.
K.	A teacher who transfers voluntarily in May or June and whose position is eliminated before the commencement of the school year in September shall be given the option to return to his/her previous position or go into the "fishbowl". If the teacher elects to return to his/her previous position, the teacher currently filling such position, if any, shall go into the "fishbowl".
L.	If, subsequent to posting but prior to assigning teachers into posted positions, staffing changes are made which result in a net equal number of qualified teachers and positions in a given building, then no transfers will be made into that building as a result of the postings and the staffing will be accomplished within the school.
If, subsequent to posting and assignment of new teachers into a building, consolidations are made which affect staff in that building, then teachers who are directly affected by the consolidation may elect to claim the previously posted positions for that building, and the incoming teacher whose position is taken shall be given the options described in paragraph K.

19.
ACADEMIC FREEDOM
The nature of American Democracy demands that citizens be able to listen to all sides of a controversial issue, sort out the facts, and arrive at independent conclusions. Students in school, therefore, have a right to be exposed to issues which are within their intellectual grasp and are under current debate in society. This right imposes certain obligations upon the teachers and the administration.
The Board will attempt to employ qualified teachers, to supply them with the necessary teaching materials and to maintain an atmosphere of academic freedom in the schools.
The teachers, individually, will be responsible for determining when and how to deal with controversial issues according to the maturity and abilities of their students and in accordance with current Board policies and will be responsible for the evaluation of their students’ work. This provision shall not be interpreted to preclude the District from adopting new programs. Prior to the implementation of such programs the Superintendent shall consult with the Federation.
The administration shall be available to assist teachers when in doubt as to the appropriateness of certain controversial issues. It shall further have the responsibility of approval of any and all speakers brought into the schools to present a viewpoint to students.
The Board and the Federation agree that the community and the students have the right to expect that controversial issues will be presented in a fair and unbiased nature and the parties agree that they will take reasonable steps to assure this.
20.	QUALITY INTEGRATED EDUCATION

The parties recognize and are of the opinion that the needless interruption of classroom instruction by loudspeaker announcements and messengers is distracting to the educational process. Every effort will be made to minimize the use of messengers and to localize announcements made on the public address system to the specific classroom involved.
All interruptions of regular classroom instruction are to be authorized by the school principal.
B.	Collection of Money
The principal or his/her designee will receive and provide a receipt for monies collected by teachers during the school day.
The principal will determine a method to safeguard the teacher and money when it is collected after the close of the regular school day.

Elementary teachers will be relieved of lunch duty.
I.	Maintenance
No teacher shall be directed to perform custodial functions, such as the cleaning of rooms or furniture, the placing of chairs upon desks, the washing of blackboards, and other such tasks.

It is up to die discretion of die teachers as to whether to use pre-printed plan book or electronic/computer format. A descriptor page agreed upon by the Federation and the District will be provided as a guide for each category.
Planning is a professional responsibility vital to effective teaching. On an individual basis, a tenured teacher not covered by Paragraph 1 above, may be required to produce evidence of short and long term planning. Such tenured teachers may use as evidence of planning syllabi, curricula and/or listing of subject matter or any other appropriate
63
evidence of planning. Such tenured teacher, when asked by an administrator, shall describe the variety of instructional methods he/she will employ to deliver the indicated material/content. Tenured teachers will not be required to submit written lesson plans on a daily or weekly basis. Where, in die opinion of the observer, there exists evidence of insufficient planning, the teacher shall supply evidence of planning for the day observed other than syllabi, curricula, and/or listing of subject matter.
