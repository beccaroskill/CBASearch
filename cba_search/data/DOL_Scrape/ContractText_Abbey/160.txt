The provisions of this Article are intended only to provide the basis for the calculation and payment for overtime and shall not be construed as a guarantee that there will be any overtime'per day or per week. Since overtime payments are a penalty against the Company, all overtime work will be kept to an absolute minimum. Overtime,.
V when required, will be distributed as equitably as practical within Plant A, 'Plant B, Plant C, and the Complex Group, considering the availability of the employees and the nature of the workJ!'|'l | Jj j * \
Maintenance Department overtime availability lists will be compiled dpily foi; Plant "A", Plant *B“, and Plant "C", ; and the Complex Group. Complex Group employees assigned to a plant will indicate their overtime availability in that plant and will be considered a part of that plant's manning for all overtime administration. Employees will declare their availability no later than 12:30 p.m. each dav bv completing an overtime availability sian-uo list Indicating availability for either overtime, callout or both. For callout ov^time. availabirrty can be for either assigned work area, assigned Plant or both. On daily carryover jobs the lowest available man, or men if more than one work group (dassification(s) is required, will continue on the job if the employe^ lias declared availability anywhere in the Lake Charles Complex. Replacement or supplementary manning will be accomplished by using the low available man (or men) in the affected plant (A, B, C, and the Complex Group). Ori carryover jobs starting two (2) or more hours before shift change, employees assigned to the job must be on the job the two (2) or more hours prior to shift change to qualify for the carryover overtime. On weekend carryover the tow available man, or men if more than . one (1) work group is required, will continue on the job and replacement dr supplementary manning willbe accomplished by using the low available man, or men In the affected plant.' Weekend carryover will only be used where continuity is required. Continuity is defined as the need for knowiedgeof the job status, and the work sequence to effectively perform the duties. Availability when declared for, scheduled overtime on regularly scheduled days off will be for a consecutive twenty-four (24) hour period beginning at 11:30 p.m. and ending at 11:30 p.m. on the following calendar day.

It Is understood by both parties that foe implementation of the abovefpnocedure win be done by using the most recent overtime list available.
