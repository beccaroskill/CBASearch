Parties to the Agreement
THIS MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING is made and entered into on July 1, 2002, by and between Authorized Management Representatives (hereinafter referred to as “Management”) of the City of San Diego (hereinafter referred to as “City”), and the San Diego Municipal Employees’ Association (hereinafter referred to as “MEA”).
Purpose
It is the purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding (hereinafter referred to as “Memorandum”), to promote and provide for harmonious relations, cooperation and understanding between Management and the employees covered by the Memorandum; to provide procedures herein for an orderly and equitable means of resolving any misunderstandings or differences which may arise under this Memorandum; and set forth the understanding of the parties reached as a result of good faith negotiations regarding wages, hours of employment and other terms and conditions of employment of the employees covered by this Memorandum, which agreement the parties intend jointly to submit and recommend for approval and implementation.
Meet and Confer
The City and MEA agree to meet and confer during the term of this Memorandum only to the extent required by applicable law, and if agreement is reached in such meeting and conferring, to reduce such agreement to writing, sign and seek any required ratification, implementation, and/or approval.
6
ARTICLE 1
Recognition
Management formally recognizes the MEA as the exclusive representative for all employees in the Administrative and Field Support, Technical, Professional and Supervisory Units. This Memorandum applies to all classifications listed in Appendix A, and to any new classifications added to Appendix A during its term.
No classification shall be removed from the bargaining units exclusively represented by MEA during the term of this Memorandum, and Management shall not entertain any employee petition which seeks removal from this “represented” status.
ARTICLE 2
Implementation
Section 1.
This Memorandum constitutes the mutual recommendation to be jointly submitted to the City Council and/or Civil Service Commission. It is agreed that this Memorandum shall be binding upon the parties upon:
A.	The City Council and Civil Service Commission formally acting by majority vote, to approve and adopt these articles within their respective jurisdictions, and
B.	Ratification by MEA shall be done in a timely manner. MEA shall notify Management of the result of the ratification process no later than June 28, 2002.
Section 2.
The City shall act as soon as possible to make the necessary changes in ordinances, resolutions, rules, policies and procedures to conform to this agreement. Such action shall be completed in a timely manner which will normally be on or before September 3, 2002.
Section 3.
The tentative agreement shall be submitted to the City Council and MEA for their action as soon as possible after agreement has been reached by the Management Team and the MEA.
ARTICLE 3
Term
The term of this modified Memorandum shall commence at 12:01 a.m. on July 1, 2002. This Memorandum shall expire and otherwise be fully terminated at 12:00 midnight on June 30, 2005.
ARTICLE 4
Renegotiation
Section 1.
MEA shall serve upon the City its full and entire written proposals for a successor agreement by March 1, 2005 with the exception of salary or other economic proposals which shall be presented no later than March 15, 2005.

7

ARTICLE 5
Grievance Procedure
I.	Policy
A.	Employees have the right to file grievances without jeopardizing their positions.
B.	Employees may represent themselves or be represented by a steward designated pursuant to Article 6 of this agreement or be represented by MEA at any or all steps in the grievance procedure.
(1)	The employee has the right to the assistance of a steward and/or a MEA representative in the investigation, preparation and presentation of a grievance.
(2)	Employees may have no more than one City employee and one non-City employee as representatives for a grievance hearing. A person not acting as a representative may take notes or observe.
(3)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, an employee in a class assigned to the Administrative and Field Support Unit, the Technical Unit, the Professional Unit, may not select as a representative, an employee assigned to the Supervisory Unit. An employee in the Supervisory Unit may not select as a representative a supervisor in the employee’s chain of command, or a higher ranking supervisor in the same division. This does not apply to stewards.
C.	Grievances may be initiated by the employee, a steward, or by a formally recognized employee organization on the employee’s behalf. If an employee chooses to have representation on any formal grievance concerning a matter that directly involves the interpretation or application of the specific terms and provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding, such representation must come from MEA.
D.	The employee’s, steward’s or employee organization’s first contact regarding job and working conditions is with the immediate supervisor and supervisors shall attempt to settle grievances informally at this level.
E.	A grievance will normally be presented and processed on City time, and a grievant attending a grievance meeting in his/her own behalf on City time will not lose pay. In scheduling the time, place and duration of any grievance meeting, the employee, a steward or MEA Representative and Management will give due consideration to all the participants’ responsibilities in the essential operations of the department. Management has the unequivocable right to schedule grievance hearings as convenient. Hearings may or may not be held during an employee’s normal shift. No overtime pay will be given to the grievant. Representatives, witnesses, or other participants will receive overtime pay if ordered to be present by the appointing authority.
F.	Waivers and Time Limits.
(1)	Failure by Management to reply to the employee’s grievance within the time limits specified automatically processes the grievance to the next level.
(2)	Any level of review, or any time limits established in this procedure, may be waived or extended by mutual agreement confirmed in writing.
(3)	If an employee fails to appeal from one level to the next level within the time limits established in this grievance procedure, the grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of the last decision and the grievance shall not be subject to further appeal or reconsideration.
(4)	By mutual agreement, the grievance may revert to a prior level for reconsideration.
8
(5)	If a grievant fails to appear for a scheduled grievance meeting, such failure without an excuse approved by the appointing authority shall entitle Management to decide on the grievance without the presence of the grievant, or to schedule another meeting at that level (in which case the time requirements for hearing and decision are automatically waived). Failure to appear at two meetings on the same grievance without an approved excuse automatically terminates that grievance and it is deemed denied. The grievance shall then not be subject to further appeal or reconsideration.
(6)	When a grievant is on approved leave the time limits established in this procedure shall be suspended for the period of the leave.
(7)	No grievance shall be finally dismissed for an unexcused failure to appear at a scheduled hearing unless the grievant had been given 24 hours notice of the hearing.
G.	The Management Team shall provide MEA with copies of all grievances regarding this MOU filed by employees, within the MEA Bargaining Units, who choose to represent themselves.
EI. MEA agrees to pursue all claims of violation of this MOU through the grievance procedure. Resort to other remedies shall not be pursued until all steps of the grievance procedure have been exhausted. If the employee or MEA does resort to remedies outside the grievance process prior to its completion, the grievance process is automatically terminated. When MEA feels that an employee may be subject to immediate and irreparable harm, MEA will contact the City Manager’s Office directly prior to initiating some other type of action. MEA will allow the Manager’s Office a reasonable period of time to address such a grievance prior to initiating action outside of the City. Utilization of this procedure shall be deemed to exhaust the grievance procedure.
II.	Definitions
A.	A grievance is a claim or charge of misunderstanding, or difference in interpretation, or violation of provisions of the Civil Service Rules, the Personnel Manual, this Memorandum of Understanding, or Management policy or regulations including but not limited to Administrative and Departmental Regulations, which affect wages, hours, or other terms and conditions of employment.
B.	Actions which are covered in the City Rights Article of this Memorandum are not grievable, but this shall not preclude employees or their representatives from consulting with Management about the practical consequences such actions may have on wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. In addition, actions covered by another appeals process as described in the Civil Service Rules, Personnel Manual, or this Memorandum are not grievable and shall not be processed through this Grievance Procedure.
C.	If the grievance system is abused by an unreasonable number of submittals by one individual or group and which is obviously designed to thwart orderly processing or if the grievances are patently irrelevant, or incomprehensible, such grievances shall be rejected as non-grievable. Such rejection shall be grievable.
D.	Wherever applicable, the term “working days” means the actual work days of the individual on whom the time limits are imposed, excluding Saturday, Sunday and holidays.
III.	Procedures
A.	General
(1)	Management of the department has the responsibility to inform an employee of any limitation of a given level of Management’s authority to fully resolve the grievance. In this regard, Management shall:
(a)	Supply the employee with the necessary information to process the grievance to the proper agency or authority.
(b)	Advise an employee when any matter under submission is determined by Management as not grievable according to the definitions in Section II above. The “grievance” paperwork submitted by the employee shall be returned to the employee along with a memorandum explaining why the matter is not grievable and what alternative procedures, if any, the employee may follow to process his/her complaint. If a grievance is determined to be non-grievable, that decision may be appealed to the next step without reverting to a lower step. A decision favorable to the employee or the MEA in this latter grievance shall serve to reinstate the original grievance in whole. The grievance need not revert to a lower step.
(2)	When a group of identical grievances develop, only one grievance form shall be submitted. The grievants may select not more than two (2) spokespersons who thereafter will be their representative “grievants”. The acceptance of the decision by the spokespersons at any step (or final decision if the grievance moves to the fifth
9
step) will be binding on all parties.
(3)	A grievance shall be recognized if it is brought to the attention of the immediate supervisor either informally or formally within ten (10) working days of the incident’s occurrence, unless an extension was approved by the Labor Relations Manager.
(4)	If the grievance is between the employee and the immediate supervisor, the initial step may be to the next higher level supervisor.
(5)	To be recognized, a grievance must state which policy, rule, regulation, etc., is involved in the matter and the nature of the remedy sought by the employee or MEA. In the event that the grievance is rejected for failure to state which policy, rule, regulation, etc., is involved, it may be amended by the grievant or MEA.
B.	Steps:
Step 1: At the employee’s or employee organization’s sole option, grievances may be presented to the supervisor either orally or in writing. If the complaint is presented orally, the procedure is informal and may be settled by an oral answer given within five (5) working days to the employee and MEA representative. If the grievance is presented in writing, the procedure is formal, a meeting with the grievant and MEA shall be held, and the answer must be given in writing within five (5) working days after the meeting at which the supervisor has been provided the written grievance.
Step 2: If the problem cannot be solved at Step 1, the employee or employee organization may present the complaint in writing to the second level supervisor (if not done at Step 1) within five (5) working days. Within five (5) working days of the receipt of the grievance, a hearing shall be held and the Management representative shall give a written decision to the employee and the MEA representative within 10 working days after the hearing.
Step 3: If the problem is not resolved at Step 2, the employee or employee organization may submit the grievance to the division head within five (5) working days. Within ten (10) working days of the receipt of the grievance, a hearing shall be held and the division head shall give a written decision to the employee and MEA within 10 working days after the hearing. In smaller departments, this step is deleted.
Step 4: If the dispute is not solved in Step 3, the employee or employee organization may present the grievance to the Department Head within five (5) working days. Within ten (10) working days of the receipt of the grievance, a hearing shall be held and the Department Head (or designee) shall give a written decision to the employee or MEA representative within 10 working days after the hearing. In non-managerial departments, this shall constitute the final resolution of a grievance involving Management policy or regulations.
Step 5: Final Resolution of Grievance: If the grievance is still in dispute after Step 4, the employee or employee organization may request a further hearing, which at the discretion of the Management Team will take place before the Civil Service Commission, on matters over which the Commission has authority, or before the City Manager or his designee, by submitting the grievance within five (5) working days. (If it is determined that the hearing should be held before the Civil Service Commission, a fact-finding hearing to define the issues in the grievance will be held by the Personnel Director with the employee and/or employee organization, prior to the date set for the Commission hearing. The grievance may be settled during such fact-finding hearing, if a mutually acceptable solution is developed.) The decision of the Commission shall be issued at its next regularly scheduled meeting following the hearing by the Personnel Director. In grievances answered by the Manager, a hearing shall be held and a written response given within ten (10) working days from the date of receipt of the appeal from the fourth step. The employee or employee organization may only request a hearing before the Civil Service Commission, in matters solely involving Civil Service Rules or the Personnel Manual. In non-managerial departments, this step shall constitute the final resolution of a grievance involving a violation of this M.O.U.
Step 6: Grievances arising out of the disagreement on interpretation or application of this Memorandum shall follow the City-wide grievance procedure. MEA may formally request to continue the grievance, not later than ten (10) days following receipt of the answer at the final step of the grievance procedure (provided it was heard by the City Manager), by serving written notice upon the Management Team. The Management Team will refer the grievance to the City Council for hearing and decision.
ARTICLE 6
Stewards
10
Section 1	- General
MEA may designate stewards to represent employees in the processing of grievances subject to the following rules and procedures:
A.	MEA and Management shall agree to a reasonable number of stewards within each facility.
B.	MEA shall furnish Management representatives on July 1 of each year with a written list identifying by name and assigned work areas all regular and alternate stewards, and the list shall be kept current by MEA.
C.	MEA will designate as stewards only employees who have passed an initial probation period and have been designated as permanent and have a satisfactory as their most recent performance evaluation. MEA will also designate, and the City will recognize, as stewards only employees currently assigned to classifications in the units represented by MEA, as listed in this Memorandum.
D.	Stewards may only function within the boundaries of their City approved area of MEA assignment. Stewards who are not on a current MEA submitted and City approved list of stewards shall not be recognized as stewards by the City and shall have none of the rights or privileges agreed to as a steward.
E.	A steward shall not be transferred, or changed to a different work shift without notifying MEA in advance. A prior notice to MEA shall not be construed as limiting Management in its prerogatives to transfer or change the work shift of a steward.
F.	Failure of a steward to abide by any of the provisions of this section may be cause for the City to revoke recognition of said steward. Prior to taking such action, Management will meet and consult with MEA.
G.	It is recognized by both parties that stewards’ functions are necessary in maintaining sound employer-employee relations on the job.
Section 2	- Handling Grievances
A.	When requested by an employee who has a grievance, a steward, with permission of his or her supervisor, may investigate any grievance in his or her assigned work area and assist in its preparation and presentation.
B.	After notifying and receiving approval of the immediate supervisor, a steward shall be allowed reasonable time off during working hours, without loss of time or pay to investigate, prepare and present such grievances. The immediate supervisor will authorize the steward to leave his or her work unless compelling circumstances require refusal of such permission, in which case the immediate supervisor shall inform the steward of the reasons for the denial and establish an alternate time when the steward can reasonably be expected to be released from his or her work assignment.
C.	When a steward desires to contact an employee at his or her work location, the steward shall first contact the immediate supervisor of that employee, advise the nature of the business, and obtain the permission of the supervisor to meet with the employee. The immediate supervisor will make the employee available promptly unless compelling circumstances prohibit the employee’s availability, in which case the supervisor will notify the steward when he or she can reasonably expect to contact the employee within 24 hours.
D.	A steward’s interview or discussion with an employee on City time will be handled expeditiously.
E.	MEA may appoint a Chief Steward or alternate who may act in instances where a job site steward is not available.

ARTICLE 7
MEA Access
A.	Authorized MEA paid non-City employee representatives may be granted access to work locations in which employees
11
covered hereby are employed, for the purpose of conducting grievance investigations and observing working conditions. Authorized MEA representatives desiring such access to such work locations shall first request entrance from the appropriate Management representative, at which time the authorized representative shall inform said Management representative of the purpose of the visit. The Management representative may deny access to a work location if in his or her judgment it is deemed that a visit will unduly interfere with the operations of the department or facility thereof, in which event the Management representative will recommend an alternative time for the visit within 24 hours unless the Management and MEA representatives mutually agree on an alternative time for the visit. MEA representatives shall not unduly interfere with operations of any Department during a visit. Representatives have the right to meet with employees during authorized coffee, rest or lunch breaks at City facilities as may be available, in compliance with access procedures in this article.
B.	MEA shall, within thirty (30) days of the effective day of this Memorandum, give to Management a written list of all authorized representatives, which list shall thereafter be kept current by MEA. Access to work locations hereunder will be granted only to representatives on the current list.
C.	Authorized MEA representatives may be given access to non-security work locations during working hours to conduct grievance investigations and observe working conditions on the condition that MEA representatives will comply with the regulations established in this Article, and that MEA representatives shall not interfere with work operations of any Department of the City.
ARTICLE 8
Employee Representation
A.	An employee is entitled, upon his or her request, to representation, not to exceed one City employee and one non-City employee during each of the following proceedings. In addition, one observer may also attend if authorized by the Manager’s Office. Under no circumstances shall an employee suffer any retaliation or harassment for his/her requesting such representation.
1.	During any investigatory or fact-finding meeting where there is a reasonable expectation, by the supervisor or the employee, that discipline might result. Such representation is not available in cases requiring immediate removal or suspension as defined in Civil Service Rule XI.

Management shall give an employee, who is notified of a proceeding described in A. above advanced notice, including a reasonable amount of time to consult with his/her representatives and to prepare a response. (At the time of notice, Management shall also inform such an employee of his or her right to representation.) An employee shall have the right to contact a representative for this purpose by the reasonable use of City facilities and while on City time so long as said contact does not unduly interfere with the operation of the Department or facility.
D.	The City employee representative shall not be an employee subject to the same investigation or fact-finding.

ARTICLE 10
Personnel Practices
A.	Employee Personnel Files
1.	An employee, or an MEA representative with the written consent of the employee, may inspect the employee’s personnel files. The request to inspect files shall be granted at a time that is convenient to both Management and the employee. The inspection shall be made in the presence of an appropriate supervisor. If requested by the employee, copies of the record, or any portion thereof, may be provided to the employee, or anyone designated by the employee. Charges for these copies may be made in accordance with Administrative Regulation 95.20, Pricing and Furnishing City Documents.
2.	An employee shall be entitled to read any statement on his or her work performance or conduct if such statement is to be filed. The employee shall acknowledge reading such material by affixing his or her signature on the actual copy to be filed, with the understanding that said signature merely signifies that the employee has read the material to be filed and does not necessarily indicate agreement with its content. If the employee refuses to sign, the supervisor will sign, noting the refusal of the employee to sign.
No disciplinary documents will be placed in an employee’s permanent personnel file unless the procedure in paragraph 2 is followed. Any documents placed in the employee’s file in violation of this provision will be removed at the employee’s request.
B.	Commendations
1.	All written commendations initiated by City Management shall be placed in the employee’s permanent personnel file.
2.	An employee may request that all commendations may be entered as a permanent part of an employee’s personnel file. Commendations may include such items as letters from the public, suggestion awards, educational or training honors, and civic club presentations.
C.	Vacancies
Neither party shall intimidate or encourage qualified eligibles from a certification list to waive appointment. Waivers shall be an employee decision only and shall normally be submitted in writing by the employee. Violations of this Section shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
D.	Dismissal During Probation
Probationary employees in classifications in these Units shall normally receive at least five (5) working days notice of dismissal during probation, either through the performance report or other written notification.
E.	Performance Reports
1.	Performance Reports will normally be given to the employee within 14 calendar days after the close of the rating period. However, in no case shall the Department give a performance report to an employee later than 30 working days after the close of the rating period without the prior approval of the City Manager’s Office or non-managerial Department Head. Approval is required for the presentation of the performance report more than 30 working days after the due date, not for the content of the report. Failure to obtain such prior approval gives rise to a grievance which MEA may present directly to the City Manager’s Office or to the non-managerial Department Head.
Employees will be informed when permission has been granted to give a performance report later than 30 working days after the close of the rating period.
The approval for late Employee Performance Reviews shall be submitted to the employee in writing, and shall include reasons for the delay and approval.
An “annual” performance report should not be prepared if the employee’s performance has already been evaluated in
14
“supplemental performance reports” for the entire period which the “annual” would otherwise cover, as such an additional “annual” report would be unnecessarily cumulative. Where there has been one or more “supplemental performance report(s)” during the year, however, an “annual” report shall not re-state the information otherwise covered by the “supplemental(s)”, but may make a simple reference to the fact of the “supplemental(s)” having been issued during the year. Moreover, the rating on the “annual” report shall fairly and accurately describe the overall performance of the employee during the months actually being described and evaluated in the “annual” report and the fact of any “supplemental(s)” having occurred during the year shall not dictate or predominate in deciding the employee’s rating. It is the intention of the parties to give an employee the opportunity to overcome the deficiencies noted by way of a “supplemental” and to achieve an improved rating at the time of an “annual performance report.”
2.	Rating Performance Reports: Raters should remember that Employee Performance Plans are developed for positions, not personalities; that they should rate job performance, compared to the expected performance standards.
Raters should assemble and review data gathered on an employee’s performance throughout the rating period, such as production records, observations, draft documents, work product, commendations, citizens complaints, and similar tangible evidence.
The basis of evaluations should concentrate on facts and concrete instances of performance. Raters should focus on performance throughout the rating period, not merely on recent experience.
An employee shall only be rated by the immediate supervisor. If the first line supervisor is unavailable, the next higher level supervisor will be the rater. The rater should consult with the OCA supervisor(s) during the rating period for input.
The City agrees to a joint committee with MEA to discuss guidelines and training related to the incorporation of performance-based measurements into Employee Performance Reviews. MEA shall have three representatives on this committee.
3.	Supervisor-Employee Conference: The supervisor should point out the employee’s progress in performing job functions and meeting performance standards, achievements, areas in which improvement is necessary, why they are needed, how they can be accomplished with the supervisor’s assistance, as well as any other performance information considered to be important.
4.	Issuance of Less than Satisfactory Reports: Supervisors should provide regular feedback to their employees during the rating period. In instances where improvement is needed, the supervisor should provide guidance and assistance on how to improve so as to allow the employee an opportunity to raise his or her performance level to satisfactory.
If it is determined that an employee will be issued a less than satisfactory performance report, the employee shall be provided reasonable advance notice for the purpose of obtaining representation. However, this shall not be construed so as to require Management to delay issuance of a less than satisfactory performance report past an employees probation period or transfer trial period end date.
An overall performance rating of Below Standard or Unsatisfactory shall include written comments as to what remedial action was discussed, what corrective action (such as warnings or other discipline) may have been taken, and a follow-up review date within 90 days where appropriate.
In reviewing less than satisfactory performance reports, the appointing authority should determine if reasonable efforts have been made to assist the employee to become a satisfactory employee.
5.	Employees who are on light duty shall still be evaluated. The light duty assignment will not interrupt or suspend the normal rating period for Employee Performance Reports. The usual performance standards shall be utilized for the time period that the employee was performing the full range of duties. For the period of time during which the employee is on light duty, the evaluation will cover the performance of the employee while on light duty. This may be done in a simple narrative form as an addendum to the usual form.
6.	The rating period for an Employee Performance Report shall not exceed twelve months. The department will not retroactively evaluate employees beyond a 12-month period.
F.	Citizen Complaints and Route Slips
Employees will be notified of any citizen complaint or route slip in which they are identified by name or in which they can be identified by Management from the information received. If the complaint is resolved in the employee’s favor, the complaint, together with all related documents, shall be removed immediately from the employee’s personnel file(s), unless the employee requests in writing that the document be retained.
15
G.	Transfer and Promotion
Any employee receiving and accepting an offer of promotion or transfer will be released from the employee’s current position in a timely fashion as mutually agreed by the appointing authority and the employee.
H.	Access to Information Regarding Employment
MEA may bring to the attention of the City Manager, or his or her designee, the identity of any work location where employees do not have reasonable access to documents which affect or describe their terms and conditions of employment, including but not limited to this M.O.U.; the Personnel Manual; Civil Service Rules; Departmental Instructions; Policies and Regulations; and relevant sections of the City Charter and Municipal Code. The Manager shall make a reasonable effort to remedy the situation in order that all employees have reasonable access to these documents.
I.	Fact Finding
Management shall give an employee sufficient notice of its desire to conduct a fact-finding session so as to allow the employee to obtain representation if he or she chooses.
Employees will normally receive written notification of the results of any fact finding interview within 30 calendar days of the interview. Employees not receiving such notification may request through the City Manager’s Office, the results of the fact finding. Such results shall be made available to the employee unless the City Manager determines that extraordinary and extenuating circumstances require additional time in which case the employee will be given the reasons additional time is required and a projected date for conclusion of the fact finding process.
No fact-finding session will be tape-recorded without the express consent of all parties present in the session. If a tape is made pursuant to such consent, the party who makes the tape will provide a copy, within one working day, to any participant in the session who requests it.
J.	Skelly Rights
Management agrees to follow appropriate procedures during any Skelly hearings prior to the imposition of a suspension, reduction in compensation, demotion or discharge as outlined in Civil Service Rule XI.
K.	Merit Increase
Department management will maintain records of merit increase recommendations and will notify employees in writing of decisions to recommend denial of merit increases.
L.	Duplication of Discipline
The City agrees that if an employee is disciplined for a specific act, that said discipline shall be final for the particular act once the appeal process is complete.
This does not preclude the City from considering this discipline as part of the progressive disciplinary and employee performance evaluation processes should any future discipline be necessitated.
M.	Notice of Appointment with Terms
After a person is appointed to a position from an official Personnel Department Certification, the City shall provide the person with a notice which indicates the person’s official appointment date, his or her job status, the starting salary and salary step upon appointment and length of probation.
N.	Equity in Access to Opportunities
1.	Opportunities
Departments will ensure that training, out-of-class assignments, special assignments, and committee assignments will be offered fairly to division employees.
Departments will also ensure that clerical employees will have equal opportunity to participate in appropriate citywide or departmental meetings and committees, special events, awards ceremonies and other functions.
2.	Communication
To the extent practical, Departments will communicate with employees about general criteria used for promotions
16
and how they can better prepare themselves within their current classifications for promotions or career advancements. Such communications may be made through department or City publications, during staff meetings, or through special conferences with all employees.
O.	Clerical Career Path and Futures Committee
The City and MEA recognize the changes occurring in the clerical and support classes due to the new technologies that have been implemented or will be implemented within various departments. In order to avoid a crisis when the time of lull implementation comes, the following committee is being proposed.
The City agrees to a joint committee with MEA to discuss how to expand current and future career paths for the clerical and the data processing occupational groups. In addition, the committee will study the projected future usage for these classes and develop a proactive plan which will analyze future demands, training and skills that will be needed and make recommendations on transition classification issues the departments or employees may have.
The composition of the committee will be determined jointly by Management and MEA.
ARTICLE 11
Use of City Facilities
A.	The MEA may, with the prior approval of the Management Team, be granted the use of City meeting room facilities during non-work hours for meetings of City employees provided space is available, and provided further, such meetings are not intended for organizational activities or membership drives of City employees.
B.	Solicitation of membership and activities concerned with the internal Management of the MEA such as collecting dues, holding membership meetings, campaigning for office, conducting elections, and distributing literature to individual employees, shall not be conducted during working hours.

Bulletin Boards
The City will furnish, for the exclusive use of MEA, adequate bulletin board space at reasonable locations. Additional bulletin board space or locations may be made available by mutual agreement as additional changes occur in work site locations during the year. MEA representatives shall have access at any time to the bulletin boards. The boards and only these designated boards shall be used only for the following subjects:
A.	Information on MEA elections and the results, Stewards’ reports and notices.
B.	Reports of official business of MEA, including reports of committees or the Board of Directors.

Payroll Deductions and MEA Dues
17
A.	It is agreed that MEA dues shall be deducted bi-weekly by Management from the salary of employees when authorized by Section VI (B) of the Employer-Employee Relations Policy who file with the City a written authorization requesting that such deductions be made. Remittance of the aggregate amount of all fees shall be made to MEA by Management biweekly at the conclusion of each pay period in which said fees and deductions were deducted.
B.	Dues shall be for a specified amount and shall be made only upon the voluntary written authorization of the employee. The authorization or cancellation of fees shall be made upon clearly marked cards provided by MEA.
C.	When an employee is in a non-pay status for an entire pay period, no dues withholding will be made to cover that pay period from future earnings nor will the employee deposit (with the City) the amount that would have been withheld if the employee had been in a pay status during that period. In case of an employee who is in a non-pay status during only a part of the pay period and the salary is not sufficient to cover the full withholding, no deduction shall be made.
D.	MEA shall indemnify, defend, and hold the City of San Diego harmless against any claims or suits instituted against the City of San Diego contesting the check-off of dues. In addition, MEA shall refund to the City any amounts paid to it in error upon presentation of supporting evidence.

In the event of any concerted action authorized by MEA which encourages employees to withhold their services to the City, the City Council has the right, by resolution, to immediately cease the collection and remittance of dues and other deductions to MEA. Before invoking its rights under this paragraph, the City will notify MEA of its intention and meet to discuss the matter if requested by MEA.
F.	Upon request, the Personnel Department shall provide a list of new employees (department and classification).
G.	Such payroll authorization deduction form may, at the election of MEA, include a provision that the authorization is for a specific term. Under no circumstances will the City be required to enforce this provision.

ARTICLE 15
Presidential Leave
The parties agree to a Presidential Leave Program for the President of MEA with the following elements:
1.	The President will remain a full-time City employee receiving a salary equal to the salary the President is receiving at the time he or she takes office. This amount will reflect the base pay the President receives as calculated for retirement purposes and will not include any add-ons that are not part of the retirement calculation. During Presidential Leave, the President will receive raises commensurate to the raises of employees in his or her classification.
18
2.	The President will maintain all the rights and benefits of a City employee. During normal work hours the President shall be subject to all applicable provisions of law, including all the policies and procedures of the City, all terms and conditions contained in this Memorandum of Understanding, and the affidavit of adherence referenced in paragraph 7 below. Normal work hours means 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, or an equivalent schedule approved in advance by the City Manager.
3.	The President will be covered by the City’s Workers’ Compensation Plan for any injuries incurred while the President is performing representational activities during normal work hours as defined in paragraph 2 above. Worker’s compensation benefits will not cover travel time to and from the President’s home to his or her primary workplace, or to and from social activities from any location, but will cover travel time to or from representational meetings during normal work hours.
4.	MEA will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City, and its employees and agents, for any liabilities, including costs and attorneys’ fees, resulting from any conduct by the President in violation of any federal, state, or local law, or any City policy or procedure, including but not limited to Council Policies, Administrative Regulations, Personnel Regulations, Administrative Manuals, or Department Directives, Policies and Procedures.

7.	The Union President may enter Presidential Leave by providing a notice of such election to the City Manager/Labor Relations Office and executing an affidavit of adherence to the provisions of Presidential Leave outlined above.
ARTICLE 16
Rest Periods
A.	The City of San Diego and MEA jointly endorse the practice of progressive management which recognizes that regular, authorized rest periods are beneficial both to employees personally and to the productivity of the organization.
B.	Subject to work assignments and departmental requirements, department heads are authorized and encouraged to allow rest periods for employees within the limits of the policy outlined below:
1.	Two 15-minute rest periods (including “travel time” if the employee leaves the work area) shall be allowed during each 8-hour workday (“travel time” means pedestrian travel or travel in the employee’s private vehicle). Employees working less than an eight-hour work day shall also be given rest periods near the end of each consecutive two hours worked, including overtime, except in situations where public safety, public health or emergencies exist.
2.	Subject to work assignments and department requirements, a rest period or a meal break should be allowed near the end of each two-hour period of work including overtime.
3.	Since the purpose of granting the privilege of rest periods is to give relief from mental and/or physical fatigue, and consequently, to improve productivity, the following practices shall not be allowed:
a.	Combining two or more rest periods into one rest period;
b.	“Saving” rest period time to justify extended lunch hours or shortened workdays;
c.	Accumulating rest period time from day to day;
d.	Applying rest period time to compensatory or other time off, or in the considerations or computations concerned with overtime compensation.
ARTICLE 17
19
Work Schedules
1.	If Management desires to make a change in work schedules, or geographic locations, Management will notify the employee five (5) work days in advance of the proposed change. The notice will be in writing and state the reasons for the proposed change. In emergency situations, Management will not be required to give a five (5) day notice prior to changing a work schedule or location. The downtown area around the City Administration Building is considered one geographic location.
2.	Any changes in the method of assigning employees to shifts or significant changes in work schedules shall be subject to meet and confer. MEA may consult with Management on other matters that affect hours of work.
3.	Shift Preference - Any employee who wishes to change to a different work schedule or shift within his/her department may submit such request in writing to the department’s personnel section or the authority who has the power to render a decision in these matters. Such requests will be considered by Management prior to filling a vacancy in the employee’s position on the desired shift. In the event two or more employees are equally qualified to transfer to a vacant position and desire to do so, the employee with the most seniority in the department will normally prevail. Management may select other than the most senior in the event there are valid bona fide reasons. Seniority in this instance is defined as the longest continuous service in the class in the department. In the event two or more employees having the same length of service in the class in the department desire the vacant position, the tie shall be broken by overall City service.
Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the authority of Management to make temporary assignments to different or additional locations, shifts or work duties for the purpose of meeting emergency situations over which the department has no control. However, such emergency assignments shall not extend beyond the period of such emergency.
4.	Any violation of this policy shall be grievable.
5.	Subject to Section 2, departments with the concurrence of the City Manager, have within their authority the right to modify their work schedules. MEA may meet with appointing authorities to discuss alternate work schedules and job sharing.
6.	Definitions:
A.	Workday is the number of hours an employee is scheduled to work in a 24-hour period.
B.	Workweek is a period of 168 consecutive hours (seven consecutive 24-hour periods) as determined by the appointing authority.
C.	Scheduled workweek is the employee’s predetermined number of hours per workday and workdays per workweek as established by the appointing authority.
D.	Thirty days prior to a Saturday or Sunday holiday, MEA and Management shall review the scheduling method for City departments. Efforts will be made to reduce scheduling disruption and employee inconvenience.
7.	Management agrees that alternate work schedules (36/44) will be implemented for all MEA represented employees in the Police Department who wish such alternate work schedule.
The alternate schedules, will be reviewed under the same conditions as the other existing alternate work schedules in the Police Department.
8.	Schedule alternatives to the traditional eight-hour day, five day week, such as the 4/10 or 44/36 schedules, may be approved for implementation based on justifications identifying operational efficiencies, productivity improvements or enhanced customer service. They may also be approved in cases in which there is no harm to departmental efficiency, productivity or costs, but will result in benefits for employees. Employees who telecommute may be eligible for alternative work schedules at the discretion of the Appointing Authority. Employees who work alternate work schedules may be eligible to telecommute at the discretion of the Appointing Authority.
9.	When the need to work outside normal or scheduled work hours is identified and authorized, and when Management directs the employee to adjust his or her work schedule to avoid overtime expense, Management will notify the employee, in writing, at least five (5) work days in advance of any directed schedule change.
When proper advance notice has been given, Management will then work with the employee to determine how the work schedule will be adjusted within the pay period to meet the needs of both the City and the employee.
In the event that five work days advance notice has not been given, whatever the reason, Management shall authorize overtime in accordance with Article 18, Annual Leave/Compensatory Time Off; Article 56, Overtime; and Personnel
20
Regulation, H-4; Overtime Compensation.
10.	The City and MEA agree to continue to discuss the implementation of alternative work schedules and new shifts in MWWD and Water with implementation occurring no later than January 1, 2003.
ARTICLE 18
Annual Leave and Compensatory Time Off
1.	Appointing authorities are responsible for arranging scheduled annual leave for vacations so that adequate personnel are available to carry on necessary City work.
2.	Insofar as is practicable, employees should be permitted to schedule annual leave for vacations and compensatory time off at times most acceptable to the employee. Annual leave for vacations shall be selected by employees within each division, section, or unit, as is applicable, based upon their seniority by class within the Department. Employees who are transferred at their request, or promoted, may be required to modify their scheduled annual leave or comp time off for vacations.
3.	Employees should be encouraged to take regular annual leave vacations but they shall not be required to take annual leave vacations against their will. Employees may accumulate annual leave time in accordance with this agreement.
Compensatory time shall be reduced to 45 hours as of June 30 each year unless an exception is granted by the City Manager’s Office. This time frame may be modified in exceptional circumstances. Compensatory time may be accumulated up to a maximum of 120 hours during the fiscal year as long as the above provisions are complied with. However, based on workload and operational considerations, Department Heads or their designees may set a lower midyear accumulation limit after meeting and discussing the proposed limit with MEA.
4.	Any existing annual leave vacation scheduling method that is satisfactory with the employees shall remain in effect for the duration of the contract. This is in lieu of the above mentioned scheduling method.
5.	Effective July 1, 1991, the maximum accumulation of annual leave for employees with 15 or more years of service is 700 hours. For employees hired after July 1, 1993, the maximum accumulation of annual leave is 350 hours.
Employees are eligible to receive “payment-in-lieu” of annual leave regardless of the total number of annual leave hours the employee has accrued at the time of the request, up to a maximum payment of 125 hours per fiscal year.
Cease to Accrue Provision: Employees who reach their maximum permitted accumulation of annual leave on their anniversary date shall cease to accrue additional annual leave. Employees who expect to be in this situation may submit a written plan by which to reduce excess leave which will include time off and pay-in-lieu up to 125 hours per fiscal year as necessary. If the Appointing Authority denies the specific time off requested and provides no alternative time off which is acceptable to the employee, this cease-to-accrue provision shall not apply until such time as the employee is granted and takes the time off. It is the City’s intent to accommodate employees’ requests to use annual leave and avoid any loss of this benefit.
6.	Leave provisions included under items 7 and 8 below will be accounted for separately.
7.	Pre-approved annual leave, sick leave, or compensatory time off properly used for personal, family or dependent illnesses should not be subject to disciplinary action.
8.	Approved unscheduled annual or sick leave properly used for family, dependent or significant other/co-tenant illnesses shall be considered as a separate category when reviewing employee performance with regard to attendance and/or absenteeism issues and shall not be subject to disciplinary action. Should the City, for good and sufficient reasons, determine that an employee is abusing this leave provision, the appointing authority may request a bona fide doctor’s statement from the employee to substantiate the leave request(s). Failure to provide documentation, by a mutually agreed upon date, to the appointing authority may be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with the City’s Personnel Regulations.
9.	Criteria to be considered in determining leave abuse shall not be limited to stated department/division numerical standards, and must include, but not be limited to, length of service, prior attendance record throughout City career, reason for absence, past performance reports, harm to the work unit, leave balances, past discipline, as well as job classification and working conditions.
If disciplinary action for employee leave abuse under this article is proposed which deviates from this criteria, the appointing authority or designee must obtain prior approval from the Labor Relations Manager.

Retirement
27
High One-Year Basis for Final Compensation
Retirement benefits for General Members shall be based upon the “highest one-year” annual base compensation.
Retirement Contribution Offset
The City agrees that it will apply an amount that is approximately equal to 5.4% of the base salary of employees covered by this agreement and 7.3% for eligible Lifeguards and Harbor Patrol Officers in the City Retirement System, thereby reducing the amount deducted from employees’ paychecks as the employees’ retirement contribution by that amount. Effective July 6, 2002, the City will increase the amount it pays to offset the employees’ retirement contribution, which offset reduces the amount deducted from employees’ paychecks, from 7.3% to 9.0% for eligible Lifeguards. Effective July 5, 2003, the City will increase the amount it pays to offset the eligible Lifeguards retirement contribution from 9% to 10%.

These retirement offset increases will remain in effect until the Employee Contribution Reserve is exhausted. The employee, upon termination, will have no vested right in the amount so contributed by the City. Substitution of this portion of the employees’ contribution by a City payment will not decrease the total amount applied towards the required retirement contribution, and will not affect retirement benefits. Provided, however, such payment shall not exceed any employees’ total contribution to the system.
IRC Section 415 Amnesty Provisions
In order to preserve CERS’ tax qualified status, MEA and the City mutually agree to adopt the “amnesty” or “grandfather” provisions of IRC Section 415 (b) (10), and agree to meet and confer regarding “make-up” provisions.
2002 Benefit Changes
The City and MEA, having met and conferred, have agreed to benefit improvements to the City Employees Retirement System for health eligible retirees.
1.	Effective July 1, 2002, a Health Eligible Retiree, as defined in the Municipal Code, will have the applicable Medicare eligible or non-Medicare eligible insurance premiums paid for the Health Eligible Retiree-only insurance, or the Health Eligible Retiree will be reimbursed the actual cost incurred from the Medicare eligible or non-Medicare eligible retiree-only premium up to the maximum amount allowed in Municipal Code Division 12. Municipal Code Division 12 will be amended to set the maximum amounts to be paid on behalf of or reimbursed to a Health Eligible Retiree for retiree-only Medicare eligible or non-Medicare eligible health insurance premiums based on the premium for the City-sponsored PPO plan for Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 and annually adjusted thereafter based on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Office of the Actuary, projected increase for National Health Expenditures for the full year period ending in the January preceding the start of the new plan year; such adjustment shall not exceed 10% for any given year. The maximum amount of monies reimbursed to Health Eligible Retirees will be 100% of such Medicare-eligible or non-Medicare eligible retiree-only premium. Pursuant to this provision the based monthly maximums are established for FY 2003 as follows:
a)	For Non-Medicare eligible retirees: $489.16
b)	For Medicare eligible retirees: $460.67
Health Eligible Retirees may choose to participate in a City sponsored health insurance plan or any other health insurance plan of their choice
Additionally, the Retirement System will reimburse the Part B Supplemental Medical Expense Premium for those Health Eligible Retirees enrolled in Medicare.
2.	The Disability Income Offset provision is eliminated. There will be no reduction of retirement benefits if the retiree has other income.
3.	A five year purchase of service credit provision is established effective January 1, 1997. Under this provision, the Member may purchase up to five years of service credit by paying both employee and employer contributions in an amount and manner determined by the San Diego City Employees Retirement System Board to make the System whole for such time. In addition, members retiring on or after January 1, 1997, may purchase probationary periods, military and veterans code leaves, waiting periods for the 1981 Pension Plan, actual time worked hourly or part time, special leaves without pay occurring prior to January 1, 1997, the difference in time between part time and full time prior to January 1, 1997, long term disability, vocational rehabilitation maintenance (VRMA) and temporary total disability (TTD), FMLA periods, special leaves of absence with job to be saved periods and any period preceding reinstatement by the Civil Service Commission following a termination appeal.
4.	A Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP) is established effective April 1, 1997. DROP provides an alternative form of benefit accrual while allowing a Member to continue working for the City. During the DROP period, a DROP Member
28
retains all rights, privileges and benefits of being an active City employee, except as specifically modified in the DROP Plan Document, and is subject to the same terms and conditions of employment including disciplinary actions up to and including termination. The Member continues to be eligible for the active employee Flex Benefits Program for the classification and is not eligible for “retiree” health benefits until such time as the Member completes or terminates the DROP period. Under DROP, a monthly service retirement allowance along with any COLA increases, Supplemental Benefit checks and any adjustments to such payments applicable to retirements effective on the date the Member entered the DROP are deposited into a trust account. These SDCERS benefits are calculated as if the Member were retiring on the date the Member enters the DROP. The Member’s contributions to the Retirement System cease. The Member and the City each contribute 3.05% of the Member’s salary each pay period that the Member participates in the DROP. The Member’s contribution is made on a pre-tax basis pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 414(h)(2). These monies are placed in a trust account and are distributed to the DROP participant upon termination of employment or completion of the DROP period whichever occurs first. No withdrawals may be made from the DROP account until the Member completes or terminates his or her DROP period. Interest will be credited to the Member’s DROP account at a rate determined by the Board. The Member is 100% vested in the DROP from its inception.
A DROP participant who becomes disabled may apply for conversion of their deferred retirement allowance to a disability allowance calculated at the date of entry into the DROP. A Member who participates in DROP irrevocably designates a specific consecutive period of months for participation, not to exceed sixty months. The Member must terminate City service at the end of the designated period.
5.	For retirements effective on or after January 1, 1997, the 50% continuance is available to the spouse to whom the Member was married on the date of retirement. The requirement that the member be married to his or her spouse at least one year prior to retirement for the spouse to receive the 50% continuance is eliminated.
6.	The surviving spouse of a Member who is killed while in the performance of duty is entitled to continued health coverage as provided in California Labor Code Section 4856.
7.	The Industrial Disability Benefit for General Members is increased from 33-1/3% to 50% of final compensation for retirements effective on or after January 1, 1997.
8.	The modified special death benefit provided to the surviving spouse of a Member killed in the line of duty is amended to eliminate the requirement that the benefit be discontinued if the spouse remarries. Any benefit terminated to such spouse as a result of remarriage shall be reinstated effective January 1, 1997.
9.	MEA General Members:
A.	Change of Retirement Calculation Factors for City General Members
The Retirement Calculation Factors used to calculate a General Member=s Allowance will increase to the levels shown below (the "New Factors") for all retirements effective on or after July 1, 2002, unless the General Member elects, before retirement, to have his or her Allowance calculated using the Old Factors (2% @ age 55, etc., with 10% added to the Member's Final Compensation) or the Corbett Factors (2.25% @ age 55, etc.). The New Factors will apply to all City employees who join the Retirement System after June 30, 2002, and their Allowances will be capped at 90%. The 90% cap will also apply to: (1) General Members who joined the Retirement System on or before June 30, 2002, except as provided below, and (2) General Members who participated in the Retirement System on or before June 30, 2002, who left City employment but are rehired by the City on or after July 1, 2002.
Retirement Age	Benefit
55-59	2.50%
60	2.55%
61	2.60%
62	2.65%
63	2.70%
64	2.75%
65 and older	2.80%
Any General Member whose Allowance as of July 1, 2002 is 90% or more using the New Factors may continue to accrue benefits above the 90% cap until December 31, 2002. The General Member's Allowance will be capped at that time.
1.	Any General Member who joined the Retirement System before July 1, 2002 may continue to accrue benefits above the 90% cap using either the Old Factors or the Corbett Factors. If the Member selects one of these options, the Member's Allowance will not be capped, and the System will refund to the Member, at retirement, any excess contributions the Member made to fund the New Factors.
29
2.	Any General Member who joined the System before July 1, 2002, and reaches the 90% cap by choosing the New Factors, may continue to accrue benefits above the 90% cap until December 31, 2002, at which time the Member's retirement calculation factor and Creditable Service are capped; the Member's Final Compensation is not capped. On January 1, 2003, the Member must choose one of the following options:
a.	If the Member is eligible for a service retirement on January 1, 2003, he or she may:
i.	continue working and contributing to the Retirement System,
ii.	enter DROP, or
iii.	retire.
b.	If the Member is not eligible for a service retirement on January 1, 2003, he or she may:
i.	continue working and contributing to the Retirement System, or

53	2.80%	3.00%
54	2.90%	3.00%
55+	2.99%	3.00%
Member Option: Pursuant to the class action settlement, a Lifeguard Member may choose, upon application for retirement, one of the following two options:
(1)	The Retirement Calculation Factor in effect on July 1, 2000 with no change in the Lifeguard Member’s Final Compensation OR
(2)	A ten percent (10%) increase in the Lifeguard Member’s Final Compensation, with the Lifeguard Member’s Unmodified Service Retirement Allowance calculated using the Retirement Calculation Factor in effect on June 30, 2000.

A Lifeguard Member may be eligible for an industrial disability retirement if it has been medically determined that the Lifeguard Member has become psychologically or mentally incapable of performing his or her normal and customary duties as a result of a violent attack on the member with deadly force, such as a shooting or stabbing that causes great bodily injury, and that resulted in a nervous or mental disorder. The violent attack must occur on or after July 1, 2000, and such application for industrial disability retirement must be submitted before July 1, 2005. This provision shall sunset on June 30, 2005, and no such applications may be made after that date.

ARTICLE 23
Lifeguard Services
I.	LIFEGUARD TRAINING
A.	The MEA may meet with the City to discuss training programs and enforcement responsibilities for Lifeguards, including the development of a more adequate training program for seasonal Lifeguard I’s.
B.	Lifeguard Training Committee
31
The MEA may select no more than three Lifeguards which the City may meet with to discuss training programs and enforcement responsibilities. MEA will bring all matters regarding training and enforcement to the committee prior to seeking resolution elsewhere. Such matters must be dealt with in a reasonable time. This committee will not be used as a vehicle to bypass the management chain of command in the Fire and Life Safety Series Center.
C.	The City shall continue to pay the costs associated with a lifeguard’s EMT recertification, including necessary training.
D.	The F&LSS Training Division shall form a committee with the MEA lifeguard training committee to develop a basic lifeguard training plan and any cross training. The parties agree that it is of mutual importance that training be provided in the Lifeguard Service to the extent fiscally feasible in order to maintain the most effective level of safety for the benefit of the public and the employees. Discussion areas will include, but are not limited to, how to provide expanded designated training to ensure the training policy requirements are met, how to increase recertification trainings to ensure maintenance of skills for lifeguards who assist specialty teams and assist with cliff rescues, and enhanced marine fire fighting training.
II.	CLASS B DRIVING LICENSE REQUIREMENTS
Beginning September 1, 1994, all members of the River Rescue Team and the Dive Team, along with all Cliff Rescue Instructors, will be required to have a Class B driving license, if they wish to continue serving these respective assignments. The City shall provide the training for a Class B license in-service and will cover the costs of the required medical examination and the initial DMV license fee. Renewals of the Class B license will be at the employee’s cost except the City shall pay for the required medical examination required for renewal.
III.	PRESERVATION OF WORK
Fire and Life Services recognize the expertise and organizational benefit of Lifeguard Services continuing to be the primary responders for cliff rescues during the day and river rescue responders throughout the year. Due to the specialized aquatic expertise of the Marine Safety Division these duties and responsibilities shall not be removed from Lifeguard Services.
CLIFF RESCUES
From the hours of 9AM-8PM:
The Lifeguards will continue to be primarily responsible for responding to coastal cliff emergencies. If the call for emergency services involves an injury, a Paramedic Unit should be dispatched. Fire Fighters will not be dispatched until requested by the Lifeguard Service. If the Lifeguards, when responding to a cliff incident, determine that more sophisticated equipment is required or that additional personnel are required to perform the rescue safely, they should request assistance from the Fire Department. Whenever it is necessary to utilize Fire Department equipment at a cliff rescue scene, the senior Fire Department official will be in command.
During other hours (8PM-9AM): The Fire Department will continue to be primarily responsible for responding to coastal cliff rescue emergencies. However, when such a call is received the appropriate Lifeguards should be called back to assist the Fire Department.
Communications
Requests for cliff rescue services are received either at the Lifeguard Headquarters at Quivira Basin or at the Police Communications Center in the 911 system. When calls are received at Quivira Basin, the Lifeguards will ensure that this policy is followed. From 9AM - 8PM, the Lifeguards will respond to all calls. If the call involves an injury, they will immediately request a Paramedic Unit from the Fire Department. During other hours, all calls will be referred to the Fire Department and the appropriate Lifeguards will be called back.
If the call is received through the 911 system, the Police Department receives the call. If received between 9AM and 8PM, the call will be immediately referred to the Lifeguard Service. If the call involves an injury, the Fire Department will also be contacted to dispatch a Paramedic Unit. If the call is received during other hours, the call should be referred to the Fire Department to respond and the Lifeguard Service should also be called at the same time so the Lifeguards can be called back.
RIVER RESCUES
For the purpose of this policy a river rescue shall be defined as any rescue of persons or property threatened, surrounded or entrapped by stationary or moving water. River rescues, particularly those rescues that necessitate going in the water to effect the rescue, are extremely hazardous operations. To safely perform these rescues requires specialized training and equipment. For this reason, it is important that where possible all river rescues be performed by the Lifeguard Service’s River Rescue
32
Team. The ten Lifeguards who comprise this team are expert swimmers and have received extensive training in making river rescues. In addition, there is a reserve of 41 Lifeguards who are qualified to assist them. As a general policy, therefore, the Lifeguard River Rescue Team will be called to make these rescues. Other safety personnel will not make in-water rescues unless a citizen’s life is in immediate peril.
Whenever an inland water emergency occurs, the request for emergency service should be referred by the Police Department to the Lifeguard Communications Center. Lifeguard Service will dispatch the appropriate unit(s). In those cases where it is not apparent from the request that a river rescue is involved but any responding Fire units realize upon arrival at a scene that a river rescue is necessary, the Lifeguard River Rescue Team will be summoned. Once again, other safety personnel will not attempt river rescues unless a citizen’s life is in imminent peril. This policy applies at any time of the day and during periods when there is no flood alert or during a Stage 1 or Stage 2 flood alert as defined in the Disaster Preparedness Plan. The Lifeguard River Rescue Team is available on a call back basis at all times through the Lifeguard Communications Center.
It is also necessary to address the issue of emergency scene management at river rescue incidents. The senior officer of the Fire Department at the scene will have overall responsibility for the river rescue. When the Lifeguard River Rescue Team is called to the scene, the senior ranking member of that Team will have responsibility for overseeing the in-water rescue and how that should be accomplished. The senior officers of all safety services at the scene should ensure that there is a high degree of coordination and cooperation among all personnel present at the scene.
IV.	CAREER PATH OPTIONS
Fire and Life Services Health and Human Resources Services shall establish a committee with lifeguards to develop additional career path options for Lifeguards and increase appropriate, short term light duty assignments.
V.	SWIM TEST
The swim test shall continue to be conducted as described in the current Lifeguard Policies and Procedures Manual.

The City’s contribution to the Flexible Benefits Plan will be increased effective July 1, 2002 to $4,725. The Flexible Benefits Plan annual value for FY 2004 will increase to $5,125 and for FY 2005 to $5,575.
On or about April 1 of each year during the term of this agreement or earlier if mutually agreed, the parties exchange premium rates for the parties’ respective plan offerings.
The benefits available through the Flexible Benefits Plan and the respective annual costs are reflected in the Flexible Benefits Summary Highlights booklet provided to each employee each year of this agreement. An employee must be either an MEA member, or where appropriate, an agency fee payor to be eligible for MEA’s Dental and Eye Care Plans.
Notes:
1.	It is the intent of the parties that all Plans comply with all applicable State and federal laws, including IRS Regulations as interpreted by the City Attorney. All disputes over interpretation of the above shall be submitted to the appropriate agencies for interpretation.
2.	The employee must select life insurance and health insurance (unless covered under another comprehensive health plan). An employee may opt out of City health insurance if he/she has other comprehensive health insurance by selecting the “waiver” option.
3.	With the remaining FBP monies, eligible employees may select from other optional benefits including dental, vision, cancer/intensive care protection, 401(k), Deiital Mcdical Visiou and Dependent Care reimbursement and/or cash payment.
4.

Only dental coverage may be obtained in this manner. Such “out-of-pocket” contribution must be made at the time of Open Enrollment and is nonrefundable.
34
5.	In addition to designating flexible benefits monies to pay for reimbursements employees may designate a specific amount of pre-tax money (IRS restrictions apply) to be withheld from their paycheck to reimburse eligible out-ofpocket medical, dental, vision, or dependent care expenses. These payroll deductions must be designated during the open enrollment period, are irrevocable, are subject to IRS regulations, and monies are forfeited if not used within the fiscal year.
6.	Eligible employees are required to enroll for their benefits each year during the designated open enrollment period. If an employee fails to complete enrollment within the open enrollment period, the employee’s current options for health (or comparable plan if unavailable), including dependent health offset, and life, will be automatically continued at the same level for the next year as if the employee had elected to keep them. All other benefit options will be cancelled. Any monies remaining from the FBP allotment will be paid out as taxable cash payment. All payroll deductions, including DMV and Dependent Care reimbursement, will continue and may not be eligible to be stopped until the following open enrollment period.
7.	The City agrees that it will not arbitrarily or unreasonably deny MEA the opportunity to offer a health insurance plan to active and/or retired employees. Such coverage must include mental health coverage at an equal or better level of coverage than that offered through the City’s health plans. MEA agrees to inform Employee Assistance Program (EAP) of any changes to the mental health coverage and/or provider in order for EAP to give input on the proposed changes to ensure that City employees are receiving adequate mental health coverage through their selected health plan.
8.	MEA agrees to indemnify the City against any and all claim arising out of the administration of its benefits plans.

Transportation Programs
A.	“C” Mileage

Effective July 1, 2003, the “C” mileage reimbursement rate shall increase to thirty-nine cents ($.39) per mile. Effective July 1, 2004, the rate shall increase to forty cents ($.40) per mile.
B.	“D” Mileage
Effective July 1, 2000, a new “D” mileage reimbursement plan shall be implemented as follows:
1.	Eligibility
To be eligible for the “D” mileage reimbursement plan, an employee must be assigned to one of the job classifications set forth in Appendix “E.” Such assignment makes the employee categorically eligible for “D” mileage. Otherwise, to be eligible, a City employee driving on City business must meet the following criteria:
a.	Be required, as a condition of employment, to provide a personal vehicle to conduct City business; AND
b.	The employee does not have regular access to a City-provided pool vehicle; AND
c.	Drive a personal vehicle a minimum of 250 miles per month on City business; AND
d.	Drive a personal vehicle a minimum of 12 days per month on City business.
In addition to the criteria referenced directly above, an employee’s unusual and extraordinary driving patterns, resulting from the required usage of a personal vehicle related to City business, may also qualify the employee for consideration for “D” mileage exclusive of the conditions outlined above but subject to the review and recommendation of the City Manager.
2.	Eligibility Attaches To The Classification/Assignment Not The Employee
An employee’s continuing eligibility for reimbursement under the “D” mileage plan depends upon satisfaction of the criteria described in section 1 and does not become a vested right of the employee. A substantial change in the duties of an employee assigned to a job classification listed in Appendix E may result in a change in eligibility for “D” mileage.
3.	“D” Mileage Reimbursement Rates
Mileage Increment (Monthly)		Cents per Mile		Miles Reimbursed

4.	Appeal of Eligibility
An employee aggrieved by the City’s determination that he or she is ineligible for the “D” mileage reimbursement plan has the right to have the matter heard and decided under Article 5, Grievance Procedure of this MOU beginning at Step 3. However, the decision ofthe Management Team pursuant to Step 5 of this Procedure shall be final and binding on this eligibility issue and there will be no appeal to the City Council or the Civil Service Commission.

Salary Status of Part-Time Positions
I.	AUTHORITY
A.	Annual Salary Ordinance
B.	Civil Service Rule X: LEAVES OF ABSENCE.
II.	POLICY
A.	Intent: The intent of this policy is to ensure that employees who work on a regular basis for 40 or more hours each pay period and for a substantial period of time should be provided with an appropriate level of fringe benefits. This policy is not intended to apply to employees hired on a seasonal basis.
B.	The primary purpose of the clerical pool is to assist a department in maintaining a continued level of service and production when a regular employee is absent. The pool is available to meet a variety of short-term needs, such as replacing a regular employee who is on vacation or sick leave, temporarily filling a vacant position pending certification and selection from the eligible list, and providing extra help during a brief period of an exceptionally heavy workload.
It is not the intent of the City to utilize pool employees essentially as “regular” employees, yet deny them the fringe benefits of regular employees. Therefore, departments will not use clerical pool employees to avoid budgeting for adequate staffing or to fill vacant budgeted positions for the long term.
C.	Part-time Positions Paid on an Hourly Basis: The following shall be paid on an hourly basis:
1.	Positions in clerical or similar pools serving in a number of departments or locations.
2.	Positions filled on an on-call or seasonal basis due to fluctuations in work or staffing needs.
3.	Entrance positions to be filled for three months or less.
4.	Classes such as Library Aide, Student Engineer, Recreation Leader II, Recreation Leader I, and Recreation Aide, which are normally filled on an hourly basis, unless they meet the conditions described in D below.
D.	Part-time Positions Paid on a Biweekly Basis:
Positions, except those referenced in C-l, 2, and 3 above, which are at least one-half time but less than full-time, shall be appropriately compensated as half or three-quarter time positions paid on a biweekly basis rather than an hourly basis, if they average at least 40 hours a pay period annually (60 for three-quarter time) and require at least 40 hours of work (60 for three-quarter time) in each of 24 of the 26 annual biweekly pay periods.
E.	Overtime Pay: Part-time employees are eligible for overtime pay in accordance with the following:
46

a.	are eligible for regular rate compensation in the form of pay or compensatory time credits for all time worked in excess of their scheduled workweek up to 40 hours per week.
b.	such employees are eligible for premium rate overtime for all time worked in excess of 40 hours in their workweek and must receive pay for such overtime.
2.	Hourly Employees:
a. are eligible for premium rate overtime pay for all time worked in excess of 40 hours in their workweek and may not receive compensatory time credits in lieu of pay.
3.	Such employees may not count compensatory time or compensated leave as hours worked in the overtime calculation.
F.	Fringe Benefits: Part-time employees paid on a biweekly basis are eligible for holidays, annual leave, and other leaves as provided in Civil Service Rule X. All part-time employees may be eligible for Military Leave as provided in Civil Service Rule X.
G.	Present Employees: Employees who would be hired on an hourly basis according to this policy, but who are now paid on a biweekly basis, may remain in that status until the termination of their current employment.
III.	PROCEDURE
A.	The Personnel Department will review the payroll records of all hourly employees every six months. Appointing authorities will be informed of those employees who qualify for benefits and take appropriate action.
B.	If an employee is hired as an hourly employee, and the appointing authority intends to work the employee 40 hours or more per pay period, on a regular basis for a substantial period of time, the appointing authority should insure compliance with this policy.
C.	The City Manager’s designee will periodically review the payroll records of all hourly employees.

ARTICLE 49

1.	Both parties to the exchange must be willing to make the exchange and must have the approval of the immediate supervisors concerned.

ARTICLE 50

All employees will be required to provide authorization to the City Auditor to Electronically deposit their paychecks to a financial institution of their choice (subject to electronic compatibility). Employees shall not have to change financial institutions if their financial institution is not compatible with the wire transfer. The effective date of this requirement will be January 1, 2003.

The parties will both communicate and promote the availability and advantages of automatic deposits of paychecks through
48
their respective communication means.
ARTICLE 51
Supplemental Pension Savings Plans/401(k)
SPSP
The parties agree that a new Supplemental Pension Savings Plan will be implemented for all new employees hired on or after July 1, 1986. For these employees the voluntary contribution will be reduced from 4.5% to 3.05% to offset the Medicare tax. Future increases in the Medicare or Social Security tax will result in corresponding decreases in the SPSP contribution for the City and the employees.
This change will not effect or change the current SPSP Plan for employees hired prior to July 1, 1986.
The parties agree that an early retirement provision will be added to the Supplemental Savings Plans so that distributions prior to age 59-1/2, but within the City’s normal retirement age provisions, will not be subject to the 10% excise tax on early distributions.
Recent legislation mandates that all employees be covered by a retirement plan effective July 1, 1991. This impacts all hourly employees in the units represented by MEA since they do not participate in any retirement system. Mandatory participation for these employees in a version of the Supplemental Pension Savings Plan is agreed to by the parties in order to comply with this mandate.
The City and MEA agree to the adoption of a new SPSP(H) plan coverage for hourly employees to avoid compulsory inclusion in the Social Security System as mandated by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. These new Federal regulations mandate Social Security for employees not covered by a “retirement system”. Current hourly employees, who are not participating in the City Retirement System do not meet the requirements of the regulations and must be covered by Social Security or a “retirement” plan effective July 1, 1991.
In order to comply with this new Federal law, the City and MEA agree to the implementation of a new SPSP-H (hourly) Plan for hourlies with the following key elements:
•	3.75% employee contribution matched by a 3.75% City contribution to meet 7.5% minimum requirement.
•	100% immediate vesting.
•	Monies must remain in plan until termination.
The City and MEA agree to study the feasibility of establishing a program which allows employees to borrow against their vested SPSP contribution.
401(k)
The City agrees to change the structure of the 401 (k) Plan in order that each employee participant may determine the type and mix of his or her investment in the Plan (e.g., Socially Responsive, Aggressive Growth, Long Term Growth, etc.) in the same or similar manner to the choices available to participants in the Deferred Compensation Plan. As part of this restructuring, a reasonable administrative fee will be established on each 40 l(k) account by the plan administrator which will not exceed approximately $23 annually.
All part-time benefitted employees shall be eligible to participate in the 40l(k) plan that is offered to full-time benefited employees.
ARTICLE 52

Employees who are interested in promotional opportunities or a transfer to a different department or to another classification should call the Personnel Department. (Telephone 236-6400). (See also Personnel Manual Index Code E-7, Transfers and Demotions).
B.	Financial Counseling:
49
If an employee’s supervisor receives notification from a firm, collection agency, or other source that a debt is owed by the employee, the information should be immediately turned over to the employee. The supervisor should not attempt to ascertain the validity of the debt, collect the money, or determine the method of payment. This is a personal matter between the employee and the creditor. The supervisor may suggest that the employee seek financial counseling, if necessary, and refer the employee to the Rehabilitation Unit for appropriate community resources for financial counseling.
C.	Retirement Counseling:
An employee who is planning retirement, or who is leaving City employment, should consult the Retirement Officer (236-6207) to discuss available retirement benefits, and the SPSP Administrator in the Risk Management Department (236-7894) regarding the Supplemental Pension Savings Plan (SPSP) to discuss payout ofthe plan.
ARTICLE 53
Transportation Incentives
A.	Employees who utilize the Concourse Parkade and pay on a monthly basis will be charged 50% of the prevailing general public monthly rate.
Employees participating in the Employee Transportation Incentive Program (ETIP) shall pay 50% of the public daily rate, for up to 52 instances per year. Participation in this program is limited, and available on a first-come first serve basis.
B.	The City will provide 75% reimbursement up to $100 to those employees who wish to purchase monthly passes for transportation on the public bus and/or trolley, and commuter rail service, or who ride bicycles to work and utilize bicycle lockers. Such passes will be for the exclusive use of the employee/purchaser. The City will provide an equal amount to employees who utilize the bay ferry and to employees participating in a City approved vanpool program. Employees must utilize these subsidized transportation services to commute to and from work at least three days a week to be eligible for reimbursements. Employees in violation of these provisions shall have their Transportation Incentives discontinued.
C.	The City will provide reimbursement to employees who utilize the Concourse Parkade and carry riders. The rate of reimbursement will be calculated so that an employee who carries three riders will receive free parking.
ARTICLE 54
Labor Management Committee
The Management Team and MEA will establish a joint committee for the purpose of discussing common problems including, but not limited to, safety issues and policies, contract interpretation and administration, application and administration of the grievance procedure, the exceptional merit cash payment program, Supplemental Pension Savings Plan, clerical work stations, air quality in City buildings, alternate work schedules, and use of limited appointments.

Performance Management Program
The City and MEA agree to implement a Pay-for-Performance plan in the Operations and Maintenance Division of the Metropolitan Wastewater Department (hereafter referred to as O&M) that would provide cash incentives for employees based on the achievement of detailed performance objectives. All cash awards will be funded from a portion of any savings actualized by meeting the targeted goals.
The established goals will be based on both economic and technical performance, i.e., savings from efficient operations and improved performance related to safety as well as the quality and quantity of the treated wastewater. No cash awards will be distributed unless economic objectives are achieved. Therefore, this program is assured of paying for itself. In addition, as only a maximum of 50% of the savings is to be utilized for the cash awards, ratepayers would be assured of benefiting from successful performance as well.
No individual employee would be eligible to receive more than $1,000.00 from this program. In addition, this award is above and beyond any other Citywide rewards employees may be eligible for.
The details of this plan are outlined in the sections below. MEA and representatives from both the Metropolitan Wastewater Department (MWWD) and the City Manager’s Office will meet on a quarterly basis during the course of the pilot to study and discuss issues of mutual concern including, but not limited to, implementation, progress, modification, and evaluative criteria. The O&M Division will provide MEA with all quarterly summaries and other reports pertinent to the pilot. Should the City want MWWD to continue the program beyond FY97, or expand the Pay-for-Performance Program to other departments and divisions, the City agrees to notify in advance and to meet and confer with MEA.
PAY FOR PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN
The fundamental goals of this reward system are:
1.	To highlight desired behaviors and the level of performance required;
2.	To foster creativity and reward high performance
3.	To encourage teamwork and cross-functional cooperation
The reward system is designed to promote two specific key areas: reduction in cost, as well as gains in quality and quantity of performance. Moreover, in order to promote a new culture of cooperation and teamwork both within and across sections, the rewards are based on the achievements of the section’s and entire organization’s goals.
At the beginning of each fiscal year, each Activity Group sets its goals and objectives for the following year. These objectives shall be set by O&M Management and senior staff with input from employees. These goals, at a minimum, must address the quality and quantity of performance, level of monetary resources spent, and employees’ attendance. Consequently, each section will have at least four objectives/goals for each year.
The amount of savings actualized by each section determines the amount of money available to be used as rewards. The total amount saved is divided equally between the ratepayers and the employees. The 50% available to the employees is then split into two reward pools. One reward pool is available to employees of a specific Activity (i.e., Maintenance, Operations, Administration), the other half goes into a plant-wide reward pool. The exact amount an individual employee receives from each pool is proportional to the percentage of goals met by his/her section as well as by the entire plant. If three out of four section goals are met, 75% of the Activity reward pool will be distributed equally among employees within that section. In order to be eligible for the plant-wide reward pool, a section must meet at least 50% of its objectives. If the eligibility condition is met, that portion of the pool corresponding to the portion of the plant-wide goals met will be equally distributed among the plant’s employees. The following are specific guidelines and rules for the distribution of rewards:
1.	Each organization (e.g., plant or facility) must have at least four goals, one in each area of quality, quantity, cost savings, and attendance.
2.	Each section (e.g., Operations or Maintenance) must have at least four goals, one in each area of quality, quantity, cost savings, and attendance.
3.	Rewards are generated only if monetary savings are actualized.
4.	Fifty percent (50%) of each section’s savings will be returned to the ratepayers.
5.	Fifty percent (50%) of each section’s savings will be available to be distributed among employees, constituting the section’s reward pool.
6.	Fifty percent (50%) of the section’s reward pool (25% of the total savings in each section) is available to be distributed among employees of that section.
67
7.	Fifty percent (50%) of the section’s reward pool (25% of the total savings in each section) will be placed in the plant-wide pool and is available to be distributed among all of the plant’s employees.
8.	Each section will receive only that portion of its pool that corresponds to the portion of goals met: e.g., if only two of the four goals are met, one half of the section share will be divided equally among employees.
9.	Only that portion of the plant’s pool that corresponds to the portion of the plant’s goals met will be equally distributed among employees.
10.	Employees will be eligible to receive their portion of the plant-wide pool only if they have met at least one half of their section’s objectives and goals.
11.	Since different sections have different opportunities to generate savings, a cap of $500.00 is applied to each employee per section reward. The excess reward will be redirected to the plant pool so all employees can benefit from it.
12.	A cap of $500.00 per employee per plant-wide pool is also applied.
13.	Any portion of the savings that does not get distributed among employees will be returned to ratepayers.
14.	The unexpected, unusual breakdowns leading to high expenditure are covered by the department’s contingency fund and do not affect the section’s budget.
15.	The rewards are calculated at the end of each fiscal year and distributed shortly thereafter.
16.	The rewards are distributed among the eligible employees equally regardless of their classification and pay steps.
17.	These rewards are taxed.
18.	The potential $1,000.00 Pay-for-Performance reward per employee is above and beyond any other rewards they may be entitled to through other City reward pools.
19.	Employees who have worked for the Division less than three months at the end of each Fiscal Year are not eligible to participate in this Plan.
20.	The new incoming employees working longer than three (3) months with the Division will be included in the Plan. Their share will be prorated based on the number of full months at the O&M Division.
21.	Employees moving from one section to another will share in the two sections’ rewards based on the number of full months they have worked in each section.
22.	Employees leaving the City permanently before the end of the fiscal year will not be eligible to receive any rewards.
