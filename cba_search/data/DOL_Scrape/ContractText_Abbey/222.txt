B.	In other situations the Company shall make decisions as to whether work shall be performed by Company forces in any Company plant, or by others, consistent with an intention to maintain as far as practicable a stable work force. The Company shall make decisions of such nature with such intention, taking into consideration such factors as the scope of the project or production requirements, relative cost, possession and availability of Company equipment and of employees qualified to accomplish the production without undue overtime or delay either of the specific production or of any other scheduled activity, desirability of continuity of relations with historic sources of supply and believed best utilization of all of the Company's plants with a view to the long-term stability and health of the enterprise as a whole.

5
ARTICLE III, Section 1.
ARTICLE III NONDISCRIMINATION
Section 1.	Cooperation

A.	There shall be no discrimination against any employee in the bargaining unit by either party under this Agreement because such employee is a member of a "protected class" as that term is used in Presidential Executive Orders and in Federal and State Legislation.
B.	Wherever a reference to male gender appears in this Agreement it is understood that such language is nonrestrictive and is intended to include females.
Section 4.	Equal Opportunity

Section 2.	Notice
Before an employee is required to leave the plant as a result of any incident calling for disciplinary action, his Committeeman, if in the plant, or otherwise any representative of the Union shall be summoned to an office designated by management for the purpose of being notified that the employee is being sent out of the plant and for the purpose of hearing the employee's statement of his position. It is understood that this meeting does not constitute a hearing and the sole reason for the presence of the Committeeman at this time is to be notified that the employee is being sent out of the plant and to hear the statement of the employee. The employee will not be required to leave the plant in instances involving garnishment, tardiness and absenteeism. In other instances, except for those involving a violation of Article X or where the safety of the employee, other employees, or Company property may be threatened, the Union may request that the hearing be held without the employee being required to leave the plant. Before the hearing is held, a brief discussion will take place between the Labor Relations Representative and the Committeeman relative to the scheduling of the hearing, the infraction of the rules involved, and the facts known at that time. Should it be necessary to further investigate the facts presented, the hearing may be delayed.
8
ARTICLE IV, Section 3.
Section 3.	Disciplinary Hearing
A.	Within a reasonable period of time after the employee has been sent out of the plant, a disciplinary hearing shall be conducted by the Manager of Industrial Relations, or his representative, at a designated office. At this disciplinary hearing the employee shall have the right to be present, and his Committeeman shall have the right to represent him and both parties shall be allowed to bring in witnesses in order to ascertain all the facts and circumstances of the case. The Chairman may, if he requests, participate in the disciplinary hearing.
B.	Should the Company decide to discipline the employee, it shall so notify the employee and the Chairman, or Committeeman. In imposing discipline the Company will not take into account any prior infraction which occurred more than three years previously.
Section 4.	Minutes
Written copies of the minutes of the disciplinary hearing, as provided in Section 3 above, including a statement of the Company's disciplinary action, if any, will be furnished by the Company to the Chairman within five (5) working days from the date of the disciplinary hearing. The time limit on the filing of a grievance as a result of disciplinary action, if any, will begin at the time such minutes are furnished to the Union.
Section 5.	Discipline Grievances
If any employee desires to present a grievance because of disciplinary action by the Company, as described in Sections 1, 2 and 3 of this Article, said grievance shall enter the Grievance Procedure in Step 2, except that discharge grievances shall enter the Grievance Procedure at Step 3. If it is finally determined that the employee has been disciplined without good and just cause, such employee shall be restored to his former status at the time such action was taken against him and shall be compensated for the wage loss, if any, which has been incurred.
9
ARTICLE IV, Section 6.
Section 6.	Probationary Employees
It is agreed that this Article shall not apply to probationary employees, except that in cases where discrimination because of Union activity or membership in the Union is alleged by the employee, a grievance may be filed as provided in Section 5 of this Article. The Company agrees that any probationary employee will be given the right to see his departmental steward before he is required to leave the plant because of disciplinary action.
Section 7.	Written Reprimand
A.	After the written reprimand has been on file for one (1) year without any intervening disciplinary action, it will be removed from the employee's employment record.
B.	The departmental steward shall witness the issuance of written reprimands in his area.

LEAVES OF ABSENCE
Section 1.	Personal Business
A.	In special cases the present practice of the Company of allowing employees to absent themselves from active employment for brief periods to take care of personal business will be continued, when arrangements are made in advance therefore. In such special cases the employee shall retain and accumulate seniority and shall be returned to the job last held provided the seniority provisions so permit and provided that he returns to active employment at the expiration of such leave.
B.	On any absence from active employment of more than three (3) days, and if a leave of absence on the proper form (Exhibit "D") has been approved by management, a copy of such leave shall be furnished to the Union.
Section 2.	Union Business
A.	When the Union (Chairman, President or Secretary) requests permission for an employee to be absent from active employment for more than three (3) days for Union business, the Company will grant a leave of absence. This permission shall be extended to not more than one (1) employee for each four hundred (400) employees, or major fraction thereof in the bargaining unit, with a minimum of six (6) employees at any one time and shall not exceed a total of more than thirty (30) working days per year times the number of employees entitled to be absent. In such special cases, the employee shall retain and accumulate seniority and shall be returned to the job held provided the seniority provisions so permit and provided that he returns to active employment at the expiration of such leave.
12
ARTICLE VI, Section 2.
B.	Upon request by the Union (Chairman, President or Secretary), permission to be absent from active employment will be granted to employees selected as delegates to John Deere Intra-Corporation Council or Screening Committee meetings, Agricultural Implement Wage and Hour Council, or as members of Local Union election committees, or as Union negotiators in any contract negotiations with the Company, or to Local Union representatives engaged in preparatory work for Step 3 and arbitration of the Grievance Procedure, or to Executive Board Members of the Local Union to attend meetings away from the plant, or to members of standing committees as defined by UAW International Constitution (not to exceed twenty (20) at any one time). Such time off shall not be charged against the quota of employees or against the time allowed under A above.
C.	In addition, upon such request, the President of the Local Union will be granted a special leave of absence to serve as a full-time representative of the Local Union. During such leave the employee shall retain and accumulate seniority. Such leave of absence shall be for one (1) year and shall be renewed from time to time upon written request from the Union. If he returns to the active employment of the Company at or before the end of such leave he shall be assigned to work as set out in D below.
D.	Upon written request by the Union, the Company will grant a special leave of absence to not more than seven (7) member(s) of the bargaining unit who accept a full-time job with the Union for a part or all of a year. During such leave the employee shall retain and accumulate seniority. Such special leave of absence shall be limited to a period of one (1) year. Such leave of absence shall be renewed from time to time upon written request from the Union. If the member returns to the active employment of the Company at or before the end of the special leave of absence, he shall be returned to the department and seniority classification last held prior to his leave of absence. In the event the department and seniority classification last held does not exist, or if his seniority is not sufficient to permit
13
ARTICLE VI, Section 2.
his remaining in that department and seniority classification, then he shall be subject to the remaining provisions of Article XIV.
E.	Any request to be absent or on leave as provided by this Section should be submitted to the Company as far in advance as is reasonably possible.
Section 3.	Educational
A.	A leave of absence for a period not to exceed one (1) year without loss of seniority will be granted an employee who has one (1) year or more of seniority in order that the employee may attend a recognized college, university, trade or technical school full time, provided that the course of instruction is related to the employee's employment opportunities with the Company. A request for a leave of absence to attend primary or high school will be regarded as being within the intent of this paragraph and the schooling will be regarded as being related to the employee's employment opportunities with the Company. Before receiving the leave, or an extension thereof, the employee shall submit to the Company satisfactory evidence that the college, university or school has accepted him as a student and, on the expiration of each semester or other school term, shall submit proof of attendance during such term. Such leaves may be extended for additional periods not to exceed one (1) year each.
B.	An employee may terminate an educational leave of absence by written notice to the Company. The employee will be returned to active employment within ten (10) working days after receipt by the Company of the written notice to terminate the educational leave of absence.
14
ARTICLE VI, Section 4.
Section 4.	Elective Office
A.	For the purpose of enabling employees to participate in the affairs of government, the Company shall grant, upon written notice from the employee, leaves of absence to employees who are elected or appointed to city, county, state, and national governmental positions for the first term or who are appointed to serve unexpired terms of such elective or appointive positions. Such leaves of absence will be granted by the Company, upon written request, for successive terms within the period of this contract.

One thousand (1,000) employees worked eight (8) hours on Sunday. Four hundred (400) employees worked two (2) hours overtime on five (5) regular workdays. The total number of hours of overtime worked would be:
1,000	x	8	=	8,000 hours
1,000	x	8	=	8,000 hours
400	x	10	=	4,000 hours
TOTAL			=	20,000 hours
This number (20,000) would be divided by the number of employees (4,000) to determine overtime hours payable to each committeeman for the workweek.
20,000 4,000	=	5
Thus, each committeeman would receive five (5) hours of pay for the workweek at time and one-half.

45

I.	If the regular Board members are unable to agree on the statement of an issue to be referred to arbitration or on any other matter within the Board's jurisdiction they shall attempt to agree on selection of a Special Chairman who will also decide any such dispute by casting the deciding vote; and if unable to agree on such a Special Chairman, the Board, through the Secretary, will request the Permanent Arbitrator to appoint such a Special Chairman. The cost of the services of the Special Chairman will be shared equally by the Union and the Company.
J.	If an appeal to the Board contains both an issue or issues of contract interpretation and any other issue or issues such as issues of fact or specific relief, such other issue or issues will be referred back to Step 3 in the factory involved to be held in abeyance (if not disposed of there) until the issue or issues of contract interpretation have been disposed of.

D.	An employee may have seniority in only two seniority classifications at the same time.
E.	An employee will change his seniority classification by (1) job bidding, (2) voluntary transfer to fill a vacancy created by job bidding, (3) a transfer as an incapacitated employee as herein provided in Section 18, or (4) as provided in Section 13-B-(3) of this Article.

62
ARTICLE XIV, Section 4.
B.

B.	Should an employee be or have been laid off as a result of a factory closing or the discontinuance of a major function of a factory and who accepts employment at another factory and is then reduced from his seniority classification in that factory, he will have restoration rights under Article XIV, Section 13, Paragraph B-(3), to his seniority classification in the employing factory based on the seniority he had at the time of his layoff from the closed factory or from the factory where the major function was discontinued.
Section 13.	Loss of Seniority
A.	Any employee who has acquired seniority in a bargaining unit covered by this Agreement shall lose his seniority and employment will be broken for the following reasons only:
72
ARTICLE XIV, Section 13.
(1)	If he quits - either by (1) notifying the Company, or (2) remaining away from work for three (3) consecutive working days without a satisfactory reason. In the event the Company terminates an employee because he remained away from work for three (3) consecutive working days without a satisfactory reason, he shall be notified by the Company by registered or certified mail of such termination. A copy of such notice of termination will be provided the Chairman. Employees terminated as three-day quits will be allowed to meet with the Chairman and the factory Manager of LR/HR or his designee upon request from the Chairman to offer an explanation for his absence from work. If, after this meeting, the Company determines that the employee should be terminated pursuant to the provisions above, then the Union shall be provided with a copy of the minutes of this meeting.
(2)	If he is discharged.
(3)	If, after a layoff out of the plant he fails to report for work within five (5) working days after being notified, in writing, by registered or certified mail to do so at his last known address, unless prevented by illness or other satisfactory reason. Employees laid off and desiring to retain their seniority rights must keep their addresses known to the Company.
(4)	Any absence from active employment (except for the period of time of a formal leave of absence, a plant-incurred injury, military service, or Long-Term Disability Benefits, as set forth in Appendix "C," or Total and Permanent Disability Retirement) for a period of time equal to the employee's seniority prior to such absence. However, in no instance will an employee's seniority and employment be broken by an absence of less than two (2) years.
(5)	Death or retirement or determination of permanent and total disability as specified in the John Deere Pension Plan for Wage Employees, except that an
73
ARTICLE XIV, Section 13.
employee who had been determined to be totally and permanently disabled but who recovers and is subsequently reemployed shall have his seniority reinstated as though he had been continued on a leave of absence during the period of his disability.
B.	An employee will lose his seniority rights in his seniority classification by:
(1)	Losing his seniority as set out in A above.
(2)	Transfer to a seniority classification as a result of job bidding or a voluntary transfer to a seniority classification to fill a vacancy created by job bidding or a transfer to a seniority classification as an incapacitated employee as provided for in Section 18. In these circumstances his seniority will be transferred to such seniority classification which will thereafter be treated as his seniority classification. In the case of the incapacitated employee, however, should he be working in a secondary seniority classification when the incapacity occurs but the incapacity is one which does not incapacitate him for work in his seniority classification, he shall retain his recall rights to his seniority classification.
(3)	Any absence from the seniority classification (except for the period of time of a formal leave of absence, a plant-incurred injury, military service, or Long-Term Disability Benefits, as set forth in Appendix "C," or Total and Permanent Disability Retirement) for a period of time equal to the employee's seniority prior to such absence or for a period of five (5) consecutive years, whichever is the lesser. However, in no instance will an employee's seniority rights in a seniority classification be broken by an absence from the seniority classification of less than two (2) years.
74
ARTICLE XIV, Section 13.
Should an employee lose his classification seniority under this paragraph, the secondary seniority classification will become his seniority classification. Should an employee lose his classification seniority under this paragraph while on layoff, the secondary seniority classification held at the time of layoff will become his seniority classification.
(4)	An employee who has acquired seniority rights in a secondary seniority classification and who does not thereby lose his seniority rights in his seniority classification will lose such rights in the secondary seniority classification upon being reduced or laid off from the secondary seniority classification or upon return to his seniority classification.
C.	An employee who accepts employment from the LMAS or Outside LMAS list shall carry his disciplinary record to and from the hiring unit(s).	Discharge of an
employee from any bargaining unit covered by this Agreement will terminate all employment and seniority rights of such employee in any and all bargaining units covered by this Agreement.
Section 14.	Transfer In and Out of Bargaining Unit
A.	An employee who was formerly in the group now covered by the bargaining unit, and who was transferred to a supervisory, salaried, or other position outside the bargaining unit, but not included in any other bargaining unit, or an employee who may in the future be transferred from the bargaining unit to a supervisory, salaried, or other position outside the bargaining unit, but not included in any other bargaining unit, and who later returns to the bargaining unit, shall be returned to the seniority classification last held prior to leaving the bargaining unit and shall have his seniority accumulated and reestablished without loss. In the event the seniority classification last held does not exist, then the employee shall be subject to the remaining provisions of this Article.
75
ARTICLE XIV, Section 14.
B.	The Company will not use this provision to affect a reduction in the salaried work force. The provision will be used to return a salaried employee who was formerly in the bargaining unit to the bargaining unit for reasons other than a reduction in force. One such reason would be where the employee requests that he be returned to the bargaining unit. This paragraph will not be construed to guarantee any employee an automatic right to return to the bargaining unit.
Section 15.	Choice of Shifts
A.	Choice of shifts, not to exceed one (1) such choice in a period of ten (10) consecutive working days, on work which normally constitutes the daily task of the employees involved in the same department, or on work in the same department and seniority classification, shall be accorded employees in accordance with their plant-wide seniority, except on work where the skill and experience of certain individuals is necessary for the proper processing of the products, the operation of a department or the plant. It is also understood that the choice of shifts provided for in this Section shall not apply in the case of rotating shift operations.
B.	The president of the local union, vice president of the local union, Committeemen, departmental stewards, Union time study representatives, and Union safety representative shall not be removed from the shift on which they are employed as Committeemen, departmental stewards, Union time study representatives, or Union safety representative by the application of seniority in the choice of shifts.
Section 16.	Preferential Seniority
A.	The following UAW Local representatives, during their term of office, shall, in connection with layoff, recall, reduction or restoration as set out in this Article, head the seniority list: president of the local union, vice president of the local union, Committeemen, Union time study representatives, and Union safety representatives.
76
ARTICLE XIV, Section 16.
B.	All departmental stewards, during their term of office, shall, in connection with layoffs, recall, reduction or restoration, as set out in this Article, be considered senior, except as provided in Paragraph A of this Section, to other employees in the seniority classification in which he is employed and the department or area he serves as department steward.
C.	In connection with all of the foregoing paragraphs of this Section, it is understood and agreed that no Union representative, as mentioned in this Section, shall exercise this special seniority status unless he has a minimum of three (3) months' active employment with the Company, and unless he is qualified to perform the work of the employee he replaces. It is further understood and agreed with respect to the Union representatives mentioned in this Section, that upon termination of their duties as Union representatives, they shall be returned to their proper places on the seniority list.
D.	The president of the local union, vice president of the local union, Union time study representatives, Union safety representative and departmental stewards, shall not be sent home because of lack of work while employees whom they represent as Union officials are working in the plant.
Section 17.	Job Bidding
A.	When it becomes necessary to add employees to any seniority classification, such vacancies, except those created by job bidding, will be subject to job bidding after the recall or restoration of all employees with recall or restoration rights to the seniority classification.
B.	Any vacancy which in the best judgment of the Company is of a temporary nature, that is, of less than sixty (60) days' duration, shall not be listed as a vacancy and it shall not be posted for bidding.
77
ARTICLE XIV, Section 17.
C.	The Company shall post the vacancy to be filled on bulletin boards in the plant. No vacancy shall be posted during the annual inventory and vacation shutdown period. The posting shall list the seniority classification and department in which the vacancy exists and the qualifications for the work assignment. It is agreed that the Company shall have the right to prescribe the qualifications necessary for each posted vacancy.
D.	Any employee who is working in the seniority classification and in the department in which the vacancy exists may request from the supervisor of the department assignment to the vacancy. If more than one such employee requests assignment to the vacancy, the supervisor will transfer the employee with the greatest seniority to the vacancy, provided he is qualified to perform the work, and provided the employee's request has been made before the expiration of the posting date, referred to in Paragraph F below. In such an event, the vacancy created by the transfer will be the vacancy to be filled by job bidding.
E.	Any employee with seniority, excluding those employees in the seniority classification within the department in which the vacancy exists, who can qualify or believes himself to be qualified, may apply for the vacancy by submitting a completed "Application for Vacancy" form to the LR/HR Department within the period specified.
F.	When the vacancy has been posted for two (2) working days (48 hours), the Company shall remove the posting from the bulletin boards and accept no more applications for the vacancy. From the applications filed, the Company shall determine those who are qualified, and from this group, if there be more than one (1), shall fill the vacancy as hereinafter set out:
(1)	The senior qualified applicant. However, in jobs in Pay Level 7, the senior job bid applicant will be selected except where physical qualifications and/or specific skills are necessary to perform the required work such as the ability to operate a motor vehicle.
78
ARTICLE XIV, Section 17.
(2)	If it is determined by the Company that there are no qualified applicants and the Company is unable to hire qualified employees within thirty (30) days from the date the vacancy is posted, then the Company shall give consideration to those applicants, or those employees considered not qualified under Paragraph D of this Section, whose records would seem to indicate they could learn satisfactorily to perform the required work before a new inexperienced employee shall be hired and trained for the work assignment.
(3)	Assuming there are no experienced qualified applicants and there are no applicants whose record would seem to indicate that they could learn satisfactorily to perform the required work, then the Company may fill the vacancy by the transfer or hire of any employee or applicant.
G.	The Company shall within two (2) weeks transfer the successful bidder to the vacancy.
H.	Any employee who fills a vacancy by this bidding procedure and who fails to perform the job satisfactorily, shall be returned to his previous assignment, department and/or seniority classification, provided his seniority will permit such return.
I.	Any vacancies caused by this procedure may be filled by the Company by recall or restoration before transfer or hire. The filling of the vacancy left by the job bidder will be filled subject to the possible failure of the job bidder on the posted vacancy, but the transfer of a replacement for the job bidder, if the job bidder fails to perform the job satisfactorily, will not be considered a temporary assignment and no special pay provisions will be involved.
Section 18.	Incapacitated Employees
A.	An employee who has become permanently incapacitated for work in his seniority classification, or an employee who has become permanently incapacitated for work in his secondary seniority classification, or an employee returning
79
ARTICLE XIV, Section 18.

B.	The incapacitated employee will be placed in an open job if such a job exists, assuming he is qualified to perform such work.
C.	If there are no open jobs, as noted above, and if there are no jobs held by probationary employees which the incapacitated employee is qualified to perform, then the seniority list will be checked from the employee with the least seniority rights upward until a job is found which the incapacitated employee is qualified to perform. It is understood that no employee will be displaced who has greater seniority rights than that of the incapacitated employee. The employee displaced will be assigned in accordance with the appropriate provision(s) of this Article.
D.	Should a dispute arise under the provisions of this Section the parties will jointly select a third doctor to examine the employee. The purpose of this examination shall be to determine if the employee's disability is temporary or permanent, what the employee's work related capabilities are, and the type of work the employee can be expected to perform with his physical limitations. The decision of the third doctor selected under this paragraph will be binding on the parties.
E.	The parties by mutual agreement may appoint a physician or an approved clinic or the staff of an approved hospital which will resolve medical disputes concerning the existence or nonexistence of either a total or partial disability which may arise in the application of this Section. If the parties are unable to agree on such appointment, the appointment will be made by the County Medical Association. The resulting decision will be binding upon the parties. The Union and Company will share equally any costs resulting from such appointments.

91

A.	Eligible employees shall receive six (6) personal vacation days on their one (1) year anniversary date and each year thereafter.

B.	This provision will apply to absence for personal business as set out in Section 1 of Article VI.
C.	Payment for this time will be computed at the employee's average straight-time hourly earnings as defined in Article XVIII, Section 12.

E.	If an eligible employee desires to do so he can take these days or any remaining portion of them during a personal illness resulting from sickness or accident, including a personal illness which began on the first day of the anniversary year, if the employee had worked some part of the preceding anniversary year, under the following circumstances:
(1)	If the circumstances permit (for example, a planned operation), the employee shall notify the Company prior to leaving work that he is going to be absent.
(2)	In the case of sickness or an accident which makes it impossible to give prior notice this requirement will be waived if notice of the illness and the request for the personal leave time with pay is made within two (2) calendar weeks from the first day of absence.
94
ARTICLE XVI, Section 20.
(3)	If it is impossible for the employee to give notice during the two (2) weeks, as set out above, he may do so within three (3) days from the date he reports back to work.

G.	Any employee who is placed on layoff will be paid for any remaining or unused personal vacation days with his last regular paycheck unless the employee requests in advance that this payment not be made.
H.	An employee who is absent from work on a scheduled workday for more than two (2) hours for reasons other than as set out above may request pay for such absence which will be granted if and to the extent he is eligible for such pay. The granting of such pay will in no way imply that his absence was or was not for a reasonable or satisfactory reason nor will it imply any waiver of the employee's obligation to make a reasonable and satisfactory effort to have notified the Company prior to such absence.

The employee will be paid the wage rate of the temporary assignment or the wage rate of his regular assignment, whichever is higher. . If the employee is still so assigned at the end of the period of time for which he would have been eligible for Weekly Indemnity or Supplemental Workers' Compensation Benefits had the incapacity been temporary total, the employee will be transferred and reclassified to the work assignment and paid accordingly.
115
ARTICLE XVIII, Section 6.
Section 6.	Continuous Improvement Pay System
Continuous Improvement Pay Plans (CIPP) reward teams of employees for helping achieve continuous improvement of the operations to which they are assigned. Continuous improvement requires a cooperative effort from all employees, and provides employees the opportunity to both increase their earnings by sharing in these improvements and maintain a consistent weekly pay level.
A.	Outline of the Continuous Improvement Pay System
(1)	A Continuous Improvement Pay Plan provides incentive compensation to a team of employees for achieving continuous improvement on a weekly basis above the Base performance metric(s).
(2)	Weekly Plan Performance is a team’s calculated weekly earnings level expressed as a percent. It is determined by increasing (or decreasing) the 115% weekly pay level for the team for the week by 67% of the percentage change in weekly results achieved, compared to each Base performance metric(s). When multiple metrics (e.g., quality, productivity, schedule performance, etc.) are used, each metric will be assigned a percentage weighting factor with the sum of the weighting factors equaling 100%. A Weekly Plan Performance is calculated for each metric as described above and then multiplied by its respective metric weighting factor. These individual metric calculations are then added together to arrive at the total Weekly Plan Performance.
(3)	Pay for an employee’s attendance hours while participating in a CIPP application (input hours) within a given week is computed by multiplying the employee’s wage rate(s) times the Weekly Pay Level for the week. Weekly Pay Level for each CIPP application will be determined as follows:
116
ARTICLE XVIII, Section 6.
a.	The maximum Weekly Pay Level for a CIPP application is 115%. Weekly hours earned in excess of 115% will be allocated to the CIPP application’s Reserve Fund.
b.	When Weekly Plan Performance for a CIPP application is between 100% and 115%, the hours required to build-up earnings to the maximum Weekly Pay Level for the plan’s participants will be provided equally from the CIPP application’s Reserve Fund Hours and the Company, if hours are available in the Reserve Fund.
c.	When a CIPP application’s Weekly Plan Performance provides an earnings level that is less than 100% of an employee’s input hours times their base rate(s), the Company will provide buildup hours to a weekly pay level of 100% of their wage rate(s) for a plan participant’s input hours in the plan. Weekly earnings will be built-up further to the maximum Weekly Pay Level according to Section 6.A.3(b).
(4)	An Average Semester Plan Performance for each CIPP application, weighted by the plan participants’ weekly input hours, will be calculated for each Base metric at the end of 26 consecutive calendar weeks (Plan Semester) from the start of the plan and each 26 consecutive calendar week period, thereafter.
a.	When the Average Semester Plan Performance for a metric is less than or equal to 115%, its Base performance metric will not be changed for the next semester.
117
ARTICLE XVIII, Section 6.
b.	When the Average Semester Plan Performance for a metric exceeds the maximum Weekly Pay Level of 115%, its Base performance metric will be adjusted by .33 of the percent of total team improvement in the output divided by input ratio as compared to the base for the next semester; however, in no case will the base adjustment exceed 2% in any plan semester. For example:
Output hours in a semester:	9300
Input hours in a semester:	10000
Current base:	.900
Output/Input = 9300/10000 = .930
Base adjustment =
(output/input - Base x .33
Base
Base adjustment =
.930 - .900 .900
x .33
Base adjustment = .0110
New Base = [base adjustment + 1] x old base
New Base = [1.0110] x .900
New Base = .910
In return for this adjustment, the Company will distribute a Base Adjustment Allowance of additional paid hours to the plan participants. Overtime premiums required by statute will be paid with the Base Adjustment Allowance.
118
ARTICLE XVIII, Section 6.
c.	If a Base Adjustment Allowance is earned for a metric as provided in 4(b) above during a current semester and there was a Base Adjustment, as provided in 4(b) above, for that metric, each employee's Base Adjustment Allowance will be determined by multiplying the employee's input hours for the semester times the percentage the Base was adjusted for the next semester (factored by the Base metric's weighted hours) times a multiplier based upon the following criteria: For those teams with a base adjustment less than 2%, the employee input hours for the semester will be multiplied by the base adjustment (less than 2%) times 1.5. For those teams with a base adjustment equal to 2%, the employee input hours for the semester will be multiplied by the base adjustment (2%) times 2. (For example, if an employee had 1000 input hours for the semester and there was a 2% adjustment of the base, and the base is weighted by 100% because there is only one metric, the Base Adjustment Allowance would be calculated as follows: 1000 (the input hours) x 2% (the same percentage the base was adjusted) x 2 (the additional premium for continuous improvement) = 40 hours.
d.	Remaining Reserve Funds Hours (accumulated weekly Reserve Fund Hours less hours used for build-up) will be distributed to the plan's participants at the end of the Plan Semester. The Reserve Fund Hours and the Base Adjustment Allowance, if earned, will be distributed to the plan’s participants based on a ratio of each participant’s plan input hours to the total plan input hours during the semester.
e.	In the event the number of plan workweeks within a semester is less than (24) workweeks, the base and performance metric(s) will be adjusted on the basis of .33 of the total team improvement in the
119
ARTICLE XVIII, Section 6.
output/input ratio when compared to the base (not to exceed 2%) times the number of plan workweeks divided by twenty-four (24).
Example:
A CIPP plan has sixteen plan workweeks for the semester and .33 of the Total Team Improvement in output/input as compared to the base was 1.10%.
Base Adjustment = 1.10% x 16/24 = .73%
(5)	Each Base performance metric will be established using historical data, when available, or through comparative data and/or appropriate engineering techniques, such that weekly results equal to the Base performance metric will yield a Weekly Plan Performance of 115%.
(6)	Employees’ time for the following situations should be excluded when establishing the Base performance metric and not be included as plan input hours when they occur.
a.	Paid Lunch Hours
b.	Authorized Union Business
c.	Classroom Training
d.	Catastrophic downtime
e.	Special projects/assignments outside of plan operation
f.	Medical surveillance physicals and tests directed by the Company (not individual First-Aid Treatment)
120
ARTICLE XVIII, Section 6.
g.	Scheduled Company meetings (not to include daily or routine Production/Safety meetings)
h.	Activities related to Emergency Response Teams and Evacuation
(7)	All attendance hours not included as plan input hours will be paid for at the employees appropriate Wage Rate unless otherwise provided for in the Agreement.
B.	Maintenance of CIPP Applications
(1)	In addition to Base adjustments described in Section 6.A.4(b), adjustments to Base performance metric(s) and/or output standards will be made for the following conditions:
a.	The Company invests greater than $50,000, or $5000 per plan participant, whichever is less, in a CIPP application area.
i.	When an investment results in improved performance the adjustments will account for only 80% of the calculated improvement to allow employees time to adjust to the change.
ii.	When an investment results in deteriorating performance the adjustments will account for the full affect of the deterioration.
b.	Both parties agree that a change is necessary to assure the on-going competitiveness of the operation.
c.	Work is moved into the plan from another area or out of the plan to another area.
d.	Direct Labor is added to or deleted from the operations.
121
ARTICLE XVIII, Section 6.
e.	Introduction of new or revised products.
When new or revised products are introduced into a plan, output standards for the new and revised products will be established based on the design and methods of manufacture for the new or revised product. At this time, the Company may update the output standards of all products produced by the plan participants. In this case, the ratio of output hours produced to the plan participants’ input hours (Base performance metric) will be adjusted to produce the same Weekly Plan Performance for this metric that was achieved prior to the change in the output standards.
(2)	Output Standards in CIPP applications will be established using procedures such as timestudy, standard data, plant data, video analysis, laboratory analysis, predetermined data systems, part family analysis or any combination thereof.
a.	No output standard shall be changed during the life of this Agreement except under the provisions of Section B.1 of this Article. The Company will notify the Union of such changes, as requested.
b.	Information on all output standards now established or set during the life of this Agreement shall be kept in an accessible place for reference and investigation by appropriate Union officials.
c.	Any data or procedural analysis identified in Section B.2 of this Article will be made available for inspection by appropriate Union officials.
d.	In the event that an individual or group of output standards is questioned, the Company will make every attempt to resolve the question. If Company investigations do not resolve the questions, the Union Time Study Representative(s) or the appropriate Union Representative will be asked to review the operation(s) in question. If these
122
ARTICLE XVIII, Section 6.
subsequent investigations do not resolve the question, the issue will be handled according to the National Joint Committee on Competitiveness Letter.
(3)	In the event that a CIPP application is not producing the desired results, the parties agree to meet, determine the extent of the problem, and develop solutions within the framework of the Continuous Improvement Pay System.
(4)	To support the effective administration of CIPP plans each CIPP plan will establish a CIPP maintenance team. Duties of these teams include assisting in maintaining the CIPP application as defined above.
Section 7.	Special Pay Provisions
In the following special conditions, an employee assigned to a CIPP plan shall be paid his Wage Rate X 115% for attendance hours that are not included as plan input hours.
A.	Classroom Training (other than employee break-in)
B.	Assignment to Non-CIPP work while his regular CIPP plan is in operation.
C.	Medical surveillance physicals and tests directed by the Company (not individual First-Aid Treatment).
D.	Scheduled Company meetings (not to include daily or routine Production/Safety meetings)
E.	Activities related to Emergency Response Teams and Evacuation
123
ARTICLE XVIII, Section 8.
Section 8.	Adjustment of Wage Rate -Temporary Assignment
An employee temporarily assigned to perform work other than his regular work assignment (not a transfer or formal reclassification and the employee is expected to return to his regular assignment upon completion of the work) will have his wage rate adjusted as follows:
A.	CIPP assigned employee
Wage Rate of the temporary CIPP assignment or the Wage Rate of his regular assignment, whichever is higher.
B.	Non-CIPP assigned employee
(1)	Assigned to CIPP Work - Wage Rate of the temporary assignment or the Wage Rate of his regular assignment, whichever is higher.
(2)	Assigned to other non-CIPP Work - wage rate of his regular assignment for the length of the shift, then the wage rate of his regular assignment or the wage rate of the temporary assignment, whichever is higher for any subsequent days.
Section 9.	Continuous Improvement Process
A Joint UAW/Deere Continuous Improvement Process will commence no later than 1 January 2004. Only through continuous improvement can the Company remain competitive and employees enjoy secure employment and premium wages. In order to meet these objectives, the Deere and UAW leadership recognizes the importance of establishing and supporting a Joint UAW/Deere Continuous Improvement Process. This is required to ensure that a culture exists across the business and within the union that promotes continuous improvement. This structured process is outlined in the UAW Deere Continuous Improvement Process Letter.

JOINT DEERE-UAW PROGRAMS
ARTICLE I
NATIONAL JOINT EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ON UNION-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS
To provide assistance in improving their business relationships, Deere & Company and the UAW establish a National Joint Executive Committee on Union-Management Relationships (NJEC).
The NJEC will be composed of six members -- three from the Union and three from the Company. Two of the Union members and two of the Company members shall be permanent members and will, at any point in time, be the individuals then holding the following positions:
For the Union:	Vice President and Director UAW
Agricultural Implement Department
Administrative Assistant to the above Vice President
Designee of the Agricultural Implement Department
For the Company: Officer of the Company Responsible for Human Resources
Vice President, Labor Relations
Designee, Labor Relations Staff
While other Union members and other Company members will be as designated by the respective parties, no meeting of the NJEC will be held unless at least one permanent member from each party is present.
169
EXHIBIT "H" - ARTICLE I
The NJEC does not replace collective bargaining, nor does it interfere in any way with the parties' grievance and arbitration procedure. Rather, it provides a new forum designed to promote better Union-Management relations through better communications, systematic fact finding, and advance discussion of pertinent developments that are of mutual interest and significance to the Union, the Company, and employees. It is understood that the composition, organization, procedures, and functions of the NJEC are not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of the parties' Labor Agreement.
The NJEC will meet at such times, frequency, and locations as the permanent members may mutually agree. The NJEC will have two primary functions:
A.	To oversee, coordinate, and give guidance and direction to the following joint committees:
(1)	Central Safety Committee
(2)	Central Committee on Alcoholism and Drug
Abuse
(3)	Central Equal Opportunity Committee
(4)	Central Apprenticeship Committee
(5)	National JDEP Committee
B.	To discuss and assess other matters of mutual interest of a broad, corporate-wide nature. This would include such items as:
(1)	Monitoring and improving the overall UAW-Deere labor relations climate,
(2)	Discussing general operations and pertinent developments,
170
EXHIBIT "H" - ARTICLE I
(3)	Examining government relations and governmental regulations of mutual interest, and
(4)	Collecting, reviewing, and disseminating information and other data necessary to perform the functions of the NJEC.
The above list of items is illustrative; and topics, including those listed, are always subject to the mutual agreement of the parties.
As appropriate, the NJEC may establish ad hoc subcommittees or working groups to explore or resolve selected issues. Where there are appropriate issues of mutual interest and concern, the NJEC, upon approval of the Company's Director of Labor Relations and the Director of the UAW Agricultural Implement Department, may request periodic meetings between members of Company operating management and members of the UAW leadership.
Periodically, the NJEC may direct the preparation of a presentation on the state of the UAW-Deere relationship. As approved by the Company's Director of Labor Relations and the Director of the UAW Agricultural Implement Department, this presentation may be made to members of the Company's senior management and/or Union leadership bodies.

ARTICLE III
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM
Section 1.	Purpose
The Company and the Union jointly recognize that members of "protected classes," as that term is used in Presidential Executive Orders and in Federal and State Legislation, should be afforded full opportunities for advancement.

JOHN DEERE JOB SECURITY PROTECTION PROGRAM
Section 1.	Statement of Purpose
In recent contracts the Company and the Union agreed to various types of programs such as the Protected Employee Group (PEG) Program, the John Deere Jobs Preservation (JDJP) Program, and the John Deere Employment Program (JDEP) to address employee concerns about job security. In general, the parties would agree that these past programs achieved a degree of success in meeting certain objectives. This new John Deere Job Security Protection Program builds partially upon past principles, but includes important new features that should assist in broadening employment opportunities for new employees of the Company.
Section 2.	Basic Benefit and Employment Guarantees
A.	Employees hired prior to 1 October 1999 will be entitled to job security protection for each Program Year as set forth in Section 3 of this Exhibit.
B.	Active employees hired on or after 1 October 1999, but prior to 1 October 2004 with fifteen (15) or more years of seniority at the time of layoff will be entitled to job security protection for each Program Year as set forth in Section 3 of this Exhibit.
C.	Active employees hired on or after 1 October 2004, but prior to 1 October 2009 with twenty (20) or more years of seniority at the time of layoff will be entitled to job security protection for each Program Year as set forth in Section 3 of this Exhibit.
179
EXHIBIT "K
Section 3.	Job Security Protections
A.	Basic Protections of Program
The basic commitment of the Company is that during the time that employees are eligible for job security protection, as defined in Section 2 of this Exhibit, they will no longer be subject to layoff beyond temporary inventory adjustment shutdown/layoffs and other limited conditions. This commitment provides true employment security because the risk of long term layoff and loss of recall rights is virtually eliminated for protected employees. The obligation to provide benefits to eligible employees under the job security provisions of this program shall arise, with the exceptions set forth in Section 4 below, in any case where an action by the Company would normally result in the layoff of an employee who is eligible for job security protection. Where applicable, the benefits provided can be generally defined as the opportunity for active work and/or other constructive activities and assignments for at least forty (40) hours in each workweek.
B.	Program Year
A Program Year shall run from the first Monday in October each year to the first Monday in October of the following year.
C.	Maintenance of Eligibility
An employee's ability to maintain job security protection shall be dependent upon that employee's seniority, skill, ability, and the other determining factors as provided for in the Master and Local Agreements.
180
EXHIBIT "K
D.	Loss of Job Security Protections
An employee who is eligible for job security protection under the provisions of Section 2 of this Exhibit, shall lose the rights and benefits of that protection as provided for in Paragraph A above under the following circumstances:
1.	Discharged for "good and just cause;"
2.	Disciplinary suspension (for the period of the suspension);
3.	Voluntary termination (including terminations under Article XIV, Section 13-A, subparagraphs 1 and 3 of the Agreement);
4.	Retirement;
5.	Death;
6.	Refusing placement into Resource Pool;
7.	Refusing assignment once in Resource Pool;
8.	Failure to sign up for outside LMAS List after plant closing has eliminated employee's job;
9.	Failure to accept an assignment from the LMAS or Outside LMAS List under the conditions set forth under 8 above.
Section 4.	Temporary Layoffs
Employees are not protected against layoff in the following situations, which may result in a reduction of the benefits provided under this Program including a reduction in the forty (40) hours of available work in each workweek.
181
EXHIBIT "K
A.	Short Term Layoffs
Layoffs which fall under Article XIV, Section 4-A-5 and layoffs during the annual inventory and vacation shutdown period referred to in Article XIV, Section 4-A-3, to employees who do not have sufficient vacation to cover the shutdown period. (No employee shall be laid off during a scheduled annual inventory and vacation shutdown unless the employee does not have sufficient continuous employment to be entitled to any vacation at the time of the shutdown.)
B.	Temporary Inventory Adjustment Shutdowns/Layoffs
1.	Temporary reductions in the workforce of up to ten (10) workweeks in any Program Year for the purposes of reducing or avoiding an increase in inventory because of sales prospects may be scheduled by the Company, unless with the approval of the National John Deere Job Security Protection Program Committee, the Chairman of the Shop Committee and the Company agree to additional workweeks.
2.	The ten (10) workweek exception may be scheduled (in whole or part) by a Company facility, department, and/or distinct group of related operations in each covered bargaining unit; however, at the John Deere North American Parts Distribution Center and Parts Depots, such shutdowns may be scheduled by individual employee. For the purposes of applying this paragraph, the John Deere Waterloo Works-Westfield, John Deere Product Engineering Center, John Deere Waterloo Works-Tractor and Cab Assembly Operations, John Deere Waterloo Foundry, and John Deere Engine Works will be treated as separate facilities. Such shutdowns may be scheduled for different times and durations. The layoff and/or recall provisions of the Master and Local Agreements shall not be applicable to such shutdown workweeks.
182
EXHIBIT "K
3.	The ten (10) workweeks (or any portion thereof) may be consecutive or nonconsecutive, but must be scheduled in full workweek periods, however, up to five (5) workweeks (i.e., twenty-five (25) working days) of the ten (10) workweek shutdown periods may be taken in less than full workweeks.
4.	Individual employees in any unit shall not be adversely affected (i.e., subject to more than ten (10) workweeks of shutdown) under this section in any Program Year.
5.	Employees placed on layoff under this Section will be paid a benefit for that week as provided under the applicable Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan, if otherwise eligible.
6.	Employees affected by inventory adjustment shutdown/ layoffs will be considered scheduled for work for the purpose of determining holiday pay and vacation shutdown pay.
7.	Supplemental Unemployment Benefits which are paid to employees pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 5 of this section will not be used to count against an eligible employee's entitlement to receive such benefits in the event the employee is laid off pursuant to the provisions of Article XIV, Section 5.
8.	For the purposes of this Section, a workweek is defined as a period of seven consecutive days beginning on a Monday.
9.	Notification of adjustment shutdown/layoffs will be made in accordance with Article XIV, Section 7. For inventory adjustment shutdowns/layoffs of less than a full workweek, notification of such layoff shall be made before the end of the employee's preceding shift.
183
EXHIBIT "K
10.	Adjustment shutdowns/layoffs that fall in the same week as a Holiday will be scheduled as individual days. If an adjustment shutdown/layoff week follows a vacation shutdown week, in which a Holiday occurs, individual days will be scheduled for the adjustment shutdown/layoff week.
C.	Other Exceptions
1.	Layoffs arising out of or resulting from acts of God, or other events beyond the Company's control.
2.	A sale of the Company or any covered plant or facility shall eliminate the John Deere Job Security Protection Program and any of the benefits hereunder for all affected employees, as of the closing date of the sale.
3.	After the Company notifies the Union, in writing, of its final decision to permanently shut down a facility, there will be no further grow-in to the job security protections as provided in Section 2 of this Exhibit.
Section 5.	Resource Employees
A.	Purpose of Resource Pool
A Resource Pool may be maintained at each unit in order to provide continued employment opportunities to employees who would otherwise be subject to layoff based on their seniority status under the seniority provisions of both the Master and Local Agreements.
184
EXHIBIT "K
B.	Assignments of John Deere Job Security Protection Program Protected Employees in the Resource Pool
When an employee has job security protection pursuant to this Program, and the Company does not have a vacant work assignment for the individual, the Company may assign such employee to the Resource Pool. The parties recognize that the scope of such protections requires flexibility with regard to the assignment by the Company of duties and activities to Resource Pool employees and the selection of Resource Pool employees for training. Therefore, the following special assignment rules may be utilized for John Deere Job Security Protection Program protected employees who have been placed in the Resource Pool.
1.	Placed in a training program.
2.	Used as a replacement to facilitate the training of another employee or the assignment of another employee on a non-traditional job.
3.	Given a job assignment within or outside the Bargaining Unit which may be non-traditional.
4.	Placed in an existing opening.
5.	Given a job assignment in another Bargaining Unit within the "Labor Market Area" as defined in Article XIV, Section 9. In such a case, the rights of the Resource Pool employee so assigned shall be identical to those he would have realized had he been hired from the LMAS list. No Resource Pool employee will be assigned to another Bargaining Unit in the Labor Market Area unless he is senior to the employee on the LMAS list who would otherwise have been hired for the opening, and either agreed to accept the assignment or is the least senior employee in the Resource Pool.
185
EXHIBIT "K
6.	Temporarily transferred from a Bargaining Unit in the Quad-City area to any other Bargaining Unit in the Quad City area for up to one hundred and twenty (120) workdays in any Program year; provided, however, that temporary assignments under this paragraph to covered Bargaining Units at other locations shall not be made if employees remain on the recall list at that location. Reasonable assignments between Bargaining Units at separate locations for training purposes will not be subject to this restriction.
7.	Given other assignments consistent with the purposes of this Exhibit. (For example, the Company may create jobs for Resource Pool employees under this paragraph by adding work to the factory that expands upon what has historically been the work of the Bargaining Unit.)
C.	General Resource Pool Assignment Provisions
1.	It is recognized that both John Deere Job Security Protection Program protected employees and nonprotected employees may be placed into the Resource Pool as a result of the application of the seniority provisions of the Master and Local Agreements. The Company's assignment of Resource Pool employees shall not be restricted by seniority rules or other practices.
(a)	Employees assigned from the Resource Pool to temporary assignments in the Bargaining Unit will work the same schedules as the department and/or classification to which they are assigned including any required overtime. Such employees will be treated the same as any other employee with respect to any contractual notice requirements for such overtime unless it is impossible to do so. Any overtime worked by employees while on Resource Pool assignments will not be charged to any overtime unit or group.
186
EXHIBIT "K
(b)	Employees in the Resource Pool, should be fully utilized to the best extent possible. Consequently, the Company will endeavor to assign Resource Pool employees to assignments whenever possible. In the event that the Company assigns no duties to a Resource Pool employee, he shall remain available for assignment upon reasonable notice in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Company for administration of the Resource Pool.
(c)	Employees, assigned to the Resource Pool shall be removed from the Resource Pool in seniority order pursuant to the Master and Local Agreements, as vacant work assignments become available, provided they are qualified to perform the work required.
2.	The Company and International Union have agreed to the following guidelines to administer the Resource Pool:
(a)	The wage rate of an employee transferred to the Resource Pool shall be established as the wage rate of the employee's last regular assignment prior to being placed into the Pool.
(b)	The wage rate of a Resource Pool employee who is temporarily assigned shall be the wage rate of the temporary assignment or the wage rate as established in paragraph (a) above, whichever is higher.
(c)	Such employees shall not be eligible for Income Security Benefits.
(d)	Resource Pool assignments will be considered temporary and not subject to provisions governing permanent filling of vacancies or the application of shift preference.
187
EXHIBIT "K
(e)	An employee who is eligible for job security protection may decline the opportunity to be assigned to the Resource Pool, or while in the Resource Pool, decline an assignment. In such event, the employee will no longer be considered in the Resource Pool. The employee will be laid off until recalled in seniority order to a non-Resource Pool position. In no case may the employee then claim a violation of seniority rights because of a lesser seniority employee's job assignment.
Section 6.	Administration
A.	At each Bargaining Unit covered by the 2009 Master Agreement, a Local John Deere Job Security Protection Program Committee will be established.
B.	The membership of the Committee will consist of the unit(s) Manager(s) of Labor Relations/Human Resources and a maximum of three other designated Company representatives, and the President and Chairman (Chairmen) of the Bargaining Unit and two other committeemen.
C.	The duties of the Local Committee will be:
1.	Periodically review the size and makeup of the Resource Pool and review the impact of openings as well as future requirements.
2.	Monitor the placement and assignments of employees in the Resource Pool.
3.	Review the assignment of Resource Pool employees to non-traditional work assignments for employees in the Resource Pool where practicable both within or outside the Bargaining Unit.
188
EXHIBIT "K
4.	Review any complaint regarding the administration of the John Deere Job Security Protection Program. Refer unresolved complaints to the National Committee. Only those matters involving the size of the Resource Pool, or governing the treatment of an employee assigned to or impacted by the Resource Pool will be subject to the Grievance Procedure.
5.	Jointly develop and initiate proposals to improve operational effectiveness to secure existing jobs and to attract customers and additional business, thus providing additional job opportunities.
D.	A National John Deere Job Security Protection Program Committee will be established at the Deere & CompanyInternational Union level consisting of three (3) representatives selected by the Company and three (3) representatives selected by the Director of the UAW Deere Department.
E.	The National Committee will meet periodically as required to:
1.	Monitor the efforts of the Local Committees.
2.	Approve Local Committee efforts to improve operational effectiveness and coordinate those actions when appropriate.
F.	The National John Deere Job Security Protection Program Committee is specifically empowered to periodically review and evaluate the operation of this Exhibit and make mutually satisfactory adjustments to its provisions.

During the course of our negotiations for the current Labor Agreement, the Company agreed to establish policies related to overtime in the factories. The intent of this letter is to state the policy of the Company for employees who are asked to work on (1) daily overtime; (2) Saturday and first off-duty day overtime; and (3) Sundays, holidays, and second off-duty days. It is our intent where questions arise out of situations involving these categories that the Manager of Labor Relations, upon a request from the Chairman of the Shop Committee, will make himself available to review the situation.
1.	Daily Overtime:
A.	Except as provided in B below, an employee will not be required to work daily overtime unless he has been given twenty-four (24) hours' prior notice of the overtime assignment.
196
LETTERS
Mr. James Settles, Jr.

B.	In a situation created by the absence of an employee on the succeeding shift, an employee may be required to work one (1) hour of daily overtime without prior notification. Overtime occasioned by such absence will not be considered as overtime except for pay purposes.
2.	Saturday and First Off-Duty Day Overtime:
A.	When Saturday and first off-duty day overtime is considered necessary, the employees required to work will be given notice on the calendar Wednesday preceding the Saturday and first off-duty day overtime.
B.	No employee will be required to work overtime for more than three (3) consecutive Saturdays and first off-duty days.
C.	For no more than five (5) occasions during a contract year, an employee required to work overtime under this paragraph will be excused from a Saturday or first off-duty day overtime assignment provided he notifies the Company two (2) working days prior to the overtime day.
D.	Should the number of employees requiring time off under this provision on a given Saturday or off-duty day seriously interfere with production or maintenance requirements, the Company will review with the Union the degree of interference in order to obtain immediate resolution of the problem. Nothing herein is intended to permit or condone concerted activity by employees, and the Company is not hereby precluded from limiting the number of employees taking time off and from taking appropriate disciplinary action for any such activity.

During the course of negotiations, the parties discussed the subject of conversion to the metric system and its effect on certain employee-owned tools. The Company indicated that it intended to make available during the transition period necessary metric tools and calibrated measuring instruments to employees when required in the performance of their work. Such tools will be available in the tool cribs and checked out to employees when they have need for them.
At the point in time when the Company requires employees to provide their own metric tools, the Company and Union will meet to discuss the subject.

Mutual Respect
It is acknowledged that contacts between the Company and the Union are based on a relationship of respect, understanding and cooperation. Such respect, understanding and cooperation at the Corporate-International Union level contemplates a continuation of contacts between the parties on items of mutual interest as they arise. Such items include, but are not limited to, any relocation, purchase, and the building of facilities. In all facilities the Company will, as it has in the past in regard to Union relations, conduct itself in its relationships with hourly paid employees who perform traditional production.
Neutrality
The Company will maintain a neutral position with respect to both the UAW, and Union representation generally, during any organizing campaign conducted by the UAW and directed toward an appropriate unit of unorganized production and maintenance employees at any majority-owned manufacturing or warehousing facilities which are included in the Company's domestic agricultural and/or industrial equipment operations. By a neutral position, the parties mean that they will not directly or indirectly attack or communicate anything of a negative or derogatory nature about the other party or about labor unions or employers generally.

Procedure For Resolving Representation Questions
If the Union contends that a majority of the employees in one of the units described above wish to be represented by the Union, the Company agrees that it will resolve all questions associated with such contention in accordance with one of the following procedures.
First, the Company may agree to resolve such issue by means of a mutually acceptable procedure for confirming the Union contention of majority support which will be conducted by a mutually agreeable third party.
Second, if the Company does not agree to resolve the issue as described above, it agrees that any such issue (including but not limited to issues involving voter eligibility and scope of the appropriate bargaining unit) will be resolved by means of an expedited submission to a mutually agreeable third party who will determine the question of representation by means of a secret ballot election conducted on an expedited basis after the Union produces a 30 percent or more showing of interest. With respect to any issue properly submitted to the third party in accordance with this Letter, the determination by such third party shall be final and binding on the Company and the Union. The Company and Union agree that the third party shall apply NLRB law, the third party will not retain jurisdiction after deciding the question of representation, and the third party shall have no power to alter, change, detract from or add to the provisions of this Letter.

C.	The Company is committed to purchase only those hazardous materials that have adequate Material Safety Data Sheets and labels. Also the Company will request that suppliers of hazardous materials provide it with identifiable chemical names and composition of such products on their Material Safety Data Sheets as required by the regulations. When reviewing Material Safety Data Sheets on new or different products, the Company will confirm supplier provided health warnings through toxicology references. The Company is committed to the proper labeling, as required by the standard, of all transfer containers used to carry hazardous materials and will make an ongoing effort to accomplish this goal. Further, the Company will make an ongoing, good faith effort to maintain consistent enforcement of this program. This program will be monitored by both factory personnel and Deere & Company in order to assure that each facility has an effective hazardous material program. The Union Safety Representative will be invited to attend the facility's Hazardous Material Review Committee Meetings. The Company is committed to continuously reduce both the number of and quantity of hazardous materials used at each facility.
D.	Provide for prompt notification to the Local Union Safety Representative and the International Union Central Safety Committee of fatalities and accidents involving loss of limb. Access to the factory will be provided to the Local Union Safety Representative and the International Union Central Safety Committee in order to conduct an investigation.

E.	The Union Safety Representative may accompany governmental health and safety inspectors and International Union health and safety professionals on factory inspections.
F.	The Company strives to achieve a "No Hands in the Die" policy. However, some "draw jobs" currently run on mechanical or hydraulic presses, require employees to place their hands and arms in the die hazard area for part loading and unloading. In these situations, the following additional safeguards will be provided:
1.	The presses will be equipped with a set of two-hand control buttons for each operator/helper. All buttons must be activated simultaneously to cycle the press.
2.	The press operator(s)/helper(s) must hold the two-hand control buttons down during the full press cycle.
3.	The presses will be equipped with mechanical safety blocks or ram/slide locks that will prevent the press ram from accidentally falling while the employees are reaching into the die hazard area.
G.	Review the confined space/entry program. When work assignments require employees to enter confined spaces, appropriate precautions will be taken in accordance with safe work practices such as: air sampling, ventilation when necessary, communications systems, personal surveillance arrangements, and adequate support personnel, as required.

This is not intended to, and does not, increase the Company's liability in such cases beyond its normal exposure, if any (i.e., Workers Compensation).
The Company shall have the responsibility to continue to make reasonable provisions for the safety and health of its employees during the hours of their employment. The Union shall cooperate with the Company's efforts to carry out its obligations.
As stated in these discussions, the Company reaffirms its commitment to continue and improve these policies, procedures, and practices as they relate to health and safety. Any questions which might arise may be reviewed by the Central Safety Committee.

During negotiations, the parties discussed the question of "superseniority" or "preferential seniority" for Union officers in the light of recent NLRB decisions which make such coverage improper for certain Union positions.
It is the intent of the parties to abide by the NLRB rulings. Therefore, the parties agree to administer the Agreement so as to provide "superseniority" or "preferential seniority" coverage only for a Union member who is involved in either grievance handling or the administration or negotiation of bargaining agreements on the plant level.
However, should the NLRB rulings be overturned or modified on appeal, it is the understanding of the parties that, to the extent permitted by such appeal decision, "superseniority" or "preferential seniority" coverage will revert to the provisions previously contained in the Agreement.

During negotiations, the Union raised numerous concerns over the Company's sourcing actions and their impact on past and future employment opportunities.
The Company shares the Union's interest in optimizing employment opportunities and growing the business. It is recognized, however, that decisions resulting in insourcing or outsourcing will need to be continued for the efficient operations and survival of our business and the long term job security of our employees.
Recognizing the sensitivity and level of concern over this issue, the Company agrees to the following procedures to ensure Union input into the Company's sourcing decisions. Discussions will take place as provided below:
211
LETTERS
Mr. James Settles, Jr.
Page 2
1.	The Company will provide written notification to the Local Union of contemplated sourcing actions at least one hundred and twenty (120) days in advance, or longer when possible, including the reason for such contemplated action. This notice period will be used to share information and have mutual discussions as required. Prior to implementing a final sourcing decision, the Company and Union will consider such factors as the available market (whether internal or external) for the work in question, the total cost involved, quality, the availability of the requisite technology, capital, the ability to comply with statutory requirements, timeliness of implementation, possession and availability of Company equipment, as well as the impact of such a decision on both the long term job stability of Deere employees and the effect on future job opportunities.
2.	Within ten (10) days of notification, a meeting will be held between local Company and Union representatives to review and discuss sourcing actions being contemplated by the Company. During this meeting, the Company will provide full information and discuss in detail:
a.	its reason(s) for the contemplated sourcing action,
b.	Data used to support the contemplated sourcing action, and
c.	any alternatives to the contemplated sourcing action.
212
LETTERS
Mr. James Settles, Jr.
Page 3
3.	Within thirty (30) days of the meeting in paragraph (2) above, the Local Union may present a written proposal to either keep existing work in-house or to in-source previously outsourced work and/or bring in new work to offset any job loss associated with the contemplated sourcing action. For this purpose, new work means any work unlike or dissimilar to work currently performed by any Deere-UAW bargaining unit. Such proposal will take into account the criteria stated in paragraph (1) above. Such proposal may also include Union input into product and/or work process and other changes that may impact the cost and quality of the work sufficiently to keep the work in-house.
4.	In all cases, the Company will have the final responsibility for making the sourcing decision and will communicate such decision promptly to the Union.
5.	In cases where the Local Union claims that sourcing actions are not being made consistent with the provisions of this letter, these situations may be referred to Step 3 of the grievance procedure.
6.	It is understood that the Company's open discussion with the Union of sourcing and related plans may require the Union to keep information confidential until the Company consents to its release. The Company, on its part, also agrees not to release to outsiders any information or proposals developed as a result of discussions with the Union, nor to use the results of such discussions to obtain more attractive contract terms from outsiders in lieu of keeping the work in-house.

Over the years, Deere & Company and the UAW have made a sincere effort to resolve issues through the negotiation process and the grievance procedure. In those instances where, unfortunately, strikes have occurred, Deere & Company has, in the interest of our long term relationship, elected to refrain from continuing production operations by hiring new employees as permanent replacements for striking workers. During those few instances in which a strike has occurred, the UAW recognizes that Deere must continue to protect equipment, facilities and, most importantly, fulfill its commitments to customers by using salary employees as are available to continue critically necessary operations in an orderly manner.

2.	Should a final determination be made under the procedures of the appeal process of Article XXXIII of the UAW Constitution that the complaint is meritorious, then the International Union will notify the Director of Labor Relations of such fact, and the parties will proceed to establish the procedure for the reinstatement of the grievance to the grievance procedure including possible arbitration.

In the event that issues involving an output standard or a base performance metric that cannot be resolved through this involvement process, the Company may elect to implement the CIPP application. The issue(s) will be referred to this committee, and if this committee cannot resolve the issue(s), and does not utilize outside facilitation/arbitration, then the union may refer the grievance to Special Step 3 of the grievance procedure.

(2)	Organizational Structure
The Factory Joint CI Steering Committee leads the CI organizational structure. The JD and CI Grow Team structure supports and drives CI and separates improvement from administrative issues. This cornerstone ensures every employee will have a voice in the CI process.
(3)	CI Work Plan and Events
Each CI Team is responsible for developing a Work Plan. The Plan will include goals for safety, quality, delivery and efficiency and the projects and schedule to accomplish them. CI Team progress and their successes will be communicated and recognized.

Sustaining these achievements will provide employees enhanced job security and premium wages. To this end, it is recognized that an organizational structure must be in place to support these objectives.
The CI organizational structure includes the following groups along with their roles and responsibilities.
UAW Continuous Improvement Coordinator
A Factory Joint Continuous Improvement Steering Committee will choose a continuous improvement coordinator. The appointment of the CI coordinator will be submitted to the National Committee on Competitiveness for approval. This person will be responsible for assisting the CI Grow and JD Grow Teams in their efforts to achieve their goals. The coordinator will report to the CI Steering Committee on the status of CI projects and the CI Process for the factory.
CIPP Teams/Natural Work Groups
CIPP teams have the primary responsibility to continuously improve.
CIPP teams consist of one or more Natural Work Group(s). The Natural Work Groups are based on the natural division of manufacturing areas into processes or shifts. Each Natural Work Group selects a CI representative. The Natural Work Groups are responsible for identifying opportunities for CI and assisting in the implementation of improvements in their work areas. The CI Representative carries improvement ideas from the group to the CI GROW Team.

1.	Planned Activities
In general, the time employees spend on pre-determined, planned activities (excluding those identified in Article XVIII., Sec 6.A.(6),) that are of significantly greater magnitude than those incurred or allowed for in the plan’s Base productivity ratio, should be considered as non-plan hours and paid at the following appropriate Contractual rate.
A.	If the plan is in operation the time should be paid in accordance with Article XVIII, section 7, paragraph B. (Exhibit N applies to Employees hired before 1 October 1997 )

B.	If the plan is not in operation, employees should be paid the non-CIPP rate of the assignment or the rate of their regular assignment, whichever is higher. If, however, the employee is hired after 1 October 1997and is Pay Level 7, the employee should be paid the wage rate of their regular assignment or the wage rate of the temporary assignment, whichever is higher, for this non-plan time.
If however, it would be beneficial to have the employees minimize the duration and impact of the activity, a predetermined number of output hours may be added (“seeded”) to the plans' reported output hours and the time considered as plan input hours. The “seeded” hours will be calculated to provide 115% plan performance for new plans (no semester-to-date plan performance history available). Current plans will be “seeded” to semester-to-date performance, but in no case will such seeding be less than 115%.
Example A
An activity is scheduled that is anticipated to reduce weekly output to 80 units. The team will return to normal operations at the conclusion of the event.

= 100 units
= 400 Hrs / 100 pcs.
= 440 hours
= .800
Semester to Date Plan Performance = 125.51%
Step 1. Determine input hours affected by activity
80 units x 400 Hrs / 100 = 320 Output Hours
(((((320 Output Hrs/Input Hrs) - .800)/.800)x.67)+1)x115% = 125.51%
Solve for Input Hours = 351.99 hours
Input Hours of lost production = (440 - 351.99) = 88.01

Step 2. Determine output hours to “seed” at Base for Input Hours of lost Output
(((((Output Hrs./88.01 Input Hrs.)-.800)/.800)x.67)+1)x115%=125.51% Solve for Output Hours = 80.00 ”seed” hours
Disrupted Week Output Hours = 320.00 (80 units x 400 Hrs/100 units) +80.00 “seed” hours
= 400.00 Output Hours
Resultant Weekly Results = 400.00 / 440 = .909 productivity ratio Weekly Plan Performance = 125.51%
2.	Major New Product/Process Introduction
During the production start-up, employees will be producing product at a reduced rate while learning their jobs, trying out tooling, etc. To encourage employees to achieve the specific production requirements during the start-up, employees’ time will be considered as plan Input Hours and Output Hours will be “seeded” to the plan to provide plan participants with the opportunity to achieve and exceed the Weekly Pay Level of 115%. The maximum input hours allowed to produce a given schedule during this start-up period must be determined ahead of time. Since Input Hours may vary during start-up weeks, “seed” hours will be calculated after actual Input Hours worked during the week are determined. If actual Input Hours exceed the pre-determined maximum Input Hours, “seed” hours will be based on the pre-determined maximum Input Hours. The “seeded” hours will be calculated to provide 115% plan performance for new plans (no semester-to-date plan performance history available). Current plans will be “seeded” to semester-to-date performance, but in no case will such seeding be less than 115%. No output “seed” hours will be allowed for units produced in excess of the scheduled production.

New Product/Process Start-up Examples
A new model is being introduced in an assembly operation. Management has planned for a reduced schedule during the first week of this introduction. They have provided, however, enough materials to exceed the planned schedule if employees demonstrate the ability to learn the new work and straighten out tooling and other problems ahead of schedule.
Given conditions:
Current Base = .893
New model output standard = 5000 Hours/100pcs
“Full” production = 5 units/day = 25 units/week
Start-up period = 5 days
Start-up production schedule = 10 units/week Pre-determined maximum Input Hours = 1400 hours
Example 1
Units produced = 10
Input Hours = 1400

Solve for Output Hours = 1389.42
Required “seed” hours = 1389.42 - 500 = 889.52 “seed” hours
Allowed “seed” hours/unit produced = 889.52 / 10 = 88.95

During the course of negotiations, the parties discussed the Company’s apprenticeship program, its utilization and how to properly train skilled trades employees to support factory operations. Particular concern was raised regarding the effectiveness of current apprenticeship programs and its alignment with changing factory technology. The parties agreed that if the program is to be effective going forward that it must be restructured to serve current and future manufacturing needs.
To this end, it was agreed that a joint committee, consisting of three representatives appointed by corporate Labor Relations and three representatives appointed by the International UAW, would be formed to address the concerns noted above. This joint committee would be charged with the development of relevant:

During 2009 Collective Bargaining Negotiations, the Union raised concerns about the Company’s administration of certain provisions of ARTICLE II. GENERAL CONDITIONS of the Labor Agreement. Specifically, under the Physical Examinations section, concerns were raised about the quality and quantity of examinations at a particular unit. Additionally, there were issues concerning the Company’s administration of the Non-Traditional Assignments provisions relating to the volume of the assignments, the propriety of characterizing certain assignments as non-traditional (when they were actually bargaining unit work), and the Company’s selection process for filling assignments. Finally, the Company’s failure to provide notice as provided in the Subcontracting/Sourcing provisions was raised. After discussion, the Company acknowledged that breakdowns in some of the labor relations processes in these areas may have occurred. To address that situation, the Company committed to further investigate the matters raised and to implement any necessary process or administration changes in order to remedy the situation.
