IH. Chicagoland Sheet Metal Contractors Association Policy Regarding Direct Bidding of Sheet Metal Work
Whereas, the customary system of having the mechanical contractor as a prime subcontractor and the sheet metal contractor as a sub-subcontractor originated years ago because the primary method of heating our buildings by boilers and steam and hot water systems involved large amounts of piping work, and
Whereas, modern technology has changed the industiy so that now the primary systems in our buildings are
44
sophisticated heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems which require large amounts of duct work and ilr handling units, and
Whereas, the sheet metal contractor, who is the primary air handling contractor, is most qualified by reason of training and experience to have direct responsibility to the general contractor, and
Whereas, the ratio on commercial HVAC jobs may have a ductwork to piping breakdown between 80% and 20%, and
Whereas, direct bidding reduces costs to the construction purchaser, provides better control by general contractors of HVAC work which is the major part of the work, eliminates the third party in the payment process from the general contractor, and
Whereas, mechanical contractors who have their own sheet metal shops and perform the sheet metal work with their own forces are already providing the benefits of a direct sheet metal bld, so therefore
Be It Resolved, that the Chicagoland Sheet Metal Contractors Association encourages the concept of direct bidding whenever appropriate and practical on jobs where the ductwork/air handling outweighs the piping work and that the sheet metal contractor should be a prime subcontractor to the general contractor.
CONDITIONS LISTED BELOW ARE IN EFFECT REGARDING FOREMAN, GENERAL FOREMAN AND SUPERINTENDENT
