Section 7.5	Promotions and Transfers. In order to provide advancement opportunity when vacancies exist within the bargaining unit, the Employer agrees that all permanent new jobs and vacancies shall be posted on the bulletin board for a period of not less than seven (7) calendar days. The posting shall indicate the title, description of duties, basic personnel requirements, work schedule and rate of pay of the vacancy. Interested employees may make application for such vacancies by filing with the Director or his/her representative a statement declaring their desire for a transfer or an advancement. The Employer shall award the job to the senior most qualified applicant. In considering the employee’s qualifications for transfer or promotion, the employer shall consider the employee’s experience, training, ability and work record and if all of these are relatively equal, the employee with the most seniority shall be awarded the job.

Current employees promoted to a higher classification shall receive the starting rate for the higher classification or twenty (20) cents per hour, whichever is greater, until advanced to the one (1) year rate of pay.
Section 7.6	Layoff. In the event that the Employer in its discretion determines that a layoff is necessary, such layoff will be from classifications selected by the Employer and in numbers determined by the Employer subject to the terms and conditions provided for in this Agreement. The Employer shall make a reasonable effort to lay off part-time/substitute and temporary/seasonal employees doing similar bargaining unit work before laying off any bargaining unit employee in a particular classification. The Employer shall not use the cost per hour of full time - vs - part-time/substitute/temporary/seasonal employees as the sole justification for the layoff of any bargaining unit employee.
9
(a)	Layoff of employees shall be by job classification seniority, and the following order shall be followed:
(1)	Newly hired probationary employees.
(2)	Remaining seniority employees within the classification affected shall then be laid off in the order of their classification seniority within the affected classification beginning with the least senior.

(d)	An employee being laid off in one classification shall have the right to move into the next lower classification at the appropriate pay level for that classification and shall thereupon be considered the most senior employee in the lower classification. This subsection shall not apply to the maintenance classification, it being understood that persons in that classification shall have no right to move into another classification and persons in other classifications shall have no right to move into the maintenance classification in the event of a layoff.
(e)	Nothing contained in this section shall in any way interfere with the Employer’s absolute right to transfer employees from one branch to another when circumstances warrant.
Section 7.7	Recall. The order of recalling of laid-off employees shall be in the inverse order in which the employees are laid-off and shall be subject to the same conditions of layoff. A laid off seniority employee, if recalled to a job similar in work content and identical or higher in rate to the job from which such employee was laid off, shall be required to take the recall. Failure to take such offered work shall result in loss of seniority and discharge.
10
Notices of recall shall be sent by certified mail or telegrams to the employee’s last known address as shown on the Employer’s record. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to provide the Library with a current address. A recalled employee shall give notice of intent to return to work within five (5) working days following notice of recall or such employee’s employment shall be terminated without recourse to this Agreement.
In the event a recall is necessary on less than three (3) days notice, the Employer may call upon laid off employee(s), either personally or by telephone, until an employee who is able to return to work immediately is located. In such cases, the employee able to return to work immediately will be given a temporary assignment not to exceed three (3) days, and employees passed over (because of their inability to return to work immediately) will be given notice to report for work at the end of the said three (3) day period.
Section 7,8	Temporary Assignment. An employee who is temporarily assigned to perform duties and responsibilities in a position of a higher classification or salary grade for more than 15 consecutive working days shall be paid at the higher rate.
However, this temporary assignment higher rate shall not apply if the employee is covering for an employee at a higher classification who is on vacation, unless an exception is made in advance.
SECTION 8
HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT
Section 8.1 Regular Work Week. The regular work week shall be forty (40) hours scheduled Monday through Sunday. Shift schedules shall be established by the Employer, so that an employee’s normal workday shall be eight (8) to twelve (12) hours and such shifts shall be made so that library service may include evening hours Monday through Saturday. Schedules that contain Sundays, or more than eight (8) hours per day, shall only be included in the regular workweek of those employees who volunteer for such schedules.
Section 8,2	Assignment of Evening and Saturday Work for Non-maintenance Employees. Non-maintenance employees will not be scheduled to work more than two (2) evenings a week or more than every other Saturday unless the employee otherwise agrees. Assignment of evening work will be made by the Employer on an equitable basis with due regard to the services required and the employee’s seniority. Such employees scheduled for a Saturday workday will be scheduled for a day off Monday through Friday. Such employees scheduled for Saturday hours after 5:00 p.m. will receive a shift premium of 25% of their regular straight time rate for all hours worked on Saturday after 5:00 p.m.
11
Section 8.3	Sunday Assignment When an employee's regular workweek includes Sunday, employees will be paid a premium of 50% of their regular straight time rate for all hours worked on Sunday. In the event there is need for additional Sunday assignments, volunteers shall be solicited. If qualified volunteers are insufficient, assignment may be made to the employee with the least seniority who is qualified to perform the work. All full-time employees scheduled to work on Sunday will have the option to be compensated for Sunday work either by being paid at a rate of time and one-half (1-1/2) for the hours worked on Sunday, or receive compensatory time pursuant to Section 8.5, at the rate of time and one-half (1-1/2) per hour worked on Sunday.
The Employer may utilize non-bargaining unit employees to perform bargaining unit work on Sundays. Bargaining unit employees wishing to work on Sundays must notify the supervisor in charge of Sunday scheduling by the fifteenth (15th) of the month preceding the month in which they wish the Sunday work assignment. When non-bargaining unit employees are used to perform bargaining unit work on Sundays, no less than one bargaining unit employee will be utilized in each branch.
In the event that Community Room services are provided during Sunday evening hours (5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.) the provisions of this Section shall be utilized with the understanding that the notification deadline referred to in this Section, above, shall be waived in those instances where the need for such services is unknown prior to the deadline.
Section 8.4	Overtime and Premium Rate. Overtime when required beyond forty (40) hours in a work week shall be compensated at time and one-half (1-1/2) the employee’s regular straight time hourly rate. Any employee called back to open/close a building or to perform some maintenance function after his/her normal work shift shall be compensated for a minimum of two hours.
Hours worked during a recognized holiday will be compensated at one and one half the employee’s regular straight time hourly rate for the hours actually worked, in addition to the eight hours of holiday pay at the straight time rate.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require the pyramiding of overtime rates for the same hours worked. When two or more provisions requiring the payment of premium rates are applicable, the one most favorable to the employee shall apply.
The following examples illustrate the intended interpretation of this section:
1.	An employee must work on a holiday. The employee is paid time and one-half his/her regular straight time hourly rate, in addition to eight hours of straight time pay.
12
2.	An employee must work on a Sunday which is also a holiday. The employee is paid at time and one-half his/her regular straight time hourly rate, in addition to eight hours of straight time pay. (See Section 8.5 regarding compensatory time.)
3.	An employee must work four (4) hours on a holiday. The employee is paid for four (4) hours at one and one-half of his/her regular straight time hourly rate in addition to eight hours of straight time pay.
4.	An employee must work on a Sunday. The employee is paid at time and one-half (1 %) the employee’s regular straight time pay
5.	An employee must work ten (10) hours on a holiday. He/She is paid one and one half his/her straight time hourly rate for the ten hours of holiday work, in addition to eight hours of straight time pay.
Section 8.5	Compensatory Time. The Library and the Union recognize compensatory time as an acceptable method of reducing payment for overtime hours worked. On a case by case basis, Library may offer, and the employee may accept, compensatory time in lieu of payment of overtime. However, compensatory time shall only be used when mutually agreeable to both the Library and the affected employees. Banked compensatory time shall not exceed a maximum of forty (40) hours. Utilization of banked compensatory time shall be scheduled in the same manner as vacation, except compensatory time resulting from working on a holiday shall be taken in full day increments.
Section 8.6	Exchange of Schedules. An employee may occasionally trade a scheduled work assignment with another qualified employee to accommodate personal business, provided that such change does not cause an interruption of service or other undue inconvenience to the Library, does not create additional liability for overtime pay, and provided that the change is made with the consent of the Managing Librarian.
Section 8.7	Maintenance Schedule. Maintenance personnel will work a week consisting of seven (7) hours daily, Monday through Friday, and five (5) hours on Saturday alternating every second week between working the above schedule and working eight (8) hours, Monday through Friday only. All maintenance personnel must take a minimum % hour lunch period during their daily work schedule without pay. No lunch period may be taken at the beginning or end of any shift.
13
Section 8.8 Rest Periods. All employees working shifts of seven (7) to eleven (11) hours shall be entitled to two (2) rest periods per shift, excluding a lunch period. These periods shall be taken one before and one after lunch. All Union Employees must take a minimum % hour lunch period during their daily work schedule without pay. No lunch period may be taken at the beginning or end of any shift.
Employees working a twelve (12) hour shift shall be entitled to three (3) rest periods per shift, excluding a lunch period. At least one rest period shall be taken before and after lunch. Two rest periods may be combined.
Length of rest periods shall be fifteen (15) minutes per period. No rest period may be taken to extend any lunch period, nor shall any rest period be taken at the beginning or end of any shift.
No rest periods can be taken when an employee is being paid overtime or working to earn compensatory time on a Sunday.
Section 8.9	Unexpected Closings. If it becomes necessary, due to inclement weather, emergency conditions, power outages, or other acts of God, to curtail some or all of the Library’s function, employees shall receive their daily base pay for the hours they would have normally worked. The Library System will close if the County closes for inclement weather.
When this circumstance occurs, employees who are off work on any full eight (8) hours approved in advance paid leave, shall have such leave time accounted for as those employees that had been scheduled to work the day of the closing.
14
SECTION 9
LEAVES OF ABSENCE
Section 9.1 Personal Leave. A “personal leave of absence” shall mean any leave of absence that is not otherwise covered by the remaining sub-parts of this Section below. Personal leaves of absence will be granted at the discretion of the Employer. A request for a personal leave of absence shall be in writing and signed by the employee and state the reasons for the leave. Requests for personal leave should be filed at least thirty (30) calendar days before such leave is desired, except in emergency situations. Seniority shall continue during all approved leaves of absence. All employees who are given a leave of absence in excess of thirty (30) calendar days, must make arrangements to assume the required premiums of all insurance policies commencing on the thirty-first (31st) day of said leave of absence and continuing for the duration of the leave of absence, if he/she desires those benefits to be continued. It is understood that the continuation of certain insurance benefits in the manner described in the foregoing sentence may be limited by the carrier pursuant to insurance contract language. No benefits shall accumulate or accrue during any leave of absence except the continuation of seniority.
Section 9.2	Funeral Leave. An employee will be granted a leave of absence for up to three (3) days following the death of a member of the employee’s immediate family. An employee shall receive his/her regular rate of pay for the hours that he/she otherwise would have been scheduled to work during such leave. Upon approval of the Library Director, an employee may use additional five (5) days of sick leave, personal and/or vacation leave because of the death. “Immediate Family” is defined to include mother, step-mother, father, step-father, brother, step-brother, sister, step-sister, husband, wife, children, step-children, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, step-mother-in-law, father-in-law, step-father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, grandparents, grandchildren. Pay under this Section will not be applicable if the employee receives pay for such days under any other provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this section is intended to prevent the Library Director from authorizing a paid funeral day allowing an employee to attend the funeral of a person who is not in the employee’s immediate family, but who had a close personal relationship with the employee.
Section 9.3	Jury Duty Leave. Any employee who is obligated to serve as a juror or witness in court shall receive full pay from the Library upon paying his/her juror or witness fee to the Library.

Sick leave shall be taken in increments of not less than one-half (%) hour.
(b)	After completion of the probationary period, each eligible full-time employee shall be credited with sick leave on the basis of one (1) eight (8) hour day each month. Said eight (8) hour day shall be awarded on the first day of each month. Sick leave shall be credited on a prospective basis.
