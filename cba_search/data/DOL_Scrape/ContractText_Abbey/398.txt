Re:	Proposed Master Contract
Dear Brothers and Sisters:
I along with the other members of the Special Negotiating Committee listed below are pleased to inform you that on March 23,2004, the Wage Scale Committee concluded with the United States Maritime Alliance, Ltd. a new multi-year agreement on Master Contract issues for the period October 1,2004 through September 30, 2010.
The proposed Master Contract provides for wage increases and other significant improvements in your terms and conditions of work. The Special Negotiating Committee and the Wage Scale Committee unanimously recommend approval of the proposed Master Contract, a copy of which will be furnished to you. They ask that you vote in favor of ratification.
Accordingly, on June 8, 2004, between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. a vote will be held among all ILA members in good standing in all ILA ports covered by the proposed Master Contract. If accepted by a majority of all those voting on the contract, it will take effect on October 1, 2004 in all covered ports. The local unions in each port are responsible for negotiating their local agreements and a vote on your local agreement is to be held at the same time as the vote on the Master Contract.. Failure to conclude local agreements in any particular local port will not affect work from proceeding in all other ports where such agreements have been concluded.
Fraternally yours,
John Bowers

FINAL JURISDICTION COMMITTEE GUIDELINES AND GLOSSARY OF TERMS
The members of the Jurisdiction Committee, in order to provide a framework to resolve outstanding issues regarding the jurisdiction of the ILA Clerks and Checkers, have agreed upon the following definitions and the statement of principle that will be used to define and identify the specific functions that fall within the ILA's jurisdiction.
In applying Section 11 -12 (B) of the Master Contract, members of the Jurisdiction Committee shall be bound by the following principle. Management and the ILA agree that the ILA Clerks and Checkers shall have jurisdiction over each and every function set forth in Section 11-12(B), which is performed on container waterfront facilities on behalf of signatory employers in each and every port covered by the Master Contract, provided that such function was at any time in the past performed by the ILA Clerks and Checkers in that port. It is further understood that clerical work currently performed by state port authorities or government agencies, if discontinued, will fall under the ILA’s jurisdiction.
The following basic list of terms are intended to be descriptive and not all encompassing and are not intended to limit the jurisdiction or functions of the ILA Clerks and Checkers as they exist under local agreements in the various ports covered by the Master Contract.
Unless there is agreement between the ILA in a local port and an employer in the local port, any deviation from the jurisdiction provisions of the Master Contract shall not constitute a waiver, amendment or rescission of the jurisdiction provisions of the Master Contract.

Receiving & Delivery of cargo shall mean checking and/or clerking of all cargo received into and/or out of a container terminal operated and controlled by a USMX member company. The input and output of information related to change of status (eg, change of vessel, change of discharge port, etc.) once the container is received at the waterfront facility shall also be performed by the Checkers and Clerks. Management and the ILA agree that they will develop a methodology to confirm who is performing computer input work that falls within the ILA’s jurisdiction. Both Management and the ILA agree that the methodology will vary from one terminal to another because of the different computer systems utilized in various ports and terminals.

Timekeeping shall mean the Timekeeper’s duties and functions, which shall include, at the discretion of Management, but not be limited to, keeping longshore time and the preparation of time sheets and payroll information. If a computer is used to perform this function, this will fall under the ILA's jurisdiction.

The ILA’s jurisdiction remains in effect at waterfront container facilities, and/or off-pier premises used for servicing and repair of equipment covered by this agreement, in accordance with the Containerization Agreement.
Further, all said equipment, be it owned, leased or controlled by USMX members and/or signatories to the Master Contract, etc., once it is presented at waterfront facilities, shall be covered by this agreement.
Furthermore, it is recognized that the marine terminal work of all ILA crafts has been traditionally performed on pier and waterfront facilities. When such marine terminal work is moved off the marine terminal by the terminal operator or by a signatory carrier to facilities in the port area, the ILA shall retain its work jurisdiction, where the work is the work that would have been performed in the marine terminal or port area.
Major damaged equipment must be repaired in the port where the major damage is discovered provided,. however, that where a carrier needs to reposition empties or where it is otherwise necessary to its operations, a carrier shall notify the ILA maintenance local of the repositioning and the equipment numbers of the major damage equipment. Thereafter, it shall also report the time, place and nature of the repairs performed by ILA labor in an ILA port on such damaged equipment. Such notification shall be subject to the audit procedure.
In fulfilling the above objectives, it is agreed that:
1.	No damaged equipment shall be loaded aboard ship for export except under the procedures provided below.
2.	No employer or carrier shall permit damaged equipment to leave the compound except under the procedures provided herein.
3.	The employers and carriers shall not enter into any leasing agreement that circumvents the work jurisdiction of the ILA covered under this Agreement.
Determination Procedure
1.	An ILA/Carrier Master Contract Committee has established amended criteria attached as part of the Appendix for a container with major damage in accordance with uniform criteria which relate to safety, structural soundness, roadability and seaworthiness of the various types of containers. These criteria shall be distributed to the ILA maintenance employees in the inspection (or roadability) lanes at each container terminal.
2.	In accordance with the criteria established in paragraph No. 1, ILA employees may designate a container or chassis which they examine and find damaged (as defined in such paragraph 1 criteria) as out of service on a T.I.R. form and such container shall be placed in a deadline status in accordance with the procedures of the terminal involved.
3.	The carrier shall be notified of such designation as soon as possible and shall have the right to determine that such container or chassis shall either be repaired (in an ILA port of its choosing) or if it disagrees with the ILA determination that such container was damaged within the paragraph 1 criteria, the container in question shall be placed back into service or repositioned as an empty.
ATTACHMENT C — PAGE 1
Grievance and Audit_____________________
The ILA shall have the right to be informed of the action so taken and to grieve the matter, if it so desires, under the terms and conditions of the grievance procedures agreed to by the parties in the Master Agreement. If it is determined under such grievance procedure that the container in question should have been repaired, the carrier shall pay liquidated damages of $1,000 per container ($2,000 per container for willful violations), as ruled in such determination.
Fact finding and audit under the grievance procedure shall be provided by an independent auditor selected by the parties who shall have the right to audit all applicable documentation of a carrier to determine compliance with this agreement. Such audit shall be available to the grievance procedure and may be used to establish compliance or the lack thereof.
