This AGREEMENT, hereinafter referred to as the Agreement, entered into by the STATE OF CALIFORNIA, hereinafter referred to as the State or the State employer, pursuant to Sections 19815.4 and 3517 of the Government Code, and the CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL SCIENTISTS, hereinafter referred to as CAPS, has as its purpose the promotion of harmonious labor relations between the State and CAPS; establishment of an equitable and peaceful procedure for the resolution of differences; and the establishment of rates of pay, hours of work, and other conditions of employment including health and safety.
The term "Agreement" as used herein means the written agreement provided under Section 3517.5 of the Government Code.
ARTICLE 1	- RECOGNITION
1.1	Recognition
A.	Pursuant to Public Employment Relations Board decision S-SR-10, the State recognizes CAPS as the exclusive negotiating agent for all employees in Bargaining Unit 10.
B.	Pursuant to Government Code Sections 19815.4 and 3517, CAPS recognizes the Director of the Department of Personnel Administration or his/her designee as the negotiating representative for the State and shall negotiate exclusively with the Director or his/her designee, except as otherwise specifically spelled out in the Agreement.
C.	At such time that the State employer designates a position as confidential pursuant to Government Code Section 3513(f), the State shall mail a notice to CAPS of the confidential designation. CAPS shall have fifteen (15) calendar days after the mailing of such notice to protest the State's action. If CAPS elects to protest, the State shall meet-and-confer with CAPS in an effort to reach agreement. If the parties are unable to agree, the confidential designation dispute shall be submitted to PERB for resolution. If CAPS does not protest within the 15-day notice period, the confidential designation of a position shall be deemed agreeable to the parties and PERB shall be so advised.
ARTICLE 2	- SALARIES
2.1	Personal Leave Program
Effective October 1, 2003, the State shall implement a mandatory Personal Leave Program (PLP) for all unit employees. This program shall remain in effect for 12 months from October 1, 2003 through September 30, 2004. Employees may voluntarily participate in the Personal Leave Program on a continuing basis.
A.	Each full-time employee subject to paragraph b. shall be credited with eight (8) hours of Personal Leave on the first day of the following monthly pay period for each month in the Personal Leave program.

B.	Salary ranges and rates shall be changed to reflect the July 1, 2003 general salary increase; however, each full-time employee shall continue to work his/her assigned work schedule and shall have a reduction in pay equal to 5%. In exchange 8 hours of leave will be credited to the employee’s PLP monthly.
C.	Personal leave shall be requested and used by the employee in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Requests to use personal leave must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on vacation and annual leave. Personal leave shall not be included in the calculation of vacation/annual leave balances pursuant to Article 3 (Leaves) and Sections 3.1 (Vacation Leave) and 3.11 (Annual leave).
D.	At the discretion of the State, all or a portion of unused personal leave credits may be cashed out at the employee's salary rate at the time the personal leave payment is made.

Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for unused personal leave credits in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Cash out or lump sum payment for any Personal Leave credits shall not be considered as "compensation" for purposes of retirement.

Upon retirement/separation, the cash value of the employees personal leave balance may be transferred into a State of California, Department of Personnel Administration Deferred Compensation Program as permitted by federal and state law.
E.	An employee may not use any kind of paid leave such as sick leave, vacation , or holiday time to avoid a reduction in pay resulting from the Personal Leave program.
F.	A State employee in the Personal Leave Program shall be entitled to the same level of State employer contributions for health, vision, dental, flex-elect cash option, and enhanced survivor’s benefits he or she would have received had the Personal Leave Program not occurred.
G.	The Personal Leave Program shall not cause a break in State service, a reduction in the employee's accumulation of service credit for the purposes of seniority and retirement, leave accumulation, or a merit salary adjustment.
H.	The Personal Leave program shall neither affect the employee's final compensation used in calculating State retirement benefits nor reduce the level of State death or disability benefits the employee would otherwise receive or be entitled to receive nor shall it affect the employee's ability to supplement those benefits with paid leave.
I.	Part-time employees shall be subject to the same conditions as stated above, on a prorated basis.
J.	The Personal Leave Program for intermittent employees shall be prorated based upon the number of hours worked in the monthly pay period.
K.	The Personal Leave program shall be administrated consistent with existing payroll system and the policies and practices of the State Controller’s Office.

4.	Where organizationally feasible, departments should ensure that positions clearly meet the standards by centralizing the bilingual responsibility in as few positions as possible.
5.	Actual time spent conversing or interpreting in a second language and closely related activities performed directly in conjunction with the specific bilingual transaction will count toward the ten percent (10%) standard.
B.	Rate:
1.	An employee meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria during the entire monthly pay period would receive a maximum $100.00 per monthly pay period, including holidays.
2.	A monthly employee, meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria less than the entire pay period, would receive differential on a pro rata basis.
3.	A fractional-month employee, meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria, would receive the differential on a pro rata basis.
4.	An employee paid by the hour, meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria, would receive a differential of 58 cents per hour.
5.	An employee paid by the day meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria would receive a differential of $4.61 per day.
C.	Employees, regardless of the time base or tenure, who use their bilingual skills more than ten percent (10%) of the time on a continuing basis and are approved by the Department of Personnel Administration will receive the bilingual differential pay on a regular basis.

F.	Employees will be eligible to receive the bilingual differential payments on the date the Department of Personnel Administration approves the departmental pay request. The effective date shall be retroactive to the date of appointment, not to exceed one (1) year, and may be retroactive up to two (2) years, to a position requiring bilingual skills when the appointment documentation has been delayed. The effective date for bilingual pay differential shall coincide with the date qualified employees begin using their bilingual skills on a continuing basis averaging ten percent (10%) of the time, consistent with the other provisions of this section.
G.	Bilingual salary payments will be included in the calculation of lump sum vacation, sick leave and extra hour payments to employees terminating their State service appointment while on bilingual status.
H.	Employees will not receive bilingual salary compensation for overtime hours worked, except upon separation from State service, regardless of total hours during the pay period. Agencies may not include bilingual salary compensation when computing overtime rates.

BU 10
03-06
I.	Employees receiving regular bilingual differential pay will have their transfer rights determined from the maximum step of the salary range for their class. Incumbents receiving bilingual pay will have the same transfer opportunities that other class incumbents are provided.
J.	The bilingual differential pay shall be included in the rate used to calculate temporary disability; industrial disability and non-industrial disability leave benefits.

When a regular paycheck is late for reasons other than Item (1) above (e.g., AWOL, late dock), a salary advance of no less than 50 percent of the employee's actual net pay will normally be issued within five (5) work days after payday. No more than two (2) salary advances per calendar year may be issued under these circumstances.
3.	The difference between the employee's net pay and the salary advance shall not be paid until after receipt of the Controller's warrant for the pay period.
4.	The circumstances listed in Items (1), (2), and (3) are not applicable in remote areas where difficulties in the payroll process would not allow these timelines to be met. In these areas the State agrees to attempt to expeditiously correct payroll errors and issue salary advances.
C.	It will be the responsibility of the employee to make sure voluntary deductions (e.g., credit union deductions, union dues, etc.) are paid.
D.	This provision does not apply to those employees who have direct deposit. This provision does not preclude advances if they are provided for under any other rules or policies where direct deposit is involved.

An employee who returns to State service after an absence of six (6) months or longer caused by a permanent separation shall receive a one time vacation bonus on the first monthly pay period following completion of six (6) qualifying pay periods of continuous service in accordance with the employee's total State service before and after the absence.
B.	Breaks in employment of eleven (11) work days or more, including unpaid leaves of absence, shall not be counted as qualifying service for vacation purposes set forth under Subsection A. above. Absences from State service resulting from a temporary or permanent separation for more than eleven (11) consecutive working days which fall into two (2) consecutive qualifying pay periods shall disqualify the second pay period.

1.	Was required to work as a result of fire, flood, or other extensive emergency;
2.	Was assigned work of a priority or critical nature over an extended period of time;
3.	Was absent on full salary for compensable injury;
4.	Was prevented by department regulations from taking vacation until December 31 because of sick leave;

It is the employee's responsibility to utilize all vacation hours in excess of the 640 hours cap by the end of each calendar year unless otherwise prevented from doing so as enumerated in Items (1) through (6) above. Whenever an employee's vacation accumulation exceeds 640 hours, the department head or designee has the right to order the employee to submit a vacation request which will demonstrate how and when the employee plans to use any hours which will exceed the cap by the end of the calendar year. If the employee does not use the time as planned for reasons other than those listed above, the department head or designee may then order the employee to take the excess time at the convenience of the department.
E.	Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for accrued vacation credits for all accrued vacation time.
F.	The time when vacations shall be taken by the employee shall be determined by the department head or designee. If an employee's vacation accumulation will exceed the vacation cap in Subsection d. at any time during a calendar year, the department head or designee has the right to order the employee to take vacation during the calendar year.
G.	Vacation requests must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on this subject. However, when two or more employees on the same shift (if applicable) in a work unit (as defined by each department head or designee) request the same vacation time and approval cannot be given to all employees requesting it, employees shall be granted their preferred vacation period in order of seniority (defined as total months of State service in the same manner as vacation is accumulated). When two or more employees have the same amount of State service, department seniority will be used to break the tie. Vacation schedules which have been established in a work unit, pursuant to the seniority provisions in this Section, shall not be affected by employee(s) entering the unit after the schedule has been established.
H.	Each department head or designee will make every effort to act on vacation requests in a timely manner.

BU 10
03-06
B.	Enhanced Non-Industrial Disability Insurance (ENDI) is a program for state employees who become disabled due to nonwork-related disabilities as defined by Section 2626 of the Unemployment Insurance Code.
C.	For periods of disability commencing on or after January 1, 1989, eligible employees shall receive ENDI payments at 50 percent of their gross salary, payable monthly for a period not exceeding 26 weeks for any one disability benefit period. An employee is not eligible for a second disability benefit due to the same or related cause or condition unless they have returned to their regular time base, and work for at least ten (10) consecutive work days. Paid leave shall not be used to cover the ten (10) work days. Disability payments may be supplemented with annual leave, sick leave or partial payment to provide for up to 100 percent income replacement. At the time of an ENDI claim, an employee may elect either the 50 percent ENDI benefit rate or a supplementation level of 75 percent or 100 percent at gross pay. Once a claim for ENDI has been filed and the employee has determined the rate of supplementation, the supplemental rate shall be maintained throughout the disability period.
D.	The employee shall serve a seven (7) consecutive calendar day waiting period before ENDI payments commence for each disability. Accrued paid leave or CTO leave balances may be used to cover this waiting period. The waiting period may be waived commencing with the first full day of confinement in a hospital, nursing home, or emergency clinic for at least one full day. A full day is defined as a 24-hour period starting at midnight.
E.	If the employee elects to use annual leave or sick leave credits prior to receiving ENDI payments, he or she is not required to exhaust the accrued leave balance.
F.	Following the start of ENDI payments an employee may at any time switch from ENDI to sick leave or annual leave, but may not return to ENDI until that leave is exhausted.
G.	In accordance with the State's "return to work" policy, an employee who is eligible to receive ENDI benefits and who is medically certified as unable to return to their fulltime work during the period of his or her disability, may upon the discretion of his or her appointing power, work those hours (in hour increments) which when combined with the ENDI benefit, will not exceed 100 percent their regular "full pay." This does not qualify the employee for a new disability period under c. of this article. The appointing power may require an employee to submit to a medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the Director of the Employment Development Department for the purpose of evaluating the capacity of the employee to perform the work of his or her position.
H.	If an employee refuses to return to work in a position offered by the employer under the State's Injured State Worker Assistance Program, ENDI benefits will be terminated effective the date of the offer.
I.	Where employment is intermittent or irregular, the payments shall be determined on the basis of the proportionate part of a monthly rate established by the total hours actually employed in the 18 monthly pay periods immediately preceding the pay period in which the disability begins as compared to the regular rate for a full-time employee in the same group or class. An employee will be eligible for ENDI payments on the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of 960 hours of compensated work.

K.	Upon approval of ENDI benefits, the State may issue an employee a salary advance if the employee so requests.
L.	All appeals of an employee's denial of ENDI benefits shall only follow the procedures in the Unemployment Insurance Code and Title 22. All disputes relating to an employee's denial of benefits are not grievable or arbitrable. This does not change either party's contractual rights which are not related to an individual's denial of benefits.
M.	Employees who become covered in the annual leave program while on an NDI claim shall continue to receive NDI pay at the old rate for the duration of the claim.
N.	Employees who do not elect the annual leave program will receive NDI benefits in accordance with the current program in section 3.8 and such benefits are limited to $135.00 per week.

3.16	Mentoring Leave
A.	Eligible employees may receive up to forty (40) hours of "mentoring leave" per calendar year to participate in mentoring activities once they have used an equal amount of their personal time for these activities. "Mentoring leave" is paid leave time, which may only be used by an employee to mentor. This leave does not count as time worked for purposes of overtime. "Mentoring leave" may not be used for travel to and from the mentoring location.
B.	An employee must use an equal number of hours of his/her personal time (approved annual leave, vacation, personal leave, personal holiday, or CTO during the workday and/or personal time during non-working hours) prior to requesting "mentoring leave." For example, if an employee requests two (2) hours of "mentoring leave", he/she must have used two (2) verified hours of his/her personal time prior to receiving approval for the "mentoring leave". "Mentoring leave" does not have to be requested in the same week or month as the personal time was used. It does, however, have to be requested and used before the end of the calendar year.
C.	Prior to requesting mentoring leave and in accordance with departmental policy, an employee shall provide his/her supervisor with verification of personal time spent mentoring from the mentoring organization.
D.	Requests for approval of vacation, CTO, and/or annual leave for mentoring activities are subject to approval requirements in this Contract and in existing departmental policies. Requests for approval of mentoring leave are subject to operational needs of the State, budgetary limits, and any limitations imposed by law.
E.	In order to be eligible for "mentoring leave," an employee must:
1.	Have a permanent appointment;
2.	Have successfully completed their initial probationary period; and
32
BU 10

3.	Have committed to mentor a child or youth through a mentoring organization that meets the quality assurance standards, for a minimum of one school year. (Most programs are aligned with the child's normal school year; however, there may be some that are less or more. Department management may make exceptions to the one school year commitment based on the mentor program that is selected.)
F.	An employee is not eligible to receive mentoring leave if;
1.	He/she is assigned to a “post” position in the Departments of Corrections or Youth Authority; or
2.	He/she works in a level of care position in the Departments of Developmental Services, Mental Health, Education, and Veterans’ Affairs.
G.	Permanent part-time and permanent intermittent employees may receive a pro rated amount of mentoring leave based upon their timebase. For example, a halftime employee is eligible for twenty (20) hours of “mentoring leave” per calendar year, whereas an intermittent employee must work a monthly equivalent of 160 hours to earn 3.33 hours of mentoring leave.
H.	Any appeals and/or disputes regarding this section shall be handled in accordance with the Complaint procedure specified in Article 9 of this Contract.
3.17	Mentoring Leave Authorization
DPA shall authorize state departments to include mentoring leave in support of regional science fair judging statewide and the Sacramento Regional Science and Engineering Fair as an approved program under Section 3.14, Mentoring Leave.

5.5	Independent Medical Examinations
A.	Whenever the State believes that an employee, due to an illness or injury, is unable to perform his/her normal work duties, the State may require the employee to submit to an independent medical examination at State expense. The medical examination will be separate of any medical services provided under the State's Workers' Compensation program.
B.	The purpose of such independent medical evaluations are not to determine the degree of disability the employee has suffered, but rather as to whether illness or injuries sustained restrict the employee from performing the full range of his/her normal work assignment.
C.	If the State, after the independent medical examination, determines that the employee cannot perform his/her normal work assignments, the State shall give the employee the opportunity to challenge the State's medical evaluation by supplying his/her personal medical evaluations to dispute the State's findings.
5.6	Employee Injury or Disability
Employees shall be eligible for Industrial, Enhanced Industrial Disability Leave, and Nonindustrial Disability Leave as provided in Government Code Sections 19869 through 19885 and as described below.
A.	IDL
1.	For periods of disability commencing on or after July 1, 1992, eligible employees shall receive IDL payments equivalent to full net pay for the first 22 work days after the date of the reported injury.
2.	In the event that the disability exceeds 22 work days, the employee will receive 66 and 2/3 percent of gross pay from the 23rd work day of disability until the end of the 52nd week of disability. No IDL or payments shall be allowed after two years from the first day (i.e., date) of disability.
3.	The employee may elect to supplement payment from the 23rd work day with accrued leave credits including annual leave, vacation, sick leave, or compensating time off (CTO) in the amount necessary to match, but not exceed, full net pay. Full net pay is defined as the net pay the employee would have received if he/she had been working and not on disability. Partial supplementation will be allowed, but fractions of less than one hour will not be permitted. Once the level of supplementation is selected, it may be decreased to accommodate a declining leave balance but it may not be increased. Reductions to supplementation amounts will be made on a prospective basis only.
4.	Temporary Disability (TD) with supplementation, as provided for in Government Code Section 19863, will no longer be available to any State employee who is a member of either the PERS or STRS retirement system during the first 52 weeks, after the first date of disability, within a two-year period. Any employee who is already receiving disability payments on the effective date of this provision will be notified and given 30 days to make a voluntary, but irrevocable, change to the new benefit for the remainder of his/her eligibility for IDL.

6.	In the event that an employee is determined to be "permanent and stationary" by his/her physician before the IDL benefit is exhausted, but is unable to return to work, he/she must agree to participation in a vocational rehabilitation program. Refusing to participate will result in immediate suspension of the IDL benefit.
7.	All appeals of an employee's denial of IDL benefits shall only follow the procedures in the Government Code and Title 2. All disputes relating to an employee's denial of benefits are not grievable or arbitrable. This does not change either party's contractual rights which are not related to an individual's denial of benefits.

For the purposes of this Section, "net salary" is defined as the amount of salary received after federal income tax, State income tax, and the employee's retirement contribution have been deducted from the employee's gross salary. The EIDL benefit will continue to be subject to miscellaneous payroll deductions.
4.	EIDL will apply only to serious physical injuries and any complications directly related medically and attributable to the assault, as determined by the department director or designee.

Effective July 1, 2001, the State shall continue a Rural Health Care Equity Program for Bargaining Unit 10 members, which may be administered in conjunction with a similar program for State employees in other bargaining units, for excluded employees, and for annuitants. The Department of Personnel Administration shall administer any fund involving Bargaining Unit 10 members.
The program shall operate in the following fashion:
A.	The State shall contribute $1500 per year on behalf of each bargaining unit member (employee) who lives in a defined rural area, as more definitely described in Government Code Section 22825.01.
1.	For Bargaining Unit 10 members, because a substantial number of them are seasonal employees, payment shall be on a monthly basis.
2.	For permanent employees, as in the “Medical Reimbursement Account” situation, the employee does not have to wait for reimbursement of covered medical expenses until the full amount has been deposited.
B.	As to any employee who enters State service or leaves State service during a fiscal year, contributions for such employee shall be made on a pro rata basis. A similar computation shall be used for anyone entering or leaving the bargaining unit or gains eligibility (e.g., promotion in mid-fiscal year).
C.	The money shall be available for use as defined in Government Code Section (GC) 22825.01.
D.	A Rural Healthcare Equity Program will be established with a separate account for Bargaining Unit 10 members, as one of several similar accounts.

44
BU 10
03-06
F.	If an employee does not utilize the complete $1500 pursuant to the procedures and limitations described in GC section 22825.01, then the unused monies shall be put in a “same year pool.” That same year pool shall be utilized to pay those who have incurred eligible health care expenses in excess of the $1500, but again according to the procedures and limitations in GC section 22825.01. The monies in the same year pool would be distributed at the end, or even soon after, each fiscal year to that group of employees who had expenses in excess of $1500 in the relevant fiscal year. Those monies shall be distributed on a pro tanto (pro rata) basis.
1.	Any employee not in Bargaining Unit 10 all year shall receive credit under this paragraph utilizing the same pro rata formula as in paragraph 2. above.
2.	If an employee is entitled to less than $25 under this paragraph, the money shall instead go into next year’s fund pursuant to paragraph g hereafter.
G.	If monies still remain after a distribution to such employees (i.e., all employees who spent more than $1500 as provided in GC section 22825.01 were completely reimbursed), then those surplus monies shall be rolled over into the next fiscal year’s funds available for distribution to employees whose expenses pursuant to the statute exceed $1500 in such subsequent year. Similar “rollovers” would occur in any years where all employees were completely reimbursed (or had payments made on their behalf) pursuant to GC section 22825.01 and monies still remained in the pool.
5.13	Health Promotion Activities
A.	The State, in an effort to increase morale and productivity, to reduce absenteeism, injuries and illness, and to contain rising health care costs, encourages departments and employees to participate in health promotion and injury prevention activities.

45
BU 10
03-06
2.	To be eligible for the subsidy, an employee’s income may not exceed a monthly base income of $4, 000 or a total of $48, 000 per year. Employees will be required to selfcertify their income. A random audit verification of approximately 10 percent of the eligible employees may be conducted. Employees selected in the randomized audit may be required to provide income verification.
3.	Employees will be required to enroll and participate in a dependant care reimbursement account in the Flexelect program. Employees must meet the eligible criteria for the Flexelect program to be eligible to participate in the subsidy program.
4.	Employees will be required to apply for the subsidy. Should the number of employees applying for the benefit exceed the total funds available for subsidies, a lottery will be used to select employees who will receive the subsidy. Only one cash award per year will be awarded to each employee. Married state employees may apply separately, but may not receive more than two $1,000 awards per family.
5.	Employees will be required to reapply for the subsidy program and FlexElect each year.
6.	Subsidies will be deposited into dependant care reimbursement accounts on January 1, 2004 and January 1, 2005.
The Department of Personnel Administration shall administer the subsidy program.

7.3	Overtime Scheduling
Where practicable, a department shall establish a system to request and utilize volunteers to perform overtime work from among Unit 10 employees who are qualified and available within the appropriate work area.

7.7	Work Week Group Definitions and Compensation
A.	Work Week Group 2
1.	Work Week Group 2 applies to those classifications in State service subject to the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
2.	Overtime for employees subject to the provisions of the FLSA is defined as all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a period of 168 hours or seven consecutive 24-hour periods.
3.	The State employer agrees to administer current rules and practices regarding work week groups and overtime.
4.	Employees in Work week Group 2 required to work in excess of forty (40) hours per week shall be compensated for such ordered overtime either by cash payment or compensating time off (CTO) in the following manner:
a.	Cash compensation shall be at one and one-half times the hourly rate.
b.	Compensating time off for Work week Group 2 employees shall be given at one and one-half (1%) hour for each overtime hour worked.
5.	Overtime may be compensated on a cash or CTO basis at the discretion of the department head or designee. Both parties agree and understand that a different type of overtime payment (cash or CTO) may be provided to employees at different times and may even be different for employees in the same or similar situations.
6.	The Department of Food and Agriculture and CAPS agree that Unit 10 employees who are approved for Alternate Range Criteria 208 may be compensated for up to 20 hours of overtime at straight time per month for the period of the Alternate Range applicability.
7.	The Department of Food and Agriculture and CAPS agree that Unit 10 employees who are assigned to Governor declared Emergency Projects will have their Work Week Group changed to 2 for the duration of the assignment. This provision does not apply to employees who are approved for Alternate Range Criteria 208 or 209.
B.	Work Week Group E
1.	State employees who are exempt from the FLSA are salaried, not hourly, workers.
2.	To assure continued exemption from the FLSA, the following is the state’s policy for all employees exempt from the FLSA:
a.	Management determines, consistent with the current memorandum of understandings, the products, services, and standards which must be met by FLSA exempt employees.
b.	The salary paid to FLSA exempt employees is full compensation for all hours worked.
c.	FLSA exempt employees are not authorized to receive any form of overtime compensation, whether formal or informal.
56
BU 10
03-06
d.	FLSA exempt employees are expected to work the hours necessary to accomplish assignments and fulfill their responsibilities. The employee’s workload will normally require 40 hours per week to accomplish. However, inherent in the job is the responsibility and expectation that work weeks of longer duration may be necessary for which there will be no additional compensation in any form.
e.	Management can require FLSA exempt employees to work specified hours. However, consistent with operational needs, and the services which management has determined must be provided, the FLSA exempt employee, subject to notifying and obtaining management concurrence, has the flexibility to alter his/her daily and weekly work schedules.
Employees are responsible for keeping management apprised of their schedules and whereabouts, must receive approval from management for the use of formal leave (e.g. vacation, sick leave, personal leave) and for absences of one day or more, and must respond to directions from management to complete work assignments by specific deadlines.
f.	Consistent with the salaried nature of FLSA exempt employees, these employees:
(1)	Shall not be charged any paid leave for absences in less than whole day increments;
(2)	Shall not be docked for absences of less than a day;
(3)	Shall not be suspended in increments of less than one complete work week (one week, two weeks, three weeks, etc.) when facing discipline; suspensions, demotions, or discharge;
(4)	Shall not have absences of less than a day recorded for attendance record keeping or compensation purposes.
C.	Work Week Group SE
1.	Work week Group SE applies to those positions that under the FLSA are statutorily exempted, (physicians, attorneys, teachers) from coverage.
7.8	On-Call Assignments
A.	Department of Fish and Game
1.	On-Call Program
a.	“On-call” is the requirement that an employee be available during specified off-duty hours to receive an order to work. An employee assigned to on-call duty shall at all times while on-call be prepared to respond in a fit and able condition. Employees not scheduled for on-call duty who are called back to work are not eligible for on-call compensation. Rather, appropriate call back provisions apply.
BU 10
03-06
57
b.	The Office of Spill Prevention and Response (OSPR) and the Marine Region Spill Response (MRSR) programs require designated Unit 10 employees to be available during non-work hours to respond in accordance with program procedures to departmental emergencies and any other urgent, operational needs of the Department. The programs shall clearly specify in writing when any designated Unit 10 employee will be required to be available when not working, and what periods of non-working hours such employees shall be required to be available.
2.	Selection of OSPR and MRSR Unit 10 Employees for On-call Duty
a.	The OSPR and MRSR will establish and publish on-call schedules for 6-month periods of time. On-call schedules shall be established with designated program Unit 10 employees bidding on weekly on-call shifts at their respective work locations based on program seniority within his/her classification. Each employee shall be given the opportunity to select one weekly on-call shift at a time in order of seniority until the schedule is complete.
b.	In order to allow employees to substitute for others, the schedules shall be published at least one month in advance. Substitution must be voluntary on the part of both employees and approved by the appropriate Response Supervisor at least 48 hours prior to the beginning of the on-call assignment. A Response Supervisor is a manager or supervisor having the authority to call back and assign employees to an emergency incident.
c.	If an employee due to an emergency or illness is unable to fulfill his/her on-call duty responsibilities, he/she must notify the dispatch center. The program will first seek volunteers to cover the on-call shift. However, if no one volunteers or the program is under time constraints, management retains the discretion to make on-call assignments from among program Unit 10 employees.
d.	Management retains the right to place additional program Unit 10 employees on on-call duty during emergency situations.
e.	Employees assigned to on-call duty must respond within fifteen (15) minutes of being contacted by a program communication dispatcher. If the employee does not respond to the initial page, the dispatcher will contact the employee via the listed telephone number provided by the employee. “Respond” in this case means contacting the dispatcher and beginning the response assessment procedure, including fact finding via telephone and/or driving to a particular incident.
f.	Employees on-call who do not respond or cannot be located may forfeit their on-call compensation.

3.	Telephonic Pagers
a.	The program will furnish telephonic pagers and cellular telephones and require employees assigned to on-call duty to carry these with them. Assigned employees shall be required to keep the pager activated and available, and to respond in the event he/she is contacted by a departmental representative during such on-call time.
b.	The employee shall self-page at the beginning of each on-call shift to ascertain the pager is working, and when visiting an area where the paging system’s capabilities are unknown.
c.	It is the responsibility of the employee to give the dispatcher a telephone number if the employee is in an area where the pager does not work, or during hours when the pager may not be heard by the employee.
4.	Compensation. Any OSPR Unit 10 employee covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and assigned to be available for on-call duty shall be credited with two (2) hours of compensating time off (CTO) for on-call time on a workday and three (3) hours of CTO for on-call time on an administrative day off (24 hour period) provided his/her on-call time is not interrupted by a call-back.
If during the workday the employee’s on-call time is interrupted by a call-back, then the employee will only be compensated one (1) hour of CTO for eight (8) hours or less of on-call time or two (2) hours of CTO for more than eight (8) hours of on-call time. If this situation occurs during an administrative day off, the employee will receive only one (1) hour of CTO for eight (8) hours or less of on-call time, two (2) hours of CTO for more than eight (8) but less than sixteen (16) hours of on-call time or three (3) hours of CTO for more than sixteen (16) hours of on-call time. For purposes of this agreement, “On-call Time” does not include the employee’s normal work hours, including the lunch period, and scheduled or unscheduled overtime.
On-call time and compensation shall not be considered as time worked for overtime purposes consistent with federal and state law.
An OSPR Unit 10 FLSA exempt employee assigned to be available for on-call duty shall be compensated with vacation or annual leave credits instead of CTO. However, with regards to the employee’s actual response time, such time is considered part of his/her regular duties for which he/she is fully compensated by his/her monthly salary.
5.	Response While On-Call. If a program Unit 10 FLSA covered employee, while on-call duty, is required by the OSPR/MRSR to attend to the operational needs of the Department and to report to a particular site or work location, that employee shall be compensated in accordance with the call-back provisions in Article 7.4 of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between CAPS and the State of California. If a response to a particular site or work location is not required, the employee will only be compensated for the actual time spent on the telephone and assessing the situation.
6.	Dispute Resolution. Disputes concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure in Article 9.

B.	Department of Health Services
1.	On-call assignment is defined as a work-shift of no less than one day in which the Unit 10 employee is: (1) available by telephone or electronic paging device at all times; and (2) normally immediately available to return to the facility for any emergency response deemed necessary by the employee or supervisor. On-call assignment shall be in addition to the employee’s normal work schedule. If the State deems it necessary, the State shall issue a Unit 10 employee an electronic paging device during an on-call assignment.
2.	Those employees completing an on-call assignment shall receive one (1) hour CTO for each eight (8) hours time period of each on-call assignment, to a maximum of three hours CTO for each 24 hour period on call. Payment for fractions of an hour shall be made in quarter hour increments.
3.	On-call assignments shall not be rescheduled to be less than one full day solely to avoid payment under this Section.
4.	Unit 10 employees who complete on call assignments of less than seven (7) consecutive days shall receive pro rata CTO or pro rata pay.
5.	On call compensation can apply to all Unit 10 staff regardless of work week group.
7.9	Arduous Duty Differential for FLSA Exempt Employees
The State shall establish an “arduous pay” program to provide additional compensation to FLSA exempt employees assigned to WWGs E and SE when there is no other way to recognize the performance of additional duties and responsibility which clearly exceed the normal demands of an employee’s classification/position. Employees shall be eligible for this pay differential for up to four months per fiscal year (or per event for emergencies involving loss of life or property).
Requests for arduous pay shall be made to the Department of Personnel Administration on a case-by-case basis by the employing department. The Department of Personnel Administration shall evaluate said requests based on whether it satisfies all of the following.
A.	Nonnegotiable Deadline or Extreme Urgency
The work must have a deadline or completion date that cannot be controlled by the employee or his/her supervisor, or must constitute an extreme urgency. The deadline or extreme urgency must impose upon the employee an immediate and urgent demand for his/her work that cannot be avoided or mitigated by planning, rescheduling, postponement or rearrangement of work, or modification of the deadline.
B.	Work Exceeds Normal Work Hours and Normal Productivity
The work must be extraordinarily demanding and time consuming, and of a nature that significantly exceeds the normal work week and work productivity expectations of the employee’s work assignment.
Employees who are excluded from FLSA are expected to work variable work schedules as necessary to meet the demands of the job. This pay differential is not intended for employees who regularly or occasionally work in excess of the
60
BU 10
03-06
normal work week to meet normal workload demands. It is intended where in addition to working a significant number of hours in excess of the normal work week, there is a demand for and achievement of greater productivity or result.
C.	Work is Unavoidable
The work must be of a nature that it cannot be postponed, redistributed, modified, reassigned or otherwise changed in any way to provide relief.
D.	Work Involves Extremely Heavy Workload
The work is of a nature that it cannot be organized or planned to enable time off in exchange for the extra hours worked. The absence from work would cause difficulty or hardship on others and would result in other critical work not being completed. Occasional heavy workload of less than 12 to 14 days in duration would not normally satisfy this requirement because time off can be arranged as compensation for this demand.
E.	No Other Compensation
The employee who is receiving this pay differential is not eligible for any other additional compensation for the type and nature of the above described work.
Department decisions not to submit arduous pay requests to the Department of Personnel Administration, and DPA decisions to deny arduous pay, shall not be subject to the grievance or arbitration provisions of this agreement.
7.10	Telecommute/Telework Program
A.	Where operational considerations permit, a department may establish a telework program. If the telework arrangement conforms to telework criteria established in the department’s telework policy and guidelines, no employee’s request for telework shall be unreasonably denied. Such programs shall operate within the policies, procedures, and guidelines established by the Telework Advisory Group.
B.	Formal written telework or telecommuting policies and programs already adopted by departments before the date of this Contract will remain in effect during the term of this Contract.
C.	Departments that desire to establish a telework or telecommuting policy and/or program or departments desiring to change an existing policy and/or program shall first notify the Union. Within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of such notification, the Union may request to meet and confer over the impact of a telework or telecommuting policy and/or program or change in an existing telework or telecommuting policy and/or program.

8.1	Employee Retirement Contribution Reduction for Miscellaneous Members
If the Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) informs the parties in writing that it has determined that the recent temporary arrangement whereby state employees were relieved of paying into their retirement fund may be extended for 12 months and that such an extension would be fiduciarily sound and meet the Board’s established actuarial standards, which in turn provide temporary cash flow relief to the State, the parties will agree to the following:

F.	Address Confidentiality
Employee work and home addresses shall be maintained as confidential by CAPS.

An affected employee will be notified of the existence of such a court order or subpoena.
C.	Evaluation material or material relating to an employee's conduct, attitude, or service shall not be included in his/her official personnel file without being signed and dated by the author of such material.

G.	Materials relating to an employee's performance included in the employee's official departmental personnel file shall be retained for a period of time specified by each department, except that at the request of the employee, materials of a negative nature shall be purged after three years. This provision, however, does not apply to formal adverse actions as defined in applicable Government Code Sections or to material of a negative nature for which actions have occurred during the intervening three-year period. Except that, by mutual agreement between a department head or designee and an employee, an adverse action material may be removed.
19.4	Release Time for State Personnel Board
Upon two working days' advance notice, the State shall provide reasonable time off without loss of compensation for a reasonable number of employees to attend hearings conducted by the California State Personnel Board during the employee's normal work hours provided that the employee is either: (1) a party to the hearing proceedings (e.g., an appellant), or (2) is specifically affected by the results of the hearing and has been scheduled to appear or testify by the State Personnel Board.

C.	Employees riding in vanpools shall be eligible for a 75 percent (75%) reimbursement of the monthly fee up to a maximum of $65 per month. In lieu of the van pool rider reimbursement, the State shall provide $100 per month to each State employee who is the primary vanpool driver, meets the eligibility criteria, and complies with program procedures as developed by the state for primary van pool drivers. This shall not be considered compensation for purposes of retirement contributions. A vanpool is defined as a group of seven or more people who commute together in a vehicle (State or non-State) specially designed to carry an appropriate number of passengers. The State may establish and implement procedures and eligibility criteria for the administration of this benefit.
D.	Employees headquartered out of State shall receive reimbursement for qualified public transportation and vanpool expenses for 75 percent (75%) of the cost up to a maximum of $65 per month or in the case of the primary van pool driver, the $100 per month rate. The appointing power may establish and implement procedures regarding the certification of expenses.
E.	For the term of this Agreement, the parties agree that the State may increase parking rates in existing owned or leased lots, in urban congested areas, no more than twenty dollars ($20) per month above the current rate charged to employees in specific locations where they park. Congested urban areas are such as Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, Fresno, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside and San Diego areas. Every effort shall be made to provide employees 60 days but no less than 30 days notice of a parking rate increase. The State shall not increase rates for existing parking lots where employees do not currently pay parking fees. Rates at new lots administered or leased by the State will be set at a level comparable to rates charged for similar lots in the area of the new lot, e.g. rates for open lots shall be compared to rates for open lots, rates for covered parking shall be compared with rates for covered parking.
F.	The State shall continue a system for employees where parking fees may be paid with pre-tax dollars.
G.	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, the Union agrees that the State may implement new policies or change existing ones in such as transit subsidies, vanpool/carpool incentives, walking/biking incentives, parking, parking fees, hours of work, and other actions to meet the goals of transportation incentives. The State agrees to notify and meet-and-confer regarding the impact of such new or changed policies.
19.7	Group Legal Services
The State of California agrees to contract for an employee-paid group legal services plan. The plan will emphasize a choice of providers and access to legal services.

A.	Telecommute Policy
The CalEPA Telecommute Policy shall be implemented and available to all scientists throughout the State employed by the CalEPA.
B.	Commute Mitigation
1.	Alternate Transportation Support - The State and CAPS agree that the State shall encourage employees to use alternate means of transportation to commute to and from work in order to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality.
2.	Incidental Use Parking - CalEPA shall develop an “Incidental Use Parking Program” for employees who use alternate means of transportation to commute to and from work. Upon 24 hours notice, employees who self-certify that they are using alternate transportation to commute to and from work at least three times per week, shall be eligible to park for up to two days per pay period in a CalEPA paid parking space set aside for this purpose.
3.	Guaranteed Ride Home Program - This program exists through the Sacramento Transportation Management Association. This program allows employees who use alternative transportation at least three time per week to obtain transportation in the case of emergency or unanticipated approved overtime that precludes the use of their regular ride home. Eligible employees may use the program up to six times in a 12-month period. All CalEPA boards, departments and offices will maintain membership in this organization in order to provide this benefit to all qualifying employees.
C.	Parking
1.	Parking Lot Waiting List - For purposes of allocating available parking spaces to CalEPA employees who were not assigned a lottery number on August 3, 2000, the following priority order shall be used after September 1, 2000: 1) handicapped, 2) car/vanpools and shared permits with at least two CalEPA employees, and 3) all others, on a first come first served basis, without exceptions.
2.

D.	Bicycle Transportation
A.	Bicycle Storage Fee Reimbursement - Employees charged a bicycle storage fee shall be eligible for reimbursement of $15.00 per month from when the employee relocates to the CalEPA building. This shall not be considered compensation for purposes of retirement contributions. The State may establish and implement procedures for the administration of this benefit.
B.	Bicycle Storage Assignments - Bicycle storage shall be assigned based on commute days, by lottery numbers, and in accordance with the following priority: 1) five days per week, 2) four days per week, and 3) three days per week. CalEPA shall notify each bicyclist of storage arrangements beginning October 1, 2000. Advance acceptance of the storage assignment may be submitted to appropriate administrative officials. After assignments are final at each bicycle storage area, each employee may then request to be placed on a waiting list for specific bicycle storage areas. Placement on a waiting list shall be based on a first come, first served basis. Upon satisfactory proof of the need for such accommodation, bicycle commuters who require special needs accommodations shall have priority over all others commuting the same number of days per week.
The CalEPA Bicycle Storage Area is not scheduled to be available for parking until December 2000. Employees with permits may either park bicycles in general work areas of a CalEPA sponsored Pilot Project, or use available bicycle storage facilities located at 901 P Street, or any other state building.
C.	City Storage Fee Reimbursement - Employees who commute to and from work by bicycle at least three days per week shall be eligible for reimbursement of the fee charged by the City for bicycle parking until the bicycle storage facilities in the new building are available for use, and afterwards, if the facilities in the new building are fully utilized.
E.	Clothing Lockers
Priority assignment shall be given to employees who commute by bicycle or on foot by lottery number and in accordance with the following priority: 1) five days per week, 2) four days per week, 3) three days per week. Employees who commute to and from work by bicycle or on foot who were not assigned a lottery number, shall be assigned available clothing lockers in accordance with the same priority and on a first-come, first-served basis. Employees requiring a clothes locker to meet special needs accommodations shall be assigned a clothes locker upon satisfactory proof of the need for such accommodation. All other clothing lockers shall be utilized on a first-come first-served basis.
F.	Safety Committee
CalEPA agrees to establish a Safety Committee to review and discuss safety issues and concerns applicable to the employees of CalEPA and its Boards, Departments and Offices (BDO) located at the new CalEPA Headquarters building at 1001 I Street in Sacramento. The Committee shall meet quarterly and participants shall include the safety officer from each BDO and one representative from each bargaining unit willing to participate. The Committee shall establish Bylaws that may or may not be based on any such existing committees, so long as they are not in conflict with the Memoranda of Understanding for each participating bargaining unit.

G.	Building Card Key Costs
Employees are responsible for their building card keys. Except in cases of loss and/or damage due to negligence, building card keys will be replaced at no cost to employees up to two times per year.
H.	Implementation
Where necessary, CalEPA shall develop procedures to implement any of the above programs.
19.10	Contracting Out
A.	Purpose. CAPS has presented evidence that State departments are presently contracting out work appropriately done by Unit 10 employees, and that said contracting results in unnecessary additional costs to the State. Thus, the purpose of this section is to guarantee that the State does not incur unnecessary, additional costs by contracting out work appropriately performed at less expense to the State by Unit 10 employees, consistent with the terms of this section. In achieving this purpose the parties do not intend this section to expand the State’s ability to contract out for personal services. The parties agree that this section shall not be interpreted or applied in a manner which results in a disruption of services provided by state departments.
B.	Policy Regarding Personal Services Contracts and Cost Savings. Except in extremely unusual or urgent, time-limited circumstances, or under other circumstances where contracting out is recognized or required by law, Federal mandate, or court decisions/orders, the State must make every effort to hire, utilize and retain Unit 10 employees before resorting to the use of private contractors. Contracting may also occur for reasons other than cost savings as recognized or required by law, Federal mandate, or court decisions/orders.
C.	Information Regarding Contracts To Be Let
1.	Departments will provide CAPS’ designated representative with copies of Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and Invitations for Bid (IFBs) for personal services contracts when released for publication if they call for services found in Unit 10 class specifications.
2.	To the extent that a department is preparing to enter into a contract (or amend a contract) and it does not require an RFP or IFB, the department shall provide CAPS’ designated representatives with a copy of the Standard Form 215 (or its departmental equivalent) if and when the Form 215 is completed, provided the contract is/will be for services found in Unit 10 class specifications. If the Form 215 contains confidential or proprietary information, it shall be redacted as discussed below in subsection D.2.
3.	The purpose of subsection C is to provide CAPS with notice and an opportunity to present alternatives which mitigate or avoid the need for contracting out, while still satisfying the needs of the State to provide services. Directors (or their designee) shall therefore meet with CAPS for this purpose, if requested by CAPS.

BU 10
03-06
D.	Labor/Management Committee To Review Personal Service Contracts In Existence
1.	A State Joint labor/management committee shall be established. It shall consist of representatives of CAPS, the Department of Personnel Administration, the Department of Finance and affected departments. The first meeting of this committee shall occur no later than 10 working days from ratification of the MOU, and shall be for purposes of determining the procedures by which the committee will operate. An initial review of all currently existing contracts as requested by the committee shall be completed within six (6) months from ratification of this agreement. However, if this deadline cannot be met due to the number or complexity of existing contracts for review, the committee may mutually agree to extend this deadline.
2.	Upon request of the committee (or either party on the committee) each department shall submit copies of any or all personal services contracts that call for services found in Unit 10 class specifications. For each contract, departments shall provide additional documents establishing the number, scope, duration, justification, total costs of all such contracts, and payment of all overhead and administrative costs paid through each contract, provided it does not disclose confidential or proprietary information, in which case it shall be redacted as discussed below. The requested contract and related information shall be provided as soon as reasonably possible. The parties expect that this shall be provided no more than 21 calendar days following the request by the joint labor/management committee, or longer if approved by the committee. This shall include contracts that may otherwise be protected from public disclosure, if they provide for services found in Unit 10 class specifications. However, the State may redact those portions of protected contract(s) that are proprietary, necessary to protect the competitive nature of the bid process, and that which does not pertain to the costing of personnel services found in Unit 10 classes. The goal shall be to protect against disclosure of information which should remain confidential, while at the same time providing the committee with sufficient information to determine whether unnecessary, additional costs are being incurred by contracting out work found in Unit 10 class specifications. Costing information provided to the committee for protected contracts shall include total personnel costs for personnel services found in Unit 10 classifications plus any overhead charges paid to the contractor for these services, provided such disclosure does not breach confidentiality requirements or include proprietary information.
3.	Within 10 workdays after receipt of the personal service contracts and associated documents as provided for in subsection D.2. above, the committee shall begin reviewing the contracts. The committee shall examine the contracts based on the purpose of this section, the terms of the contracts, all applicable laws, Federal mandates and court decisions/orders. In this regard, the committee will consider which contracts should and can be terminated immediately, which contracts will take additional time to terminate, which contracts may continue (for how long and under what conditions) and how (if necessary and cost effective) to transition contract employees or positions into civil service. All determinations shall be through express mutual agreement of the committee. Committee determinations regarding contracts let by the Department of Corrections shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in subsection F below.
4.	The committee will continue to meet as necessary to examine personal services contracts which have been let.
99
BU 10
03-06
5.	If savings are generated by the terminations of personal service contracts under this provision, it is the intent of the State to implement findings of the committee for utilization of said savings. Such findings may include:
a.	Contributing toward position reductions which would otherwise be accomplished by the layoff, salary reduction or displacement of Unit 10 employees.
b.	Enabling the employment of Unit 10 employees for services currently performed by contractors.
c.	Enabling of the conversion to Unit 10 civil service employment of qualified contract employees who wish to become State employees, as otherwise permitted by law, regulations, provisions of the contracts and resolutions by the State Personnel Board.
d.	Providing timely, adequate and necessary recruitment efforts. These efforts may include focused recruitment, publicizing in professional journals, use of the media, job fairs, expedited hiring, expedited background checks, spot testing authorized by the SPB, State employee registries, and recruitment and retention incentives.
e.	Such other purposes as may be mutually agreed upon by the joint labor/management committee.
E.	Displacement Avoidance
1.	The objective of this subsection is to ensure that Unit 10 employees have preference over contract employees consistent with, but not limited to the following principles:
a.	The duties at issue are consistent with the Unit 10 employee’s classification;
b.	The Unit 10 employee is qualified to perform the job; and
c.	There is no disruption in services.
2.	To avoid or mitigate Unit 10 employee displacement for lack of work, the appointing power shall review all existing personal services contracts to determine if work consistent with the affected employee’s classification is being performed by a contractor. Displacement includes layoff, involuntary demotion, involuntary transfer to a new class, involuntary transfer to a new location requiring a change of residence, and time base reductions. If the joint labor/management committee that reviews personal services contracts determines that the terms and purpose of the contract permit the State to assign the work to a Unit 10 employee who would otherwise be displaced, this shall be implemented consistent with the other terms of this section. The State and CAPS shall meet and confer for purposes of entering into an agreement about the means by which qualified employees are notified and provided with such assignments. This shall include developing a process that ensures that savings realized by terminating the contract and reassigning the work to a Unit 10 employee to avoid displacement, are utilized to offset that employee’s moving and relocation costs, the amount for which shall be consistent with Section 6.2 of the parties’ collective bargaining agreement.

F.	Department of Corrections
1.	This section shall not be applicable to the Department of Corrections until such time as it has been approved by the Federal court special master(s). Nothing in this section shall be interpreted or applied in such a manner as to interfere with Federal court orders, the authority of the Federal court or the authority of the special masters.
2.	The Department of Corrections shall present this section to the special master(s) immediately in writing upon ratification of this agreement. The parties agree to make themselves immediately available to meet with the special master, on a schedule determined by the special master.
3.	No contract for services by the Department of Corrections shall be prohibited, modified, restricted or terminated by virtue of this memorandum of understanding or by operation of the joint labor/management committee established by this memorandum of understanding without approval of the special masters in Madrid v. Alameida et. al (as it pertains to contracts effecting Pelican Bay State Prison), and/or the Special Master in the Coleman litigation (as it pertains to contracts effecting Coleman Class members), and/or counsel for the parties in the Plata litigation or the Plata court (as it pertains to contracts effecting medical care for Plata class members).
4.	If this section is not approved by the special master the parties agree to reopen negotiations for the purpose of agreeing on an alternative contracting out provision, with the goal of satisfying the concerns of the Federal court and CAPS.
G.	Relationship Between this Section and Related Statutes. The State is mindful of the constitutional and statutory obligations (e.g., Government Code Section 19130) as it pertains to restriction on contracting out. Thus, nothing in this section is intended to interfere with pursuit of remedies for violation of these obligations as provided by law (e.g., Public Contracts Code Section 10337).
ARTICLE 20 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND DURATION
20.1	Entire Agreement
A.	This Agreement sets forth the full and entire understanding of the parties regarding the matters contained herein, and any other prior or existing understanding or agreement by the parties, whether formal or informal, regarding any such matters are hereby superseded.

1.	Where such changes would affect the working conditions of a significant number of employees in Unit 10.
2.	Where the subject matter of the change is within the scope of representation pursuant to the Dills Act.
3.	Where CAPS requests to negotiate with the State.
Any agreement resulting from such negotiations shall be executed in writing and shall become an addendum to this Agreement.
