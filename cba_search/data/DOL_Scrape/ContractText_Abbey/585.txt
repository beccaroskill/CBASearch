Every effort will be made to provide prompt notice to the employee when the request has been granted.
The sales or support manager has the discretion and authority to grant reasonable requests for a schedule change, provided that granting such requests does not impair the needs of the business. While business needs must take priority, a spirit of mutual cooperation between managers and associates will go a long way in satisfactorily resolving scheduling
issues.

Re:	Merchandise Returns and Calculation of Commissions
Dear Mrs. Torres:
This side letter of agreement is to reaffirm the parties’ understanding with respect to when commissions are earned and how Bloomingdale’s factors in returns with respect to the calculation of commissions paid to employees who are on a commission pay plan. Since at least as far back as the 1950 collective bargaining agreement commissions have been calculated and paid only after “net” sales have been determined which is total sales minus returns (identified and unidentified) (1950 CBA, page 5, ^D “all departments which presently pay 1% or 2% commission on net sales shall continue such commission payments;” 1974 CBA, p. 65:commission on 40% of net sales by Evenin^Saturday employees to be shared by regular employees; 1976 CBA, p. 74: commission on 50% of net sales to be pro-rated; 1989 CBA, p. 17, V(a): “Total net sales means total sales (excluding fees and handling charges) net of returns.”)
Commissions are not earned at the point of sale or on sales made in excluded departments. Examples of excluded departments include but are not limited to: applicable taxes, alteration fees, monogramming, back office discounts, handling fees, delivery fees and gifts with purchase. Commissions are only earned on sales made in non-excluded departments and only after all identified returns and allocated pro-rata portion of unidentified returns are processed and allocated against an employee’s sales in non-excluded departments for that pay period; and only after all draw/deficit calculations have been completed. Both identified and unidentified returns are allocated against sales during the pay period in which the returns are processed, regardless of when the returned merchandise was sold.
The parties also reaffirm their understanding that the amount (percentage) of returns (unidentified and identified) to be allocated against total sales of each commissioned employee before commissions are calculated has always been a mandatory subject of bargaining and will remain so (1978 CBA, p. 78, V (66%); 1996 CBA, p. 18,5[12 (80%)).

Re: Storeworkers Security Plan
Dear Mrs. Torres,
For many years the Storeworkers Security Plan, (SWSP) has provided health care benefits to bargaining unit members. In order to ensure the continued viability of the SWSP the parties have mutually agreed to maintain the following requirements.
(a)	Except as provided in Section (b) hereof for the term of the Agreement, the Company shall continue to contribute to the Store workers Security Plan Trust 9.0% of total earnings as set forth in the predecessor collective bargaining agreements less $250,000.00 per year for the term of this agreement. For each month remaining in 2004 from January 1 to December 31 beginning with the month that Bloomingdale’s assumes responsibility for the Accident and Disability Benefits Plan, Bloomingdale’s will deduct $20,833.34 from its payments to the SWSP.
(b)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this or any other document (including, without limitation the Agreement and Declaration of Trust establishing the Storeworkers Security Plan or the plan of benefits of the Storeworkers Security Plan Trust), the obligation of the Company to contribute to the Storeworkers Security Plan Trust will terminate 90 days after written notice pursuant to paragraph (c) from the Company to the Union and the SWSP at any time if one or more of the following events does not occur:
(i)	The Storeworkers Security Plan Trust will continue to maintain the currently in force fiduciary liability insurance policy (as well the nonrecourse rider with respect to that policy) and a fidelity bond that satisfies the requirements of Section 412 of ERISA, and the Storeworkers Security Plan Trust will continue to maintain such policy and bond or its progeny in effect throughout the term of this Agreement (subject to Section (b)(ii) below).
1000 Third Avenue. New York, New York 10022 (212) 705-2000
(ii)	Upon the expiration of the currently in force fiduciary liability insurance policy, the Trustees will secure a fiduciary liability insurance policy. The Trustees will use their best efforts to secure a policy providing a maximum coverage limitation of no less than $3 million (or, if greater, the coverage limitation of the expiring policy) and no deductible.
(iii)	By no later than March 1, 2005, and continuing throughout the term of this Agreement, the responsibility for the day-to-day administration of the Storeworkers Security Plan Trust has been transferred to either (A) a professional, independent third party administrator with substantial, experience in the administration and operation of multiemployer health benefit plans; or (B) a newly retained professional plan administrator with substantial experience administering multi-employer plans, or (c) a combination thereof.
(iv)	By no later than January 1, 2005, and continuing throughout the term of this Agreement, the Storeworkers Security Plan Trust will (A) retain an actuarial consulting firm with no less than 20 professional employees (including at least one enrolled actuary with at least 10 years’ experience in the multiemployer health plan sector) with significant experience in actuarial consulting for multiemployer health benefits plans; and (B) retain as counsel a law firm that serves as legal counsel to at least 10 other unrelated multiemployer health benefit plans, which firm agrees to staff on the Storeworkers Security Plan Trust’s account an attorney specializing primarily in employee benefits law.
(v)	The Agreement and Declaration of Trust establishing the Storeworkers Security Plan is amended effective no later than October 1, 2004, and continuing throughout the term of this Agreement, to (A) reduce the number of Trustees to two Union Trustees and two Employer Trustees (with both such Employer Trustees to be designated solely by, and to be removable solely by, the Company); (B) to reduce the number of Trustees required for a quorum necessary to transact business to two Union Trustees and two Employer Trustees; and (C) that the Company and the Union recommend that the Trustees amend the Trust Agreement to provide for alternate Trustees.
(yi) As of January 31 of each year of the term of this Agreement, (A) the Storeworkers Security Plan Trust maintains no less than six months’ reserves; and (B) the audited financial statements of the Storeworkers Security Plan Trust indicate that the assets of the St ore workers Security Plan Trust (excluding the Storeworkers Security Sub-Fund) exceed the benefit obligations (calculated under S.O.P. 92-6 or its
r
progeny) of the Storeworkers Security Plan Trust (excluding the Storeworkers Security Sub-Fund).
(vii)	By no later than December 31, 2004, the Storeworkers Security Plan Trust has had no less than two regular Board of Trustees meetings or conference call meetings.
(viii)	Beginning January 1,2005 and throughout the term of this Agreement, Board of Trustees meetings or conference call meetings are held no less frequently than four times per year.
(ix)	By July 31 of each year during the term of this Agreement, all Trustees receive copies of certified financial statements for the Storeworkers Security Plan Trust for the plan year most recently ended, which statements have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
(c)	If the Company makes written notice pursuant to paragraph (b) that any one or more of the requirements in paragraph (b) (i) through (ix) has not occurred, there will be a further ninety (90) days from the date of the notice for consultation among the parties and for such requirements to be cured before the Company may exercise its right to terminate its obligation to contribute to the Storeworkers Security Plan.
(d)	Solely in the event that the obligation of the Company to contribute to the Storeworkers Security Plan Trust is terminated by the Company in accordance with Section (b) hereof, effective 90 days after the curing period of paragraph (c), bargaining unit employees shall be covered under the plan of benefits maintained by the Company for non-bargaining unit employees of the Company (subject to any eligibility and enrollment requirements of such plan of benefits). The cost to bargaining unit employees under the Company’s health care plan(s) shall be negotiated by the Company and the Union commencing at the end of the 90 day curing period. If after 30 days following the end of the curing period the parties have not resolved the cost negotiations, the matter shall be submitted to expedited interest arbitration in order that a final and binding decision can be made within 90 days after the curing period has ended. During the transition of coverage from the SWSP to the plan(s) offered by the Company, there shall be no lapse in payments by the Company to the SWSP in order that SWSP coverage will be maintained until the completion of the transition.
(e)	It is further expressly understood and agreed that notwithstanding any other provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, no disputes or disagreements with respect to any issue arising out of this article regarding the Storeworkers Security Plan shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of the
contract with the exception of paragraph (a) and the interest arbitration set forth in paragraph (d) above.
(f)	With the exception of paragraph (a) effective May 1, 2008 this Article shall be null and void for all purposes and shall have no further force or effect.
(g)	This letter of agreement constitutes the complete agreement between the parties with respect to the issues addressed herein. No changes to the express provisions of this agreement may be made except by mutual agreement of the parties in writing. This letter of agreement will be binding on the parties’ successors and assigns.
