AGREEMENT
(1) This Agreement, entered into as of the 1 st day of July 2003, by and between the Associated General Contractors of Northwest Ohio, Inc., Labor Relations Division (hereinafter referred to as “Employer”) and Local No. 500, Laborers’ International Union of North America and Laborers’ District Council of Ohio (hereinafter referred to as the “Union”).
(a) It is specifically understood and agreed that the Laborers’ District Council of Ohio, as an entity, separate and apart from the Local Unions of which it is comprised, shall not be liable hereunder for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to acts of local unions which are members of Laborers’ District Council of Ohio.
ARTICLE I TERM OF AGREEMENT
(2)	This Agreement shall become effective July 1,2003, and shall remain in full force and effect until midnight June 30,2007, and from year to year thereafter unless either party desires to modify or terminate the Agreement and files a notice in writing of its desire to terminate or modify at least sixty (60) days prior to midnight June 30,2007, or prior to midnight June 30th of any subsequent year. The parties hereby waive any rights they may have to repudiate this Agreement during the term of the Agreement or during the term of any extension, modification or amendment to this Agreement.
ARTICLE I I COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT
(3)	The persons, firms, corporations, joint ventures or other business entities bound by the terms of this Agreement are referred to in this Agreement as “Employer" or “Em
1
ployers." The Employers and the Union, by entering into this Agreement, intend to and agree to establish a single multi-employer collective bargaining unit. Any Employer who becomes a party to this Agreement shall thereby become a member of the multi-employer collective bargaining unit established by this Agreement.
(4)	Employers covered by this Agreement shall be free to designate their own representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining and contract administration; however, such designation shall not affect the Employer’s membership in the collective bargaining unit established by this Agreement.
ARTICLE 111
UNION RECOGNITION I HIRING / NONDISCRIMINATION
(5)	UNION RECOGNITION. The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all employees performing work designated herein as building construction Laborers’ work with respect to hours of work, wages, rates of pay and all other conditions of employment.
(6)	Each Employer, in response to the Union's claim that it represents an uncoerced majority of each Employer’s employees, acknowledges and agrees there is no good faith doubt that the Union has been authorized to and in fact does represent such majority of employees. Therefore, the Union is hereby recognized as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining representative for the employees now or hereafter employed in the bargaining unit with respect to wages, hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment.
(7)	It is mutually agreed that all employees who on July 1, 2003, the effective date of this Agreement, are members of the Union shall, as a condition of employment, remain members of the Union in good standing for the term of this Agreement. All employees hired after the effective date of this Agreement and all employees who are not now members of the Union must, as a condition of employment, become and remain members in good standing on the 7th day following the beginning of their employment or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is the
2
later.
(8)	In interpreting good standing in the Union, the Employer shall not discharge any employee for non-membership in the Union if (1) he has reasonable grounds for believing that such membership was not available to the employee on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to all members, or (2) if he has reasonable grounds for believing that membership was denied orterminated for reasons other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and initiation fee uniformly required as a condition of acquiring and retaining membership in the Union.
(9)	HIRING. Upon the request of the Employer, the Union will, at times, furnish experienced men capable of performing the work of common labor, but the Employer may hire or discharge whomsoever he desires, within the limitations as set forth in paragraph (8), but the employee and the Union must be given a reason for discharge upon request.
(10)	Whenever the Employer adds to his Laborer work force, he shall have the free right to re-employ any Laborer employed by that Employer during the preceding six (6) months.

ADDENDUM A
HAZARDOUS WASTE REMOVAL AND LEAD ABATEMENT
For Laborers working in an exclusive or “hot” area with toxic or hazardous materials, one of the following personal protective equipment ensembles wilt be required for necessary protection against toxic contaminants.
LEVEL A (Wage Group A) to be worn only in established “safe zones” may consist of, from normal work clothes to normal skin protection such as gloves, face shields, goggles, coveralls and occasionally respiratory protection.
LEVEL B (Wage Group B) protective equipment includes a protective suit and an Air Purifying Respirator (APR) with the appropriate filter canisters. The ensemble is used when the contaminants are reliably known not to be hazardous to the skin and not IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health) and correct filter protection is available. This ensemble offers adequate protection for many jobs.
LEVEL C (Wage Group C) protective equipment includes a chemically resistant splash suit and SOBA or Airline Respirator. This ensemble is required when the situation is very hazardous, such as oxygen deficient atmospheres, IDLH atmospheres, or confined space entries, but the risk of skin exposure is not as great as in Level D situations. The Level C ensemble gives the second highest level of protection.
LEVEL D (Wage Group D) protective equipment is required when the area has been determined to contain extremely toxic contaminants or contaminants unknown but may be expected to be extremely toxic and / or Immediately Dangerous to Lite and Health (IDLH). This ensemble includes a fully encapsulated chemical suit (moon suit), Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), or Airline Fed Respirator, and various types and numbers of boots and gloves; cool vests and voice activated radios are optional equipment sometimes worn. Level D ensembles provide the highest level ol protection from contaminants, but places the greatest physical and mental stress on the worker.
