।	Section 1.2. Consolidation of Agreements. All of the provisions
of the agreements between the Company and the Union covering
1	the employees in each of the above-listed respective separate
I	bargaining units have been consolidated into this one Agreement

■	units.
Section 1.2
3
Section 1.3.	Application of Provisions. Unless the context otherwise dearly indicates, all provisions of this Agreement shall apply to all employees covered by this Agreement,
Section 1.4,	Agency Shop. All employees covered by this Agreement, who at the time of signing this Agreement are members of the Union in good standing, or shall hereafter become members of the Union, shall remain members in good standing for the term of this Agreement as a condition of employment, except as otherwise provided herein. After the signing of this Agreement, when employees are first employed in a classification covered by this Agreement they must, as a condition of employment, arrange within their first thirty (30) days of such employment to either (1) become a member of the Union in good standing, or.(2) to make payments (hereinafter referred to as substitute payments) to the Union of amounts equal to the uniformly required monthly dues they would have paid if they were members. The term "substitute payments" shall not include initiation fees which are not required of a non-member. The failure of employees to (1) maintain their membership in the Union in good standing or (2) to make substitute payments shall result in their discharge unless membership was terminated for reasons other than failure of the employees to tender initiation fees and periodic dues uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership. An employee may resign from membership by sending notice thereof in writing to the President of the Local Union by registered mail, return receipt requested.
Section 1.5.	Assignment and Authorization for Deduction of Initiation Fee, Dues, Substitute Payments, COPE Contributions, and Assessments.
a.	The Company will, hereafter, with respect to each employee who has individually and voluntarily authorized such deduction in writing in a form acceptable to the Company, deduct from the wages due an employee his/her membership dues or substitute payments, including:	’
Section 13. 1,4. 1.3
4
(1)	A duly authorized uniform initiation fee assessed by the Union,
(2)	Duly authorized membership dues (including such general assessments as may be a part thereof) levied by the Union.
(3)	Substitute payments.
(4)	Committee on Political Education (COPE) Contributions.
Any such authorization may be revoked at any time by the employee sending notice to the Paymaster of the Company by registered mail, return receipt requested. The Paymaster will promptly notify the Union of any such revocation by forwarding a copy of the revocation. As a convenience, the Company will continue to deduct dues of an employee transferred to a classification not covered by this Agreement during his/her trial period of six (6) months. The authorization will be automatically canceled when employment in the Company is terminated for any reason, or six (fi) months after an employee is so transferred. If such an employee returns to a bargaining unit during the term of this Agreement, he/she must, within thirty (30) days thereafter, again become and remain a member of the Union in good standing.
b.	The Company will remit to the Treasurer of the Union by the 10th day of each month the dues, substitute payments, COPE contributions, initiation fees, and general assessments deducted from employees' wages in the preceding month. If no pay is due an employee, or if for some other reason deductions are not made at the agreed times, the Company will attempt to make the overdue deductions later in the same month, if possible, after which the Company will not be responsible.
c.	Duly authorized and uniform initiation fees, substitute payments, COPE contributions, and dues (including such general assessments as may be a part thereof) shall be in the amounts
Section l.S

certified in writing to the Company over the signature of two (2) officers of the Local Union.
Section 1,6.	Successor Agreements.
a.	Successor Clause
(1)	Internal Sale or Transfer - In the event the Company changes ownership of ail or a part (i.e., a part employing permanent, full time bargaining unit employees) of its existing corporate operations by the sale or transfer of such operations to an existing or a newly created subsidiary or corporate affiliate, the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements shall be binding on any such subsidiary or affiliate.
(2)	External Sale of Transfer - In the event the Company sells, or otherwise divests itself of all or a part (i.e., a part employing permanent, full-time bargaining unit employees) of its corporate operations in any transaction where the collective bargaining agency and the rights of union represented employees are or may be affected, the transaction will be conditioned on the purchasing entity agreeing to recognition of Local 223 and, at a minimum, assumption of the arbitration, seniority, job retention, wage, benefit and pension provisions of the then existing Collective Bargaining Agreements. Such purchaser and the Union will negotiate to retain and/or modify other existing applicable Agreement provisions, and any other matters appropriate for such negotiations. Any disputes regarding which terms, if any, of such Collective Bargaining Agreements are not applicable must be resolved between the Union and the new or restructured entity by arbitration. It is the intention of the Company and the Union that such disputes be resolved expeditiously. Prior to closing, the Company will furnish Local 223 a minimum of 60 days notice of any transaction covered by the provisions of (1) and (2) above.
Sectian 1.6

b.	Worker Transition Program - The Company commits to developing jointly with Local 223 an industry worker transition program which shall provide skills upgrades, apprenticeships and training programs, voluntary separation packages consistent with reasonable business priorities, and job banks to coordinate and assist placement of Local 223 members into comparable employment at no less than their current wage rates and current or substantially equivalent fringe benefits. It is the Company’s further intention to seek recovery of the cost of such worker transition programs as a transition cost as permitted by applicable restructuring legislation and MPSC restructuring orders.
c.	Future Employment - In the event the Company, DTE Energy and/or any DTE affiliates, purchases or merges divisions, business units, or generating stations or generating units with any entity in the electric utility business anywhere in the United States, and additional employees are required, the Company shall offer employment to members of Local 223 who are qualified, but have been displaced from employment at Detroit Edison, provided that such employment offer is consistent with any then existing labor agreement covering the acquired or merged facility or business unit. In the event that DTE Energy acquires or merges with an entity where the employees are not represented by a union, the Company and Local 223 agree to conduct themselves in any union representation elections pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding between the parties regarding union representation elections.
d.	Duration of Successor Agreement Selection - This Successor Agreement Clause does not diminish the wages, hours working or other conditions of employment under existing or successor collective bargaining agreements. Also, this Successor Agreement Clause does not alter the rights and responsibilities of the parties in negotiations for successor
Serf tan 1.6

collective bargaining agreements, except that the provisions of this clause will continue in effect until January 1, 2008 unless changed by mutual agreement.
Article 2

The Company agrees, as part of the consideration of this Agreement, that neither the National Union, the Local Union, its officers, nor agents shall be liable for damages for unauthorized stoppages, strikes, intentional slowdowns, or suspensions of work in the respective bargaining units covered by this Agreement, if:	.

Section 21

Section 2.2.	No Coercion. Neither the Company nor the Union shall interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees either to join or refrain from joining the Union.
Section 2.3.	Fermi 2. Both the Union and Management recognize that the Company's ability to meet its obligation to employees, investors, and the general public is directly dependent upon the safe and continuous operation of Fermi 2, the Company's only nuclear plant. Recognizing this, both Management and Union agree that every effort should be made to assure continued, successful operation of Fermi 2. To accomplish the same, the Union and Management agree that during the period following contract expiration and the effective date of a new contract, the Union will give the Company 48 hours' advance written "notice of intent to strike" at Fermi 2 except that, from two weeks prior to the start of an outage associated with fuel reload through two weeks following the end of such an outage, or during any other major outage, the Union will give the Company seven days' advance written "notice of intent to strike" at Fermi 2 and employees will remain at work until properly relieved. If the Company relieves employees during any such notice period, the employees will be paid for all lost time from their regularly scheduled hours from time of relief to the expiration of said notice period. Further, the Union, its officers, agents, and members agree they will not sanction, condone, or participate in any unlawful picketing activity at the Fermi 2 plant. The Union further agrees that all Fermi 2 Local 223 represented employees will cross any picket lines at Fermi 2 until the expiration of the said 48 hour or seven day notice period.

If not resolved at this discussion stage, these disciplinary issues will go directly to Step 3.) No grievance that has been discussed with or through a Union representative will be adjusted unless a Union representative is present or has been offered the opportunity to be present. The immediate supervisor will have ten (10) days exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays horn the date the grievance is first discussed to provide a verbal answer to the grievant and/or Union representative.

Grievances which do not concern the meaning or application of the terms of this Agreement may not be submitted to arbitration, and will be considered to no longer exist. The question of whether a grievance is subject to arbitration may be arbitrated.
Section 4.4.	Persons Present.

It is understood that, except as otherwise specifically agreed to in writing by the Company, not more than three (3) employees of the Union's choosing shall be paid by the Company for the time lost from their regular working hours while attending Step 1, Step 2 and Step 3 hearings and for one (1) employee while attending arbitration.
Section 4.5.	Minutes. The Company will keep, prepare, and promptly submit to the Union minutes of each meeting held at Step 3, except as otherwise agreed, or except when a stenographic transcript is taken. If such a transcript is made, a copy of it will be promptly furnished to the Union.

Article 6 GRIEVANCES IN DISCHARGE, SUSPENSION, DECISION MAKING LEAVE, AND DEMOTION CASES
Unless otherwise agreed between the Company and the Union, prior to the discharge, suspension, decision making leave (DML), or demotion for cause of an employee, the Company will conduct a fact finding meeting with the Chairperson of the bargaining unit or, Acting Chairperson, or the Chairperson's designee. (See also Section 8,31 regarding the Supervisor's obligation to provide Union representation under other circumstances involving Positive Discipline.) Unless otherwise agreed between the Company and the Union, the Company will prepare and submit to the Union minutes of the fact finding meeting. Unless otherwise agreed between the Company and the Union, if an employee is discharged, suspended, given a DML, or demoted for cause, the Union shall be notified of such action promptly in writing by the Company. Notice will be addressed to the Local Union President and a copy mailed to the Chairperson of the bargaining unit in which the employee was working, or in the Chairperson’s absence the Vice Chairperson or Chief Steward. If the employee is not probationary, the employee or the Union may. within twenty (20) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) of notice to the Union, file a written grievance directly with the President of the Company to protest such action without taking the preliminary steps of the grievance procedure set forth in Section 2 of Article 4. It-is recognized that such a grievance should be heard at the earliest possible time and take precedence over grievances of a different nature. Therefore, such employee shall have the right to a prompt hearing on such charges before the President of the Company or the President's Delegate, with full power and authority to sustain or alter the severity of the discharge, suspension, DML, or demotion, or to otherwise settle the grievance. The President of the Company or the President's Delegate shall report his/her decision in writing, mailed or delivered to the Local Union office within five (5) calendar days after the conclusion of such hearing. However, if a stenographic transcript is made of the hearing, the conclusion of the hearing will be considered to be the day such transcript is placed in the hands of the President of the Company or the President’s Delegate.

Section 6
1$
the Union is not satisfied with the decision of the President or the President's Delegate) the Union may submit- such grievance to arbitration in accordance with Article 5 hereof within sixty (60) calendar days after the date of mailing by the Company to the Local Union office of the decision on such grievance. If not so submitted within such sixty (60) calendar days, the grievance shall be considered to no longer exist. If so submitted to arbitration within sixty (60) calendar days, the power of the arbitrator shall be limited to either upholding the disciplinary action as stated in the decision of the President or the President's Delegate or vacating such disciplinary action. If the arbitrator vacates a discharge, DML, suspension, or demotion, the arbitrator shall order the employee returned to his/her former job with full seniority and compensation for all time and wages lost. The discharge, suspension, DML, or demotion of a probationary employee shall not be the subject of a grievance or arbitration.
Article 7 SENIORITY
Section 7,1.	Service Defined. Length of employment in the Company (including the length of all previous periods of employment in the Company) shall be known as "service". Benefits, such as vacations, pay during absence, pension, and the layoff allowance, are based on service.
Section 7.2.	Seniority Defined. Seniority is the relationship of one employee to other employees on the same seniority list within a bargaining unit or bargaining units. A seniority list establishes the order by which the employees listed thereon will be considered, as provided in this Agreement, for layoffs, rehiring, promotions, and permanent transfers between and within bargaining units covered by this Agreement.
Section 7.3.	Acquiring Seniority, a. Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, an employee acquires seniority in a bargaining unit or bargaining units by working in one or more classifications covered by a single seniority list in that bargaining unit for a continuous period of six (6) months. Seniority, when acquired, dates back to the time when
Section 7 J, 22,73
16
such continuous employment began and accumulates so long as such employment continues.
b. An employee who has not acquired twelve (12) months of service is a probationary employee.
Section 7.4.	Seniority Lists, a. The seniority status of each present employee shall be that which has been determined by the present seniority lists. The established practices of occupational groups, divisions, and departments shall continue for the term of this Agreement, unless changed by mutual agreement.
b.	The Company will cooperate with the Union in working out a mutually satisfactory method of* showing the seniority status of employees. The Company will furnish each month to the Chairperson of each unit the names of those employees who have acquired seniority in the unit during the month, and send a copy to the President of the Local Union. Seniority lists shall be brought up to date each January 15 and July 15 and posted by the Company, and one (1) copy of each list shall be furnished to the President of the Local Union and at least five (5) copies to the Chairperson of the unit involved. Such seniority lists shall be deemed to be correct as to the seniority of all employees except those who question the same within twenty (20) days after such lists are posted by the Company. Employees who could not see the list at the time of posting because of illness, vacation, work assignment, or similar cause shall have twenty (20) days after their opportunity to see the list to question their position. All such objections shall be considered and processed as grievances.
c.	Employees added to any of the seniority lists in each bargaining unit shall have their seniority determined as provided in this Agreement, except as otherwise agreed by the parties. When two employees start on a seniority list on the same day, the senior employee shall be the one with the longer continuous employment in. the occupational group- In the Production Organization the term occupational group as used in Paragraph c of this Section 7.4 means occupational group within a single bargaining unit. If this does not
Section 7.4
17
break the tie, reference shall be made successively to cumulative employment in the division, then department, and finally the Company,
Section 7,5.	Transfers at Employee's Request, a. Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph c of this Section 7,5, employees who transfer from one seniority list or bargaining unit to another at their own request will continue to accumulate seniority on the seniority list from which they transferred for a period of six (6) months from the date of transfer. During this six (6) month period, the employees will be on trial to demonstrate their qualifications and abilities for the work in their new classification. If found not qualified for such work by the Management during this period, the employees will be returned to their former bargaining unit and classification without prejudice. At the end of this six (6) month trial period, if retained, their seniority will be established on their new seniority list retroactively to the date of transfer, and the employees' seniority on their former seniority list will cease to accumulate but will be retained as of the date of transfer and may be exercised only in the event of layoff.
b.	Employees may voluntarily return to their former seniority list and classification within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of transfer without prejudice, .
c.	(Exception to Paragraph a of this Section 7,5:) Both parties recognize that in some instances six (6) months may not be a sufficient period of time in which to adequately judge the qualifications and abilities of an apprentice in training. In the event an apprentice in training does not pass required classroom work, the employee will be permitted one (1) repeat session for each course failed during each term of the training program provided the employee is otherwise progressing satisfactorily. Should a second attempt in any course also result in failure, the apprentice may be dropped from the training program and classification. If such employee, because of classroom work or on-the-job performance, is found not qualified after having been longer than six (6) months in the training program, the employee shall be returned to his/her former classification, if any, and the employee will be credited with an additional six (6) months of seniority in his/her former classification. If such employee has no former classification to which the
Section 7,5
18
employee can be returned, the Company will attempt to place the employee on other work which the employee is qualified to perform but, in such event, the employee will not be credited with seniority in the newfound classification.
d.	If an employee transfers to a classification not covered by this Agreement, the employee will continue to accumulate seniority on the seniority list from which the employee transferred for a period of six (6) months from the date of transfer, or longer if mutually agreed. If the employee becomes permanently assigned to the classification, the employee's seniority will be adjusted so that accumulation stops as of the initial date of the transfer. The terms of Section 1.4 (Agency Shop) apply while seniority is being accumulated. If such an employee wants his/her deduction of dues to continue beyond the period provided by Section 1.5 (Assignment and Authorization for Deduction of Initiation Fee, Dues, and Assessments) the employee must sign a statement to that effect.
Section 7.6.	Transfers by Management. Whenever in the course of changes such as reorganization or transfers of work from one division or department to another, Management shall permanently transfer an employee from one division or department to another, and the transferred employee will be placed in the classification most like his/her previous work. New seniority lists for the classifications in which employees are placed as the result of such transfers will be made up, and all employees on these new lists will have their respective seniorities adjusted to include all service with the Company in the classification and all like classifications, except that where seniority has been terminated, prior service shall not be included unless otherwise agreed.	■	‘
Section 7.7.	Temporary Assignments, a. An employee who is assigned to a classification on another seniority list on a temporary basis will not accumulate seniority on that list. However, if the assignment is continuous and the vacancy is posted as a permanent vacancy, the employee's seniority, if the employee is selected to fill the permanent vacancy, will be established on his/her old and new seniority lists as of the date of the temporary assignment.
Section 7.6, 7.7
19
b. In the Civil and Specialty Trades Occupational Group of Substations and the Maintenance Occupational Group of Fermi 2 or Power Generation, if a shortage of work in the regular classification makes it necessary to assign one or more employees to another classification in their bargaining unit, and such assignment is expected to last ten (10) working days or more, the employees with the Least seniority shall be so assigned, provided reasonable qualifications and abilities are not significantly different, and no change in headquarters or work area is required. "Significant difference" shall be "head and shoulders difference", and such factors as advance licenses or Step-up experience shall not of themselves amount to significant differences.
Section 7.8.	Incapacitated Employees. An employee represented by the Union who becomes incapacitated for his/her regular work may he placed at any work the employee can do without regard to the seniority provisions of this Agreement, and upon recuperation shall be returned to his/her former classification or the classification the employee would be entitled to through qualifications and accumulated seniority. The seniority of such an employee will accumulate only on his/her former seniority list.
Section 7.9.	Leave of Absence. An employee on leave of absence will continue to accumulate seniority, and at the termination of the leave the employee will be returned to his/her former classification or, if that classification no longer exists, to the classification the employee is entitled to by qualifications and seniority, provided the employee is able to perform its duties. The terms of Section 1.4 (Agency Shop), apply while seniority is being accumulated.
Section 7.10.	Seniority of Employees Promoted to Supervisory or Staff Positions. If an employee is or has been promoted from a classification covered by this Agreement to a supervisory or staff position and is thereafter transferred back through a layoff, the employee’s seniority will be the seniority the employee had at the time of promotion. The rules for accumulation of seniority, as set forth in this Section 7.5, shall apply to these promotions.
Section 7.<t 7 9 7.10
20
Section 7.11.	Layoffs or Reductions. a. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Company finds it necessary to lay off or reduce an employee or employees from a classification or a seniority list, the Company will notify the Local Union President of the matter in writing and will negotiate with the Union to formulate a program for spreading the work, transferring employees, or taking some other appropriate action including but not limited to monetary incentives to allow employees in affected classifications to voluntarily leave the Company, retraining to allow employees to qualify for other jobs, temporary placement into other jobs at other locations and temporary placement into special projects. If the parties are unable to agree on such a program within thirty (30) days after the matter is first brought to the attention of the Union, the procedure outlined below shall apply.
b. If it becomes necessary to reduce the force by laying off employees from any seniority list, the employee with the least seniority on that list I	shall be laid off first, provided the employee can be replaced with a
I	qualified employee having higher seniority.
I
1	c. Any employee who is being laid off from a seniority list may, at
I	his/her own request, use seniority the employee retains on any other
seniority list to displace an employee on such other seniority list whose |	seniority is less than his/her own thereon; or to displace any
probationary employee in his/her bargaining unit, provided, in either I	case, that the employee is qualified to perform the work available. To
maintain the integrity of Fermi 2 and to protect seniority, the parties '	have agreed that the number of Maintenance Occupational Group
employees permitted to bump into Fermi 2 will be limited to a number equaling 10% of the number of Maintenance Occupational Group ।	employees employed at Fermi 2 in any year (365 day period).
I	Management may, at its discretion, accept a number greater than 10%.
।	Any employee who thus transfers and displaces a probationary
employee or a junior employee on some other seniority list will retain
1	his/her seniority indefinitely on the seniority list from which the
employee was laid off. In case the employee is restored to the seniority list from which the employee was laid off, his/her seniority on the list from which the employee was laid off shall include the time spent on the seniority list or lists to which the employee was transferred during
Section 7.11
21
I
the period of layoff. And, if restored to the seniority list from which the employee was laid off, the employee will be given no seniority credit on the list or lists to which the employee was assigned during the period of layoff.	,
d.	The Company will attempt to place any employee who is being laid off from his/her seniority list at work he/she is qualified to do in his/her own or other departments before hiring new employees for such work from outside the Company. If placed, the employee's seniority on the list from which the employee was laid off will be retained and accumulate in the same manner as if the employee had replaced a junior employee under Paragraph c of this Section 7.11.
e.	If the affected employees have not been placed under Paragraphs a, b, c, or d of this Section 7.11, the employees will be offered work currently being performed by contractors which they can perform or be expected to perform with reasonable training. To meet this end, the parties commit to discuss and reach mutual agreement on how to accomplish the above.
f.	An employee who is laid off from employment in the Company, and is later hired into a lower classification (while the employee still has recall rights) will retain his/her seniority indefinitely on the list from which the employee was laid off. In case the employee is later restored to the seniority list from which the employee was laid off, his/her seniority on the list from which the employee was laid off shall include the time spent on the other seniority list or lists during the period of layoff and, if restored to the seniority list from which the employee was laid off, the employee will be given no seniority credit on the list or lists to which the employee was assigned during the period of layoff, and the employee shall be given no seniority credit anywhere for the period of unemployment from the Company.
g.	An employee is not entitled to reimbursement by the Company for expenses incurred by the employee in accepting work under this Section 7.11.
Section 7. fl
22
h.	An employee who is laid off from employment in the Company will retain his/her seniority on the list from which he/she was laid off and ■will have recall rights for a period of time equal to his/her seniority on that list, or for five (5) years, whichever is the lesser. If not recalled or hired into a lower classification during this period, the employee’s seniority shall be terminated.
i.	Qualified employees who have been laid off from any seniority list and retain seniority thereon under this Section 7.11, who are able to return to work, will be called back in the reverse order of their layoffs, except that an employee who had been retained outside of seniority order because the employee had been a Union representative who is subsequently laid off will be called back in the order which would have applied to the employee if the employee had not been a Union representative.
j.	Should it become necessary for the Company to reduce for a period which it appears will be six (6) months or more the number of employees in a classification at a work location:
(1)	The employee in that classification with the least seniority on the seniority list covering the classification affected and employed at the work location in question will be displaced first, provided the employee can be replaced, if necessary, with a qualified employee having higher seniority.
(2)	Such employee may, if qualified, displace an employee on the same seniority list employed elsewhere in his/her own classification whose seniority is less than his/her own thereon, or such employee may, if qualified, displace an employee in some other lower-rated classification on the same seniority list employed elsewhere or at the same location whose seniority is less than his/her own thereon.
k.	For the purposes of layoffs or involuntary transfers or work assignments when seniority is a factor, an elected or appointed Union representative as listed below will be considered as being at the top of his/her seniority list, provided the pending layoff, involuntary transfer or change in work assignment would interfere with his/her job-related

। administration duties. If this paragraph is applied to prevent the layoff of any employee from his/her classification or seniority list because he/she is an elected or appointed Union representative, and such employee shall thereafter lose his/her status as an elected or appointed Union representative, the following will be done:
(1)	Such former elected or appointed Union representative shall resume his/her proper status on his/her seniority list. ,
(2)	Employees who have greater seniority on such seniority list than such former elected or appointed Union representative and who (a) were displaced from their classification or from such seniority list while serving as an elected or appointed Union representative and (b) have remained continuously with the Company in some other job classification or have been re hired under Paragraph f of Section 7.1! shall be offered, in descending order of accumulated seniority, from high to low, the opportunity to replace such former elected or appointed Union representative,
(3)	If such employee accepts the offer, the employee lowest on the seniority list as it exists after such offer is accepted shall have the provisions of this Section 7.11, applied.	.
(4)	If any employee to whom such offer is made declines the same, he/she shall lose all rights, e'xcept recall rights, to return to the job from which he/she was displaced.
(5)	This Paragraph k of this Section 7.11 shall not apply in such a way as to require Management to offer the above opportunity to any employee other than those covered by Paragraph k (2) of this Section 7.11, and
(6)	This Paragraph k of this Section 7.11 shall not be construed to give any employee who shall hereafter become an elected or appointed Union representative any right to return to any classification or seniority list from which the employee hag been laid off or displaced.
Section 7 11
24
(7)	For the purpose of applying this Paragraph k of this Section 7.11, elected or appointed Union representatives shall be ranked at the top of their seniority lists in the following order:
I.	Local Union President
2.	Local Union Vice President
3.	Local Union Secretary
4.	Local Union Treasurer
5.	Union EAP Representatives

*// tux> or more in this category are on the same seniority list, regular seniority will break the tie.
(8) If said layoffs or involuntary transfers reach to the top of said seniority lists the Union representatives in the following Union Offices will not be laid off from nor involuntarily transferred from their respective bargaining units while they hold one of said offices unless all of the employees of the entire bargaining unit are first laid off from or involuntarily transferred from said bargaining unit:
1.	Local Union President
2.	Local Union Vice President
3.	Local Union Secretary
4.	Local Union Treasurer
5.	Bargaining Unit Chairperson
Section 7.11
25
1.	An employee with ten (10) years or more of Company service who is being laid off from his/her classification in accordance with the seniority practices of his/her bargaining unit, who cannot be placed under the seniority practices of his/her bargaining unit or Paragraphs c, d, or j of this Section 7.11 may, if the employee meets the qualifications required to enter such job, elect:
(1)	To use his/her bargaining unit seniority to displace an employee with less bargaining unit seniority in another job with the same or a lower pay grade in his/her bargaining unit, even though the employee has no seniority in such job, or, if there is no such employee,
(2)	To use his/her Company service to displace from another job with the same or a lower pay grade an employee represented by the Union in another bargaining unit who has less than six (6) months Company service.
(3)	If an employee has no alternative to being laid off and is laid off following the foregoing application of this Section 7.11, such employee, if qualified, will be given first consideration before new employees are hired into classifications covered by this Agreement. Failure of employees to avail themselves of any such opportunity shall not prejudice their recall rights under Paragraph h of this Section 7.11.
m.	This Section 7.11, does not in any way alter the force and effect of Section 10.8, (Layoff Allowance).
Section 7.12.	Termination of Seniority. Seniority will be terminated in cases of (a) resignation, (b) discharge for cause, including absence for three (3) consecutive workdays without notice (unless failure to give notice is beyond the employee's control), (c) expiration of recall rights, or (d) failure to reply (unless failure to reply is beyond the employee’s control) within five (5) days to a notice of recall to work, sent by registered mail return receipt letter to the last address furnished in writing to the Company by the laid-off employee. If seniority has been terminated, the Company has no further obligation to offer reemployment but, if a former employee without seniority is re-employed,
Section 7.12
26
his/her seniority status will be that of a new employee, unless otherwise agreed by the parties hereto.
I i
Section 7.13.	Promotions. In promotion of employees covered by this Agreement to classifications within the same bargaining unit, seniority will govern whenever reasonable qualifications and abilities of the employees being considered are not significantly different. "Significant difference" shall be "head and shoulders difference", and such factors as advance licenses or step-up experience shall not of themselves amount to significant differences. If the Management proposes to by-pass any employee with greater seniority, the Management will discuss the matter with the chairperson of the bargaining unit involved (at least five (5) days before the by-pass is made effective) in an attempt to reach an agreement thereon before such a by-pass is made. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be processed through the grievance procedure to the President of the Company, or his/her delegate, whose decision shall be controlling, except that the question of whether the bypass has been arbitrary or discriminatory may be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Article 5 of this Agreement. If the arbitrator finds the by-pass was arbitrary or discriminatory1, the by-pass will be canceled.
Section 7.14.	Trial Period, a. Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph c of this Section 14, every employee who begins employment for the first time in a classification in a bargaining unit shall be on trial for a period of six (0) months from the first day of his/her continuous employment in that classification to demonstrate his/her abilities and qualifications for such work. If he/she shall be found not qualified by Management during this six (6) month period, helshe shall be returned to his/her former bargaining unit and classification, if any, without prejudice. In the event of disagreement concerning the employee's ability or qualifications, except in the case of a probationary employee,’ the matter may be processed through the grievance procedure up to the President of the Company, or his/her delegate, whose decision shall be controlling, except that the question of whether the Management's action has been arbitrary or discriminatory may be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Article 5 of this Agreement,
Section 7J 5, 7./4
27
b.	In the case of a probationary employee, or one who is rehired into a classification in which he/she has no seniority, termination of employment shall not be the subject of a grievance or arbitration. Otherwise, such an employee shall have the full benefit of the grievance procedure under Articles 4 and 5,
c.	(Exception to paragraph a of this Section:) Both parties recognize that in some instances six (6) months may not be a sufficient period of time in which to adequately judge the qualifications and abilities of an apprentice in training. In the event an apprentice in training does not pass required classroom work, he/she will be permitted one (1) repeat session for each course failed during each term of the training program provided he/she is otherwise progressing satisfactorily. Should a second attempt in any course also result in failure, the apprentice may be dropped from the training program and classification. If such employee, because of classroom work or on-the-job performance, is found not qualified after having been longer than six (6) months in the training program, he/she shall be returned to his/her former classification, if any, and he/she will be credited with an additional six (6) months of seniority in his/her former classification. If such employee has no former classification to which he/she can be returned, the Company will attempt to place him/her on other work which he is qualified to perform; but, in such event, he/she will not be credited with seniority in the newfound classification.

WORKING CONDITIONS
. Section 8.1. Bulletin Boards - Union Business on Company Time or Property, a. Bulletin boards will be made available to the Union by the Company and such bulletin boards will be erected at designated places agreeable to the Union and the Company for the purpose of posting Union notices relating to meetings, entertainment, health, safety, and other non-controversial items of interest to the membership.
b. The members of the Union will not discuss strictly Union business to the extent that work is interfered with, nor will they solicit members, nor attempt to influence employees on Company time or property
Section 8.1
28
during working hours. This Paragraph b of this Section 8.1 is not to be interpreted as prohibiting solicitations on an employee’s own time, such as lunch and break periods.
Section 8.2.	Full-Time Employment. The Company agrees that any employee, other than a part-time or seasonal employee, who is scheduled to work on the first day of his/her work week, will be guaranteed pay at straight time for forty (40) hours that week, provided he/she reports for work and is in condition to work. This does not preclude suspensions or discharges for just cause, or layoffs as provided in Section 8.34 hereof. It is understood that in case of a shortage of work in his/her own group the employee will do any work assigned which he/she is capable of performing.
Section 8.3.	Inclement Weather. The Company will not require employees, not so normally engaged, to work outdoors in inclement weather during regularly scheduled work periods, unless such work is ' necessary to protect life or property, to maintain service, or to prevent impairment of service. In inclement weather, the Company will furnish indoor work, insofar as practicable, to those employees whose outdoor work has been suspended, it being understood that if it is not practicable to furnish work in his/her own group, the employee will do any work assigned which he/she is capable of performing. If unable to do so, the Company will nevertheless fulfill its obligation under Section 8.2 of this Article by paying for such unworked time within the regularly scheduled workweek of forty (40) hours. Any employee normally working indoors, but required to work outdoors without sufficient notice to provide his/her own protective clothing, will be provided by the Company such clothing as raincoats, mackinaws, hats, and rubber boots.
Section 8.4.	IVorA Sharing. Allocation of work to other groups than those which are regularly assigned to do it shall never be on an arbitrary basis, and the department involved will discuss with the chairperson of the bargaining unit or his/her substitute, as far in advance as possible, any unusual allocation.

Section 8.5.	Outside Contractors, a. If Management proposes to contract work which is regularly and customarily done by the employees in a bargaining unit, and such contracting appears to threaten their security of employment, the chairperson or chief steward of the division will be given prior notice thereof.
b. Work will not be contracted out for the purpose of laying off or reducing in classification employees who regularly and customarily do such work. (Reference: Letter by William G. Meese dated June 19, 1969.)
Section 8.6.	Safety, a. The Company and Union will cooperate in placing in effect and maintaining safety rules and practices. These safety rules and practices and the OS HA and MIOSHA laws governing health and safety shall be complied with by the Company, the employees, and the Union.
b.	In order to meet our shared interests of assuring the health and safety of the workforce, the parties agree to the importance of effective joint health and safety committees and agree such committees will meet . on Company time. To achieve an environment in which joint health and safety committees operate effectively, the parties further agree to create a Joint Steering Committee to develop and implement a health and safety committee process. A part of the Joint Steering Committee’s activities will be to:
(1)	Determine the expected purpose and accountabilities of the joint health and safety committees.
(2)	Determine the most effective committee structures, relationships and accountabilities.
c.	The Company is committed to and will continue to furnish properly fitted safety clothing and equipment as customarily furnished, and as safe and comfortable working conditions as practical under conditions existing at the time will be maintained.
Section 85. 8.6
30
d.	The Company commits that its efforts, in full concert with Local 223, to protect the safety of employees will not diminish in any way as a result of the passage of electric utility restructuring legislation and the issuance of restructuring orders by the MPSC.
Section 8.7.	Minimum Pay Allowance, a. A minimum pay allowance equivalent to four (4) hours at straight time, including such travel time as is allowed herein, will be paid an employee who reports at the Company's request for work entirely outside and not continuous with his/her regular work period. The continuity of an overtime period with the regular work period or the continuity of an overtime period shall not be considered to be interrupted by time out for eating a meal, even though such time is not paid.
b. The guarantee of a minimum allowance shall apply only to the first two (2) call-ins on any workday or off day.
Section 8.8.	Moving Expenses, a. If the headquarters of an employee is changed at the Company's request and it is necessary to change his/her residence, the Company will pay the necessary moving expenses upon receiving a receipted moving bill from the employee within one (1) year of the date of change of headquarters (unless the time is specifically extended by Management in writing). When the employee submits his/her receipted moving bill, the employee will be given an additional sum of money to offset other relocation expenses he/she may have incurred. That sum shall be the current per diem allowance (reference Section 8.17) times thirty (30). Such an employee will be given as much notice as practicable to permit the employee to arrange living quarters in the new locality. However, a change of headquarters because an employee applied for a job at a different location or headquarters or upon a job more than thirty (30) days after layoff is not a change at the Company's request,
b. In the Electrical System Substations when the Company, in lieu of requesting a specific employee to change his/her headquarters, allows employees to bid to fill a job, the Company will pay moving expenses (subject to the foregoing time limits set forth in Paragraph a of this
Sec-lion 8.7, 8.8
3J
Section 8.8	above) only for the first employee required to change his/her residence in each cycle of bidding.
Section 8.9.	Job Descriptions, Wage Benchmarking, and Pay Rale Negotiations, a. It is understood and agreed that Management reserves the exclusive right to determine the duties of any classification.
b.	Management will furnish the President of the Union with copies of job descriptions (including titles and qualifications such as licenses, degrees, and course requirements) for all classifications covered by this Agreement. Should the Company contemplate (1) implementing a new classification or (2) substantially changing an existing classification, the Company will advise the President of the Union of such changes at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed effective date of such changes. During this thirty (30) day period, the Union and the Company will enter into negotiations in an attempt to reach agreement on such changes, including whether such changes were substantial.
c.	If the Union does not believe a job description for a Union represented classification, either an existing job description or one newly brought under the Agreement, accurately reflects the significant duties and responsibilities of the classification, the President of the Union will so advise the Company’s Director of Labor Relations. The Director of Labor Relations will arrange a meeting with all the necessary parties to attempt to reach agreement on a revised job description and whether such changes are substantial.
d.	If Management creates a new classification and they want to post and fill such a new classification as soon as possible, the parties will attempt to reach quick agreement on a tentative pay rate and job description for such a classification. If agreement cannot be reached, Management’s proposed pay rate and job description will be put into effect. However, within six months after such a new classification becomes operational, the process in Paragraph e of this Section 8.9 will be followed.
Section 89
32
e.	Direct negotiations between the parties will be used to determine the pay rate of any classification covered by this Agreement provided the classification is (1) a new classification, (2) a classification which is brought within the jurisdiction of this Agreement, or (3) a classification already covered by this Agreement, the duties of which have been substantially revised. In direct negotiations, a joint Negotiating Committee will first attempt to reach agreement on slotting the job into existing jobs in the Agreement which have been previously benchmarked through wage surveys. If such agreement cannot be reached, Management will assign a tentative pay rate and the parties will submit the classification to a joint Benchmarking Committee. Unless otherwise agreed, the parties will conduct a wage survey for any new job, substantially changed job, or any classification brought within the jurisdiction of this Agreement at least once during the term of this Agreement. The survey will be conducted using a mutually agreed-to third party and follow the basic agreements reached by the parties in completing their extensive 1998 wage survey. The Benchmarking Committee will report their findings to the Negotiating Committee. The parties will then attempt to negotiate a final pay rate. If not resolved through negotiations, the pay rate proposed by Management shall be put into effect, subject to the Union’s right to request mediation of the issue. If not resolved in mediation, the Union has the right to process a grievance through arbitration. The arbitrator’s decision will be confined to the reasonableness of the process used by Management to determine the pay rate.
f.	It is the intent of the parties that all employees be paid within the pay rates established by the above process. However, if a pay rate for a classification is reduced through the above process, an incumbent’s pay will not be reduced. Rather, the incumbents will be brought within the established pay rates through the use of lump sums instead of General Increases being given to others in the same classification who are within the established pay rates.
Section 8.10.	Temporary Assignment to a Higher-Rated Classification, a. If an employee is assigned to a higher-rated classification for one (1) full hour or more in a day, he/she shall receive for all time worked in such higher-rated classification, (1) the rate for
Section 8.10
33
which he/she has previously qualified by working in the classification on either a permanent or temporary basis, (2) the lowest pay rate in the higher-rated classification, or (3) one pay grade over employee's current pay rate, whichever is highest, provided this shall not exceed the maximum pay rate of the higher classification. This provision does not apply to an employee holding a substitute classification or a dual-rate classification, or an employee assigned for instruction who does not relieve another employee or one whose pay rate is based on relieving a higher classification. If an employee is assigned to a higher-rated classification for less than one (1) full hour in a day, he/she shall receive no increase in pay. When the employee is returned to his/her regular classification, he/she shall also return to his/her regular rate.
b.	If an employee is assigned for four (4) or more hours to a higherrated classification both on the day before and the day after a holiday or other absence for which he/she is.excused with pay, the absence will be paid for at the higher rate.
c.	If the reasonable qualifications and abilities of the employees available for temporary assignments to higher-rated classifications are not significantly different, the senior employee will normally be assigned. "Significant difference" shall be "head and shoulders difference”, and such factors as advance licenses or step-up experience shall not of themselves amount to significant differences.

34
not be permitted to do work which will act to reduce the number of employees normally required for the job. This shall not preclude the supervisor working in an emergency.

If such employee is not satisfied with the conclusions of said examinations required by the Company, when such conclusions affect his/her status as an employee, the employee may, at his/her own expense, submit a report obtained from a doctor of his/her own choosing for consideration by the Company. If the Union believes the action taken by the Management after such consideration is arbitrary, it may process the case through the grievance procedure, including arbitration.

b.	As an exception to the foregoing Paragraph a of this Section 8.15, if an employee in the Civil and Specialty Trades Occupational Group in Substations or in the Maintenance Occupational Group in Power Generation who is assigned to a regular work area (see Section 8.27) is temporarily assigned to a location within another work area, or to Harbor Beach Power Plant, he/she will report and quit on the job, working the customary eight (8) hours per day, and he/she will be paid for each day when he/she reports to such temporary assignment an expense reimbursement allowance based on the following table, in lieu of any allowance otherwise payable under the foregoing Paragraph a of this Section 8.15:

(1)	If an employee is called to report, at a location other than the employee's regular headquarters, for work "at once" on an off-day or entirely outside the employee’s scheduled hours, all time and transportation expense, including that between the employee's home and the job and back home, shall be at the Company's expense. The employee is expected to report as soon as possible, unless he/she is instructed to report at a later specified time within two (2) hours. Time shall start with the time of call and shall include the time required to reach home afterward. If the work continues on into the employee's scheduled hours, only time and transportation expense to the job will be allowed. Work area employees will be treated the same as employees who report to a location other than their regular headquarters.
(2)	If an employee is called at home and accepts an "at-once" overtime assignment requiring the employee to report to his/her regular headquarters, the employee is expected to report as soon as possible. Provided the employee actually reports to work within one (1) hour, the employee will receive a travel time allowance of one (1) hour, at the applicable overtime rate (backed up from the time the employee arrives at his/her regular headquarters), an additional one (1) hour from the job back home, and round trip mileage from his/her home to his/her

regular headquarters. However, if the work continues into the employee’s next scheduled work period, only the one (1) hour travel time allowance from the home to the job and only the mileage from the employee’s home to his/her regular headquarters will be paid.

e.	An employee who reports back on one of the days of his/her standard work week for less than eight (8) hours of prearranged work outside of and not continuous with the employee's regular shift will be reimbursed for the travel expense required by the extra trips between home and the job and back home.

Each employee so affected shall be notified of such assignment before being released from work on the previous day, except in emergencies.
Section 8.17
39
On such an assignment, travel time and transportation between such temporary headquarters and the employee's regular headquarters shall be at Company expense once each week. As an alternative to documented expense reimbursement an employee may elect to accept a per diem allowance of $64.30 per day for each day when he/she reports and quits on the job working the customary eight (8) hours per day, said per diem allowance to cover all meals, lodging, travel time and transportation.
b. As an exception to the foregoing Paragraph a of this Section 8.17 if an employee in the Civil and Specialty Trades Occupational Group in Substations or in the Maintenance Occupational Group in Power Generation who is assigned to a regular work area (see Section 8.27) is directed by Management to report temporarily to a location within another work area, or to Harbor Beach Power Plant, w hich assignment makes it necessary for the employee to remain away from home overnight and to purchase meals, lodging, and transportation, he/she will report and quit on the job, working the customary eight (8) hours per day, and he/she will be paid for each day when he/she reports to such temporary assignment an expense reimbursement allowance based on the following table, in lieu of any allowance otherwise payable under the foregoing paragraph a:

After the first week, hours worked on such shifts will be paid for at an employee's regular hourly rate, plus a separate shift premium which shall be in the amount provided in Article 11 for each shift. Regular overtime rates shall be paid for hours worked beyond the first eight (8) hours of each workday of the newly scheduled shift. This Paragraph f applies only to employees who are in an affected classification as of the date when the evening or night shift is first established. The premium provided by this Paragraph f of this Section 9.9 applies only to those of the aforementioned employees who are actually assigned to the evening or night shift sometime within the first fifty-two (52) weeks following the date when that evening or night shift is first established.
g.	When Sunday is scheduled as part of an employee's standard five (5) day week, if no half-time or full-time premium applies to the time worked, a premium of twenty-five percent (25%) of the employee's straight-time hourly rate shall be paid for such time worked on Sunday. If the employee is entitled to either an-area differential or an afternoon or night shift premium, such premiums will be added after the twenty-five percent (25%) premium has been applied.
h.	Should more than one premium rate apply to the same hours, only the highest premium rate will be paid. The premium rate will be one and one-half (1-1/2) or two (2) times, as the case may be, the hourly rate in effect for the employee at the time the work is performed.
i.	Short Shift Change. If a shift worked with or without due notice begins eight (8) hours or less from the end of the last regular shift worked, time and one-half will be paid for the first four (4) hours of the new shift, then double time up to the starting time of the next workday or off-day, whichever is first. This does not apply when a shift of an employee's own choice is a contributing factor to a short shift change.
Section 9,10.	Offsetting Overtime, a. No employee shall be required to take time off during his/her standard work week for overtime, including prearranged overtime, worked or to be worked. However, this shall not preclude the scheduling (at premium rates) of an eight (8)

60
hour or longer work period on a regular workday outside of and in lieu of the employee's regular work period on that day.
b.	If work is not given to an employee who is assigned prearranged overtime work which is not canceled by reasonable notice, the employee will be paid from the prearranged starting time if the employee is available and ready to work.
c.	If an employee is held over for an overtime assignment which is not continuous with his/her shift but begins two (2) hours or less after the employee's normal quitting time, the Company will not require the employee to take time off without pay between his/her normal quitting time and the start of the overtime work, except for a one-half hour period (or longer if the employee requests it) for a meal.
Section 9.11.	Rest Time. a. When an employee is required to work such hours that all, or nearly all, of the employee’s normal sleeping time is lost, it is the supervisor's responsibility to release him for a sufficient rest period as soon as the work permits. If an employee works such hours that the employee should be released for rest as soon as the work permits, but the employee prefers to forego his/her rest and work additional hours, the employee should not be permitted to work but should be directed to rest.
b.	If the necessities of the work permit, and sixteen (16) hours or more have been worked in a twenty-four (24) hour period, the rest period should be at least eight (8) hours.
c.	A rest period may be provided either because long hours have been worked or because they are anticipated.
d.	An employee who is released under Paragraphs a, b, or c of this Section 9.11 by his/her supervisor during any hours of the employee's regularly scheduled forty (40) hour work week will be paid at the employee's straight-time rate for rest time during such scheduled hours.
e.	When an employee who has been released from his/her regularly scheduled hours for a paid rest period is required to return to work
Section 9.11
61
within ten (10) hours of his/her release (but not otherwise), the employee's paid rest time and the employee's worked time for the workday shall be added together to determine when double time should begin.
Section 9.12.	Distribution of Overtime, a. Such overtime as becomes necessary shall be distributed without favoritism among the qualified employees in their respective overtime work groups with the objective of obtaining equal distribution.
b.	The term "overtime" is defined as time paid for at time and one’ half or double time except for such payments for short shift changes, and/or changes of shifts or off-days without due notice, and/or the establishment of an evening or night shift for work normally done days, and/or for work outside of and in lieu of an employee's regular work period, and/or for travel time. Union and Management representatives in each bargaining unit are not precluded, however, from agreeing to add if they wish certain non-overtime premium payments to the overtime records, provided it is understood that work assignments involving non-overtime premium payments need not be made on the basis of standings on the overtime record.
c.	The respective overtime work groups will be defined in each bargaining unit. If the parties fail to agree on the definition of them, or subsequent revisions in them, Management's determination will be put into effect. However, the Union may process through the grievance procedure, including arbitration, the question of whether Management’s determination was arbitrary.
d.	For the purpose of accounting for the distribution of overtime, an employee low on the overtime list who is not available when called for an overtime assignment in his/her overtime work group will be charged with the hours the employee would have been paid had he/she worked, except as otherwise agreed between the Union and Management representatives in each bargaining unit. No more than one reasonable attempt to reach anyone is required. An employee who declines an overtime assignment will be charged with the hours the employee would have' been paid had the employee worked. Except in an
Section 9.12
62
I
I
emergency no attempt will be made to reach an employee who is on vacation or has previously reported absent. For this purpose, the vacation period will be from the time reporting off duty to the time reporting back on duty and the absence period will be from the time of the report of the absence to the time the employee is cleared for duty. Off-duty employees who do not have phones listed with the Company and on this account are not offered certain overtime will be charged as though they had declined the overtime. An employee who declines to furnish his/her own transportation, or is unable to furnish his/her own transportation (for lack of license or any other reason), for an overtime assignment will be determined to have declined the overtime.
e.	When a specific maintenance or construction project is assigned to an employee or employees for completion and casual overtime work rather than another shift is required, the casual overtime’will normally be worked by the employee or employees to whom the project was assigned.
f.	When an employee transfers from one overtime work group to another, the employee will be charged with the median overtime hours in his/her new group, unless otherwise mutually agreed between the Union and Management representatives in each bargaining unit.
g.	At the end of each calendar year, accumulated overtime hours of the employee with the lowest number will be reduced to zero, and the hours of the other employees will be correspondingly reduced.
h.	No grievance will be filed on the distribution of overtime if emergency conditions prevent the orderly scheduling of overtime.
i.	If it is established that the Company incorrectly bypassed an employee for an overtime assignment, the by-passed employee will, within 30 working days, be offered the opportunity to work a makeup overtime assignment consisting of work which would not otherwise be done on overtime. The makeup overtime assignment will be worked on a day or days mutually agreeable to the by-passed employee and his supervisor. If they cannot agree on a mutually agreeable day or days, the employee's Bargaining Unit Chairperson and the employee’s third -
Section 9.12
63
/ . . .
line supervisor will meet to resolve the issue. Such a makeup overtime assignment will provide overtime pay at the same premium and will be for the same number of hours worked as the by-passed employee would have received had he/she worked the missed overtime. When it is determined that makeup overtime cannot be reasonably accomplished, other resolutions (other than additional makeup overtime assignments) will be considered. Reasonably accomplished means that unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties, the makeup overtime must be scheduled within thirty (30) days of the bypass and the makeup assignment must be completed within ninety (90) days. However, employees will not be entitled to meals or meal money allowances for such makeup overtime assignments.
Section 9.13.	Holidays and Personal Day. The Comp any-recognized holidays are: New Years Eve, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, the day following Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve Day, and Christmas Day. Effective 1/1/2000 and, at the start of each payroll year thereafter, the Company will also recognize two (2) personal days for each employee. With respect to holidays and the personal days, it is agreed that:
a.	Whenever a holiday occurs, every employee will be given a day off with pay if he/she can be spared from work. If the employee cannot be spared, the employee will be paid as provided in this Agreement for working the holiday. If the day observed as a holiday fails on one of the employee'a scheduled off-days or another scheduled holiday, another day in the same pay week or the pay week preceding or following will he designated as his/her holiday in lieu of the normally observed holiday. This day will be consecutive with the employee's off-days. Once a day has been designated as a holiday, this designated day will not be changed unless changed by Thursday of the pay week before the week in which the designated day falls. If required to work on either his/her off-day or the day designated as his/her holiday, the regular rules for time worked on such days will be applied.
b.	An employee who is excused with pay on a holiday, or day designated as such, and is later required to work during his/her
Section 9.13
64
regularly scheduled hours will receive a minimum of twelve (12) hours’ pay for the day,
c,	Holiday pay will not be allowed an employee when the employee:
(1)	Is scheduled to work, but without good reason fails to report.
(2)	Is absent without permission on any part of the workday before or the workday after the holiday, unless it is evident that the employee was not intentionally lengthening the holiday period.
(3)	Is absent without pay the entire week in which a holiday occurs.
d.	Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, when one of the above holidays fails on a Sunday, it will be observed on the following Monday, and when one of the above holidays falls on a Saturday, it will be observed on the preceding Friday, except that when Christmas Eve Day falls on a Sunday, it will be observed on Tuesday, December 26th and, when New Year's Eve Day falls on a Sunday, it will be observed on Tuesday, January 2nd. However, when Christmas Eve Day, New Year’s Eve Day, Independence Day, Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall on Saturday, such holiday will be observed on Saturday by an employee who is scheduled to work such Saturday as part of his standard five-day week, and when Christmas Eve Day, New Year's Eve Day, Independence Day, Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall on Sunday, such holiday will be observed on Sunday by an employee who is ’ scheduled to work such Sunday as part of his/her standard five-day week.
e.	(The following birthday holiday language will be in effect only from June 7, 1999 to December 31, 1999.) If an employee’s birthday falls on one of his/her regularly scheduled workdays, the employee may: (1) elect to observe his/her birthday holiday on the actual date of his/her birthday, or (2) elect to observe his/her birthday holiday on another day in the same pay week, or the pay week immediately preceding or following, subject to the approval of supervision as to which specific one of these other days can be allowed in light of the needs of the service.
Section 9.13

I
I
' Once a specific day has been approved by supervision it will not be changed without agreement of the employee.
f.	To be eligible for personal days, employees must be on the Company payroll at the start of the payroll year. Employees wishing to preschedule a personal day may do so by exercising a choice in addition to that provided in Paragraph h of Section 10.7. Once a specific day has been prescheduled and approved by supervision, it will not be changed without agreement of the employee. Otherwise, employees may, with supervisory permission, schedule their personal days as they would schedule a one (1) day vacation. If required to work on a previously scheduled personal day, employees will be paid the same as if they had ■ worked a holiday. For purposes of overtime distribution, a personal day will be considered a vacation day. Employees must make every reasonable effort io use their personal days during the payroll year in which they become due, and failure to do so will normally result in forfeiture of the personal days. However, the Company recognizes that unusual circumstances beyond the employee's control (such as illness or injury) may prevent employees from taking their personal days within the payroll year. In such situations, the personal days will be transferred to the employee's deferred vacation bank at the start of the new payroll year.

Section 10.2

c.	Retirement Options - When applying for a retirement allowance, an employee must choose one of the following three options which will determine whether and how an employee's beneficiary will receive an allowance after the employee dies:
(1)	Option III - This option provides an unreduced retirement allowance (as calculated in paragraph a or, if applicable Paragraph b of this Section 10.2) for as long as the employee lives but with no further payments to anyone after the employee dies.
(2)	Option II - This option provides a reduced retirement allowance during the employee's lifetime. When the employee dies, the employee's beneficiary wifi be paid one-half of that allowance for the rest of the designated beneficiary's life. The employee may not name a new beneficiary, even if the employee remarries.
The amount received under this option is 90% of the employee's Option III retirement allowance if the employee and his or her beneficiary are the same age. However, if the beneficiary is younger, this percentage will be reduced by 1% for each 12 full months of difference in ages. If the beneficiary is older, the percentage will be increased by 1% for each 12 full months of difference in ages up to a maximum of 100%.
If the employee is married, federal law requires that this option will apply unless the employee specifically chooses otherwise in writing. If such an employee names someone other than his/her spouse as a beneficiary (under Option II or I), the employee must have written permission from the involved spouse to do so.
If employees choose this Option II and their designated beneficiary predeceases them, the employee's retirement allowance will, effective the first of the month after the death of the designated beneficiary, revert back to what it would have been had the employee retired under Option III.
Seaion IQ. 2

(3)	Option I - Thia option provides a reduced retirement allowance during the employee's lifetime. When the employee dies, that same amount will continue to be paid to the employee's beneficiary for the rest of the beneficiary's life. The employee may not name a new beneficiary, even if the employee remarries.
The amount received under Option I is 76.5% of the Option III retirement allowance if the employee and the employee's beneficiary are the same age. If the beneficiary is younger, this percentage will be reduced by 1.2% for each 12 full months of difference in ages. If the beneficiary is older, the percentage will be increased by 1.2% for each 12 full months of difference in ages up to a maximum of 100%.
If employees choose this Option 1 and their designated beneficiary predeceases them, the employee’s retirement allowance will, effective the first of the month after the death of the designated beneficiary, revert back to what it would have been had the employee retired under Option III.
d.	Spouse’s Benefit - The plan recognizes that an employee could die before he/she starts to receive a retirement allowance. If such an employee has been married for at least one year and is vested, the plan provides for an immediate or future monthly payment to the eligible spouse for the rest of the spouse's life. If the surviving spouse is the same age as the employee, the monthly payment will be the amount the employee's spouse would have received under Option II (see Paragraph c (2) of this Section 10.2) had the employee left the Company on the day of death. If an employee dies after having reached age 45 and if the employee has 15 or more years of benefit service, the eligible surviving spouse will be eligible for an immediate monthly allowance. When other eligible surviving spouses qualify for future monthly allowances depends on the employee's age and benefit years of service at the time of death.
e.	Supplemental Early Retirement Allowance - The Company will give eligible employees a Supplemental Early Retirement Allowance in
Section J0.2
70
addition to the employee’s normal retirement allowance. Details are as follows;
(1)	Eligibility - Employees age 55 through 61 with at least 20 years of benefit service.
(2)	Duration - This additional payment takes effect the day the employee's retirement allowance begins and ends the month after the employee reaches age 62 or when the employee dies, whichever cotnes first. The plan contains no provision to pay any portion of this supplemental amount to a surviving spouse or any other beneficiary.
(3)	Amount of Allowance - The base amount effective 6/7/99 is $1,950* per month reduced by:
-	The employee's regular monthly early retirement allowance determined as if the employee had selected retirement with Option III (no payments to a survivor after employee's death).
-	Twenty dollars per month for every year or partial year of Company service less than 30.
-	Any payment received from the Company or other sources to which the Company contributes including:
• Social Security disability benefits for which the employee is or may become eligible for during the period that the employee is paid the Supplemental Early Retirement Allowance.
* Workers' Disability Compensation.
* By the amount of any other Detroit Edison Company-provided or government plan (other than military);
* Increases to $2,050 effective 6/5/00 and $2,100 effective 6/4/01.
f. Deferral of Retirement Allowance ■ Effective January 1, 1996, an employee who ia age 45 or older with at least 15 years of benefit service or the surviving spouse of an active employee age 45 with at least 15
Section J 02
7V
years of benefit service may retire and elect to defer his/her retirement allowance to any age prior to age 65.
The following rules apply to such deferrals: *
(1)	Deferral of the retirement allowance will not add years of benefit service beyond what the employees had when they ceased their active employment with the Company.
(2)	If employees are under age 60 or under age 58 with 30 or more years of service when they elect to start collecting their deferred retirement allowance, their retirement allowance will be calculated based on their actual age at the time their deferred retirement allowance begins and the applicable Early Retirement Reduction Table. If surviving spouses elect to defer their Option II retirement allowance, they may request to start receiving the allowance at any time in the future. When they elect to start collecting their retirement allowance, it will be calculated on the age which the deceased employee would have been at the time the deferred retirement allowance begins and the applicable Early Retirement Reduction Table.
(3)	Effective June 7, 1999, if employees are eligible for a Supplemental Early Retirement Allowance (SERA), the amount of SERA will be calculated as if such employees were not deferring their retirement allowance and, upon ceasing their active employment, employees will begin receiving their SERA. When such an employee starts receiving his/her retirement allowance, his/her SERA will not be readjusted.
Section 10.3.	Worker's Compensation. The Company normally grants certain benefits in addition to those required by law in compensation cases. -
Section 10.4.	Pay During Absence, a. To the end that an employee may have uninterrupted weekly income, notwithstanding certain unavoidable interferences with the employee’s ability to work, pay at regular straight-time rate will be allowed an employee for time lost
Section 10.3. 104
72
I
from his/her standard work week for the four following reasons. It is understood that an employee may be required to furnish reasonable proof of the disability for which pay during absence is to be allowed.
(1)	Personal sickness or non-occupational injury.
(2)	Injury or illness of a near relative living in the employee’s immediate household of such serious nature that the presence of the employee himselfifherself is required. Pay allowed for this reason will not exceed three (3) days, except that Management, under unusual circumstances, may allow more.
(3)	Medical treatment for self or immediate family when appointment outside working hours is not practicable and employee must be present.
(4)	Death of a near relative (son, daughter, husband, wife, father, mother, sister, brother, grandfather, grandmother, grandchild, mother-in-law, father-in-law, or anyone who is very close and who is living in the same household with the employee). Pay allowed for this reason will not exceed three (3) days, except under unusual circumstances.
b.	In addition to the foregoing, an employee may be allowed pay for absence due to necessary important personal business which cannot be taken care of outside an employee’s regular working hours.
c.	An employee becomes eligible for pay during absence, as provided in this Section 10.4, in the payroll year in which he completes six (6) months' service with the Company. During this first six (6) months, pay may be allowed for up to but not exceeding ten (10) days, which shall be charged against the twenty (20) days allowable for the first payroll year in which such six (6) months' service is completed. Pay allowed under this Section 10,4 for any or all reasons shall not exceed twenty (20) days in any payroll year, except that for personal sickness or non-occupational injury, an employee will be allowed as many additional days of absence as were not paid for of the twenty (20) days allowable in each of the two (2) preceding payroll years, referred to as "the bank."
Section 104
73
Further, if an employee, due to extensive illness, has used his/her current year's allowance of twenty (20) days, the employee may use the bank for necessary absence due to the death of a near relative. Deduction of days from the bank will be made first from the earlier payroll year. However, the number of days in the bank of an employee returning from a leave of absence will be the same number as in the employee's bank the date the employee's leave started.
Section 10.5.	Jury Duty. a. An employee absent because of jury duty shall be allowed straight-time pay not to exceed forty (40) hours in any one (I) week for hours the employee would have otherwise worked. Time absent for jury duty shall be reported as such, but not deducted from days allowable for other reasons. Employees shall report for work whenever they are not actually on jury duty during their scheduled work periods unless otherwise instructed by their supervisors.
b. Employees who are notified that they may have to serve jury duty while scheduled to work the evening or night shift may request to have their work schedules changed from evenings or nights to days. Unless emergency conditions exist, if such employees present their supervisor with their Summons to serve jury duty within five days of their receipt of such a Summons (but no less than one week prior to having to serve such possible jury duty), such requests will be granted.
Section 10.6.	Life Insurance, a. Coverage for Active Employees. Upon full-time employment an employee will receive group term life insurance at no cost to the employee. Each employee will be given a certificate of insurance which generally describes the benefits to which the employee may be entitled. The terms and conditions under which such benefits may be payable are set forth in the group term life insurance contract. The coverage hereinafter discussed is illustrative of some of the more important provisions of said group term life insurance. The amount of the life insurance will equal two times the annual base pay, raised to the next higher even multiple of $1,000. The amount so obtained may hereafter also be referred to as the "Base Amount". Should two times the employee’s annual base pay produce an even thousand figure, the insurance coverage will go to the next higher even multiple of $1,000. As an exception to the foregoing, if an employee is
-Sfci'ibn JO. J, J0'6
74
over 65 years of age (but under 70), the base amount of insurance will equal 2 times the annual base pay times 75 percent, raised to the next higher even multiple of $1,000, and if this 75 percent computation should provide an even thousand figure the insurance coverage will go to the next higher even multiple of $1,000.
Base pay for thia purpose does not include premium pay for overtime, shift work, or work area differentials.
If part-time employees should ever become represented by the Union, such part-time employees must be scheduled to work at least twenty hours per week to qualify for this insurance. The part-time employee's annual base pay will be figured on the basis of 52 twenty-hour weeks, in arriving at the amount of coverage.
If temporary employees should ever become represented by the Union, such temporary employees must complete six months' continuous service to be included in the plan.
b. Coverage for Retired Employees,	■
(1)	Normal retirement at age 65. Life insurance will be continued on a reduced basis at Company expense after an employee retires under the Company retirement plan at age 65. The amount of coverage for the employee at that time will be 50 percent of the base amounts. Thereafter it will be adjusted on succeeding retirement anniversary dates as follows:
%of
Adjustment Date	Base Amount
(a) Two (2) years after retirement 45
(bj Four (4) years after retirement 40
(c)	Six (6) years after retirement 35
(d)	Eight (8) years after retirement 30
(e)	Ten (10) years after retirement 25
Section !0,6
75
The minimum amount will never be below $10,000 for full time employees retiring under this contract.
(2)	Retirement before age 65. If the employee retires after age 55 but before age 65 and has had fifteen or ‘more years of service, the employee’s coverage will continue on a reduced basis from the date of retirement as described above for normal retirements. By making monthly premium contributions, however, an early retiree can keep his/her insurance at the level of 75 percent of his/her base amount for up to five years or until age 65, whichever occurs first, at which time the bi-annual reductions will begin. Such monthly contributions would be in an amount arrived at by taking 60<f per thousand dollars of insurance times 75 percent of his/her base amount less $1,000.
(3)	Retirement after age 65. If the employee retires after age 65, the amount of life insurance coverage will be reduced immediately to the amount the employee would have if retirement had occurred at age 65. Employees who are retiring may replace any of the coverage that is reduced or discontinued by converting to an individual policy (not term insurance).
c.	Miscellaneous Plan Provisions.
(1)	The employee may name as beneficiary any person or persons, his/her estate, or any organization.
(2)	The proceeds of the insurance will be made available promptly to the beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the group term life insurance contract.
(3)	The employee or his/her beneficiary may elect to have the proceeds of his/her life insurance paid either in a lump sum or in monthly installments over any period of one to twenty years.
(4)	U an active employee becomes permanently and totally disabled by sickness or accident prior to age 60 and is unable to engage in any occupation or employment for remuneration or profit, the base
Section 10.6
76
amount shall be in force during the continuance of the disability. To keep this coverage in effect the employee must furnish the Company with proof, as required, of the continuance of the disability. At age 65 the insurance amount will be reduced to 50 percent.
If the employee ceases to be totally disabled or fails to furnish due proof of the continuance of such permanent total disability as required, the insurance shall automatically terminate thirty-one (31) days after the date of termination of such disability or proof of such disability unless the employee returns to active employment with the employer or is entitled to insurance in accordance with Paragraph b(l) or b(2) of this Section 10.6
(5)	If the employee leaves the Company, the employee's insurance under the plan will cease. However, the employee can transfer all or part of this insurance to an individual policy (not term ■ insurance). This must be done within thirty-one (31) days of termination of employment. No medical examination will be required.
(6)	During a Company-approved leave of absence, including a military leave, the full amount of insurance will be continued in force for the employee at Company expense.
d.	Coverage for Dependents
The Company will provide dependent life insurance. The following is illustrative of the more important provisions of said insurance. The specific terms and conditions under which benefits may be payable are set forth in the insurance contract. The insurance will be in the amount of $10,000 coverage on the life of the legal spouse of, and $1,000 coverage on the life of each dependent child of, each active employee, and each retired employee who retires at age 55 or later with at least 15 years of service, with coverage stopping when said active employee (beneficiary) or said retired employee (beneficiary) dies. Ex-spouses are not covered; spouse coverage applies only on the legal spouse of the employee or retiree. Dependent children must be
Section 10.6
11
I ■
14 or more days old and not yet beyond the end of the year in which they reach age 19 (this can be extended to not yet beyond the end of the year in which they reach 23 if the employee or retiree is providing more than 50% toward their support). No other persons are considered for coverage.
Section 10.7.	Vacations. The Company's vacation policy is based on the principle that vacations with pay are earned in the calendar year preceding the year in which vacations are taken.
a.	Length of Vacation.
(1)	All employees who, on December 31 of any calendar year, have completed at least one (1) year of continuous employment (since their most recent hiring date) are entitled to a vacation with pay, to be taken in the following year as stated below.
(2)	New employees are entitled to their first vacation of two (2) weeks with pay after twelve (12) months of continuous employment. Former employees who have been reemployed are entitled to a vacation after one (1) year of continuous employment and are otherwise subject to the same practices applying to new employees hired on or after January 1, 1992.
The most recent date of reemployment will be used to determine when the vacation is due. However, the length (2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 weeks) of the employee’s vacation will be determined by cumulative employment.
Section 10?
78
(3)	Days of Paid Vacation Allowed:
(a)	Employees hired before January 1,1992:
Years of cumulative employment as of December 31 of any year		Paid vacation , entitlement for the following calendar year
1 to 6 years 7 to 14 years 15 to 23 years 24 or more years	3 weeks 4 weeks 5 weeks 6 weeks
(b)	Employees hired on or after January 1, 1992:

.	1 to 4 years 5 to 14 years 15 to 24 years 25 to 29 years 30 or more years	2	weeks 3	weeks 4	weeks	- 5	weeks 6	weeks
(4)	In computing cumulative employment under Subparagraph a (3) of this Section 10,7, leaves of absence shall be included but periods of non-employment shall be excluded,
(5)	The terms "continuous employment" and "cumulative employment", as used in this Section 10,7, shall include periods of creditable employment with Pennsalt Chemicals Corporation, or Wyandotte Chemicals Corporation, or Port Huron Paper Company, as well as with The Detroit Edison Company.
Section JO. 7
79
b.	If a Company-observed holiday falls on a day on which the employee would have worked, or would have been excused from work with pay if he/she had not been on vacation, an additional day of vacation with pay shall be allowed. If the department's work permits, the additional day may be scheduled continuous with the vacation period,
c.	Vacations become due and shall be taken in the calendar year in which the employee completes the service required to qualify for vacations. Vacations and vacation pay shall not accumulate from one calendar year to another. However, if the work of the department permits, an employee may be allowed to take part or all of his/her vacation for one year in the year following, provided it is completed during the calendar week in which April 15 of that year falls. If the Company shall request an employee to forego his/heT vacation, such employee shall be given vacation pay in lieu of vacation,
d.	Effect of Leave of Absence on Vacation.
(1)	The vacation for which an employee normally qualifies in any year will be reduced by 1/12 for each full month of absence (excluding personal disability absences) in the previous calendar year. A fraction of a day which is part of the total reduced vacation will be counted as follows: 1/2 day or less, as 1/2 day; over 1/2 day, as one (1) full day. It should be noted that vacations in two (2) consecutive calendar years following an absence may be reduced if that absence extended from one calendar year into the other.
(2)	A vacation may be scheduled immediately before or after an extended absence. However, if the absence is expected to extend into the following calendar year, the vacation should be scheduled before the absence. If this cannot be arranged, an allowance in lieu of vacation may be paid at any time selected by the employee before the end of the year. An employee will be eligible for a vacation in the calendar year of his/her return to work from a leave of absence if he/she worked any of the preceding calendar year. The length of the employee's vacation will be reduced by any
Seclion 10.7
BO
absence in the previous calendar year as provided in the preceding paragraph.
e.	In computing vacation pay, one (1) week's allowance shall be equal to forty (40) hours' straight time pay at the employee's current rate.
f.	Termination Vacation Pay.
(1)	When employment is terminated for any reason (except as provided in the following paragraphs), an employee who has completed one or more years of continuous employment will be paid an allowance for vacation earned but not previously taken. This allowance will be computed as follows;
The full vacation pay to which the employee was entitled on December 31 of the previous calendar year (adjusted for absences as provided in Paragraph d of this Section 10.7).
plu§	■
1/12 of full vacation pay for each full month elapsed since the anniversary date of employment in the current calendar year (applies only when an employee’s employment is terminated following his anniversary date in the current calendar year).

Any vacation allowance paid in the current calendar year.
less
1/12 of the full vacation pay for each full month of continuous absence (excluding personal disability absences of less than twelve (12) full months) since the anniversary date in the year employment is terminated (applies only when an employee's employment is terminated following his/her anniversary date in the current calendar year).
(a) For an employee with a break in employment, the anniversary date to be used in calculating termination pay will be the anniversary date of the most recent reemployment.
(2)	Employees who have not completed one (1) year of continuous employment on December 31 of the preceding calendar year but
Section JO 7
81
who have completed at least one (1) year at the time employment is terminated will be paid a termination vacation allowance. The allowance will amount to 1/12 of the employee's full vacation pay for each full month of continuous employment since the employee's date of employment in the previous year, less any vacation allowance which has been paid, and less 1/12 of full vacation pay for each full month of non-disability absence since his/her date of employment,
g.	Early Layoff.
A termination vacation allowance will be paid to an employee who is laid off from employment in the Company in a reduction of the work force before completing one (1) year of continuous employment, provided the employee has been employed for at least six (S) months. The allowance will be 1/12 of full vacation pay for each full month since the employee's date of employment, less any vacation allowance which has been paid, and less 1/12 of full vacation pay for each full month of nondisability absence since his date of employment.
h.	Vacation Schedules.
(1)	An employee desirous of splitting his/her vacation shall have only one first choice by seniority or Company service (as determined by the involved bargaining unit) when the schedule is made up, and a second choice only after all other employees in the employee’s group have had one first choice. Each choice of a scheduled vacation period shall be for a group of at least five (5) consecutive days or the number of days remaining in an employee’s vacation bank if less than five (5) days.
(2)	At an appropriate time each year, the department will obtain from employees entitled to vacations, their preferences as to vacation periods, and shall as soon thereafter as possible, establish workable vacation schedules. In establishing such schedules, the Company will respect the wishes of employees as to the time of taking their vacation insofar as the needs of the service will permit, but subject to the provisions of Paragraph 7(c) of this
Section 10.7
82
I
Section 10,7. Present methods as established in various departments shall determine the order of choice of vacations. An employee who is ill when the vacation schedule is being made up and is unable or unwilling to indicate a choice at that time will forfeit his/her order of choice.
(3)	Sickness or Non-occupational Injury or Death of a Near Relative During Vacation. Should an employee be off sick or off because of a non-occupational injury or should there be a death of a near relative as defined in Paragraph 4a (4) of this Section 10.4 during the employee's scheduled vacation time, the employee may be permitted to change his/her vacation (or that part remaining) to a subsequent date which will not conflict with another employee's vacation. Consideration of such requests is contingent upon prompt notice and reasonable proof of illness or non-occupational injury or death of a near relative to the employee's immediate supervisor. Time due to the death of a near relative will not exceed 3 days except under unusual circumstances.
i.	Deferred Vacation.
The terms of General Order 136 as amended from time to time, concerning deferred vacation, apply to employees represented by the Union. .
Section 10.8.	Layoff Allowance, a. If a reduction of force is made, an employee who is la id-off from employment in the Company will receive an allowance to ease a possible hardship caused by the layoff. The total amount of the layoff allowance will be determined by multiplying (1) the total number of weeks allowable under the terms of Paragraph b of this Section 10.8 for accumulated service with the Company at the time of the layoff minus the total number of weeks or fractions thereof already paid because of previous layoffs, if any, by (2) the employee's straighttime weekly (40 hours) pay at the time of layoff. The phrase "accumulated service with the Company", as used in this section, shall include periods of creditable employment with Pennsalt Chemicals Corporation, or Wyandotte Chemicals Corporation, or Port Huron Paper Company, as well as with The Detroit Edison Company.
Section !0.8

For each full month of service since the last anniversary of the employee's adjusted employment date, an employee will receive one-twelfth (1/12) of the additional layoff allowance to which the employee would have been entitled at the completion of that year.
c.	The layoff allowance shall be in addition to accrued vacation credits.
d.	When an employee is laid-off or displaced from his/her classification, pursuant to Section 7.11, the Company will not insist that he/she accept work in a classification which is more than two (2) grades lower in order to avoid being laid-off from employment in the Company.
e.	If an employee accepts lower-rated work to avoid being laid-off from employment in the Company and is nevertheless subsequently laid-off from employment in the Company, the exact number of weeks allowable and the employee's weekly straight time (40 hours) pay for each such week will be determined as follows:
Section 10.3
84
(1)	For accumulated service up to the time of the employee's first reduction in pay, the number of weeks allowable under Paragraph b of this Section 10.8, minus the total number of weeks and fractions thereof paid because of previous layoffs, if any, at the employee's straight time weekly (40 hours) pay in effect at the time of the employee's first reduction:
plus
(2)	The balance of the number of weeks allowable for the employee's total accumulated service under Paragraph b of this Section 10.8, after deducting the number of weeks and fractions thereof paid because of (a) previous layoffs, if any, and (b) under paragraph (1) above, at his/her weekly straight time (40 hours) pay in effect .at the time of such layoff.
Section 10.9. Pay During Extended Disability, a. An employee with more than six (6) months' cumulative employment who is absent from work because of disabilities resulting from personal sickness or non-occupational injury and who furnishes the Company with a medical eertifieate signed by the attending doctor and with such other satisfactory evidence of disability as may be required will, after exhausting his/her pay for absence provided in Section 10.4, be allowed additional pay up to the number of weeks (at 40 straight time hours per week) set forth in Paragraph b of this Section 10.9:
(1)	For each disabling non-occupational injury beginning with the first 1/2 day of each such injury,
(2)	For each disabling personal sickness after the first five (5) days of each such period of sickness: provided, however, that if an employee's pay during absence, including the employee's bank of days under Section 10.4, is less than five (5) days at the time his period of extended sickness begins, the waiting period shall be reduced by the number of days remaining in the bank at that time.
b.	The number of weeks allowable under Paragraph a of this Section 10,9 will be determined according to the following table:
Years of Service

c.	Effective June 7, 1999, the waiting period to fully re-establish an employee’s extended disability bank shall be the number of calendar days the employee was off on extended disability just prior to returning to work, except that if such an employee becomes disabled for an entirely new illness or injury, the extended disability bank will be restored in full after the employee returns to work for forty straighttime hours.
d.	If a holiday occurs during a period for which pay during extended disability is allowed, such holiday shall be paid as a holiday and shall not be deducted from the number of days allowable under this Section 10.9.

(5)	Surviving Spouse • All surviving spouses of any active employees and employees who retired after June 7, 1999 with Company provided health care and their eligible dependents may, if they desire, continue in the POS or their HMO for a two year period starting on the date of the employee’s death, with the Company paying 100% of the required premium. At the end of the two year period, surviving spouses and their eligible dependents may continue in the Company's basic health care plan, presently the POS, by paying 10% of the required premium if the active employee was at least age 45 and had at least 15 years of service or the retiree (retired after June 7, 1999) had the Company’s basic health care plan at the time of his/her death. Such coverage may be continued until such surviving spouse reaches normal Medicare age, at which time such coverage may be continued by paying 66% of the required premium. Such coverage will cease if the surviving spouse remarries. Further, if such a surviving spouse is eligible or becomes eligible for health care coverage from his/her employer, he/she must enroll for such coverage and the Company health care plan will become the secondary insurance carrier. Cost sharing, in accordance with this Section 10.10, will apply. If and when eligibility to continue in the POS ceases, the surviving spouse may convert to an individual policy written by the same insurance company.

is described in the Plan Document currently on file in Group Insurance. Any change that is construed by either party as materially affecting the coverages provided under the POS will be discussed before implementation.
(2)	Health Maintenance Organization - Coverage provided by individual HMDs for medical and hospital, prescription drug, vision care, and hearing care will be determined by each HMO selected by the Company. HMO coverage will be described in the enrollment booklet given to employees during the annual time period in which employees choose their health care coverage for the following plan year (the annual open enrollment period).
i	(3) Dental Maintenance Organization • Coverage provided by
individual DMOs for dental care will be determined by each
I	DMO selected by the Company. DM0 coverage will be described
in the enrollment booklet given to employees during the annual
I	open enrollment period.
(4)	Enrollment - An employee's choice of health care coverage (POS, I	HMO and DMO) will be for the entire plan year. Exceptions to
I	the annual enrollment are described in the Summary Plan
Description for Health Care.
c.	Employee Costs
I
(1)	Deductibles, Co-pays, Payment Limitations and Penalties -These are described in the Health Care Section of the Handbook for Employees for the POS and the enrollment booklets for the HMOs and DMOs.
(2)	Point-of-Service Premium Cost Sharing - The POS premium cost sharing formula is:
Average Annual POS Cost Per Employee less Company's Contribution (1991 PHCP Base Cost +■ 8% Per Year) equals Average Employee Contribution.
10.10
S9
(a)	Average Annual POS Cost Per Employee Per Year. This average POS cost will be determined by taking the total health care cost of all active employees in the POS Plan and dividing it by the average number of active employees covered under that plan during that year. This total health care cost includes all claims paid (medical, dental, vision, hearing, prescription drugs and related claims administration costs, but excluding reserve adjustments) for active employees in the POS during that year.
(b)	Company’s Contribution (1991 PHCP Base Cost + 8% Per Year.)
(1)	1991 PHCP Base Cost. This base cost has been established uy taking the total health care cost paid (medical, dental, vision, hearing, prescription drugs, and related claims administration costs, but excluding reserve adjustments) by the Company in 1991 for active employees enrolled in the PHCP and dividing that total health care cost by the average number of active employees in the PHCP during 1991. The 1991 PHCP Base Cost has been established as $4,629.
(2)	8% Per Year. The Company's contribution to the POS will be the 1991 PHCP Base Cost ($4,629) plus 8% per year compounded for each additional year beyond 1991. The following illustrates how the Company's maximum POS contribution is calculated:
Section 10.10
90
Year	Previous Year’s Maximum Contribution	8% Company Improvement Factor		POS Maximum Contribution	
1992	$4,629	X	1.08	■Z.	$4,999
1993	4,999	X	1.08	—	5,399
1994	5,399	X	1.08	—	5,831
1995	5,831	X	1.08	=	6,297
1996	6,297	X	1.08	=	6,801
1997	6,801	X	1.08	=	7,345
1998	7,345	X	1.08		7,933
1999	7,933	X	1.08	=	8,568
2000	8,568	X	1.08	—	9,253
2001	9,253	X	1.08	=	9,993
2002	9,993	X	1.08	—	10,792
2003	10,792	X	1.08	—	11,655
2004	11,655	X	1.08	=	12,587
(c) Average Employee Contribution. Employees who enroll in the POS will have to pay premium cost sharing in the following year if the average POS cost per employee per year is greater than the Company's maximum contribution for that year. The actual amount of premium cost sharing, if any, will be determined in March of the following year. Estimated premium cost sharing will be provided to employees during the annual enrollment period.
The employee's contribution will be collected through biweekly payroll deductions beginning in March of the following year and will continue for 26 pay periods. As a result of the Flexible Spending Plan provisions, these payroll deductions will be made on a pre-tax basis. For example, if the 2000 average POS cost per employee is $9,357, the 2000 cost sharing (which the employees would begin paying in March of 2001) will be calculated;
Section 10.10
91
2000 Average POS Cost Per Employee $9,357
2000 Maximum Company Contribution - $9.253
2000 Annual Employee Coat Sharing $ 104
Bi-Weekly Payroll Deduction	$ 4.00
(March of 2001 to March of 2002)
There will be no 8% coat sharing if the average cost per employee for any year is less than or equal to the Company's maximum contribution for that year.
(3)	Health Maintenance Organization Premium Cost Sharing -The HMO premium cost sharing formula is:
Annual HMO Premium Established by Provider less Company's Contribution (1991 HMO Base Cost + 8% Per Year) equals Average Employee Contribution,	•
(a)	Annual HMO Premium Established by Provider', On an annual basis, each HMO provider will establish the annual premium it will charge the Company for employees who enroll in its plan during the forthcoming plan year.
(b)	Company's Contribution (1991 HMO Base Cost + 8% Per Year):
(1)	1991 HMO Base Cost: This has been established by taking the total health care costs paid by the Company in 1991 for active employees enrolled in HMOs (medical, dental, vision, hearing, prescription drugs, and related claims administration costs, but excluding reserve adjustments) and dividing that total health care cost by the average number of active employees in HMOs during 1991. This 1991 HMO Base Cost is $4,164,
Section 10.10
92
(2) 8% Per Year The Company's maximum contribution towards an HMO premium will be the 1991 HMO Base Cost ($4,164) plus 8% per year compounded for each additional year beyond 1991. The following illustrates how the Company’s maximum HMO contribution is
calculated:			8% Company Improvement Factor			POS Maximum Contribution
Year	Previous Year's Maximum Contribution					
1992	$4,164	X	1.08		-	$4,497
1993	4,497	X	1.08			4,857
1994	4,857	X	1.08		—	5,246
1995	5,246	X	1.08		—	5,666
1996	■	5,666	X	1.08		=	6,119
1997	6,119	X	1.08		—	6,609
1998	6,609	X	1.08		=	7,138
1999	7,138	X	1.08		—	7,709
2000	7,709	X	1.08		—	8,326
2001	8,326	X	1.08		=	8,992
2002	8,992	'	X	1.08		=	9,711
2003	9,711	X	1.08			10,488
2004	10,488	X	1.08		=	11,327
(c)	Average Emnlovee	Contribution:		If	an	annual HMO
premium is greater than the Company's maximum contribution, the excess amount will become the employee's contribution. This excess amount, if any, will be individually calculated for each HMO. If an HMO requires an employee contribution, it will be collected from affected HMO enrollees through bi-weekly payroll deductions starting in January of the enrollment year and will continue for 26 pay periods. For example, if the HAP HMO establishes its 2001 annual premium to be $9,044, premium cost sharing for participants in that plan would be determined as follows:
Section 10.10
93
I
I
1	2001 Annual HAP HMO Prem.	$9,044
2001 Maximum Company Contribution	- $8.992
2001 Annual Employee Cost Sharing	$52
2001 Bi-weekly Payroll Deduction	$2.00
(January of 2001 to January of 2002)
There will be no premium cost sharing if the average cost per employee for any year is less than or equal to the Company’s maximum contribution. The amount of premium cost sharing, if any, will be provided to employees during the annual enrollment period.	'
(4)	Classes a/ Coverage - The following three classes will be used to determine premium groupings for the POS, HMOs, and DMOs:
•	Employee
•	Employee plus one person
•	Employee plus two or more persons
The average employee contribution for the POS or an HMO will be allocated on the basis of the above three classes of coverage.
(5)	Cost Sharing of Premium By Other Than Active Employees:
(a)	Unless otherwise agreed to by the Company, employees on leaves of absence, other than illness leaves of absence, will pay 100% of the actual annual cost for the POS or HMO.
(b)	Employees will pay 100% of the actual annual cost for sponsored dependents.
(c)	All Surviving Spouses of active employees and employees who retired after June 7, 1999 with Company provided
Seaion 10 10
94
health care will have 100% of their POS premium paid by the Company for the first two years. If eligible surviving spouses wish to continue in the POS after two years they may do so by paying 10% of the required premium until normal Medicare age and 66% of the required premium after
• reaching Medicare age. The Company may also elect to provide coverage through HMOs.
(d)	Employees will pay 10% of all required premiums for dependents.
d.	Benefit Administrators - It is understood that the Company may, during the term of the Agreement, change benefit administrators for any portion of the POS with benefits equivalent to those now provided or agreed upon to be provided in the future.
e.	National Health Insurance - Benefits payable under this plan will be reduced by duplicate benefits provided by any type of national health insurance. The Company will, for the duration of this Agreement, pay any premiums, taxes, or contributions, employees may be required to pay under the law creating such insurance that are specifically earmarked or designated for the purpose of financing the program of benefits provided by such law, in addition to any premiums, taxes, or contributions required of the Company. Such payment by the Company on behalf of the employees as aforesaid shall not exceed an amount which, when added to the premiums, taxes, or contributions required of the Company under said law and the premium for the Company's continuing health care plan, would be in excess of the aggregate cost to the Company of its health care plan if such law were not in effect.
f.	Alternative Provider Organizations - It is also understood that the Company may, during the term of the Agreement, offer employees an opportunity to participate in one or more alternative provider organizations. For those employees who elect to participate in such alternative provider organizations, the benefit provisions will be determined by that organization and will be in lieu of corresponding benefits provided under this Agreement. Employees who elect an alternative provider organization may be required to pay the difference
Section 10,10
95
in cost if any between the Company's contribution towards the benefits under the POS and the cost of the benefits as provided by the alternative provider organization. If any alternative provider organization is offered, the Company will give employees an opportunity to change their election each year.
Section 10.11.	Health Care Coverage - Major Medical. This Section 11 was deleted in the 1989 Agreement because the Major Medical language therein was incorporated into Section 10.10.
Section 10.12.	Orthodontics. This Section 12 was deleted in the 1989 Agreement because the orthodontics language therein was incorporated into Section 10.10.
Section 10.13.	Incapacitated Etitployeei. a. Placement of Incapacitated Employees. It is recognized that some employees may become unable to do their regular work because of ill health or because of an incapacity arising out of and in the course of employment with the Company. In any such case, the Company shall attempt to place an employee at other work the employee can satisfactorily perform in the Company in a job classification having a pay rate as close as possible to that of his/her regular job. Such a job search will be conducted for a period of twenty (20) working days prior to terminating an employee due to incapacitation. If another job is not found within these twenty (20) working days, the matter will be reviewed with the Manager of Employee and Labor Relations or the Director of Labor Relations before termination. The placement of such an employee will be discussed in advance with a committee appointed by the Union, and the seniority and bidding provisions of this Agreement shall be waived in order to carry out the purposes of this Section 10.13. The seniority of such an employee shall continue to accumulate in his/her regular job, unless otherwise agreed.
b.	Pay Rate of an Incapacitated Employee. If an incapacitated employee who. has service with the Company according to the table set forth below is placed in a lower-rated job because of ill health or an incapacity arising out of and in the course of his/her employment, the
Section 10.11. 10.12. 10.13
96
employee shall be paid a rate determined as follows, or the rate of the job in which the employee is placed, whichever is higher:
Years of Service	Pay Rate
Less than 15 years.....................................Pay	rate of
job in which the employee .	is placed
15 years but less than 20..............................80%	of the pay
rate of the employee's former classification
20 years but less than 25..............................85%	of the pay
rate of the employee's former classification
25 years or over.......................................90%	of the pay
rate of the employee’s former classification
If implementation of the above table results in a downward pay adjustment of more than $1.00 an hour, the employee's pay will be reduced 3Cfo an hour upon placement, and an additional 30tf an hour every 3 months until the appropriate pay rate in the above table is reached. Such an employee will be expected to perform any of the duties of his/her former classification which the employee is capable of performing.
Section 10.13
97
c.	Such an employee will be provided the opportunity set forth above only with full approval of the Management in respect to the employee's ability to perform any of the jobs in question. The question of whether the Management's decision in any case was arbitrary will be subject to the grievance procedure, including arbitration.
d.	An employee who has been placed in a lower classification in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.13 might prefer, because of personal reasons, to terminate his/her employment with the Company. If so, the Company will consider making a separation allowance or supplemental retirement allowance of equivalent cost, based on the merits of each individual case.

This is a plan to pay disability benefits to employees who become totally disabled after the effective date of this plan through sickness or accident, and the disability extends beyond the period covered by the Company sick-pay plan, but for at least five months. The Long Term Disability Section of the Handbook for Employees is the Summary Plan Description for the Long Term Disability Plan. The Official Plan Document for Long Term Disability is on file in Benefits Plan Administration, The amount of the benefit is 50% of base pay (excluding work area premium, overtime, etc.). The maximum duration of this benefit for most ailments, after
Section 10.14. 10.15
98
payments under the Company sick-pay plan ceases, is until disability ceases or normally the attainment of age 65, whichever comes first. However, if an eligible employee becomes totally disabled on or after age 62, duration of benefits will be in accordance with the table below:
Attained Age at Disablement	Duration of Benefits in Years if Disability gotiiUiugg .
62	3 1/2
63	3
64	2 1/2
65	2
66	1 3/4

. 1. Sick pay under the present Company plan,
2.	Worker’s Compensation benefits,
3.	Benefits available under the Federal Social Security Act (Primary Benefit only),
4.	Pension Plan Benefits. However, if disability benefits begin prior to age 62, Pension Plan Benefits, at the employee's option, may be deferred until age 65,
5.	Other employer-sponsored or government plan providing disability benefits.
Regardless of these offsets, the minimum benefit under this plan would be the lesser of $100 per month or 10% of base pay.
Section 10.15
99
"Totally Disabled" means, during the first 24 months of benefits under this plan, complete inability to petform the normal duties of the employee's regular job or any other Edison job for which the employee might be considered.

"a. To the end that an employee may have uninterrupted weekly income, notwithstanding certain unavoidable interferences with the employee's ability to work, pay at regular straighttime rate will be allowed an employee for time lost from his/her standard work week which is normally paid at the straight-time rate for the four following reasons. It is understood that an employee may be required to furnish reasonable proof of the disability for which pay during absence is to be allowed."
"(2) Injury or illness of a near relative living in the employee's immediate household of such serious nature that the presence of the employee himself/herself is required. Pay allowed for this reason will not exceed 24 hours, except that Management, under unusual circumstances, may allow more."

"(4) Death of a near relative (son, daughter, husband, wife, father, mother, sister, brother, grandfather, grandmother, grandchild, mother-in-law, father-in-law, or anyone who is very close and who is living in the same household with the employee). Pay allowed for this reason will not exceed 24 hours, except under unusual circumstances."
c.
An employee becomes eligible for pay during absence, as provided in this Section 10,4, in the payroll year in which he completes six (6) months' service with the Company. During this first six (6) months, pay may be allowed for up to but not exceeding 80 hours, which shall be charged against the 160 hours allowable for the first payroll year in which such six (6) months service is completed. Pay allowed under this Section 10.4 for any or all reasons shall not exceed 160 hours in any payroll year, except that for personal sickness or non-occupational injury, an employee will be allowed as many additional hours of absence as were not paid for of the 160 hours allowable in each of the two (2) preceding payroll years, referred to as "the bank." Further, if an employee, due to extensive illness, has used his/her current year's allowance of 160 hours, the employee may use the bank for necessary absence due to the death of a near relative. Deduction of hours from the bank will be made first from the earlier payroll year. However, the number of hours in the bank of an employee returning from a leave of absence will be the same number as in the employee's bank the date the employee's leave started. If it appears the illness or injury will result in an absence of more than two full pay weeks, Management will, as soon as is practicable, change the employee's schedule to a standard work week consisting of five (5) regularly scheduled eight (8) hour work periods on as many work days."
Attachment A
Section 10.&,	Jury Duty, will read:
a. An employee absent because of jury duty shall be allowed straight-time pay not to exceed forty (40) hours in any one (1) week for hours the employee would have otherwise worked at straight-time pay.

Employees shall report for work whenever they are not actually on jury duty during their scheduled work periods unless otherwise instructed by their supervisors.

PAY RATE SCHEDULES
Schedule 2
PROGRESSION SCHEDULES FOR TRADES AND OPERATING CLASSIFICATIONS WITHIN THE RECOGNIZED BARGAINING
UNITS *
As has occurred in most previous negotiations, the Parties have agreed to remove several classifications from this Schedule 2. Many of these changes have been due to the combining of two or more classifications into one; others were removed due to reductions in classifications or layoffs from seniority lists; still others were due to the fact that the work which was previously performed by the classification is no longer performed by Detroit Edison employees. It is agreed that, if any time in the future, the Company decides to again employ Detroit Edison employees to perform the work of a classification which has been removed from this Schedule 2 or to implement a new classification which is equivalent to a removed classification, such work will be reestablished as work represented by Local 223.

The Company recognized the Union as the exclusive representative in matters of wages, hours, working and other conditions of employment for all employees in those classifications listed in Attachment A (OPT Elect ion/Recogniti on History) to this Agreement.
b. Since the original elections and mutual recognitions referenced in Attachment A, the parties have occasionally agreed to change job titles and/or to create new job descriptions from existing classifications. Therefore, the Company also recognizes the Union as the exclusive representative in matters of wages, hours and working and other conditions of employment for all employees in those classifications listed in Attachment B (OPT Wage Rate Schedule) to this Agreement.
Section 1.2,	Application of Provisions. Unless the context otherwise clearly indicates, all provisions of this Agreement shall apply to all employees covered by this Agreement.	’

the term of this Agreement as a condition of employment, except as otherwise provided herein. After the signing trf this Agreement, when employees are first employed in a classification covered by this Agreement they must, as a condition of employment, arrange within their first thirty (30) days of such employment to either (1) become a member of the Union in good standing, or (2) to make payments (hereinafter referred to as substitute payments) to the Union of amounts equal to the uniformly required, monthly dues they would have paid if they were members. The term "substitute payments" shall not include initiation fees which are not required of a non-member. The failure of employees to (L) maintain their membership in the Union in good standing or (2) to make substitute payments shall result in their discharge unless membership was terminated for reasons other than failure of the employees to tender initiation fees and periodic dues uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership. An employee may resign from membership by sending notice thereof in writing to the President of the Local Union by registered mail, return receipt requested.	.
Section 1.4.	Assignment and Authorization for Deduction of Initiation Fee, Dues, Substitute Payments, COPE Contributions, and Assessments.
a. The Company will, hereafter, with respect to each employee who has individually and voluntarily authorized such deduction in writing in a form acceptable to the Company, deduct from the wages due an employee his/her membership dues or substitute payments, including:
(1)	A duly authorized uniform initiation fee assessed by the Union.
(2)	Duly authorized membership dues (including such general assessments as may be a part thereof) levied by the Union.

!	(3) Substitute payments.
(4) Committee on Political Education (COPE) Contributions.
Any such authorization may be revoked at any time by the employee sending notice to the Paymaster of the Company by registered mail, return receipt requested. The Paymaster will promptly notify the Union of any such revocation by forwarding a . copy of the revocation. As a convenience, the Company will continue to deduct dues of an employee transferred to a classification not covered by this Agreement during his/her trial period of six (6) months. The authorization will be automatically canceled when employment in the Company is terminated for any reason, or six (6) months after an employee is so transferred. If such an employee returns to a bargaining unit during the term of this Agreement, he/she must, within thirty (30) days thereafter, again become and remain a member of the Union in good standing.
b.	The Company will remit to the Treasurer of the Union by the 10th day of each month the dues, substitute payments, COPE contributions, initiation fees, and general assessments deducted from employees' wages in the preceding month. If no pay is due an employee, or if for some other reason deductions are not made at the agreed times, the Company will attempt to make the overdue deductions later in the same month, if possible, after which the Company will not be responsible.
c.	Duly authorized and uniform initiation fees, substitute payments, COPE contributions, and dues (including such general assessments as m$y be a part thereof) shall be in the amounts certified in writing to the Company over the signature of two (2) officers of the Local Union.

Section 1.5. Successor Agreements.
a.	Successor Clause
(1)	Internal Sale or Transfer - In the event the Company changes ownership of all or a part (i,e., a part employing permanent, full time bargaining unit employees) of its existing corporate operations by the sale or transfer of such operations to an existing or a newly created subsidiary or corporate affiliate, the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements shall be binding on any such subsidiary or affiliate.
(2)	External Sale of Transfer - In the event the Company sells, or otherwise divests itself of all or a part (i.e., a part employing permanent, full-time bargaining unit employees) of its corporate operations in any transaction where the collective bargaining agency and the rights of union represented employees are or may be affected, the transaction will be conditioned on the purchasing entity agreeing to recognition of Local 223 and, at a minimum, assumption of the arbitration, seniority, job retention, wage, benefit and pension provisions of the then existing Collective Bargaining Agreements. Such purchaser and the Union will negotiate to retain and/or modify other existing applicable Agreement provisions, and any other matters appropriate for such negotiations. Any disputes regarding which terms, if any, of such Collective Bargaining Agreements are not applicable must be resolved between the Union and the new or restructured entity by arbitration. It is the intention of the Company and the Union that such disputes be resolved expeditiously. Prior to closing, the Company will furnish Local 223 a minimum of 60 days notice of any transaction covered by the provisions of (1) and (2) above.

b.	Worker Transition Program - The Company commits to developing jointly with Local 223 an industry worker transition program which shall provide skills upgrades, apprenticeships and training programs, voluntary separation packages consistent with reasonable business priorities, and job banks to coordinate and assist placement of Local 223 members into comparable employment at no less than their current wage rates and current or substantially equivalent fringe benefits. It is the Company’s further intention to seek recovery of the cost of such worker transition programs as a transition cost as permitted by applicable restructuring legislation and MPSC restructuring orders.
c.	Future Employment — In the event the Comnany. DTE Energy and/or any DTE affiliates, purchases or merges divisions, business units, or generating stations or generating units with any entity in the electric utility business anywhere in the United States, and additional employees are required, the Company shall offer employment to members of Local 223 who are qualified, but have been displaced from employment at Detroit Edison, provided that such employment offer is consistent with any then existing labor agreement covering the acquired or merged facility or business unit. In the event that DTE Energy acquires or merges with an entity where the employees are not represented by a union, the Company and Local 223 agree to conduct themselves in any union representation elections pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding between the parties regarding union representation elections.
d.	Duration of Successor Agreement Selection - This Successor Agreement Clause does not diminish the wages, hours working or other conditions of employment under existing or successor collective bargaining agreements. Also, this
Section 1.3
Successor Agreement Clause does not alter the rights and responsibilities of the parties in negotiations for successor collective bargaining agreements, except that the provisions of this clause will continue in effect until January 1, 2008 unless changed by mutual agreement.

Section 4.2.	Grievances, a. Discussion with Immediate Supervisor. Should any disagreement arise between any employee or employees covered by this Agreement and the Company, it shall be deemed a grievance. It shall be discussed by the employee or employees and his/her or their immediate supervisor, either personally, or with or through his/her or their Union representative. (If the disagreement involves the issuance of an Oral Reminder or a Written Reminder, the discussion will also include at least the second line supervisor.) If not resolved at this discussion stage, these disciplinary issues will go directly to Step 3.) No grievance that has been discussed with or through a Union representative will be adjusted unless a Union representative is present or has been offered the opportunity to be present. The immediate supervisor will have ten (10) days exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays from the date the grievance is first discussed to provide a verbal answer to the grievant and/or Union representative. If such an answer is not given within the required ten (10) days, the grievance may be appealed to Step 1 without a verbal answer from the immediate supervisor. It is understood that all settlements and/or answers at this discussion level are without prejudice or precedent to the Company or the Union and either party may take an entirely different position if the grievance is appealed to Stepl. It is further understood that no employee will leave work for the purpose of discussing a grievance without first obtaining permission from his/her supervisor and being properly relieved. The Company, except as otherwise agreed, will pay not more than one aggrieved employee and one Union representative for time necessarily lost from regular working hours while discussing such grievance with the supervisor.
b.	Step 1. If the grievance is not settled by discussion with the immediate supervisor, the procedure shall be as follows (written decisions shall be handed or mailed to the Union in the time limits designated below unless the limits are waived or extended by the Union):
Section 4.2
9
The grievance shall be promptly, and in a clear manner, placed in writing and signed by the authorized representative or representatives of the Union, and submitted bo the designated Company official who is authorized to issue written answers to or otherwise resolve Step 1 grievances submitted by the grievant. If the written grievance is not so submitted within twenty (20) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) of the action of the Company causing the disagreement, it will be considered to no longer exist.
The Company official so designated to whom the Step 1 grievance is presented, or someone delegated by the Company official with authority to settle or decide the grievance shall, unless otherwise agreed to by the Union, convene a Step 1 meeting of the parties within twenty (20) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) of receipt of the written grievance. Using the Interest Based Bargaining (IBB) process, the parties will make a good faith effort to resolve the grievance at this Step 1 meeting. Labor Relations will facilitate these Step I discussions and will record the resolution reached by the parties. If the grievance cannot be settled using the IBB process, the written grievance will be immediately assigned a grievance number by Labor Relations.
It is understood that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing, all settlements and/or answers at Step 1 are without prejudice or precedent to the Company or the Union and either party may take an entirely different position if the grievance is heard at Step 3.
c.	Step 2. A designated Manager or Vice-President shall receive a copy of those grievances from his/her area of responsibility which have been appealed to Step 3. Where appropriate, this Management person may request his/her direct reports to again IBB the grievance, possibly including others not previously involved or will take whatever other action, if any, he/she believes is necessary. It is understood that unless
Section 4.2
10
otherwise agreed to in writing, all settlements as a result of this Step 2 review are without prejudice or precedent to the Company or the Union.
d.	Step 3.

If the grievance is not so submitted to the President within such twenty (20) days, it will be considered to no longer exist. The President of the Company, or the President’s Delegate with full power and authority to settle or decide the grievance, shall, after receipt of the grievance, thereupon contact the Union within twenty (20) calendar days to see if the grievance has been resolved through the Step 2 review. If not resolved, a Step 3 hearing will be scheduled at the earliest mutually agreeable time. Unless otherwise agreed, such a Step 3 hearing will take place within 45 calendar days of the Union's appeal to Step 3. The President of the Company or the President's Delegate will have ten (10) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) from the end of the Last Step 3 meeting to mail to the Local Union office and the bargaining unit chairperson, his/her decision in writing, unless the time is waived or extended by the Union. Provided, however, that if a stenographic transcript is made of the Step 3 meeting or meetings, the last meeting will be considered to have been held on the day such transcript is placed in the hands of the President of the Company or the President's Delegate.
Section 4.3.	Arbitration of Grievances. If the Union is not satisfied with the decision of Management at Step 3 of any grievance which concerns the meaning or application of the terms of this Agreement, then the Union may submit such grievance to arbitration in accordance with Article 5 within sixty (60) calendar days after the mailing by the Company to the Local Union office
Section 4.3
11
of the decision of the President or the President’s Delegate at Step 3. Any such grievance not so submitted to arbitration within sixty (60) calendar days will be considered to no longer exist. Grievances which do not concern the meaning or application of the terms of this Agreement may not be submitted to arbitration, and will be considered to no longer exist. The question of whether a grievance is subject to arbitration may be arbitrated.
Section 4.4.	Persons Present. Either of the parties may have present at the meetings provided for in the foregoing steps, any person or persons they may consider necessary to the proper consideration and settlement of the grievance. It is understood that, except as otherwise specifically agreed to in writing by the Company, not more than three (3) employees of the Union's choosing shall be paid by the Company for the time lost from their regular working hours while attending Step 1, Step 2 and Step 3 hearings and for one (1) employee while attending arbitration.
Section 4.5.	Minutes. The Company will keep, prepare, and promptly submit to the Union minutes of each meeting held at Step 3, except as otherwise agreed, or except when a stenographic transcript is taken. If such a transcript is made, a copy of it will be promptly furnished to the Union.
Article 5 ARBITRATION
Section 5.1.	Submission to Arbitration. Any grievance which may be submitted to arbitration under the provisions of either Section 4.3 or of Article 6 may be so submitted within the time limits therein provided by requesting the American Arbitration Association in writing to select an arbitrator in accordance with its voluntary labor arbitration rules and sending a copy of such request by certified mail within such time limits, addressed to the Company to the attention of its President at 2000 Second Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48226.
Sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1

Article 6 GRIEVANCES IN DISCHARGE, SUSPENSION, DECISION MAKING LEAVE, AND DEMOTION CASES
Unless otherwise agreed between the Company and the Union, prior to the discharge, suspension, decision making leave (DML), or demotion for cause of an employee, the Company will conduct a fact finding meeting with the Chairperson of the bargaining unit or, Acting Chairperson, or the Chairperson’s designee. (See also Section 3.31 regarding the Supervisor’s obligation to provide Union representation under other circumstances involving Positive Discipline.) Unless otherwise agreed between the Company and the Union, the Company will prepare and submit to the Union minutes of the fact finding meeting. Unless otherwise agreed between the Company and the Union, if an employee is discharged, suspended, given a DML, or
Sections 5.2, 5.5, 5,4, 5.5 and 6
13
demoted for cause, the Union shall be notified of such action promptly in writing by the Company. Notice will be addressed to the Local Union President and a copy mailed to the Chairperson of the bargaining unit in which the employee was working, or in the Chairperson's absence the Vice Chairperson or Chief Steward. If the employee is not probationary, the employee or the Union may, within twenty (20) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) of notice to the Union, file a written grievance directly with the President of the Company to protest such action without taking the preliminary steps of the grievance procedure set forth in Section 2 of Article 4. It is recognized that such a grievance should be heard at the earliest possible time and take precedence over grievances of a different nature. Therefore, such employee shall have the right to a prompt hearing on such charges before the President of the Company or the President's Delegate, with full poxvcr and authority to sustain or alter the severity of the discharge, suspension, DML, or demotion, or to otherwise settle the grievance. The President of the Company or the President's Delegate shall report his/her decision in writing, mailed or delivered to the Local Union office within five (5) calendar days after the conclusion of such hearing. However, if a stenographic transcript is made of the hearing, the conclusion of the hearing will be considered to be the day such transcript is placed in the hands of the President of the Company or the President’s Delegate. If the Union is not satisfied with the decision of the President or the President's Delegate, the Union may submit such grievance to arbitration in accordance with Article & hereof within sixty (60) calendar days after the date of mailing by the Company to the Local Union office of the decision on such grievance. If not so submitted within such sixty (60) calendar days, the grievance shall be considered to no longer exist. If so submitted to arbitration within sixty (60) calendar days, the power of the arbitrator shall be limited to either upholding the disciplinary action as stated in the decision of the President or the President's Delegate or vacating such disciplinary action. If the arbitrator vacates a discharge, DML, suspension, or demotion, the arbitrator shall order the employee returned to his/her former job with full seniority and compensation for all time and wages lost. The discharge, suspension, DML, or demotion of a probationary employee shall not be the subject of a grievance or arbitration.

Article 7 SENIORITY
Section 7.1.	Service Defined. Length of employment in the Company (including the length of all previous periods of employment in the Company) shall be known.as "service". Benefits, such as vacations, pay during absence, pension, and Voluntary Separation Plan are based on service.
Section 7.2.	Seniority Defined. Seniority is the relationship of one employee to other employees on the same seniority list within the bargaining unit. A seniority list establishes the order by which the employees listed thereon will be considered, as provided in this Agreement, for layoffs, rehiring, promotions, and permanent transfers within the bargaining unit.
Section 7.3.	Acquiring Seniority, a. Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, an employee acquires seniority in a bargaining unit or bargaining units by working in one or more classifications covered by a single seniority list in that bargaining unit for a continuous period of six (6) months. Seniority, when acquired, dates back to the time when such continuous employment began and accumulates so long as such employment continues.
b. An employee who has not acquired twelve (12) months of service is a probationary employee.
Section 7.4.	Seniority Lists, a. The seniority status of each present employee shall be that which has been determined by the present seniority lists.
b.	The Company will cooperate with the Union in working out a mutually satisfactory method of showing the seniority status of employees. The Company will furnish each month to the bargaining unit chairperson the names of those employees who have acquired seniority in the unit during the month, and send a copy to the
Sections 7. A 7, A 7.3 and 7.4
15
President of the Local Union. Seniority lists shall be brought up to date each January 15 and July 15 and posted by the Company, and one (1) copy of each list shall be furnished to the President of the Local Union and at least five (5) copies to the bargaining unit chairperson. Such seniority lists shall be deemed to be correct as to the seniority of all employees except those who question the same within twenty (20) days after such lists are posted by the Company. Employees who could not see the list at the time of posting because of illness, vacation, work assignment, or similar cause shall have twenty (20) days after their opportunity to see the list to question their position. All such objections shall be considered and processed as grievances.
c.	Employees added to any of the seniority lists in the bargaining unit shall have their seniority determined as provided in this Agreement, except as otherwise agreed by the parties. When two employees start on a seniority list on the same day, the senior employee shall be the one with the longer continuous employment in the occupational group. If this does not break the tie, reference shall be made successively to cumulative employment in the division, then department and finally the Company.
Section 7.5.	Transfers at Employee's Request, a. Employees who transfer from one seniority list to another at their own request will continue to accumulate seniority on the seniority list from which they transferred for a period of six (6) months from the date of transfer. During this six (6) month period, the employees will be on trial to demonstrate their qualifications and abilities for the work in their new classification. If found not qualified for such work by Management during this period, the employees will be returned to their former seniority list and classification without prejudice. At the end of this six (6) month trial period, if retained, the employee's seniority will be established on his/her new seniority list retroactively to the date of transfer, and the employee's seniority on his/her former seniority list will cease to accumulate but will be retained as of the date of transfer and may be exercised only in the event of layoff. The trial period may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties up to six (6) months.
Section 7.5
16
b.	For hardship reasons or by mutual agreement of the parties, bargaining unit employees who voluntarily transfer to other classifications or other locations, represented or non-represented, may voluntarily return to their former seniority list and classification within ninety (90) calendar days of the date of transfer without prejudice.
c.	If an employee transfers to a classification not covered by this Agreement, the employee will continue to accumulate seniority on the seniority list from which the employee transferred for a period of six (6) months from the date of transfer, or longer if mutually agreed. If the employee becomes permanently assigned to the classification, the employee's seniority will be adjusted so that accumulation stops as of the initial date of the transfer. The terms of Section 1,3 (Agency Shop) apply while seniority is being accumulated. If such an employee wants his/her deduction of dues to continue beyond the period provided by Section 1.4 (Assignment and Authorization for Deduction of Initiation Fee, Dues, and Assessments) the employee must sign a statement to that effect.
Section 7.6.	Transfers by Management. Whenever in the course of changes such as reorganization or transfers of work from one division or department to another, Management shall permanently transfer an employee from one division or department to another, and the transferred employee will be placed in the classification most like his/her previous work. New seniority lists for the classifications in which employees are placed as the result of such transfers will be made up, and all employees on these new lists will have their respective seniorities adjusted to include all service with the Company in the classification and all like classifications, except that where seniority has been terminated, prior service shall not be included unless otherwise agreed.
Section 7.6
17
Section 7.7.	Temporary Assignments. An employee who is assigned to a classification on another seniority list on a temporary basis will not accumulate seniority on that list. However, if the assignment is continuous and the vacancy ia posted as a permanent vacancy, the employee's seniority, if the employee is selected to fill the permanent vacancy, will be established on his/her old and new seniority lists as of the date of the temporary assignment.
Section 7.8.	Incapacitated Employees. An employee represented by the Union who becomes incapacitated for his/her regular work may be placed at any work the employee can do without regard to the seniority provisions of this Agreement, and upon recuperation shall be returned to his/her former classification or the classification the employee would be entitled to through qualifications and accumulated seniority. The seniority of such an employee will accumulate only on his/her former seniority list.
Section 7.9,	Leave of Absence. An employee on leave of absence will continue to accumulate seniority, and at the termination of the leave, the employee will be returned to his/her former classification or, if that classification no longer exists, to the classification the employee is entitled to by qualifications and seniority, provided he/she is able to perform its duties. The terms of Section 1.3 (Agency Shop), apply while seniority is being accumulated.
Section 7.10.	Seniority of Employees Promoted to Supervisory or Staff Positions. If an employee is or has been promoted from a classification covered by this Agreement to a supervisory or staff position and is thereafter transferred back through a layoff, the employee's seniority will be the seniority the employee had at the time of promotion reduced by one (1) day for each day the employee has been out of the bargaining unit beyond six (6) months. The rules for accumulation of seniority, as set forth in Section 7.5, shall apply to these promotions.
Sections Z 7, 7,8, 7 9 and 7JO
18
Section 7.11.	Layoffs or Reductions. a. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Company finda it necessary to lay off or reduce an employee or employees from a classification or a seniority list, the Company will notify the Local Union President of the matter in writing and will negotiate with the Union to formulate a program for spreading the work, transferring employees, or taking some other appropriate action including but not limited to monetary incentives to allow employees in affected classifications to voluntarily leave the Company, retraining to allow employees to qualify for other jobs, temporary placement into other jobs at other locations and temporary placement into special projects. If the parties are unable to agree on such a program within thirty (30) days after the matter is first brought to the attention of the Union, the procedure outlined below shall apply.
b.	If it becomes necessary to reduce the force by laying off employees from any seniority list, the employee with the least seniority on that list shall be laid off first, provided that employee can be replaced with a qualified employee having higher seniority. However, employees who are performing below expectations on their overall performance rating are subject to layoff without regard to seniority.
c.	Any employee who is being laid off from a seniority list may, at his/her own request, use seniority the employee retains on any other seniority list to displace an employee on such other seniority list whose seniority is less than his/her own thereon; or to displace any probationary employee in his/her bargaining unit, provided, in either case, that the employee is qualified to perform the work available. Any employee who thus transfers and displaces a probationary employee or a junior employee on some other seniority list will retain his/her seniority indefinitely on the seniority list from which the employee was laid off. In case the employee is restored to the seniority list from which the employee was laid off, his/her seniority on the list from which the employee was laid off shall include the time spent on the seniority list or lists to which the employee was transferred during the period of layoff. And, if restored to the seniority list from which the employee
Section-7,}I L t.
19
was laid off, the employee will be given no seniority credit on the list or lists to which the employee was assigned during the period of layoff.
d.	The Company will attempt to place any employee who is being laid off from his/her seniority list at work he/she is qualified to do in his/her own or other departments before hiring new employees for such work from outside the Company, If placed, the employee's seniority on the list from which the employee was laid off will be retained and accumulate in the same manner as if the employee had replaced a junior employee under Paragraph c of this Section 7.11,
e.	If the affected employees have not been placed under Paragraphs a, b, c, or d of this Section 7.11, the employees will be offered work currently being performed by contractors which they can perform or be expected to perform with reasonable training. To meet this end, the parties commit to discuss and reach mutual agreement on how to accomplish the above.
f.	An employee who meets expectations and is laid off from employment in the Company, and is later hired into a lower classification (while the employee still has recall rights) will retain his/her seniority indefinitely on the list from which the employee was laid off. In case the employee is later restored to the seniority list from ' which the employee was laid off, his/her seniority on the list from which the employee was laid off shall include the time spent on the other seniority list or lists during the period of layoff and, if restored to the seniority list from which the employee was laid off, the employee will be given no seniority credit on the list or lists to which the employee was assigned during the period of layoff, and the employee shall be given no seniority credit anywhere for the period of unemployment from the Company.
g.	An employee is not entitled to reimbursement by the Company for expenses incurred by the employee in accepting work under this Section 7.11.
Section Z / /
20
FILE COP¥
h.	An employee who meets expectation and is Laid off from employment in the Company will retain his/her seniority on the list from which he/she was laid off and will have recall rights for a period of time equal to his/her seniority on that list, or for five (5) years, whichever is the lesser. If not recalled or hired into a lower classification during this period, the employee's seniority shall be terminated.
i.	Qualified employees who have been laid off from any seniority list and retain seniority thereon under this Section 7.11, who are able to return to work, will be called back in the reverse order of their layoffs, except that an employee who had been retained outside of seniority order because the employee had been a Union representative who is subsequently laid off will be called back in the order which would have applied to the employee if the employee had not been a Union representative.
j.	Should it become necessary for the Company to reduce for a period which it appears will be six (6) months or more the number of employees in a classification at a work location:
(1)	The employed in that classification with the least seniority on the seniority list covering the classification affected and employed at the work location in question will be displaced first, provided the employee can be replaced, if necessary, with a qualified employee having higher seniority.
(2)	Such employee may, if qualified, displace an employee on the same seniority list employed elsewhere in his/her own classification whose seniority is less than his/her own thereon, or such employee may, if qualified, displace an employee in some other lower-rated classification on the same seniority list employed elsewhere or at the same location whose seniority is less than his/her own thereon.
Section 7.11
21
k.	For the purposes of layoffs or involuntary transfers or work assignments when seniority is a factor, an elected or appointed Union representative as listed below will be considered as being at the top of his/her seniority list, provided the pending layoff, involuntary transfer or change in work assignment would interfere with his/her job-related contract administration duties.

Section 7,13.	Trial Period, a. Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph c of this Section 7.13, every employee who begins employment for the first time in a classification in the bargaining unit shall be on trial for a period of six (6) months from the first day of his/her continuous employment in that classification to demonstrate his/her abilities and qualifications for such work. If the employee shall be found not qualified by Management during this six (6) month period, he/she shall be returned to his/her former classification, if any, without prejudice. In the event of disagreement concerning the employee’s ability or qualifications, except in the case of a probationary employee, the matter may be processed through the grievance procedure up to the President of the Company, or the President's delegate, whose decision shall be controlling, except that the question of whether the Management's action has been arbitrary or discriminatory may be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Article 5 of this Agreement.
Sections Z12 and 7,1 J
IS
b.	In the case of a probationary employee, or one who is rehired into a classification in which he/she has no seniority, termination of employment shall not be the subject of a grievance or arbitration. Otherwise, such an employee shall have the full benefit of the grievance procedure under Articles 4 and 5.
c,	(Exception to paragraph a of this Section:) Both parties recognize that in some instances six (6) months may not be a sufficient period of time in which to adequately judge the qualifications and abilities of an apprentice in training. In the event an apprentice in training does not pass required classroom work, he/she will be permitted one (1) repeat session for each course failed during each term of the training program provided he/she is otherwise progressing satisfactorily. Should a second attempt in any course also result in failure, the .apprentice may be dropped from the training program and classification. If such employee, because of classroom work or on-the-job performance, is found not qualified after having been longer than six (6) months in the training program, he/she shall be returned to his/her former classification, if any, and he/she will be credited with an additional six (6) months of seniority in his/her former classification. If such employee has no former classification to which he/she can be returned, the Company will attempt to place him/her on other work which he/she is qualified to perform; but, in such event, he/she will not be credited with seniority in the newfound classification.

b.	In order to meet our shared interests of assuring the health and safety of the workforce, the parties agree to the importance of effective joint health and safety committees and agree such committees will meet on Company time. To achieve an environment in which joint health and safety committees operate effectively, the parties further agree to create a Joint Steering Committee to develop and implement a health and safety committee process. A part of the Joint Steering Committee’s activities will be to;
(1)	Determine the expected purpose and accountabilities of the joint health and safety committees.
(2)	Determine the most effective committee structures, relationships and accountabilities.

Section 8.7.	Moving Expenses, a- If the headquarters of an employee is changed at the Company's request and it is necessary to change the employee's residence, the Company will pay the necessary moving expenses upon receiving a receipted moving bill from the employee within one (1) year of the date of change of headquarters (unless the time is specifically extended by Management in writing). When the employee submits his/her receipted moving bill, the employee will be given an additional sum of money to offset other relocation expenses he/she may have incurred. That sum shall be the current per diem allowance (reference Section 8.16) times thirty (30). Such an employee will be given as much notice as practicable to permit the employee to arrange living quarters in the new locality. However, a change of headquarters because an employee applied for a job at a different location or headquarters or upon a job more than thirty (30) days after layoff is not a change at the Company's request.
Section 8.8.	Job Descriptions, Wage Benchmarking, and Pay Rate Negotiations, a. It is understood and agreed that Management reserves the exclusive right to determine the duties of any classification.	.
b.	Management will furnish the President of the Union with copies of job descriptions (including titles and qualifications such as licenses, degrees, and course requirements) for all classifications covered by this Agreement. Should the Company contemplate (1) implementing a new classification or (2) substantially changing an existing classification, the Company will advise the President of the Union of such changes at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed effective date of such
Sections 8.7 and 8.8
29
changes. During this thirty (30) day period, the Union and the Company will enter into negotiations in an attempt to reach agreement on such changes, including whether such changes were substantial.
c.	If the Union does not believe a job description for a Union represented classification, either an existing job description or one newly brought under the Agreement, accurately reflects the significant duties and responsibilities of the classification, the President of the Union wiU so advise the Company’s Director of Labor Relations. The Director of Labor Relations will arrange a meeting with all the necessary parties to attempt to reach agreement on a revised job description and whether such changes are substantial.
d.	If Management creates a new classification and they want to post and fill such 2 new nlasfiificatinn as soon as possible, the parties will attempt to reach quick agreement on a tentative pay rate and job description for such a classification. If agreement cannot be reached, Management’s proposed pay rate and job description will be put into effect. However, within six months after such a new classification becomes operational, the process in Paragraph e of this Section 8.9 will be followed.
e.	Direct negotiations between the parties will be used to determine the pay rate of any classification covered by this Agreement provided the classification is (1) a new classification, (2) a classification which is brought within the jurisdiction of this Agreement, or (3) a classification already covered by this Agreement, the duties of which have been substantially revised. In direct negotiations, a joint Negotiating Committee will first attempt to reach agreement on slotting the job into existing jobs in the Agreement which have been previously benchmarked through wage surveys. If such agreement cannot, be reached, Management will assign a tentative pay rate and the parties will submit the classification to a joint Benchmarking Committee. Unless otherwise agreed, the parties will conduct a wage survey for any new job, substantially changed job, or any classification brought within
Section S.S
30
I
the jurisdiction of this Agreement at least once during the term of this Agreement. The survey will be conducted using a mutually agreed-to third party and follow the basic agreements reached by the parties in completing their extensive 1998 wage survey. The Benchmarking Committee will report their findings to the Negotiating Committee. The parties will then attempt to negotiate a final pay rate. If not resolved through negotiations, the pay rate proposed by Management shall be put into effect, subject to the Union's right to request mediation of the issue. If not resolved in mediation, the Union has the right to process a grievance through arbitration. The arbitrator’s decision will be confined to the reasonableness of the process used by Management to determine the pay rate.
f.	It is the intent of the parties that all employees be paid within the pay rates established by the above process. However, if a pay rate for a classification is reduced through the above process, an incumbent’s pay will not be reduced. Rather, the incumbents will he brought within the established pay rates through the use of lump sums instead of General Increases being given to others in the same classification who are within the established pay rates.
Section 8.9.	Temporary Assignment la a Higher-Rated Classification. Employees may be eligible for a temporary increase in base pay or a lump sum payment when their roles are changed. A change-in-role is defined as assuming a position with different levels of responsibility and/or assuming a position that requires different skills. Seniority will be considered when selecting volunteers for these change-in-role assignments as worked out by Management and the Union. No employee shall be forced to accept a change-in role assignment.
(1)	When determining the appropriate type and amount of pay adjustment, consideration should be given to:
•	The relative position of the employee’s pay when compared to the maximum pay of the new position.
Section 8.9
31
•	The relative position of the maximum pay of the employee's current position when compared to the maximum pay of the new position, and
•	The degree to which the levels of responsibility or skills required are different from those required of the employee's present role.

This shall not preclude the supervisor working in an emergency or occasionally working to meet the customers' needs.
Section 8.12.	Medical Examinations. If medical examinations are required by the Company for an employee, they shall be at the Company's expense. Written reports of such examinations will be given to an employee, upon request from the employee, except where the examination is a routine pre-hire examination for someone new to the Company, or an examination to determine if an employee who has been absent is ready to return to work, or in first-aid situations not requiring medical attention beyond first-aid. If such employee is not satisfied with the conclusions of said examinations required by the Company, when such conclusions affect his/her status as an employee, the employee may, at his/her own expense, submit a report obtained from a doctor of his/her own choosing for consideration by the Company. If the
Sections 8.10,8.1! and 8. 12

The employee is expected to report as soon as possible, unless the employee is instructed to report at a later specified time within two (2) hours. Time shall start with the time of call
Sections 8.14 and 8.15
34
and shall include the time required to reach home afterward. If the work continues on into the employee's scheduled hours, only time and transportation expense to the job will be allowed.
(2)	If an employee is called at home and accepts an "at-once" overtime assignment requiring the employee to report to his/her regular headquarters, the employee is expected to report as soon as possible. Provided the employee actually reports to work within one (1) hour, the employee will receive a travel time allowance of one (1) hour, at the applicable overtime rate (backed up from the time the employee arrives at his/her regular headquarters), an additional one (1) hour from the job back home, and round trip mileage from his/her home to his/her regular headquarters. However, if the work continues into the employee's next scheduled work period, only the one (1) hour travel time allowance from the home to the job and only the mileage from the employee's home to his/her regular headquarters will be paid.

Section 8.16
35

On such an assignment, travel time and transportation between such temporary headquarters and the employee’s regular headquarters shall be at Company expense once each week. As an alternative to documented expense reimbursement an employee may elect to accept a per diem allowance of $64.30 per day for each day when the employee reports and quits on the job working the customary eight (8) hours per day, said per diem allowance to cover all meals, lodging, travel time and transportation.
Section 8.17,	Meats. When an employee hired before June 1, 1999, is required to work outside of a prearranged eight (8) hour work period on a workday or off-day, the employee will be entitled to a meal or meal money allowance to be furnished by the Company, subject to the following conditions:

With respect to holidays and the personal days, it is agreed that:
a.	Whenever a holiday occurs, every employee will be given a day off with pay if he/she can be spared from work. If the employee cannot be spared, the employee will be paid as provided in this Agreement for working the holiday. If the day observed as a holiday falls on one of the employee's scheduled off-days or another scheduled holiday, another day in the same pay week or the pay week preceding or following will be designated as his/her holiday in lieu of the normally observed holiday. This day will be consecutive with the employee's off-days. Once a day has been designated as a holiday, this designated day will not be changed unless changed by Thursday of the pay week before the week in which the designated day falls. If required to work on either his/her off-day or the day designated as his/her holiday, the regular rules for time worked on such days will be applied.
b.	An employee who is excused with pay on a holiday, or day designated as such, and is later required to work during his/her regularly scheduled hours will receive a minimum of twelve (12) hours' pay for the day.
c.	Holiday pay will not be allowed an employee when the employee:
(I)	Is scheduled to work, but without good reason fails to report.
(2)	Is absent without permission on any part of the workday before or the workday after the holiday, unless it is evident that the employee was not intentionally lengthening the holiday period.
Section 9.13
53
(3)	Is absent without pay the entire week in which a holiday occurs.
d.	Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, when one of the above holidays falls on a Sunday, it will be observed on the following Monday, and when one of the above holidays falls on a Saturday, it will be observed on the preceding Friday, except that when Christinas Eve Day falls on a Sunday, it will be observed on Tuesday, December 26th and, when New Year’s Eve Day falls on a Sunday, it will be observed on Tuesday, January 2nd. However, when Christmas Eve Day, New Year's Eve Day, Independence Day, Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall on Saturday, such holiday will be observed on Saturday by an employee who is scheduled to work such Saturday as part of his standard five-day week, and when Christmas Eve Day, New Year’s Eve Day, Independence Day, Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall on Sunday, such holiday will be observed on Sunday by an employee who is scheduled to work such Sunday as part of his/her standard five-day week,
e.	(The following birthday holiday language will be in effect only from June 7, 1999 to December 31, 1999.) If an employee’s birthday falls on one of his/her regularly scheduled workdays, the employee may: (1) elect to observe his/her birthday holiday on the actual date of his/her birthday, or (2) elect to observe his/her birthday holiday on another day in the same pay week, or the pay week immediately preceding or following, subject to the approval of supervision as to which specific one of these other days can be allowed in light of the needs of the service. Once a specific day has been approved by supervision it will not be changed without agreement of the employee,
f.	To be eligible for personal days, employees must be on the Company payroll at the start of the payroll year. Employees wishing to preschedule a personal day may do so by exercising a choice in addition to that provided in Paragraph h of Section 10.7. Once a specific day has been prescheduled and approved by supervision, it will not be changed without agreement of the employee. Otherwise, employees may, with
Section 9.75
54
supervisory permission, schedule their personal days as they would schedule a one (1) day vacation. If required to work on a previously scheduled personal day, employees will be paid the same as if they had worked a holiday. For purposes of overtime distribution, a personal day will be considered a vacation day. Employees must make every reasonable effort to use their personal days during the payroll year in which they become due, and failure to do so will normally result in forfeiture of the personal days. However, the Company recognizes that unusual circumstances beyond the employee's control (such as illness or injury) may prevent employees from taking their personal days within the payroll year. In such situations, the personal days will be transferred to the employee's deferred vacation bank at the start of the new payroll year.
