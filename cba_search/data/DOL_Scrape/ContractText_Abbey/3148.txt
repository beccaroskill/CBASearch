It is also the right of the County subject to applicable provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding and, in accordance with the Charter and other applicable laws, to direct its employees; to hire, promote, transfer, assign, or retain employees; and to establish reasonable work rules; also to demote, suspend, discharge, or take , any other disciplinary action against its employees for just cause. Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to deny the right of any employee to submit a grievance with regard to the exercise of such rights.
Section 2.2 - Employee Rights. An employee will have and will be protected in the exercise of the right, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal, to form, join and assist the Federation, or to refrain from such activity in accordance with the Employee Relations Act of Baltimore County. In the exercise of this right, employees and their representatives will be free from any and all interference, restraint, coercion and discrimination. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Memorandum of Understanding and in the Employee Relations Act of Baltimore County, the right to assist an employee organization extends to participation in the management of the organization and acting for the organization as representative, including presentation of views to officials of Baltimore County, or other appropriate authority.
Section 2.	3 - Federation Activities.	-
(a)	Designation of Federation Representatives. In addition to Field Representatives employed by the Federation, the Federation may designate representatives from among the employees.

ARTICLE 3	- UNION SECURITY
Section 3.1 - Federation Membership. All employees covered by this Memorandum of Understanding who (a) are members of the Federation, or (b) all employees who are thereafter hired shall, as a condition of continued employment, maintain membership in the Federation or pay to the Federation a service fee in an amount not to exceed the then current Federation dues, in order to defray the cost incurred by the Federation in serving as the exclusive representative of employees in accord with the Employee Relations Act of Baltimore County. The provision of this section shall be contingent upon the showing by the Federation, annually, to the Administration that more than forty percent (40%) of the employees covered by this Memorandum of Understanding are dues paying members of the Federation.
2
Section 3.2 - Agency Shop. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1, in the event that the federation certifies to the County that seventy percent (70%) or more of the employees covered by this Memorandum of Understanding are dues paying members of the Federation, then, in such event, membership dues or a service fee, not to exceed the then current membership dues, shall be paid by all employees covered by the Memorandum of Understanding as a condition of their continued employment, regardless of the date on which the employee was hired. This provision shall remain in effect as long as the Federation annually certifies to the County that the seventy percent (70%) contingency still exists.
Section 3.3 - Election of Membership. An employee required to make an election of membership status must do so within thirty (30) days following receipt of such form from the Federation. Failure to do so shall result in the Federation notifying the County of the breach by the employee of the provisions of this Article 3. The County will then notify the employee within five (5) working days of receipt of the Federation notification that the employee has ten (10) working days in which to make such an election. If the employee still does not make an election in the time provided, or has not made a financial arrangement satisfactory to the Federation, the County shall notify the employee's appointing authority that the employee has breached the terms of continued employment, and the appointing authority shall then begin proceedings subjecting the employee to appropriate disciplinary action, including termination.
Section 3.4 - Dues Checkoff. Upon receipt of a written authorization from an employee, the Administration shall deduct from the wages due said employee each pay period, and remit to the Federation, monthly, at its headquarters, the biweekly dues as fixed by the Federation, or the equivalent service fee and/or deductions for Federation-sponsored insurance programs, provided that the Administration shall cease such deductions upon an employee's termination of employment, transfer to a job outside the bargaining unit, layoff from work, or authorized leave of absence. The Administration shall resume such deductions upon the return of an employee from layoff or authorized leave of absence. The Administration shall cease deductions for Federation dues or service fees upon receipt of a revocation of such authorization from an employee that is executed within thirty (30) days prior to the anniversary date of such authorization.
Section 3.5 - County Indemnification. The County assumes no obligation, financial or otherwise, arising out of the provisions of this Article, and the Federation shall indemnify and hold the County harmless from any and all claims, grievances, arbitration, awards, suits, attachments, or other proceedings arising out of or by reason of any action taken by the County for the purpose of complying with any of the provisions of this Article.
Section 3.6 - Federation Information Days. The County agrees to allow Federation Information Days, to provide information about the Federation and other related benefits, four times a year in each of the following locations: Department of Aging, main detention center and courthouse court facility of the Bureau of Corrections, County Office Building, Glen Arm shop of the Department of Public Works, 9-1-1 Center, and Investment Building. The date, location and times that these days will take place are subject to approval by the Labor Commissioner; such approval shall not be unreasonably denied. The Labor Commissioner may give permission for “Days” to be held at other county facilities, depending upon the agency or bureau involved and the availability of space. It is understood that County operations will not be interfered with, as employees will visit these locations on their own time. The normal time will be from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., except in 24-hour operations.
3

Section 4.5 - Time Limitations. The time limits set forth in this Article and Article 5 are of the essence of this Memorandum of Understanding.

If the aggrieved employee (or the Federation, in the case of a Federation grievance) fails to comply with the time limits set forth in this Article, or if the Federation fails to comply with the time limits specified in Article 5, the grievance shall be deemed to have been waived.

The final name remaining shall be the arbitrator of the grievance.
(c)	Arbitrator's Jurisdiction. The jurisdiction and authority of the arbitrator of the grievance and the arbitrator's opinion and award shall be confined exclusively to the interpretation and/or application of the express provision or provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding or the rules and regulations of a County agency at issue between the Federation and the Administration, as specified in the written grievance filed by the aggrieved employee at Step 2 of the procedure set forth in Article 4 of this Memorandum of Understanding.

Section 6.1 - No Discrimination. In accordance with applicable law, the provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding shall be applied equally to all employees without discrimination as to age, sex, handicap, marital status, race, color, creed, national origin, or political affiliation.
ARTICLE 7 - SENIORITY
Section 7.1 - Definition of Seniority. Seniority shall mean an employee's length of continuous service in the Baltimore County Classified Service, from the date of initial employment, or reemployment following a termination of prior seniority. An employee's seniority shall not accrue during any period of layoff in excess of twelve (12) months.
Section 7.2 - Termination of Seniority. An employee's seniority shall be terminated and the employee's rights under this Memorandum of Understanding forfeited for the following reasons: (a) discharge for just cause, quit, expiration of a leave of absence or resignation; or (b) layoff for a period in excess of twenty-four months.
Section 7,3 - Seniority List. The Administration shall maintain a list showing the seniority of all employees covered by this Memorandum of Understanding, which list will be arranged alphabetically by class title and be maintained by the Office of Human Resources. A copy of the seniority list shall be furnished to the Federation on or about January 1 of each year.
7
Section 7.4	- Layoffs andKecall.
(a)	In the event a reduction in force becomes necessary for reason of economy, the Administration shall lay off, within the job classification and department affected, first: seasonal, temporary and part-time employees; and then: classified employees, in inverse order of seniority, provided that if a layoff is necessitated because the funding of a grant program is reduced or eliminated, those employees employed pursuant to such grant will be laid off within the job classifications and departments affected in inverse order of seniority prior to the layoff of any other employees. A classified employee so laid off shall be entitled to "bump" the junior employee in the same job classification or classification series or to transfer to a vacant position in an equal or lower pay grade, provided the transferring employee meets the minimum qualifications of the job classification to which the employee wishes to transfer and provided that employees employed pursuant to a grant and laid off because of the reduction or elimination of such grant shall be entitled to "bump" in accord with the provisions of this Section 7.4. By order of seniority, a classified employee on layoff shall be recalled to the classification and Department from which the employee was laid off before a new employee is hired for such position.
(b)	Layoff due to Technology. If an employee is to be laid off due to the employee's job being eliminated due to the introduction of new technology to the employee's job, the County will, whenever practicable, make every reasonable effort to train the displaced employee in the new technology or retrain the employee for a comparable full-time merit position in the County.
Section 7.5	- Posting and Filling of Vacancies.
(a)	When a vacancy in the classified service in Pay Schedule I occurs which the Administration intends to fill and for which no eligible list exists, the Administration shall post an announcement of the vacancy on the bulletin boards whereon such announcements are normally posted, for a minimum of ten (10) workdays. Such announcement shall identify the vacancy by the class title, pay grade and pay range and the location of the position, and shall include the minimum qualifications for the position. Such announcements shall also state how and where to file and the closing date for receipt of applications. Any employee may submit an application for a vacant position. In the event two (2) or more employees certified from the eligible list are, in the judgment of the appointing authority, equally qualified, seniority shall determine who is appointed to the vacant position. Employees will be informed of their numerical score on any test for promotion and of their ranking on the eligibility list.
(b)	Shift Changes. When a vacancy occurs, a request for a shift change will be granted based upon the Administration’s evaluation of the ability, competence and dependability of the employee requesting the shift change. If ability, competence and dependability are equal, the most senior employee’s request will be granted.

An employee who is unable to report to work because of illness or injury is required to personally call the employee's supervisor (or the supervisor's designee), or have a member of the immediate family or a designated representative call, within one (1) hour prior to or one-half (1/2) hour after the time the employee was to report for duty, unless the delay is caused by a documented emergency. The employees assigned to positions requiring twenty-four (24) hour coverage in the Communications Center and those employees assigned to positions requiring sixteen (16) to twenty-four (24) hour coverage in the Detention Center are required to personally call a member of supervision, or have a member of the immediate family or a designated representative call, at least one (1) hour prior to the time the employee was to report for duty.

If an employee maintains a satisfactory attendance record for six (6) consecutive months after being placed on Exceptional Absenteeism Notice, such employee will no longer be subject to the requirements of this Section 14.5 until or unless the employee is again placed on Exceptional Absenteeism Notice.
Section 15.6 - Sick Leave Credit. As of January 1 of each year, an employee with one or more years of seniority shall be credited with the sick leave the employee would be entitled to accrue that year. If the employee leaves the service of the County having used more sick leave than the employee actually would have accrued, the value of such excess sick leave shall be reimbursed to the County.
Section 15.7	- Unearned Sick Leave.	'
(a)	Grant of Leave. An employee with one (1) or more years of seniority can request an unearned sick leave extension of 210/240 hours maximum during a single year. This 210/240 hour extension will not be granted until the employee has used all earned and anticipated sick, vacation, personal leave and compensatory time. Under unusual circumstances, if approved by the Administrative Officer and Director of Personnel, an employee can request an advance of unearned sick leave beyond the limits as prescribed by this rule. An employee with less than one (1) year seniority can receive an extension only on an exception basis, subject to the approval of the Director of Personnel. The employee will first use all accrued sick, vacation, personal leave and compensatory time and, in addition, may be granted the employee's anticipated balance before the extension is granted. A probationary employee cannot receive unearned sick leave extensions, but may, under certain circumstances, be granted the employee's anticipated balance while on probation. Sick leave extension is granted for one (1) physician-certified illness or injury only. Any balance of the total amount granted which is unused returns to the County and a subsequent request for unearned sick leave must be processed as a new extension, subject to the 210/240 hour maximum annually.
25
(b)	Reimbursement of Leave. Ail unearned sick leave granted must be "paid back" to the County when the employee returns. An employee cannot use paid sick leave until the negative balance is erased. If necessary, an employee with a negative sick leave balance can request a second unearned leave extension in a subsequent year. Such an extension, up to a maximum total negative balance of 210/240 hours, must also be "paid back" with earned sick leave time. If an employee terminates while still carrying a negative sick leave balance, the unearned leave extension and any anticipated leave used must be paid back to the County either in cash, as a deduction from the final paycheck or from the employee's retirement system account.
Section 15.8	- Overtime Computation. All hours for which an employee receives paid sick leave shall be considered hours worked for the purpose of computing overtime.
Section 15.9 - Family Illness. An employee may use up to 35/40 hours of sick leave for illness in the immediate family. With the approval of the Director of Personnel, additional sick leave may be used for illness in the immediate family. Immediate family is defined for the purpose of this sub-section as the spouse, child, legal dependent, or parent of the employee. The employee is required to submit a statement to the employee’s supervisor stating the relationship of the ill member of the immediate family, the nature of the illness, and the necessity for assisting the ill member of the immediate family.
ARTICLE 16	- LEAVES OF ABSENCE AND OTHER LEAVES
Section 16.1 - Leaves of Absence.
(a)	Request for Leave. The Director of Personnel may approve leaves of absence without pay for periods of up to one (1) year. A request for a leave of absence without pay shall be submitted in writing to the Director of Personnel and state the reason the leave of absence is being requested and the approximate length of time off the employee desires. If approved, authorization for a leave of absence shall be furnished to the employee in writing. An employee does not earn sick leave or vacation leave while on an unpaid leave of absence. An employee who accepts other employment while on a leave of absence shall automatically be terminated unless such other employment has been approved, in writing, by the Director of Personnel. During this leave, employees’may continue participation in their health care and life insurance packages by assuming full premium costs.
(b)	Return from Leave of Absence. An employee who returns from a leave of absence of more than six (6) months or from medical leave of any duration must be examined and certified by the Employee Health Clinic before returning to work. An employee who wishes to return from a leave of absence may be reinstated to the employee's former position if it is vacant, or placed on a certification list for a comparable position whenever a vacancy occurs.
26
Section 16.2 - Bereavement Leave. Four (4) days absence without loss of pay shall be permitted for the death of a parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, brother, sister or spouse. Three (3) days absence without loss of pay shall be permitted for the death of a grandparent, spouse’s grandparent, grandchild, mother-in-law or father-in-law. One (1) day absence without loss of pay shall be permitted for the death of an aunt, uncle, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepbrother, stepsister, son-in-law or daughter-in-law; provided that one (1) day additional leave with pay may be granted, at the discretion of the Agency Head or Bureau Chief, when extensive travel is involved. Bereavement leave days must be used within ten calendar days of the date of death. Pre-scheduled vacation, sick, personal or compensatory leave may be changed to bereavement leave without charge against the employee’s leave balance. Upon request by the Director of Personnel, the employee shall offer valid proof of relationship and date of death.
Section 16.3 - Jury Duty. Employees who are required to perform jury service shall be paid their regular salary. The employees summoned as jurors shall notify their supervisors immediately. Employees who report for jury duty and are dismissed shall report to work for the remainder of the working day. Such time spent on jury service will not be charged against any leave credits. Second-shift employees required to report for jury duty, and who are not dismissed from jury duty, shall not be required to report for work on the day they report for jury duty. Third-shift employees shall not be required to report for work for a shift which ends on the day they are required to report for jury duty.
Section 16.4 - Military Leave. All employees requesting military leave to fulfill reserve obligations in the Armed Forces of the United States or in the National Guard of the State of Maryland shall be granted not in excess of fifteen (15) days annually for such purposes.

An employee scheduled for military training shall notify their supervisor at least thirty (30) days in advance of a regularly scheduled military training date that would conflict with the employee's work schedule. The supervisor will make every effort to accommodate the employee's military training schedule, but it is agreed that any change in schedule will not result in the employee receiving overtime and that the change in schedule will not result in an employee working seven (7) consecutive days. Military leave shall be considered as hours worked for the purpose of computing overtime.
Section 16.5 - Work Related Injury. When an employee suffers a disability resulting from an accident or illness found to be compensable under the State Worker's Compensation Act, said employee shall be allowed leave not to exceed twelve (12) months. If otherwise eligible, said leave shall begin on the next scheduled day following the day of the accident. Unless the employee is physically incapacitated and therefore unable to comply, an employee may receive such Accident Leave only if the employee notifies management of the accidental injury within two workdays of the time for which the employee requests such Accident Leave. Payment, while on leave for this reason, shall be the amount calculated individually which will result in said employee receiving as close as practicable to their normal net pay. Every application form for such leave shall contain a statement by the employee, affirmed by the employee's supervisor, setting forth the details of the accident or illness and supported by the certification of a licensed physician, setting forth the nature and extent of the injury or illness and the probable period of disability. Leave granted under this Section shall be recorded on the employee's leave record card, but shall not be charged to any other type of leave. If incapacitated for the employee's regular assignment, the employee may be given other duties with the County for the period of recuperation. Unwillingness to accept such assignments as directed by the employee's department head or the County Administrative Officer will 27	.
make the employee ineligible for leave under this regulation during the time involved. A physician who regularly examines employees as an official physician for the Baltimore County Employees' Retirement System shall determine the physical ability of the employee to continue working or to return to work.
Section 16.6 - Federation Leave. The Federation will be granted five (5) days off for Federation business, conventions, seminars, etc., per one hundred (100) employees of the Bargaining Unit, per year.

TRAVEL POLICY
1.	Purpose
In order to provide a uniform policy for administration of required and authorized County business travel by employees of all agencies, the following guidelines and procedures shall be adopted by all departments, effective November 29, 1979.
This policy supersedes and replaces all previously existing official or unofficial travel policies presently applied by any County agency.
2.	Administration
Travel procedures will be based on information circulated and updated every fiscal year by the Office of Finance, which shall be charged with the responsibility for voucher verification, per diem averages for selected major cities, average travel timetables, air and train fare estimates, accommodation recommendations and other guideline information necessary to insure proper controls of travel expenses.
The individual agency heads shall be responsible for approving travel requests in their departments, and for insuring that travel reimbursement is neither excessive nor discriminatory in its application. Any supplementary procedures developed by the agencies shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Officer. The agency head shall have the responsibility to determine whether a County vehicle or a privately-owned vehicle shall be used for such travel.
The County Administrative Officer, or the Administrative Officer's designee, shall monitor all travel expenses as reported quarterly by the Office of Finance. ■
3.	Mileage Allowance	■
A mileage allowance at the rate set by the Internal Revenue Service, plus tolls and parking, shall be paid to County employees who use their privately-owned vehicles for official County travel necessary to carry out the required or authorized duties of their positions, without regard to the number of passengers they may have. Any adjustment in the mileage allowance rate shall be effective on the first of July following any adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service.
In the application of this allowance, the employee will be entitled to reimbursement for official travel which is authorized by the agency head or designee, other than that required to and from the employee's regularly assigned office or duty station, for the purpose of mileage allowance calculations.
When an employee is required to travel on official business from home to a location other than the regularly assigned office or duty station, whether on a workday or not, the employee shall be reimbursed for mileage in excess of the distance round-trip between the employee's home and the regularly assigned place of work or duty station. It is the employee's duty to keep accurate and timely records of travel, and to report such mileage as required by the agency for reimbursement.
4.	Temporary Change of Work Location
An employee who is required to report to a different work site will be reimbursed for all extra travel connected with that transfer provided that the transfer is authorized or directed by the employee's supervisor and is temporary (1 two-week pay period or less) in nature. This allowance will only be paid for mileage beyond that normally traveled by the employee to the employee's regularly assigned place of work.
Travel allowance payments for temporary changes of work location beyond the two-week limitation must be specifically approved by the agency head, subject to the review of the Administrative Officer.
EXHIBIT D (continued)
5.	Tolls and Parking
Should authorized County business require an employee to pay tolls or parking charges beyond that usually required by travel to their regular work area, the employee shall be reimbursed for such tolls or parking. Parking costs will not be paid to employees who are required to report to the Towson area offices on a temporary change of work location (see No. 4 above).
6.	Travel to Conferences, Workshops
Travel to approved conferences, meetings, workshops, training sessions and other work-related events shall be considered official County business. The agency head shall have the responsibility to determine whether a privately-owned or County-owned vehicle should be used for such trips. In planning travel, consideration shall be given to routes which minimize both time and cost to and from the destination.
Employees traveling on official County business are expected to exercise care in incurring expenses, and to avoid excessive or unnecessary costs by planning for the minimum amount of travel and the most economical mode of transportation to the destination. In all cases, the agency head, or designee, shall have final approval on advances and/or reimbursements for the agency's employees, consistent with the guidelines issued by the Office of Finance.
If it is determined that the most economical means of travel is by County vehicle, the "General Rules and Regulations for County Vehicles" shall be followed. Requests for overnight or out-of-state use of pool vehicles must be made prior to the first day of travel.
7.	Receipts. Gratuities
Receipts will be required by the Office of Finance for expenses such as lodging, train/bus/airplane tickets, parking, tolls over $1.00, conference/registration fees, limousine fares and cleaning allowances. Actual expenses for items such as mileage, meals, gratuities, baggage handling charges and taxis will be reimbursed according to the schedule published by the Office of Finance.
