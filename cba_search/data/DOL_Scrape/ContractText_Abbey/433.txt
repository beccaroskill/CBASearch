--------	- - c; "Employees should then progress on the new schedule In the same
manner as on the old schedule, carrying with them the time already accrued on that step.
EXAMPLE: An employee with tour (4) months on Step 2 would move to Step 2 on the new schedule and would progress to Step 3 after the completion of two more months.
2,	if an employee is on Short-Term Disability benefits as of one of the wage Increase effective dates, wage changes will be made effective on the date that the employee returns from absence.
3.	An employee hired after one of the wage Increases stated above becomes effective should be placed on the new wage schedule by the appropriate Job title, wage zone and, if applicable, wage credit, effective on their date of hire.	.
4.	In no case should any employee's wages be increased to a rate higher than the top rate of the new appropriate wage schedule.

Section C5.01 TEAM PERFORMANCE AWARD (TPA) - DESCRIPTION (Continued)
L.	Overtime
Overtime payments will be based on an hourly rate which includes both base and TPA payments.
An employee's hourly wage TPA rate for overtime payments will be calculated as follows:	,
The hourly rate will be equal to actual award divided by 2080 hours.
Example of TPA Overtime Payment Using TPA hourly rate:
An employee's TPA Payment equals $1,768. The employee worked 100 hours
of overtime in the award year at a time and one-half rate (100 x 1.5 = 150 hours).

The TPA Overtime Payment (TPAOT) will be included in the pay chock of the fast fuff pay perfect at febtuavy TPA Pay-out.
Section CS.02 TEAM PERFORMANCE AWARD (TPA) - COMPUTATIONS
The TPA will provide annual cash payments, based on an employee's wage schedule, depending on whether the Company meets, exceeds or misses Its financial and service goals. The TPA will be based on Pacific Sell performance. The Company performance measures will be the same as the Company performance measures used for the Pacific Bell Management Team Award.
156
Section C5.02 TEAM PERFORMANCE AWARD (TPA) - COMPUTATIONS (continued)
The TPA payments will be determined as follows: '	’ * ■ ■ - -	- - -
1.	A standard award, based on the top step of an employee's wage schedule, will be given annually If the Company meets Its financial and service goals. The standard award will be 5.0% of annual top step pay for each of the years 2001 - 2004.
2.	The standard awards described In number 1 above will be adjusted based on percent achievement of Company performance measures.
The TPA pay-out will be based on the percent achievement of Company performance measures. Each year. Pacific Bell will set:
•	financial and customer service targets
•	a flnanclal/service weighting
3.	The percent achievement of the Company's financial and service targets will determine the Team Performance Award. The Company pay-out percentages for the Team Performance Award will be the same as the Company pay-out percentages used for the management Team Award of Pacific Sell
4.	An example of a pay-out computation Is shown below:
•	Company performance targets for financial and service performance were set by the Company. The Company also determined that the TPA pay-out would be based 75% on financial performance and 25% on service performance.
•	98% of the financial target was attained, which resulted In 98%. The weighting
of the financial portion is 75%. 98% multiplied by 75% equals a 73.5% result.
•	100% of the service target was attained, which resulted In 100%. The weighting
of the service portion Is 25%. 100% multiplied by 25% equals a 25% result.
•	The financial result of 73.5% plus the service result of 25% equals a TPA pay-out of 98.5%.

Sample Pension Computation
Note:	Refer to your Summary Plan Description for a full description of how a pension Is
computed, Including the supplemental pension, early retirement discount, survivor annuity option, etc.
The basic monthly pension Is computed as your service credit multiplied by the monthly benefit amount (above) for your pension band.
You will find the pension band for your job and wage schedule in the Wage Schedule Tables of the Contract.
For example, If an employee with a wage schedule assigned pension band 114 retired In January, 2003, with thirty (30) years of service, the pension would be 30 x $46.09 = $1,382.70 per month.

Section Cfl WAGE ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE
Section C8.01 GENERAL
A, The following definitions will apply to this practice:
1.	A Change of Assignment is a change from one title classification to a different title classification.
To determine whether an employee's change of assignment is to a lower, equal or higher-rated schedule, compare the top rate of employee's former schedule with the top rate of the schedule to which the employee is being assigned. When comparing top rates. Include any applicable job (not shift) differential, except a relief differential.
2.	Steps - are a specified number of six month Intervals on a schedule. Steps are associated with specific wage rates. We currently have 9 and 11 step schedules,
3.	Elapsed Time - is the time an employee has accumulated or should be credited with on a step.
4.	Total Schedule Time or Wage Experience Credit Is determined by combining the number of months corresponding to the employee's current step, andjhe —	—•—	elapsed tlme on that step7 '"~	"
0.	The	following rules should apply to all	moves between schedules, whether	to lower,
equal or higher rated schedules:
1.	When the change of assignment occurs on the same date on	which a
scheduled Increase Is due, both	Increases shall be effective on that	date but
the scheduled Increase shall be considered as preceding any applicable promotional Increase.
2,	When the change of assignment is to a schedule in a different wage area, the employee shall first be placed on the former schedule In the new wage area with the same total schedule time. Movement to the new schedule will then be according to the rules outlined in Sections C8.02, C8.03, C8.04, C8.05, or C8.06 which follow.
3.	In no case shall the new wage rate exceed the top rate of the schedule to which the employee Is assigned.
4.	In no case shall any employee lose Total Schedule Time or Wage Experience Credit with exception of the limitation STEP FROM MAXIMUM.
180
I
Section C8.02 CHANGES OF ASSIGNMENT TO A HIGHER-RATED SCHEDULE
Compare the rate associated with the employee's step on the lower-rated schedule, including any applicable job differential (except a relief differential), with the rate associated on the new schedule as determined by allowing the employee full Wage Experience Credit in progression or at maximum on the old wage schedule. The employee shall then be placed on the new wage schedule according to the following rules:
A.	If the wage rate on the new schedule is equal to or lower than the rate on the lower-rated schedule, the employee shall be placed on the step of the new schedule having the rate nearest to but not less than the employee's existing rate,
B.	If the rate on the new wage schedule is higher than the rate on the lower- rated schedule, the employee shall be placed on the new schedule allowing full Wage Experience Credit in progression, or at maximum from the old schedule.
C.	The employee shall be placed on the step on the new wage schedule, as determined by the comparisons made In paragraphs A. and B, preceding, but not to exceed the step down from maximum of the new schedule as listed following paragraph D.
D.	To determine the time Interval to the next progression increase on the schedule to which assigned, credit shall be allowed for the employee's elapsed time on the step of the lower-rated schedule, both in progression or at maximum WITH THE EXCEPTION of any movement Involving a limitation on the step from maximum. In such cases, no credit shall be allowed towards the next progression Increase.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
EARLY RETIREMENT BENEFIT
The pension plan will be modified effective October 1, 1995 to provide that from time to time during the life of the contract, the Companies may designate work groups in which they will offer an Early Retirement Benefit (ERB) providing enhanced pension benefits. For purposes of this memorandum of agreement "work group" shall mean a group identified by Vice President, headquarters and job title. ERB is intended to be offered to alleviate or avoid surplus conditions. The Companies will determine, in their discretion, whether and when to offer ERB, but surplus will not be declared in a work group where ERB has not been offered to all work groups with the same title and Vice President entity within the consolidated headquarters defined in Article 2. There will be a thirty (30) calendar day election period. The Companies may place a limit on the number of employees who will be eligible for the ERB benefit separately in each work group. The Companies will send to the Union a listing of the work groups to be offered ERB before the start of the thirty (30) calendar day election period. Employees who elect to accept the offer and who are eligible under the participation limit for their group have to terminate employment at the time that is set for their retirement. They will not be allowed to revoke their election to retire, and their termination at the time set for their retirement will not be subject to arbitration.
171
4+4 Pension Enhancement
ERB is a 4+4 pension enhancement. Employees who meet all eligibility requirements will have four (4) years added to their age and four (4) years added to their service for purposes of computing their enhanced pension as of their retirement date.
The four (4) years of service and four (4) years of age that are added in computing the amount of the enhanced pension under ERB only apply as of the eligibility date and the retirement date and only apply for purposes of:
a.	Determining eligibility for a service pension under ERB;
b.	Computing the amount of the enhanced pension under ERB;
c.	Determining the application of an age related discount;
______d. - Bridging of past service for determining eligibility for a service pension and the pension amount; and
e. Meeting the requirement that an employee have at least eighteen (18) months in a pension band in order to apply all past service to the value of the band.
172
Eligibility
An employee in a designated work group is eligible to receive the ERB enhanced pension if:
1.	The employee is a current employee who has not waived rights to active benefits.
2.	The employee's actual age and service (without any enhancements) as of the final day of the thirty (30) calendar day election period meet the normal service pension requirement or would meet the requirement with the addition of four (4) years to age and four (4) years to service, that is:
Normal Service Pension Requirements Eligibility Requirements with 4 + 4
a.	any	age	with 30 years of service	any	age with 26 years of service
b.	age	50	with	25	years	of	service	age	46	with	21 years of service
c.	age	55	with	20	years	of	service	age	51	with	16 years of service
d.	age	65	with	10	years	of	service	age	61	with	6 years of service
If prior service would be bridged with the addition of four (4) years of service, the bridged total shall be used for determining if the employee would meet normal pension requirements as of the end election period, and for computing the pension amount as of the retirement date, but not for any other purpose. For instance, it will not be used for determining service for the metering process described below.
3.	The employee elects to retire with the ERB pension enhancement and signs and delivers an election form to the appropriate Company during the thirty (30) calendar day election period.
4.	The employee satisfies the requirements of the limitation on the number of eligible employees, if applicable.
173
5.	The employee retires in the month that is determined through the metering process described below or on the fifteenth (15th) calendar day following the end of the election period, if the metering process is not used. Employees who terminate employment before the applicable times will not receive the enhanced pension.
Temporary Supplement to Age 62.
If an employee retires with a service pension under ERB and the employee has not reached his or her sixty-second birthday at retirement, the employee's pension, after the 4+4 enhancement, will be increased by the addition of a 30% supplement. This temporary supplement will be paid each month, with the last payment made for the month in which the retiree's sixty-second birthday occurs.
There will be a separate election for a lump sum cashout. -- - -applicable to this-temporary- supplement : If the employee elects a - cashout” of the single life annuity the temporary supplement will also be cashed out. If the employee elects monthly payments of the service pension annuity, the employee may separately elect a cashout of the temporary supplement only.
Participation Limits
1.	Within any work group the Company may place a limit on the number of employees who will be eligible for the ERB benefit.
2.	Any such limit on a work group will be set before the thirty-day election period begins, and the Company will inform the Union of work groups with participation limits.
3.	If the number of employees submitting election forms exceeds the limit for the work group, eligibility will be determined by seniority, i.e., only the senior employees up to the limit will be eligible. This eligibility determination is made as of the end of the election period, and will not be changed.
174
Metering Process
In each second level work unit, or the next level higher work unit if there is no second level work unit, the Companies may use the following process to determine when employees within a work unit must retire in order to receive the ERB pension enhancement.
1.	Before the thirty (30) calendar day election period begins, the Companies will designate the work units using this metering and will inform the Union.
2.	The metering process will result in selection of a specific retirement month, within one (1) year from the end of the thirty (30) calendar day election period, for each prospectively eligible employee in the work unit who elected ERB. Only calendar months will be designated as retirement months. The month in which the election period ends may be a designated retirement month.
3.	There are two steps to the metering process:
a.	Within ten (10) calendar days following the end of the election period, for each work unit using the metering process, the Companies will distribute a metering list designating the specific calendar month or months in which employees in that work unit may retire with ERB, and the number of such employees that may retire in each such designated month.
b.	If more than one month is designated, each prospectively eligible employee will identify his or her preference order for all available months on the metering list in which he or she is allowed to retire. Employees shall have five (5) calendar days from receipt of the metering list in which to identify their retirement month preference order. The preference lists will then be matched, by seniority, with the metering list, so that each employee receives his or her most preferred retirement month remaining on the metering list, after the preferences of the more senior employees (as expressed on their preference lists) have been given effect. If two employees have identical
175
seniority, the one whose last four social security number digits comprise the larger number will be treated as if he or she were more senior. An employee who does not identify his or her preferences within the above timeframe, or who submits an incomplete preference list and whose preferences have all been taken, will be scheduled to retire in the earliest remaining available month on the'metering list.
4.	Once the retirement schedule is set, it will not be changed.
5.	If an employee terminates employment before the month he or she elected through this metering process, the employee will not receive the ERB pension enhancement. Employees who do not select a particular date during the month they elected through the metering process for __________ retirement._will_be .terminated-as of-the last day of - —------— that month.
6.	If a work unit does not use the metering process, all the employees in that work unit who elect ERB and meet the other ERB eligibility requirements must retire on . the fifteenth (15th) calendar day following the end of the election period in order to receive the enhanced pension.
7.	Employees receiving short term disability benefits and employees on a leave of absence as of the thirtieth (30th) day of the thirty-day election period will not be included in the metering process, and must retire on the fifteenth (15th) day following the end of the thirty-day election period, or earlier if their short term disability benefits end earlier.
Other Provisions Applicable to ERB	„
1.	The pension plan will be amended for each ERB offer. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Companies shall have the right to amend the pension plan as appropriate to implement ERB.
176
2.	' ' The-ERB service enhancement. ! s nota permanent change to the employee's term of employment or net credited " service and will not be used for any purpose other than determination of the ERB benefit, e.g., it will not be used to determine vacation or seniority, including seniority regarding the ERB metering process.
3.	The enhanced pension benefit is available only to those employees who meet all eligibility requirements and are designated eligible by an amendment to the pension plan, and only during those periods and under those conditions designated. The pension enhancement will not be applied to any employee who terminates employment before the time set for the employee's retirement.
4.	If an employee who was previously granted an enhanced pension under Early Retirement Choice (ERC) or Early Retirement Incentive (ERI) is in a work group where the ERB benefit is offered, the employee's eligibility for the ERB benefit and the amount of benefit are determined without regard to any enhancements provided under ERC or ERI.
5.	For employees with part-time service during their term of employment, the four (4) years of enhanced service will be prorated in computing the amount of the pension benefit. No proration will apply for the purpose of determining eligibility for a service pension under ERB.
6,	Employees receiving short term disability benefits or employees on leave of absence from a work group that has offered the enhanced pension will be eligible for the benefit if they otherwise meet the eligibility requirements.
7.	Employees temporarily promoted out of the work group or transferred out as of the ERB designated election period will not be covered by the pension enhancement.
8.	If an employee who has accepted an offer of ERI Phase II enhanced pension benefits is still an employee after the effective date of this Memorandum of Agreement, the employee will retire under the provisions of the ERI
177

-	Limited to thirty (30) calls per month for TOPS and fifty (50) for Directory Assistance. Monitoring of an employee will take place on no more than three days per month and will be limited to one monitoring session each day.
Mew employees for three (3) months following initial training may have double that number taken.
-	Coverage of an employee should take place as soon as as possible, but must take place within the same day.
-	No make-up observations will be taken.
185
-2-
o Diagnostic monitoring will be done on a parallel basis at the employee's position to identify individual training needs and provide follow-up to ensure training has been effective.
o Parallel monitoring for the purpose of verifying the effectiveness of new practices and customer response, etc. will be taken with operator's who agree.
o No employee will be dismissed solely as a result of monitoring unless secrecy of communications, fraud, loss of revenue or gross customer abuse is Involved.

RELOCATION
This Memorandum of Agreement will confirm our understanding of August 6, 1995, with respect to reasonable moving costs as provided for in Section 2.OBA of the Contract between Pacific Bell/Nevada Bell and the Communications Workers of America. This memorandum cancels and supercedes our letter on the same subject dated June 20, 1990.
Relocation expense reimbursement will be paid to employees who accept a Company-initiated transfer to a non-commutable work location. Company-initiated transfers are those transfers and reassignments made under the provisions of Section 2.05 or Section 2.06 of the Contract. A work location shall be considered to be non-commutable as described in Section 2.OBE of the Contract.
An employee who accepts a Company-initiated transfer to a non-commutable work location will be eligible for moving expense reimbursement if the employee has moved his/her residence to a commutable location ( as described in Article 2, Section 2.OBE of the Contract ) or if, in the determination of the Companies, the employee has moved his/her residence appreciably closer to the new work location.
1.	Relocation expense reimbursement will be paid according to the attached schedule, up to a maximum of $ 12,000.00. or
2.	A commute allowance of $200 per month will be paid for up to three (3) years. Employees who elect the commute allowance in lieu of relocation ( CILOR ) may, within one (1) year from the date of transfer, elect to move their residence. In such cases, relocation expenses will be reimbursed in accordance with the attached schedule, up to a maximum of $ 9,600. In no event will the combination of commute allowance and moving expenses exceed $ 12,000.
193
This Memorandum of Agreement will also confirm our understanding of November 27, 1985, regarding the application of relocation benefits. This Memorandum of Agreement supersedes our letter dated December 18, 1986; however, this Memorandum does not change the intent of that letter, which reads as follows:
’ In the event an employee who is commuting to work, on his/her own volition, a distance exceeding that which is normally considered commutable and is subject to a Company-initiated move to a location which is also non-commutable but results in a commute that is less than the employee's previous commute, the employee will not be entitled to relocation benefits including CILOR.
However, if an employee, under similar circumstances, is subject to a Company-initiated move which results in.a commute greater than that which the employee previously experienced, the employee will be entitled to relocation benefits should the employee decide to move his/her residence within one year of the effective date of the Company-initiated move, or CILOR.
