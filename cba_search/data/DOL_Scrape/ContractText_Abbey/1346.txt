Any employer signatory hereto who contributes on less than one hundred (100) hours for a calendar month, agrees to contribute the sum of $10.00 per month to the Promotion Fund, and $5.00 per month to the Apprenticeship Trust Fund, for each month in which the signatory employer is liable for a contribution report.
The employer shall deduct from the wages of each employee, who has signed a check off authorization conforming to Federal law, and transmit monthly to the Trust Fund, the sum agreed for each hour worked under the collective bargaining Agreement of Local #4. The sums transmitted to Local #4 shall be accompanied by a statement, reporting the name of each person whose local working dues are being paid and the number of hours each employee has been paid. .
The union shall furnish the Authorization Forms to the Employers Representative to be executed. This authorization shall be irrevocable for the period of one (I) year following the date it was signed or until the current applicable collective bargaining Agreement expires, whichever occurs from year to year, unless not more than ninety (90) days, nor less than sixty (60) days prior to the termination of the annual renewal date the member revokes this authorization by written notice to the Union and to the individual Employer by whom the member is employed.
The employer shall deduct from the wages of each employee an amount equal to one percent of the hourly wage + Fringe package, for each hour of employment under such a collective bargaining agreement during the previous month hereafter call "IU working dues", the IU dues shall be automatically adjusted each year according to the percentage increase in journeyman wage + Fringes.
Section 9.	The Trustees of the Trust Funds shall provide forms to the employer so that the employer may furnish written reports monthly, or at such other periods as designated by the respective Trustees, which reports shall set forth the names, social security numbers and hours worked by workers covered by this Agreement, or if no such workers have worked during the month involved, a statement on such form to such effect. The Trustees of the respective Trust Funds shall be entitled to, and may file legal action for, the collection of any and all contributions and liquidated damages due and owing by the employer and, in the event such action is maintained and filed in addition to recovering of payments due and legal rate of interest, the employer agrees to pay all costs of such suit or suits, together with reasonable Attorney's Fees.
19
Section 10.	Each contribution report and payment to the respective Trust Funds shall be made promptly at the designated depository and shall be postmarked on or before the 25th day of the calendar month in which it becomes payable and, if not paid in full by the 25th day of the month at the depository designated by the appropriate Trust Funds by the 25th of the calendar month in which it becomes payable, shall be delinquent and subject to liquidated damages. If Any employer fails to make the monthly report and contributions in full on or before the LAST day of the month on four (4) occasions within any twelve-month period, or for two consecutive months, the Delinquency Committee may provide by resolution that thereafter immediately following such resolution the employer shall be required to increase his cash bond to $6,000.00. Said resolution shall be subject to approval by the Trust Funds. The MCESC and Union recognize and acknowledge that the regular and prompt payment of employer contributions to the Trust Funds is essential to the maintenance of the Trusts, and that it would be extremely difficult and impractical, if not impossible, to fix the actual expense and damage to the Trusts which would result from failure of an individual employer to pay such monthly contribution in full within the time above provided. Therefore, the amount of damage to the Trust Funds resulting from any such failure to pay is hereby agreed to the sum of $20.00 per delinquency or ten percent (10%) of the amount of the contribution or contributions due, whichever is greater, which amount shall become due and payable to the Trust Funds pro rata by the delinquent employer as liquidated damages and not as a penalty at the place where the contribution is payable upon the day immediately following the date on which the contribution or contributions becomes delinquent and shall be in addition to said contribution or contributions; provided, however, the Delinquency Committee may waive payment of any said liquidated damages in particular case upon good cause satisfactory to the Committee, subject to approval of the Trust Funds.
Section 11.	Any employer signatory to this Agreement who does not employ workers during the month involved and fails to file a report with the Trustees as required by Article X, Section 9 hereof may at the discretion of the said Committee, subject to approval of the Trust Funds, be assessed the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) as liquidated damages for each such failure to report.
Section 12.	The Board of Trustees of each Trust shall maintain suitable and adequate records of and for the administration of their respective Funds. The Delinquency Committee on behalf of each Trust may require the employers, and signatory association, individual employer, member, Union or employee to submit to the Committee data, reports or documents reasonably relevant to and suitable for the purposes of such administration; provided, however, that the Union shall not be required to submit lists of
20
membership. The parties agree that they will comply with any such reasonable request by the Committee. Upon request, each employer shall permit an accountant selected by the Committee to enter upon the premises of such employer or member during normal business hours, at a reasonable time or times, and to examine the payroll and cash disbursement records to determine whether the employer or member is making full and prompt payment of all sums required to be paid by the employer or member to the Funds. The payroll records will include the applicable individual employee's records, time cards, all supporting payroll disbursement records, all quarterly and annual federal and state payroll tax returns and copies of information submitted to the employees at the end of the calendar year, such as I.R.S. forms W-2, 1099 and 599. Related records will include those necessary to substantiate payments made to employees other than the ones designated as payroll.
It is the essence of this provision that the contractor provide only information to the auditor to support payments made to employees performing work covered by this Agreement. It is not the intent of this provision for the contractor to provide any other financial or recorded information. All Parties agree that the accountant and his staff fully respect the confidential nature of the financial records and activities of the employer or member, and shall not request or require the independent accountant to divulge any information of the employer or member for any purpose beyond the scope and purpose of the examination. If it is determined, as a result of such examination, that the employer or member has defaulted in making any payments to the Funds, as required by this Agreement, then said employer or member, in addition to immediately paying into the Funds all amounts owing, shall immediately pay all reasonable costs incurred for such examination.
Section 13.	Each of the Trusts Funds shall automatically provide an unconditional release to any member contractor covered under Member Contractor Blanket Cash Bond. In addition, each of the Trust Funds shall monthly provide unconditional releases to nonmember contractors if there are no specific known deficiencies in his account.
Article XI .
