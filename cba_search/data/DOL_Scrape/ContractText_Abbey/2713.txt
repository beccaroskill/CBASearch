This salary schedule and salary policy are based upon the consideration and combined opinion of the Board and the Superintendent that the teacher is performing his or her duties at minimal, an average performance level. The Board reserves the right to withhold salary increases for cause shown. Cause may be interpreted as being within the limits of the conditions outlined in the School Code of Illinois, Chapters 105 ILCS 5/10-22.4 and 105 ILCS 5/24-1, 5 and 11 which also include the legal basis for such action.
11.3	Prior Experience Credit

Such credit will not be available for substitute teaching, part-time or partial year teaching service, teaching service provided without a valid state teaching certificate, teacher assistant experience, or other unrelated work experience.
Credit for prior military service shall be provided for up to two (2) years of such service, provided the teacher had some teaching experience prior to such military service.
11.4	Salary Schedule Placement Upon Initial Hire
Upon initial employment, a teacher shall be placed on the relevant salary schedule based upon recognized experience credit (pursuant to Section 11.3) and degree/graduate semester hours earned after the Bachelor’s degree.

Effective July 1, 2002, when employing school psychologists and speech therapists, the Board shall pay the market rate required to fill such positions. Once hired and placed on the relevant salary schedule (Appendix A), individuals shall thereafter progress on the salary schedule in the same manner as other members of the bargaining unit under the provisions of this Agreement.
In the event people new to the district in these positions are hired at a salary higher than that paid to existing school psychologists and speech therapists, the salaries of such existing employees shall be equalized to that pay to the new hires. Any such adjustment shall occur during the 2002-2003 school year, only.

The Committee shall have the authority to review all District financial and personnel records that pertain to the District's insurance program.
The Board shall review the recommendation by April 1 of each year. If the Board fails to adopt any of the Committee's recommendations, it shall inform the Committee in writing of their decision and the reasons, therefore, within thirty (30) days of their decision. There must be an acknowledgment that changes in the insurance program are a working condition and subject to bargaining.
The Committee shall be composed of eleven (11) members. Two (2) to be appointed by the Superintendent; six (6) by the APT; and three (3) from the PASS Association. Each appointment shall be for a four (4) year term. However, the initial appointments shall draw for one (1), two (2), three (3), four (4), or five (5) year terms so that two (2) Committee member terms shall expire each year. Annually, the Committee shall appoint a chairperson and vice chairperson. A quorum of seven (7) must be present in order to make final decisions. Final recommendations will be made by consensus.
ARTICLE XIV:	WORKING CONDITIONS
14.1	Class Load
a.	More than two (2) preparations shall seldom be required of teachers at the 9-12 level. Should this occur, their agreement shall be sought, and actual student load may be adjusted to compensate for the additional preparation expectations.
b.	Excluding a self-contained classroom organization, more than four (4) preparations shall seldom be required of teachers at the 6-8 level. Should this occur, their agreement shall be sought, and the actual student load may be adjusted to compensate for the additional preparation expectations.
33
14.2	Class Size
The parties acknowledge that while the Board may exercise its authority to set the size of classes, there exists a definite relationship between the size of a class and the needs of the students in it Current efforts to limit class size at the elementary level and student load at the junior high and secondary levels will be continued, realizing that limitations in financing and facilities must be to a degree a governing factor.
14.3	Duty-Free Lunch
Duty-free lunch/recess periods shall be provided for all teachers and for teachers of self-contained classrooms at the same time as the children in their own homeroom. In no case shall the duty-free lunch time be less than thirty (30) minutes.
Committee meetings over the lunch hour will be discouraged to protect the integrity of that duty-free time. There may be emergency circumstances in which a particular department or committee chooses to meet over the lunch hour, but it is the strong recommendation that such meetings occur after school or at other times as determined by committee members. Toward that end, the contract now contains language which would permit professional growth credit to be earned for inservice which is held after the contractual day.
14.4	Released Time
a.	Released time for participation in institutes, meetings, and workshops sponsored by organizations outside the local school structure can be made available on a special request basis. The requests are to be submitted in writing to an appropriate administrator for evaluation and written approval or disapproval.

b.	Released time may also be granted for local curriculum study pending the availability of money/substitutes.
c.	Released time should be provided for conferences.
d.	The District shall provide one-half (1/2) day of the mid-year institute day for all teachers for the completion of instructional responsibilities related to the end of the first semester.
34
14.5	Preparation Time
a.	The Association and the Board recognize the need for having a number of professional meetings for the purpose of discussing issues of curricular and general education concern. Building administrators shall be expected to schedule the regular faculty meetings at the beginning of the school year and to make every effort to notify teachers of any special meetings at least one (1) week in advance. Similarly, meetings shall be scheduled in such a manner as to reserve as much time as possible during the school day for teacher preparation.
b.	Acknowledging the importance of allocated time on student learning and the related demands for preparation at the elementary level, the Board will strive to maintain a proper perspective between these two issues when scheduling student learning time and teacher preparation time. Effective January 19, 1999, Elementary teachers grades 1-5 will be provided with a total of 50 minutes of daily planning time. This plan time will be derived from the addition of a 35 minute-per-week special and an additional 20 minutes from non-instructional student contact time during the then regular student attendance day (i.e. student lunch time, student recess, etc.).
14.6	Calendar Committee
A committee of teachers shall be chosen from the membership of the Association by its President to serve on a Calendar Committee. Those teachers selected shall include a representative from each building. The purpose of this committee is to provide input to the Superintendent for this school calendar. The deadline for a recommendation from this committee shall be by November 30th of each year. The calendar shall be posted in all buildings following its adoption by the Board.

14.11	Bomb Threat
In those instances where conditions exist which may jeopardize the well being of those housed in a school, the established district procedure shall be implemented. The procedure will not include a search by teachers for a bomb; however, staff will be asked to complete a visual inspection of their present duty station and report all foreign or unusual objects or situations to the appropriate supervisor.
14.12	Internal Substitutes
Employees may be required to work as internal substitutes. The principal shall make these assignments only when the services of outside substitutes cannot be retained.

At the start of the 2002-2003 school year, the Board will implement an alternative education program for high school students who have traditionally not experienced success in the regular education program. The future needs of such students and the future implementation of this program were unknown at the time of initial implementation. However, the Board and APT anticipate that the nature of the program may require that teachers in the program will work with students in ways different than the general high school populations. As a result, the implementation of the program in the future may require the waiving of certain provisions of this agreement relative to terms and conditions of teacher employment.
In the event the administration or teachers in the program seek to initiate educational arrangements for the alternative program which would require waivers of specific provisions of this agreement, any such waiver must be in writing and must specify the provision waived, the nature and duration of the waiver, and the employees affected by the waiver. The proposed waiver must be approved by at least 75% of the teachers affected by the waiver. Thereafter, approval of the waiver must be granted by both the Board of Education and the APT. The waiver, if approved, shall be considered a temporary memorandum of understanding and appended to this agreement.

This committee shall consist of eight (8) members: four (4) appointed by the APT, three (3) administrators, and one (1) central office administrator. Committee members shall be eligible for professional growth credit pursuant to Category 2 of Section 11.7 of this Agreement.
At a minimum, the program to be developed shall require, with no additional compensation, additional workdays for probationary teachers as follows:
First probationary year	=	three (3) additional workdays
Second probationary year	=	two (2) additional workdays
Third probationary year	=	one (1) additional workday
In addition to accommodating such additional workdays requirements, the program must also incorporate, with no additional compensation, in-service hours required for probationary teachers during each probationary year as follows:
First probationary year	=	fifteen (15) additional in-service hours
Second probationary year = ten (10) additional in-service hours Third probationary year	=	five (5) additional in-service hours
In evaluating or modifying such a program, the committee should also take into consideration the following issues:
a.	The provision of visitation days to allow probationary teachers to observe staff members identified by the administration as appropriate teaching role models.
b.	Distinguishing requirements between newly-hired probationary teachers who have prior experience or have achieved tenure through previous school district employment, versus newly-hired probationary teachers who have no previous teaching experience or no obtainment of tenure through previous employment.
c.	The scheduling of such additional days and hours as either within or outside of the regular workday or work year, or a combination of days and hours both within and beyond the regular workday and work year.

APPENDIX E
INTRODUCTION TQ MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING
1)	The attached memoranda are for informational purposes only. They are clearly not part of the Agreement between the parties but merely serve to provide a common understanding of part of the history of the collective bargaining process between the parties.
2)	The attached memoranda of understanding were accomplished during past periods of negotiations which led to negotiated Agreements, with the understanding that the memoranda would not be in the Agreement. However, the parties agreed to include the memoranda following the last official page of the Agreement only as a convenience to the Association and the Board, with the original intent remaining permanent and that these memoranda are not a part of the negotiated Agreement and as such, the substance of these memoranda are not subject to the contractual grievance process.
3)	It is not the intent, nor is it the representation of the parties, that the attached memoranda represent each and all of the memoranda of understanding reached during the history of the relationship between the parties.
MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING
1)	The Board of Education reaffirms the commitment to elementary art, music and physical education, reading specialist, and media specialist and pledges that no changes in current levels will be made unless extraordinary circumstances arise, which would warrant renegotiation with the Association pursuant to a change in working conditions. An example of extraordinary circumstances would be in the district being placed on the state certified watch list.
2)	Effective at the start of the second semester of the 1998-99 school year the Board shall implement a new special class at the elementary level. This class shall initially focus on health and wellness education.
3)	Effective November 29, 1999, The Board and APT recognize that master’s degrees in the areas of social work, counseling, and speech therapy often require 15, 30, or 45 hours of course and practicum work beyond the usual 30 to 36 hours required for a master’s degree in other fields. Retroactive to the start of the 1999-2002 collective bargaining agreement, speech therapists, counselors and social workers, who have earned or earn master’s degrees fitting the above description will be placed at either the MA + 15, the MA + 30, or the MA + 45 lanes of the salary schedule as appropriate to the hours taken in connection with the counselors’, social workers’, or speech therapists’ master’s degree program.
4)	During negotiations for the new APT Negotiated Agreement, the Board and APT representatives worked to establish more consistently and regularly scheduled planning, preparation and student assessment time for teachers in the District’s Early Childhood (“E.C.”) Program. The parties reached the following agreement:
a.	2002-2003 School Year.
E.C. teachers will be able to use part of the scheduled staff development days for planning, preparation and student assessment activities. The days scheduled for these activities and staff development are reflected on the District calendar on November 27, 2002, January 17, 2003, February 29, 2003, and May 16, 2003. The E.C. Program Administrator, after soliciting teacher input, will determine the schedule for planning, preparation and student assessment activities on each noted day.
Additionally, E.C. teachers will receive additional time for planning, preparation and student assessment through the use of substitute teachers, who will relieve E.C. teachers of their regular duties for these activities. Substitutes will provide E.C. teachers such relief for % day in each of the following months: September, 2002; October, 2002; December, 2002; March, 2003; and April, 2003. The scheduling of substitutes on these dates will be the responsibility of the E.C. Program Administrator.
Finally, during the 2002-2003 school year, the schedule noted below will be implemented in order to provide additional time for E.C. teacher planning, preparation and student assessment:
8:15 AM-8:30 AM	Teacher A Teacher B	Planning Time Planninq Time
8:30 AM-9:30 AM	Teacher A Teacher B	Combined Class Planninq Time
9:30 AM-10:30 AM	Teacher A Teacher B	Planning Time Combined Class
10:30 AM-11:00 AM	Teacher A Teacher B	Planning Time Planninq Time
11:00 AM - 12:00 PM	Teacher A Teacher B	Planning Time Planninq Time
12:00 PM-12:30 PM	Teacher A Teacher B	Lunch Lunch
The above schedule will be implemented one day each week (repeated in the afternoon), except for those days were teachers are required to attend meetings mandated by law.
b.	2003-2004 School Year
Effective at the start of the 2003-2004 school year, the E.C. program for students will be scheduled 4.5 days per week, with scheduled student contact sessions of 2.75 hours each. The remaining % day each week will be used for teacher planning, preparation and student assessment activities. Scheduling of such teacher activities will be determined by the E.C. Program Administrator, after soliciting teacher input.
All other activities listed in paragraph 1, above, for purposes of providing planning, preparation and student assessment time will be suspended due to the implementation of the program scheduled explained herein.
5. During the negotiations which lead to the 2002-2006 Agreement for Negotiations between the Board of Education and the Association of Plainfield Teachers, the parties agreed to amend Section 13.1 (Health, Major Medical, Hospitalization and Dental) to include a new subparagraph G. This subparagraph provides:
“Teachers wishing to drop insurance coverage may do so at any time by providing written notice to the benefit coordinator”.
By this Memorandum of Agreement, the Board and APT evidence their mutual intent that such language is applicable to employee health insurance only.
