SIDELETTERS AND ATTACHMENTS
SIDELETTER 1 - Nepotism Policy - Communications Centers
Nepotism is defined in the Unit 7 contract as the practice of an employee using his/her personal influence or power to aid or hinder another in the employment setting or situation because of a personal relationship. Employment settings or situations referenced above are either:
1.	Working in a small unit or close quarters in association with one another; or
2.	Working for the same supervisor; or
3.	Having a direct or indirect supervisor/subordinate rela tionship.
Given the uniqueness and close working proximity of individuals assigned to Communications Centers (CCs) and Area Commands with a dispatching operation, the Department is establishing policy to prevent situations wilhin the centers that could adversely affect employee production, safety and/or morale. The intent is also to ensure fair and impartial supervision and evaluation of employees. The prohibition shall apply to new hires, promotions, reinstatements and transfers, or when relationships between employees in the same CC change.
For the purpose of this policy, it is presumed the employment of immediate family relationships in the CCs is detrimental to the supervision, production, safety and/or morale in the working environment and may influence another person in any matter relative to the personal relationship. Therefore, individuals who have an immediate relationship shall not be employed in positions within the SC or command when a managerial or supervisory relationship exists or when, by promotion or marriage, the individual will be placed in the direct line of supervision. Immediate family relationships are defined as those relationships through either blood, marriage or adoption. The affected employees are responsible for informing manage ment of the presence of any family relationship that is inconsistent with this policy.
All assignments including new hires, promotions and transfers, not in conformance with this policy, shall be corrected within six months after they are identified or after a request for exception is denied. To prevent a family relationship,; is described, from existing in CCs or Area Commands, the parties in the relationship it ust decide which of them will transfer to another location for which their seniority would allow them to reasonably transfer within the first transfer cycle following the existen ce of their family relationship which conflicts with policy. During the interim period, until the required transfers are consummated, there shall be no direct line of supervision. To avoid a direct/indirect reporting relationship during the interim period, management reserves the right to reassign either individual to avoid supervision by family members. The right to reassign shall extend to a Public Safety Dispatcher-in-Charge reporting relationship.
SIDELETTER 2 - Classification Issues
The State and CAUSE mutually agree to address classification issues whenever existing classifications do not adequately describe or recognize assigned duties and responsibilities.

Pursuant to Article 7 , Provision 7.1, paragraph 2, line 2 - The “...CHP shall maintain current practice and meet and confer over the impact of any change in practices.” at the command level.
Public Safety Dispatchers who are working an AWW Plan shall be required to maintain a thirty (30) hour plus excess time balance. For purposes of this agreement, plus excess time is defined as time earned when a Public Safety Dispatcher’s number of regularly scheduled workdays exceed the number of hours required in a pay period. Plus excess hours accrue when the Public Safety Dispatcher exceeds the hours in a pay period and are used when the Public Safety Dispatcher is short the number of hours required for the pay period. Except for those Public Safety Dispatchers who have less than thirty (30) hours of plus excess time at the time an AWW Plan is implemented in the center or for those who are new hires or transfers, overtime and vacal ion time will not accrue as excess time. When a Public Safety Dispatcher has no plus excess time to draw from in order to complete the required hours for the pay period, vacation, compensating time off, holiday credits or dock may be used. Excess time shall nut be used in lieu of vacation credits.
In the event CAUSE requests to implement an AWW in s CC, it is understood that all Public Safety Dispatchers in that command shall participate in the plan.

Permanent full-time Public Safety Dispatchers assigned to a forty (40) hour workweek are required to work a minimum of forty (40) hours in a work week inclusive of the holiday to qualify for this benefit. Public Safety Dispatchers who work a Saturday Holiday receive a time and half cash out for working the holiday. Public Safety Dispatchers who work on a holiday that falls on a Sunday which is celebraled on the following Monday, receive holiday compensation if they work on Monday.
If a permanent full-time employee works less than eight (1:1) hours on a holiday, he/she is only entitled to the time and one-half (1 14) cash compensation for the number of hours actually worked on the holiday. A part-time employee who works a holiday must work forty (40) hours inclusive of the holiday in the workweek to receive the additional time and half payment.
For the purpose of computing the number of hours worked for overtime payment, time during which an employee is excused from work because of holidays, vacation, compensating time off (CTO), or other paid leave with the exception of sick leave, shall be considered time worked for overtime computation. Time during Contract which an employee is excused from work because of sick leave shall not be counted as hours worked within the workweek for purposes of determining if overtime has been earned.
An employee's shift start time determines the entitlement to holiday compensation and not the number of hours worked on the holiday.
RDOs for the pay period are scheduled based on the number of Saturdays and Sundays within the pay period. Holidays are not counted toward total RDOs for the pay period.

Any participant failing to meet the resting heart rate and r esting blood pressure standards set forth below shall be required to obtain a me dical doctor’s release on his or her own time and expense before proceeding with the physical fitness test.
The Resting Heart Rate (RHR) shall be measured after the employee has been sitting fora minimum of five (5) minutes in a relaxed, comfortabh:! atmosphere by monitoring the heart beat with a stethoscope or taking the pulse from the carotid or radial artery. The heart beat or pulse shall be taken for thirty (30) seconds and multiplied by two (2). RHR must be 90 beats per minute (BPM) or less. If the RHR cannot be established at or below 90 BPM, wait ten (10) minutes and repeat. If the RHR is still at an unacceptable level complete the pretest screening, however the participant will be required to obtain a medical doctor’s release as stated above before proceeding with Phase II.
Resting Heart Rate
A resting blood pressure will be obtained after the employ ee has been sitting in a relaxed position for at least five (5) minutes. The resting blood pressure must not exceed 140/90. If it does, wait ten (10) minutes and repeat. If blood pressure is still at an unacceptable level complete the prescreening test, however, the participant will be required to obtain a medical doctor’s release as stated above before proceeding with Phase II.

PHASE II TEST DESCRIPTIONS
THREE-MINUTE TEST-RECOVERY. This test will be performed using a bench 12 inches high and will be administered using a 96 beat per minute protocol with 24 complete cycles in three (3) minutes. Prior to the commencement of the test, the participant’s resting pulse rate will be taken while seated. At the command, the participant will step up and down from the bench keeping cadence with the metronome. Immediately after the three minutes of stepping, the participant sits down. A 60-second heart rate starting five seconds after the stepping is couni ed. If the subject’s pulse has not dropped sufficiently, further examination may be nece ssary prior to allowing that person to continue with the testing events.
ILLINOIS AGILITY RUN. An agility run test reflects the ab ility to change directions and speed quickly. Several basic movements have been combined in one test in the figureeight Illinois Agility Run.
The participant starts in a flat prone position with hands on the starting line and then reacts to the starting signal. The course consists of the following:
Sprint 30 feet, stride stop and place at least one foot over the boundary line, turn and sprint back 30 feet.
Left turn around chair on starting line and zig-zag in a figure-eight fashion around the chairs up and back.
Sprint 30 feet up and back as described in step 1) above except finish with a dash over the starting line.
The total time to negotiate the course is recorded to the nearest 0.1 second. Gym shoes must be worn for the test and a warm-up is required. Practicing the course by a slow jog is recommended as a warm-up procedure. The best of tw o time trials is used as the agility score with at least five minutes of rest allowed between the trials.
In the event a participant has an injury or physical disability which would be exacerbated by rising quickly from a prone position, or during testing in inclement weather, the starting position for the Illinois Agility Test will be a standing position with the back faced to the starting line.
SIT-UPS. Lie flat on back with knees bent, heels close to buttocks (approximately 10 inches) and arms folded across chest and feet held to floor by partner. Curl up touching elbows to thighs. Lie back touching shoulders to floor. Re peat as many times as possible in one minute.
FLEXIBILITY SIT AND REACH. After removing his/her sl ices, the participant sits on the floor or mat with the legs extended forward, feet no more than eight inches apart, knees locked, the backs of the legs touching the floor, and leans forward at the waist as far as possible. The hands are superimposed over each other and extended forward while leaning forward and the distance of the stretch is measured. If the participant is flexible enough to reach his/her toes, a score of 15 is recorded. Il: the participant is not flexible enough to reach the toes, a score of below 15 is recorded. A ruler is used to measure the distance above or below the 15 mark. The participant must reach and hold the position with both hands on the mark to have the effort measured and recorded. The best of two attempts will be used as the sit and reach score.

VERTICAL JUMP TEST. A yardstick, measuring tape, smoo th wall or a specially made vertical jump board are required for the test. Chalk dust is placed on the fingers of one hand as a means for marking the jump. The officer stands with on^ side toward the measuring device and reaches upward as high as possible. This is receded as the “reach” distance. The performer then jumps as high as possible and touches the measuring device at the height of the jump. The test is scored as the number of inches, measured to the nearest half-inch, between the “reach” and jump marks. The best of wo jumps will be used as the vertical jump test score.

ATTACHMENT E - Commercial Drivers License Dru<:| and Alcohol Testing Agreement
Federal Regulations 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CF R) Parts 382, et al. and 49 CFR Part 40 require the State of California (State) to test its commercial drivers for controlled substances and alcohol. As specified below, this requirement covers certain employees in Bargaining Unit 7. Having met and conferred, the State and the California Union of Safety Employees (CAUSE), agree to the follow! ng regarding the impact of this testing on employees in Unit 7.
I.	AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE
A.	The State will conduct drug and alcohol testing of commercial drivers in Bargaining Unit 7, as specified in Federal Regulat ons 49 CFR Parts 382, et al. and 49 CFR Part 40. This is in addition to and sep arate from other State drug and alcohol testing provisions (Department of Personnel Administration [DPA] Rules 599.960-599.966 and State Personnel Board Rules 213 - 213.6).
B.	The State will apply this Agreement to all employees in Bargaining Unit 7, other than those in the Department of Transportation, who meet the criteria for testing required by 49 CFR Part 382 et al. This includes all employees who:
1.	Are in a classification that requires the possession of a Commercial Drivers License (CDL); or who
2.	Possess a CDL and drive a motor vehicle for the State of California that:
a.	Has a gross combination weight rating or gross combination weight of 26,001 or more pounds inclusive of a towed unit with a gross vehicle weight rating or gross vehicle weight of more than 10,000 pounds; or
b.	Has a gross vehicle weight rating or gross vehicle weight of 26,001 or more pounds; or
c.	Is designed to transport 16 or more passengers, including the driver; or
d.	Is of any size and is used in the transportation of materials found to be hazardous for the purposes of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act and which require the motor vehicle to be placarded under the Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFF part 172, subpart F).
C.	This Agreement restates and describes certain of :ihe Federal testing provisions and requirements. However, the State and CAUSE agree that the applicable Federal regulations shall be applied in their entirety, and as they are specifically set forth in the CFR.
II.	DPA CONSORTIUM
DPA will serve as the administrator for the consortium that will provide drug/alcohol testing services for the Federal testing program to State departments, other than the Department of Transportation. These contracted services will include urine collection, breath alcohol testing, laboratory services, and MRO services.
221
BU 07
Final 01/24/07
III.	TYPES OF TESTING
A.	Random Testing: Each year, a number of drug tes:s that equals 50 percent of the employees in the DPA consortium will be conducted on employees who are randomly selected from the consortium. In addition, a number of alcohol tests that equals 10 percent of the number of employees; in the DPA consortium will be conducted on employees who are randomly selected from the consortium. DPA will randomly select employee names using the H-'-IDI computer software program.
Employees will usually provide urine specimens (lor drug tests) and take breath alcohol tests for the random testing program during normal work hours. Employees whose regularly scheduled work shift occurs outside of the designated collection sites' normal hours of operation may be held after shift to be tested, or the employing department may make arrangements to have them tested during their shift.
In no event shall an employee be called in for the purpose of participating in a random test while the employee is on vacation, regular days off, sick leave, compensating time off, or other leave status.
Procedures for collecting urine specimens shall safeguard individual privacy consistent with 49 CFR, Part 40, section 40.25. Chain of custody procedures shall be maintained and shall be adhered to consistent with 49 CFR, Part 40, section 40.25--40.29.
B.	Reasonable Suspicion: Employees will be required to submit to a reasonable suspicion drug test and/or a breath alcohol test if 1 he supervisor has reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver has violated this Federal requirements on the use of controlled substances and/or alcohol. A finding of reasonable suspicion must be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the driver. The observations may include indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled substances.
Supervisors who could be making a determination of reasonable suspicion must receive: 1) at least 60 minutes of training on alcohol misuse; and 2) at least an additional 60 minutes of training on controlled substances use. The training shall cover the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of probable alcohol misuse and use of controlled substances.
A CDL holder covered by this testing program is subject to reasonable suspicion testing for alcohol anytime the CDL holder is ready to perform, is immediately available to perform, is performing, or has just per formed a safety-sensitive function. A CDL holder covered by this testing pre gram is subject to reasonable suspicion tests for drugs anytime the CDL holder is on duty.
222
BU 07
Final 01/24/07
The basis for all reasonable suspicion determinations shall be documented as follows:
1.	Preliminary documentation. Before the employ ee is sent to provide a urine specimen and/or take an alcohol breath test, the employee shall be given a preliminary, informal written statement that indicates why the employee is being sent to testing. The purpose of this is to give the employee a specific (i.e., describing specific observations leading to the reasonable suspicion determination) but concise summary of why he/she is being sent to testing. Because of the need to act quickly in these situations, these statements may not contain a complete narration of the observations and circumstances surrounding the decision to initiate a reasonab le suspicion test.
2.	Official reasonable suspicion documentation will be completed and made available to the employee within two working clays after being asked to submit to testing. This will be a specific, written description of the observations concerning the employee’s appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors that led to the decision to test. It will also list the dates, times and places of these observations, as well as the nrmes of the observers. While the State intends to develop and use standard forms for this purpose, an official documentation will not be deemed to be out of compliance with these requirements simply because it is not presented on a standard form.
This documentation shall be completed before the person preparing it is aware of any positive drug test results.
3.	The parties recognize that differences between the preliminary and official documentation may occur. Differences between the preliminary and official documentation may not, in and of themselves, compromise the integrity of an otherwise valid order to go for a reasonable suspicion drug test.
Post Accident: A driver who is in an accident involving a commercial vehicle shall be tested for alcohol and controlled substances if the following conditions exist:
1.	The driver was performing safety-sensitive functions with respect to the vehicle, and the accident involved the loss of human life; or
2.	The driver received a citation under State or local law for a moving traffic violation arising from the accident, and the accident involved bodily injury requiring treatment away from the scene and/or resulted in damage to any vehicle that required the vehicle to be towed/tiansported away.
3.	Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention following an accident.
4.	The State shall conduct its own post accident tests, in addition to any tests performed by law enforcement agencies, unless it is not possible for the State agency to conduct a test within the federally prescribed time limits.
Pre-Employment/Pre-Duty Testing: A pre-employ nent/pre-duty controlled substance and alcohol test must be conducted before the first time a driver performs his/her first safety-sensitive function for foe State. A driver must also take a pre-duty controlled substance and alcohol test when he/she transfers from a position not performing safety-sensitive functions to a position performing safety-sensitive functions as defined under the OR. This also applies to a driver

returning from a leave of absence for more than 30 calendar days due to illness, lay-off, injury, extended leaves, (paid or unpaid) etc., who has not remained in the controlled substance and alcohol testing program and, therefore, has not been subject to the random testing process. A negative test result is required prior to performing safety-sensitive functions.
There will be a uniform standard within each State; Department for determining when absent employees are to remain in the testing pool.
A driver may be exempted from pre-employment/pre-duty testing if the State verifies his/her participation in and compliance with a Federal testing program under a prior employer, as specified in the Feders! regulations.
E.	Return-to-Duty Testing: Employees who have engaged in prohibited conduct under the Federal regulations must submit to and pass a return-to-duty test prior to performing safety-sensitive duties again.
F.	Follow-up Testing: Following the Substance Abuses Professional's (SAP's) determination that the employee, has properly followed the SAP's recommendation for rehabilitation, the employee will be subject to a minimum of 6 unannounced follow-up alcohol and/or drug test;-; during the first 12 months following his/her return to work.
IV.	TESTING PROCESS

BU 07
Final 01/24/07
B.	Alcohol Testing
Alcohol testing shall be performed by certified Breath Alcohol Technicians (BATs) using Federally-approved (NHTSA) evidentiary breath testing devices. For a positive test result with an alcohol level of 0.02 to 1039, the employee may not be assigned to perform safety-sensitive functions for a period of 24 hours. For a positive test result with an alcohol level of 0.040 a rid above, the employee has violated 49 CFR.
C.	Urine Collection/Breath Testing Process
Urine collection/breath alcohol testing services will generally be conducted in private clinical facilities. In addition, the State may utilize on-site (mobile) urine collection/breath alcohol testing services provided by private contractors. The State will specifically inform CAUSE of any situations in which State agencies plan to use their own staff and facilities to collect urine samples.
Time that is required for the employee to provide urine samples and take breath tests for the random, reasonable suspicion, post< ccident, and follow-up testing programs shall be considered State work time. This shall be the time required to travel to the collection/testing site, the time involved in waiting for and completing the collection/testing process, and travel back to the employee's headquarters. If the employee returns to his/her home after the col lection/testing process, that travel time, minus the employee's normal commute time from home to headquarters, shall also be work time. Pre-duty testing that is required because of the State-initiated assignment of commercial driving duties to an employee shall also be covered by this provision.
If urine collection/breath testing is not completed until after the completion of the employee's scheduled work day, or if the employee is to remain away from the worksite pending the outcome of the tests, the employing State agency shall ensure that the employee has a safe and reasonable way to get home.
When there are no other means available, the State will provide a safe and reasonable way home.
D.	Re-Tests
For controlled substance tests, employees may request that a re-test, using the second portion of their split-sample urine specime n, be conducted at a NIDA-certified laboratory of their choice, provided they do it through the Medical Review Officer (MRO) who reviewed their laboratory results and make their request within 72 hours of receiving notice of the MRO's determination regarding the results of the first drug test. If the second test confirms the results of the first drug test, the employee will pay for the costs of th eb second test. If the re-test is done at the laboratory that is under contract with ihe State consortium, this cost will be equal to the rate specified in the contract with the laboratory for re-tests. If the second test indicates that the first test results were erroneous, the State will pay for the second test.
225
BU 07
Final 01/24/07
E.	Medical Review Officer Services
All drug test results will be reviewed by a MRO, w io, in turn, will report his/her finding to the State agency. MRO services will be provided by a licensed physician (medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy^ who has knowledge of substance abuse disorders and has appropriate medical training to interpret and evaluate drug test results.
An employee who tests positive will be interviewed by an MRO and be given an opportunity to provide medical information that thct employee believes may have a bearing on the test results.
F.	Substance Abuse Professional Services
All employees who test positive for drugs or alcohol must be evaluated by a SAP, as provided in the federal regulations, if they are to return to duty.

ATTACHMENT F - K-9 Ranger 7(K) Pilot Program
PURPOSE
The purpose of this program is to implement an alternate scheduling option as a 6-month pilot program for the K-9 rangers at Hearst Castle. This scheduling option includes 19 hours of work (including meals and breaks) ;md five hours of unpaid sleep.
The alternate scheduling pilot program is intended to apply solely to the K-9 handling rangers at San Simeon District due to the unique 24-hour operational and training needs of the District,
This program may be extended by the department in six month increments if found to be operationally beneficial during the life of the contract. Par ies agree to meet and discuss any decision to terminate the program.
AUTHORITY
A.	Department
Public Resources Code section 5008(a) states: “The department shall protect the state park system from damage...and preserve the peace therein”. This new pilot program proposes to provide the most effective way to protect the visitors, employees, and cultural and historical resources at Hearst Castle without increasing PY’s.
B.	Federal FLSA
Under the FLSA of 1983, section 7(K) gives the Department the authority to utilize the alternate scheduling option for peace officers. The federal regulations recognize the need for an immediate response assignment on situations similar to those at Hearst Castle.
BACKGROUND/CRITICAL NEED
Hearst Castle is valuable in terms of number and value o: artifacts, square feet of historical facilities and vulnerable of vandalism. Yet, being in a remote location, there is a need for an immediate response assignment to protect Hearst Castle. There are no other local or county fire or police patrols within 30 minutes (first in) and there is a 65 minute response for meaningful support and backup.
In short, the District must rely on its 24-hour security employees at Hearst Castle to provide immediate response effort.
Compounding the remoteness and immediate response concerns is both the increase in value and the increase in visitors during the day and at night. There is a need for 24-hour protection.
The 7(k) scheduling option provides the 24-hour immedisle response without increasing PY’s to cover the shifts. A conventional schedule would require at least two additional PY’s.
The 7(k) scheduling option allows a K-9 ranger to pair up with a firefighter/security officer team for training, skills, mutual support and further shift F'Y augmentation. Staff retention and morale will also benefit because the employees are covering the shifts and working as a cohesive team to protect Hearst Castle.

BU 07
Final 01/24/07
K-9/BOMB DETECTION TRAINING
This type of scheduling best serves the continuity of regular and frequent bomb detection training performed by the K-9 rangers.
In order for optimum training for quality bomb detection training, there should be a block of four hours. This includes set up and breakdown of training materials, and two blind searches at a minimum of thirty minutes each of actual “sniff time”. Explosives training is most effective when it is conducted on a regular basis. This also builds up endurance in the dogs and provides confidence in the K-9 team. With the sophistication of explosive materials, there are currently fourteen protocols as far as core items, and 19,000 possible combinations for dogs to detect. Blocks of training time during daytime hours also most closely resemble real life scenarios and provide reality-based training. This schedule also allows the K-9 rangers to team up with firefighter/security officers, so that the firefight/security officers can serve in the capacity of spotters and enhance team coordination.
CONTINOUS IMPROVEMENT
This program reflects the desire to seek continuous improvement. It also addresses the core program elements linked to the mission of California State Park in the areas of resource protection and public safety. It relates to the identified outcome for resource protection in that "significant cultural sites, features, structures and collections are protected and preserved. ” For public safety, it provides “a safe environment within State Parks.”
SUMMARY
The adoption of this program encompasses the best gove rnment practices and the best museum practices because it:
Saves the equivalent of two PY’s each fiscal year.
Increases training opportunities for K-9 and bomb detection.
Enables the firefighter/security officer to focus on fire prevention and medical assists without undermining security due to the presence by K-9 rangers on the schedule.
- Provides continuous coverage and presence by K-9 rangers teams for security purposes.
Enhances security overall, especially with the increased visitation due to the fee reduction.
