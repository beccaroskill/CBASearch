There will also be a session on ethics in teaching. In designing the schedule for these five days, time will also be set aside for the teacher to spend time at his or her school. Teachers hired after the start of orientation but before the close of the first semester shall be required to fulfill an alternate orientation program developed jointly by the district and the Union
3.	During pre-planning and post-planning, at least one half (1/2) of the work time shall be reserved for use by the teacher for activities and job responsibilities such as, but not limited to, class planning and preparation, required paperwork, parent conferences, team planning, and record keeping. The principal shall have the discretion to require attendance at faculty meetings, department meetings, grade level meetings, inservice meetings, etc., during the balance of the work time during pre-planning and postplanning.

5.	District level in-service provided on the professional development day shall be jointly developed by the district and the Union. The building principal shall seek staff input in developing in-service to be conducted at the school site level on the professional development day. The parties shall endeavor to ensure that the professional development activities are relevant to the employees job assignment. Except for specific prior approval by the principal, the use of personal leave shall not be permitted on the professional development day. On the professional development day, teachers shall be given a one hour lunch period.
11
6.	In the case of job categories in which the established working year exceeds the basic contract period, compensation will be made as provided in Article 26 - Compensation and the salary schedule.
7.	Nothing herein shall abridge the right of the Board to establish a different contract period when allowed by law, provided that before implementation of the new contract year the Board will, upon request, bargain with the Union with respect to any impact on the wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment of the affected employees.
B.	Teachers will be assigned appropriate starting and dismissal times by the School Board. The regularly scheduled work day of elementary teachers shall not exceed 7 hours. The work day of secondary teachers shall not exceed 7 1/2 hours, except as provided herein. It is recognized that while the work day for elementary teachers is 4 hour less than the work day for middle school and high school teachers, elementary teachers, in addition to classroom instruction, engage in a large amount of parental contact and paperwork.
Elementary Day for Classroom Teachers - 7 Hours
300 minutes of instruction (Daily average for the week)
30 minutes of uninterrupted lunch time
35 minutes continuous duty free planning within the student day (Daily average for the week) 30 minutes duty free planning time outside the student day (Daily average for the week) The remainder of the 7 hours will include pre-school and post-school time

C.	Employees whose scheduled work day is less than the full time equivalent but greater than half shall be entitled to a pro-rated uninterrupted lunch. Only teachers whose scheduled work day is the full seven hours (7) or seven and one half hour (7 1/2) work day, whichever is appropriate
12
based upon the position, shall be entitled to the duty free planning time during the student day as described in this article. The District will give reasonable consideration for non-classroom work when scheduling teachers less than full-time. The work week for non-classroom teachers at school sites shall include not less than 325 minutes of non-instructional time, excluding lunch. This time is not required to be continuous.
D.	Uninterrupted lunch time shall not include assisting students in the lunch line.
E.	Consistent with Section 1012.22 (1)(h), Florida Statutes, the purpose of planning time is to allow classroom teachers time for planning during which they will not be directly responsible for student supervision. During such time, a building principal has the discretion to require the teacher to participate in meetings as may be necessary. However, teachers shall not be required by the building principal to attend inservice meetings, grade level meetings, department meetings or curriculum meetings during their planning time more than once per week, except in cases of emergency. The administration will continue it’s on going efforts in collaboration with the teachers to reduce paperwork required of teachers. If a principal believes it will be necessary to have teachers give up their planning time during the administration of FCAT or the PSAT, the principal shall first seek volunteers from the teaching staff with an appropriate schedule. If there are an insufficient number of volunteers, then the principal may designate the teachers who will be required to give up their planning time. Teachers called upon to give up their planning time during the administration of FCAT or the PSAT shall have the choice of receiving either an equivalent amount of time off on a duty day, or compensation at a rate of $15 per hour, rounded to the nearest quarter hour.
F.	For as long as the middle schools continue to have a professional service period, that professional service period will be used for team planning, parent conferences, faculty meetings as described in paragraph “G.” below, and other staff meetings. Reasonable efforts will be made to limit the number of meetings scheduled by the principal during the professional service period, and to allow teachers time on a daily basis prior to the student day to be used at the teacher’s discretion.
G.	Teachers may be required to attend school related general faculty meetings, school department meetings, grade level meetings, and/or parent conferences outside of the regular work day, to last no longer than one (1) hour, without additional compensation. No teacher shall be required to attend more than one of the meetings above per week outside of the regular work day, except in cases of emergency where one required after school meeting has already been conducted during the week. Attendance at all other meetings beyond the regular work day for which compensation is not paid shall be at the option of the individual teacher, except attendance shall be required at one Open House annually, or as otherwise provided in this contract.
Faculty meetings may also be used to deliver inservice education. The building principal shall endeavor to ensure that such inservice is applicable to the entire staff. Except in emergency cases, a written agenda should be made available to those who will be attending prior to the beginning of any faculty meeting. For elementary and high schools, all faculty meetings, except on Duty Days, shall begin no later than 15 minutes after the student dismissal time. Faculty meetings at the middle school level will be conducted one hour and ten minutes prior to the start of the student day, except that such meetings may be conducted after the work day where the practice at the school is to do so or when circumstances arise that are outside of the principal’s control necessitating an after school meeting.
13
For every week in which a teacher is not required to attend a faculty meeting, grade level meeting, department meeting, in-service meeting or curriculum meeting outside of the regular work day, the Principal shall have the discretion to require the teacher to attend parent conferences outside of the regular work day without additional compensation.
H.	The Principal shall endeavor to minimize the number of meetings to be held during or after the end of the regular workday, except when additional compensation is to be paid for such meetings. When possible, the building principal shall consider the use of email to communicate with teachers.
I.	Teachers shall be notified of all meetings 24 hours in advance, except in cases of emergency. An additional exception may be made for student/parent situations requiring immediate attention. In such cases, the administration shall speak with the teacher in private about the issues prior to the start of the meeting.
J.	As much as practicable, non-teaching duties shall not be performed by teachers. These non-teaching duties include collecting money (except as in Section M of this Article); supervising cafeterias and buses; delivering books; taking inventories; distributing supplies; duplicating instructional materials; similar clerical and/or custodial duties. When supervisory needs are not met by teacher volunteers, and supervision of corridors, rest rooms, stairways and other areas is warranted as determined by the Principal, it will be assigned on a scheduled rotating basis. Prior to the implementation of a rotation of duties under this paragraph, the Principal shall discuss the plan with the faculty (during pre-planning if the rotation is to begin at the start of the year, or at a faculty meeting during the year if the rotation is to be implemented during the year). In lieu of performing duties on a scheduled rotating basis, a faculty may, with the approval of the principal, select an alternative plan for the faculty to provide such student supervision. The faculty shall vote by secret ballot on such plan, and the currently identified VTO steward or other building representative appointed by VTO shall conduct the voting. To waive this provision, eighty percent (80%) of the faculty must agree.
K.	Specific planning time, apart from student contact hours and travel time, will be provided to all itinerant classroom teachers.
L.	Teachers shall not be required to collect general instructional fees of a school-wide nature beyond the second week of school.
M.	Teacher attendance at sales presentations will be optional.

without permission of the principal.
3.	The teacher shall refrain from tutoring students enrolled in his instructional class.
14
P.	The workday for district level bargaining unit members shall be seven and one half hours, including a half hour paid lunch. With the agreement of the supervisor, an employee may extend his or her workday to 8 hours for the purpose of having a one hour lunch, with one half hour of lunch being unpaid. District level bargaining unit members will have, in the course of the week, 325 minutes of non-instructional time. This time is not required to be continuous.
Q.	Early Release Days - Early release days for students will be scheduled as follows.
1.	On early release days, the student day shall be shortened by 60 minutes.
2.	A schedule for early release days will be provided prior to the start of each school year,
with Wednesday being the day of the week in which early release will be given.	There
shall be no early release day on the following weeks: (a) the first week of school;	(b) the
week that the FCAT Writing exam is conducted; and (c) the two weeks that the FCAT reading, math and science exams are conducted. The class schedule that will be utilized on early release days will be discussed at a staff meeting during preplanning.
3.	The student time lost as a result of the early release days shall be added to the remaining student days in the year in order to avoid any loss of student learning time. No more than 10 minutes of additional instruction time shall be added to the student day in order to avoid any loss of student time. If this addition causes instruction time to exceed 300 minutes per day, such addition shall not be considered a violation of the collective bargaining agreement.
4.	Except as stated herein, all early release time shall be unscheduled and utilized at the discretion of the teacher for job responsibilities such as, but not limited to, class planning and preparation, required paperwork, parent conferences, team planning, and record keeping. Beginning with the 2010-2011 school year, district or school level administrators shall be permitted to schedule meetings and/or in-service activities during release time on up to eight (8) of the early release days in the school year. Principals shall inform the faculty during pre-planning which of the early release days will be scheduled in accordance with this section. Teachers will be given at least two (2) weeks notice of any changes to this schedule during the school year. Understanding that teachers are an important part of the process, principals will endeavor to seek input from their faculty in order to customize the delivery of training. Principals, including at the middle school level, shall also have the discretion to schedule after-school faculty meetings, as described in this article, on any of the eight (8) days in order to extend the time for the meeting and/or in-service activities. The length of the time for the afterschool meeting shall be the time necessary to ensure that a two (2) hour block of time is available for the meeting and/or in-service activity.
5.	The implementation of early release days shall not cause the teachers’ normal work day to be extended on non-early release days.

Therefore, the parties agree that the school board shall not hire any new teacher (including at, but not limited to the job fair) for a position for which a displaced teacher who has not been placed is properly certified, unless the certification involved is one that has been determined to be a critical shortage area by the Department of Education and/or the Superintendent. The Union shall be notified of the areas determined by the Superintendent to be a critical shortage area.
7.	If an affected teacher is placed in an out-of-field assignment, it shall be noted in the individuals file that such placement was due to the downsizing of an individual building staff.
D.	Vacancies
Vacancies shall be advertised for three (3) work days beginning the day after post planning and concluding July 31. From August 1 through post planning, vacancies shall be advertised for two (2) work days. The following vacancies are excluded from this requirement:

3.	When two (2) or more employees have the same date of hire they shall have equal ranking in seniority status.
4.	When two (2) or more employees have equal rank on the seniority list, layoff or recall shall be determined by the drawing of lots.

B.	Layoff and Recall
1.	The VTO will be notified prior to the commencement of a layoff process.
2.	Layoff and recall shall be governed by certification and seniority, in accordance with the
procedure set out in this article.
3.	If a teacher is notified by the Superintendent/designee that he or she is to be subject to a layoff, the teacher shall have the right to displace the least senior teacher possessing the same certification and teaching in a position requiring that certification in the geographic area in which the teacher’s current school site is located, except where the least senior teacher has documented skills and qualifications that benefit the overall operation of the school. Where the previously stated exception applies, then the School Board shall move to the next least senior teacher in accordance with the terms of this paragraph. Nontenured teachers shall be laid off prior to tenured teachers. In addition, all layoff procedures must be consistent with veterans’ preference requirements, as required by law.
4.	If a position within the geographic area is not available under C.3. above, the teacher shall have the right to displace the least senior teacher possessing the same certification and teaching in a position requiring that certification in the remaining two geographic areas in the district, except where the least senior teacher has documented skills and qualifications that benefit the overall operation of the school.
5.	Where a tenured teacher is laid off, but there is no teacher in the geographic area in which the teacher’s current school site is located who has the same certification and is teaching in a position requiring that certification, the District will offer to place the teacher in a position in the district, provided the teacher has at least a bachelor’s degree and has professional certification in at least one subject area. If the teacher declines the placement that is offered or fails to respond within the time frame provided by the personnel department, but not less than three days, then he or she shall be laid off. If the teacher is placed in a position for which he or she would be out of field, then the teacher must either:
a.	If the position is one for which certification can be obtained through the passage of an exam, then the teacher must pass the exam by the June 30th following the one year anniversary of the notification; or
b.	If the position is not one for which certification can be obtained through passage of an exam, then the teacher must complete the requirements and obtain certification appropriate for the position within two (2) years; or
c.	Complete a minimum of six (6) semester credits per year for certifications that require more than two (2) years to complete the requirements for certification.
If the teacher does not have a bachelor’s degree and professional certification in at least one subject area, or the teacher fails to comply with the above stated requirements, then he or she shall be laid off.
24
6.	Employees who have been laid off will be recalled on the basis of seniority to positions for which they are certified, unless the position requires documented skills and qualifications that benefit the overall operation of the school, but which the teacher does not have, with the employee with the most seniority on layoff being called back first using the criteria listed above.
7.	A non-tenured teacher who has been laid off shall only have recall rights through the end of the school year in which he or she was laid off. A tenured teacher on layoff shall remain on the recall list so long as he expresses a desire to do so to the Board, in writing, at least once per school year, in accordance with procedures established by the Superintendent, unless removed from the list in accordance with the terms of this article. It is the employee’s obligation to notify the School Board of any change of address.
ARTICLE 17
NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFIED TEACHERS

B.	The Superintendent and Union President shall establish a committee to discuss issues and opportunities related to NBC teachers.
ARTICLE 18 MAINTENANCE OF CLASSROOM CONTROL
A.	Statement of Philosophy
The Board and the Union agree that a safe and orderly learning environment is a priority of both parties and that student discipline is the shared responsibility of teachers and administrators. It is important that disruptive student behavior be dealt with in a safe and corrective manner, consistent with the district Code of Student Conduct and Discipline, and the discipline procedures of individual school sites.
B.	General Responsibility
While on duty, a teacher has a general responsibility for student control and a major responsibility for controlling those students under his direct supervision. Similarly, the school principal has the ultimate responsibility of ensuring the enforcement of the district Code of Student Conduct and Discipline.
C.	School Disciplinary Procedure
1.	Teachers will be provided with a copy of the district Code of Student Conduct and Discipline at the beginning of each year. Student disciplinary procedures at the school level shall be consistent with the District Code of Student Conduct and Discipline, and shall include procedures for staff seeking assistance in handling disruptive students. Teacher input shall be sought when these procedures are to be changed. Teachers will be provided with a written copy of these procedures at the beginning of each school year, and will be notified whenever these procedures are changed. These procedures shall not include any arbitrary limit on the number of disciplinary referrals a teacher may write.
25
When a teacher writes a referral, the teacher may retain one copy for their records, while sending the remaining parts to the office. If codes are utilized for disciplinary referrals, such codes shall be provided to the teachers during pre-planning.
2.	A teacher may at any time request the assistance of the principal or his designee. The Board recognizes the right of a teacher under Florida Statute Section 1003.32 to have disobedient, disrespectful, violent, abusive, uncontrollable or disruptive students temporarily removed from the classroom for behavior management intervention, pursuant to the current procedure. The Placement Review Committee, including alternates required by Florida Statute 1003.32 shall be selected/elected by the second week of each school year.
D.	Student Discipline
1.	Physical restraint may be used by a teacher in extraordinary cases of discipline to contain a disruptive pupil, provided the force used is reasonable. The teacher shall inform the principal at once of such an action and shall make an accurate written account of it within 24 hours, if possible.
2.	The Board and the Union agree that the classroom teacher should be able to deal effectively with the normal problems of discipline in the classroom. However, when in the judgment of the teacher, a student's behavior seriously disrupts the instructional program to the detriment of the other students or creates an emergency, the classroom teacher shall have the authority to request and receive immediate assistance in classroom management, and have the student temporarily removed from the classroom by referral to the principal or his designee for behavior management intervention. The teacher may make recommendations for student discipline. If such a recommendation is made, the administration will respond in accordance with the requirements of section 1003.32, Florida Statutes.
3.	Prior to readmission to the classroom, the principal or designee will communicate, preferably in writing, with the classroom teacher who referred the student. If the teacher disagrees with the principal's decision to readmit the student, he shall make is so known in writing. The principal will accept the responsibility of his decision thereof prior to the student's re-admittance. If the teacher and principal or designee mutually agree that a particular student is in need of special assistance, efforts will be made to obtain such assistance through school district procedures established for that purpose.
4.	A student who physically assaults a teacher shall be immediately suspended from school. A standard procedure will be made available for all principals in reporting and investigating an assault.
E.	Battery and/or Assault
1.	Principals, or other appropriate administrators, shall be responsible for reporting immediately to the Superintendent, through the Security Department, any person who (1) commits assault or battery upon any employee, and (2) any person who is not otherwise subject to the rules and regulations of the school, who creates a disturbance on the property or grounds of any school, or who commits any act which interrupts the orderly conduct of a school or any activity thereof. The Board shall make an investigation and/or notify the police department. The Superintendent shall assist the employee in filing
26
charges against the individual committing such act or acts if the employee chooses to file charges.
2.	Employee medical expenses shall be paid consistent with the Workers Compensation Law.
3.	If a student assaults and inflicts bodily harm causing injury to a teacher, the student shall not return to that setting except in those instances which conflict with applicable law. The principal shall report as soon as possible, but within twenty four (24) hours, to the Superintendent that an assault upon an employee has been reported to him. The full report shall be signed by the employee to acknowledge that he has seen the report, and he may append a statement to the report.
4.	An assaulted employee who presses charges against his assailant shall be released consistent with School Board Policy 417 - Leave, Terminal Pay, and Holiday Provisions, II.F. - Temporary Duty, 2.
5.	If a teacher is suspended from duty because of pending judicial or administrative action and is subsequently exonerated of charges that resulted in this suspension, he will be fully compensated by the Board for such period of absence, according to the contract of the teacher, and be returned to full duty.
F.	Teacher Protection
1.	In the interests of teacher protection, the Board shall provide support to teachers in the discharge of their duties, consistent with School Board Policy 424.
2.	Assault
a.	Whenever a teacher is absent from school as a result of personal injury due to assault arising out of and in the course of his employment, he shall be paid full salary for the period of such absence or the balance of the fiscal year whichever is shorter, if approved by the Board as provided for in Florida Statutes 1012.63(1)(2), without having such absence charged to sick leave.
b.	Any amount of salary payable pursuant to this section shall be reduced by the amount of Workers' Compensation award for temporary disability due to said assault injury for the period for which such salary is paid.
c.	The Board shall have the right to have the teacher examined by a physician designated by the Board for the purpose of establishing the length of time during which the teacher is temporarily unable to perform his duties. In the event that there is no adjudication in the appropriate Workers' Compensation proceeding for the period of temporary disability, the opinion of the physician as to the period of disability shall prevail. The teacher retains the right to obtain a second opinion which will be considered by the Board.
d.	If a teacher pursues civil action, he should include loss of time, and in the event such action results in award of damages by agreement or adjudication, the Board shall be reimbursed in the amount of salary which is received in the damage settlement. Attorney's fees and expenses of collection of damages shall be
27
prorated between the teacher and the Board on the basis of the amount distributed to each. The Board shall be subrogated to the right of action of such teacher against any person legally responsible for such damages.
3.	If a teacher is suspended from duty because of pending judicial or administrative action and is subsequently exonerated of charges that resulted in this suspension, he will be fully compensated by the Board for such period of absence, according to the contract of the teacher, and be returned to full duty.
4.	Teachers shall receive notice regarding students charged with a felony offense as required by section 985.04, Florida Statutes.
ARTICLE 19

3.	Volusia County School Board will continue to provide teachers on workers' compensation with group matching health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. If a teacher has no earnings against which the Payroll Department can deduct the teacher's portion of group health insurance the School Board will notify the teacher that he must send this payment directly to The School Board of Volusia County. If the teacher chooses to let his group health insurance coverage cease the School Board will no longer make its match.
4.	A Board designated organization number will be used for receiving teachers transferred to a long-term workers' compensation status. Transfer of a teacher from his current organization to the appropriately designated organization must be done by Notice of Personnel Action (NPA) and only upon securing approval for the transfer from the Risk
37
Manager who will be responsible for monitoring the organization number designated by the Board for this purpose.
5.	Transfer of a teacher to the appropriately designated organization frees his unit at the transferring organization to be filled by another teacher. When a teacher is released to return to work the Volusia County School Board will make every effort to place the teacher in an equivalent position (subject to any medical restrictions) within the district. The School Board has no obligation to return the teacher to his/her original organization.
L.	Temporary Duty
1.	A temporary duty assignment is an assignment with pay for duty at a location other than the regular place of duty. A temporary duty assignment covers attendance at required activities, attendance requested by the Superintendent, or participation as a representative of the school or the school system. Necessary travel time and expenses are included in temporary duty assignment(s).
2.	Temporary duty assignment will be granted with pay for the appearance in any legal proceeding connected with the teacher's employment, or with the school system or in any other legal proceeding, such as jury duty, or when subpoenaed to appear before a public body or commission or other legal body if required by the law to attend. Personal litigation not related to a teacher's employment and litigation filed by the teacher against the district are excluded from this provision. This provision does not apply to a teacher who is suspended with pay.
3.	An employee released from his subpoena or jury duty with sufficient time remaining to return to his school center to complete at least one half (1/2) day of his duty day shall return to his school center unless released by the principal.

Grievance Procedure
Whenever a grievance arises between the School Board and the employees or the Union, the matter will be handled in accordance with the following procedure:
1.	Informal Procedure
Step 1 - The parties wish to encourage the resolution of potential grievances at the lowest level possible without having to resort to the formal grievance procedure. Therefore, no later than ten (10) days after the event that gives rise to the grievance or said event is known or should have been known to the employee, the grievant and/or his representative, shall request a meeting with his immediate supervisor to discuss the potential grievance. The Step 1 meeting shall take place within ten (10) days of the request for a meeting.
2.	Formal Procedure
a.	Step 2 - If the potential grievance is not resolved through informal discussions within ten (10) days after the Step 1 meeting or after the expiration of the Step 1 timeline, the grievant may submit his grievance and a request for a Step 2 meeting in writing and sign it. The written grievance must include:
(1)	A statement of the grievance and the facts involved.
(2)	The remedy requested.
(3)	The Articles and Sections of the Agreement which grievant claims have been violated.
The Step 2 meeting shall take place within ten (10) days of said request. The immediate supervisor will respond to the grievance within ten (10) days after the meeting.
b.	Step 3 - If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2 within ten (10) days of the decision of the Supervisor or the expiration of the Step 2 timeline, the grievant may appeal the decision to the Superintendent.
(1)	At the request of the Union or the employee, a meeting between the Superintendent, a Union representative and the grievant shall be held at a mutually agreeable time, but not more than ten (10) days after receipt of the appeal to Step 3 by the Superintendent.
(2)	The Superintendent will issue his decision within 10 days after the meeting held under subparagraph (1) above.
3.	Failure of the parties to meet and/or discuss a grievance to make a decision within the time provided in Step 1, 2, or 3 of the grievance procedure shall be deemed a denial of the grievance by the Management, and the employee or the Union shall proceed with the next step as if the decision had been made on the last day allowed.
39
4.	Mediation - At any step of this procedure, the parties may by mutual written consent utilize the services of an impartial mediator to assist in attempting to resolve the grievance. Recommendations of such a mediator shall not be binding upon the parties nor admissible in any arbitration or other proceeding without the express written consent of both parties.
E.	Arbitration - Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, arbitrable grievances that have been properly submitted under Section D shall be subject to arbitration in accordance with the following procedures.
Arbitration proceedings must be initiated by the Union sending a written demand to the Superintendent for arbitration. This demand shall be received by the Superintendent within fifteen (15) days of the decision in Step 3 or the last day on which a Step 3 decision could have been made, whichever first occurs.
F.	Selection of Arbitrator - As soon as possible after the demand for arbitration is served and a list of arbitrators have been received from the American Arbitration Association (AAA), the parties shall meet or confer by telephone in order to select an arbitrator to hear and decide the grievance. The Union and the School Board shall each have the right alternatively to strike three (3) names from the list. The party to strike first shall be decided by the flip of a coin. The name remaining shall be the arbitrator. Subject to Section I, the arbitrator selected shall decide the dispute and such decision shall be final and binding on the parties and the employees. The involvement of AAA shall be limited to the selection process.
G.	Fees and Expenses - The fees and expenses of the arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties. Each party shall be responsible for its own attorney's fees and any court reporting services it utilizes in any arbitration proceeding. If the hearing occurs during work time, the grievant and any witnesses shall be given the necessary release time.
H.	Authority of Arbitrator - The arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, modify, or alter the terms of this Agreement, nor shall the arbitrator have the power to arbitrate any matter expressly or by implication excluded from arbitration. The arbitrator is not to proceed in contravention of the limitations upon his powers as expressed in Section I hereof.
I.	Arbitrability - If a dispute exists concerning the arbitrability of an issue referred to arbitration, the issue of arbitrability shall be the first issue before the arbitrator and no other matter will be considered by the arbitrator until he has issued his findings on the question of arbitrability.
J.	Decision - The decision of the arbitrator on any arbitrable issue shall be supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole and shall be final and binding on the employee, School Board and Union.
K.	Time Limits - The time limits set forth in the Sections D and E are to be considered essential to the grievance and arbitration procedure, and failure of the employee or the Union to meet any time limit set forth therein shall, unless the parties by mutual agreement have extended a time limit, constitute waiver of the grievance and acceptance of the Superintendent's or Board's position.
L.	Time Off/Pay - Steps 1,2 and 3 of the grievance procedure shall be carried out at a time and place mutually agreeable to all parties based on operational needs, and neither the employee nor the employee's Union representative, if any, shall lose pay. The Superintendent shall determine when
40
Step 3 shall be processed, and if the Step is processed during their scheduled working hours, neither the grievant nor Union representative shall lose pay. Employee witnesses, including the grievant and the Union representative, whom the Superintendent may at his option choose to interview in Steps 1, 2, or 3 shall lose no pay if interviewed during their working hours.
M.	General
1.	The filing of a grievance shall in no way interfere with the right of the School Board or the Superintendent to proceed to carry out its management responsibilities, subject to the final resolution of the grievance. The employee shall abide by the management decision involved in any grievance prior to and during the time the grievance has been filed, and shall not discontinue his duties prior to or during the time a grievance is being processed, unless the employee has been terminated.
2.	No reprisals of any kind shall be taken by the Board, Administration, or Union against any employee because of his participation or non-participation in the procedures set forth in this Article.
3.	A grievance may be initiated at Step 3 of the grievance procedure if requested by the Union and agreed upon by the Superintendent.
N.	Resort To Other Procedures - Election Of Remedies
1.	A teacher who is notified of a charge of suspension, demotion, or dismissal, at the option of the teacher, shall have access to the procedure set forth therein, or shall have the right to file a grievance after adverse action by the Board. If the teacher chooses to contest the charges, the teacher must within ten (10) days after being notified of the charges (as provided in the Tenure Law) elect in writing, by registered mail, to the Superintendent and VTO President, to proceed under the Tenure Law to a full hearing before the Board, or to utilize the grievance procedure provided herein, after adverse action by the Board.
2.	If prior to seeking resolution of a dispute of any matter not covered by the Tenure Law by filing a grievance hereunder, or while the grievance is in progress, a teacher seeks resolution of the dispute in another forum, whether administrative or judicial, or before the Board but under a different procedure (including the procedure provided by Florida Statue, Chapter 120), the Board shall have no obligation to entertain or proceed further with the matter pursuant to the grievance procedure. Further, if a matter is pending before an arbitrator appointed in accordance with the grievance procedure, then the arbitrator is deprived of jurisdiction by the teacher seeking resolution in another forum or before the Board under a different procedure. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to grant a non-tenured teacher a right to continued employment beyond the term of the teacher's contract. A non-reappointment shall not be subject to the grievance or arbitration provision contained herein.
O.	Right to Representation - A party to a grievance proceeding shall have the right to request representation of his choice at any step of the informal and formal proceedings. The grievant shall not be required to discuss any grievance filed if the grievant's representative is not present; however, the grievant will select another representative in order that a meeting may proceed. An employee may avail himself of the grievance procedure in person or by counsel and have such grievance adjusted without intervention of the Union provided that:
41
1.	the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; and
2.	the Union has been given reasonable opportunity to be present at any meeting called for in the resolution of such grievance.
3.	the Union shall be provided a copy of the decision at each step.
P.	Instant Arbitration
1.	By mutual agreement the parties may initiate instant arbitration if in the Union's opinion the matter affects an employee in regard to pay, transfer, or any other matter having an immediate detrimental effect to the employee(s) or Union.
2.	The parties agree to maintain a cadre of arbitrators specifically for this purpose and will strike for an arbitrator within five (5) days of the Union's notification to the employer that the Union is invoking this Article.
3.	Cost and decision of the arbitrator will be consistent with normal arbitration proceedings.
ARTICLE 24

b.	Allow one year of service credit for each good year of service in public K-12 school systems, including public and private institutions of higher learning and private K-12 schools which require state certification based upon a baccalaureate degree as a precondition to employment, and the teacher will have held such certificate at the time of service.
c.	For teachers initially employed for service on or after July 1, 2001, there shall be no limit on the years of out-of-state experience for which the teacher may receive credit, provided such years qualify for credit. For teachers initially employed for service on or after July 1, 1987, but prior to July 1, 2001, the allowable service credit will be limited to ten years of out-of-state experience in addition to all Florida public school experience. Teachers employed prior to July 1, 1987 shall be credited additional experience up to ten years at a rate of one year's experience for each five "good years of service" to the School Board of Volusia County. Teachers initially employed prior to July 1, 2001, and who were not credited with their total years of prior service shall, beginning with the implementation of the contract salary schedule settlement for the 2004-2005 fiscal year, receive two additional years of prior service credit for salary purposes each year they are subsequently successfully employed by the Board.

FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT
1.	Family and Medical Leave Act: All provisions of this article shall be interpreted so as to comply with the requirements of the Family and Medical Leave Act and any amendments thereto, and with such federal regulations that may be issued under the Act.
2.	Employee Eligibility: Eligibility for these benefits shall be limited to those bargaining unit members that have been employed for at least the previous twelve (12) months by the Board, and worked at least 1,250 hours during that previous twelve (12) month period. Full-time teachers will be deemed to have met the 1,250 hour requirement.
3.	Terms of Leave: This leave shall be granted, in the following instances, for no more than a total of twelve (12) work weeks during the school year, July 1 through June 30. It shall be granted to eligible bargaining unit members for: (A) to care for the employee's child after birth, or following placement for adoption or foster care; (B) to care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent who has a serious health condition; or (C) for a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the employee's job.
4.	Definitions: The definitions contained in the Act apply to this article.
5.	Group Medical Insurance: The Board shall continue an employee's group medical insurance in
full effect during FMLA leave, to the same extent as when the employee worked. The employee shall be responsible for his or her share of insurance premium payment. Days of leave taken under the sick leave provision of the collective bargaining agreement shall be considered to be leave taken under the FMLA if taken for a serious health condition, for the purposes of this article, as shall any annual leave taken after the employee has exhausted his or her sick leave due to a serious health condition.
6.	Length of Unpaid Medical or Child Care Leave: The length of any unpaid medical or child care leave shall be determined by the collective bargaining agreement, provided such provisions, when considered with sick leave and annual leave used as stated above in paragraph 6, meet the required twelve (12) week allotment called for by the Act.
7.	Notice: If leave is taken to care for a newborn child or a child newly placed for adoption or foster care, the employee must provide notice of the leave in writing, to the personnel department and to his or her immediate supervisor, approximately thirty (30) days in advance, where possible. If a leave is needed for foreseeable medical care, it shall be requested, in writing at least thirty(30) days in advance, or as early as is practicable.
8.	Medical Certification: (A) Illness of Others: When requesting leave for a serious health condition of the employee's spouse, child or parent, the employee, upon request by the school district shall submit a statement from the patient's doctor which certifies that it is necessary for the employee to care for the patient, and estimates the length of time the care is needed. (B) Illness of Employee: The Board may require a medical certification from eligible employees who request leave under the FMLA. Additional requests for medical certification shall be at the employer's expense and shall comply with the regulations under the Act.
64
9.	Intermittent Leave For Planned Medical Treatment: Unpaid medical leave with FMLA benefits may be taken on an intermittent basis when the employee, the employee's spouse, child or parent has a serious medical condition and it is foreseeable that the employee will need short periods of time off. Such intermittent leave days may be taken only when all sick leave and annual leave have been exhausted.
Intermittent leave may be taken in increments of one or more days or partial days at work. Intermittent leave will be granted, subject to the previously mentioned terms, if the health care provider certifies that it is medically necessary. The Board may require medical certification of the need, and the schedule or time of the treatment. The employee must give the Board thirty (30) days written notice of the need for the leave, if possible. If it is not possible to give thirty (30) days advance notice, the employee shall provide as much notice as is practicable.
10.	Employees must exhaust all sick leave prior to taking an unpaid leave covered by the FMLA, where the reason for the leave is covered by section (B) or (C) of paragraph number 3.
11.	Restoration: Upon return from an FMLA leave, the affected employee is entitled to be restored to the same position that the employee held when the leave started, or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay and other terms and conditions of employment.

Appendix E
TEACHER AUTHORITY TO REMOVE STUDENTS FROM THE CLASSROOM
PROCEDURE
Teachers and other instructional staff shall keep good order in the classroom and in other places in which they are assigned to supervise students, shall maintain an orderly and disciplined classroom with a positive and effective learning environment that maximizes learning and minimizes disruption, and shall work with parents and other school personnel to solve discipline problems in their classrooms.
Teachers and other instructional personnel shall establish and enforce reasonable classroom rules that treat all students equitably, that include consequences designed to change behavior, and which are consistent with school board policy and disciplinary rules established by the principal.
Teachers and other instructional personnel shall have the authority to request and receive training and other classroom assistance to improve skills in classroom management, violence prevention, conflict resolution, and other areas. They shall seek professional development to improve classroom management skills when data show that they are not effective in handling minor classroom disruptions. Any teacher who removes 25% of his or her total class enrollment shall be required to complete professional development to improve classroom management skills.
In accordance with law and within the framework of school board policy, teachers and other instructional personnel shall have the authority to undertake any of the following actions in managing student behavior and ensuring safety of all students in their classes and school and their opportunity to learn in an orderly and disciplined classroom:
•	Have disobedient, disrespectful, violent, abusive, uncontrollable, or disruptive students removed from the classroom for behavior management intervention;
•	Have violent, abusive, uncontrollable, or disruptive students directed for information or assistance from appropriate school or district personnel;
•	Assist in enforcing school rules on school property, during school sponsored transportation, and during school-sponsored activities;
•	Request and receive information as to the disposition of any referrals to the administration for violation of classroom or school rules;
•	Request and receive immediate assistance in classroom management if a student becomes uncontrollable or in case of emergency;
•	Press charges if there is reason to believe that a crime has been committed on school property, during school-sponsored transportation, or during school-sponsored activities; and
•	Use reasonable force, according to standards adopted by the State Board of Education, to protect himself or herself or others from injury.
A teacher may, in accordance with the procedure established at the school, send a student to the principal’s office to maintain effective discipline in the classroom and may recommend an appropriate consequence consistent with the Code of Student Conduct and Discipline. The principal shall respond by employing the teacher’s recommended consequence or a more serious disciplinary action if the student’s history of disruptive behavior warrants it. If the principal determines that a lesser disciplinary action is appropriate, the principal should consult with the teacher prior to taking disciplinary action.
66
A teacher may remove from class a student whose behavior the teacher determines interferes with the teacher’s ability to communicate effectively with the students in the class or with the ability of the student’s classmates to learn. A teacher who does so shall provide the principal with a description of the behaviors and how they have interfered with the class prior to the end of the school day. If a teacher fails to provide the information in a timely manner, the teacher will be deemed to have agreed to having the student readmitted. Where student is removed under this procedure, the principal may place the student in another appropriate classroom, in in-school suspension, or in a dropout prevention and academic intervention program. The principal also may choose to recommend the student for out-of school suspension or expulsion, as appropriate. The student may be prohibited from attending or participating in school-sponsored or school-related activities. The principal may not return the student to that teacher’s class without the teacher’s consent unless the placement review committee (PRC) determines that the placement is the best or only available alternative, or the placement is required by the student’s individual education plan or section 504 plan. The decisions of the teacher, principal and PRC shall be made within five days of the removal of the student from the classroom.
When a student is classified as one with disabilities and receiving exceptional education services or is identified as a section 504 student, the principal/designee will, in consultation with ESE personnel or section 504 contact at the building and district level where necessary, review the IEP or the section 504 plan and determine if removing the student from class would violate the applicable plan. If the principal/designee determines that removal would violate the applicable plan, the teacher shall be so informed and the principal/designee will return the student to the classroom. If the referral involved an ESE student, the principal/designee shall notify the staffing specialist to convene the ESE staffing committee to review the student’s IEP. If the referral involved a section 504 student, the principal/designee shall notify the section 504 contact to review the section 504 accommodation. Changes in Florida statutes do not alter federal requirements related to students with disabilities.
A PRC shall be established at each school to determine placement of a student when a teacher withholds consent to the return of a student to the teacher’s class. The principal shall notify each teacher about the availability, the procedures, and the criteria for the PRC. The PRC membership shall include at least two teachers (one selected by the school’s faculty, with a standing member and an alternate being elected at the start of the year, and one selected by the teacher who has removed the student) and one member of the school staff selected by the principal. Additional staff members may be appointed at the discretion of the principal (e.g. guidance counselor, assistant principal). The principal may also serve on the PRC. The teacher who withheld consent to readmitting the student may not serve on the committee.

SICK LEAVE BANK PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES
The purpose of the Sick Leave Bank is to enable employers to provide protection in cases of long-term catastrophic illness and to encourage employees to “save” sick leave for a valuable future economic benefit (terminal leave.) Membership in the Sick Leave Bank must precede the diagnosis date for the current illness for which days are being applied.
1.	To become a member of the Sick Leave Bank, an employee must have accumulated five (5) sick leave days. Following the accumulation of five (5) sick leave days, the employee may join the Sick Leave Bank by donating one (1) sick leave day to sick leave bank.

3.	Members may be granted four times the number of days they have accumulated at the beginning
of their illness to a maximum of one hundred (100) days.
4.	Following any use of the Sick Leave Bank provisions, the employee will have to rejoin the Sick Leave Bank as indicated in #1 above.
5.	Days from the bank may only be used for extended personal physical, or mental disability.
6.	The bank will be administered by the Union as follows:
Three (3) teachers appointed by the VTO President
7.	In cases of extreme hardship, the bank administrators may grant additional days voluntarily given by other Sick Leave Bank members. Any unused donated days will be returned to the Sick Leave Bank.
8.	Members with zero accumulated sick days will have the option of days being donated on their behalf, which will be monitored, by the Sick Leave Bank.
9.	If the bank is depleted during a school year, members may be assessed up to two (2) additional days.
10.	The bank administrators will determine the eligibility of membership in the Sick Leave Bank.
11.	A list of all Sick Leave Bank members shall be provided to the VTO upon written request.
