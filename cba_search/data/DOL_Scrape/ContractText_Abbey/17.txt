It is the intention of the parties to strengthen the skills, capabilities and accountability of Employees, eliminate rigid distinctions regarding what jobs may be performed within a classification, provide a more rapid progression for Employees to assume the full range of responsibilities and replace multi-job, multi-step progressions with a single job classification.
2.	To progress to a higher step within a job classification that is based on qualifications, an Employee must have completed the minimum time in the step, have an overall job performance rating of satisfactory by his supervisor, successfully completed any training required for advancement and demonstrated the necessary knowledge and proficiency required for advancement.
3.	If an Employee is unable to progress to die next higher st: p after being given a reasonable opportunity to do so (but no longer than 6 months), the Employee, if he was hired before October 22,2001, will be demoted to a l aborer or other job classification for which the Employee is qualified and his rate of pay will not be reduced (“red circled”) for 18 months. Employees who are aired after October 22,2001 and who fail to progress, will be demoted or terminated.

3.	Only those employees with the least seniority, on the combined ser iority list, in an Affected Classification in a number equal to the total number of Excess Employees (“Least Senior Employees”) are subject to being bumped.
4,	Employees in Affected Classifications in the following status participate in the RIF process:
a)	Regular/active
b)	Disability
c)	Workers compensation
d)	Leaves of absence
e)	Temporary upgrade to management
5.	A Least Senior Employee appointed by the union as a Chief Stews rd at a station may not be bumped.
6.	Excess Employees, Least Senior Employees and all Laborers will be provided forms on which they may elect, in priority order, the stations to which they are willing to bump in their classification and will have two full days in which to submit their election forms to the company. Employees in Affected Classifications and the Laborer classification not otherwise affected by the RIF may voluntarily make an irrevocable election to transfer to another station to fill a vacancy in their same job classification and rate of pay (“Transfer Volunteer”), but only to substitute for an Excess Employee or Least Senior Employee who is being bumped as more fully described in these Guidelines. After employees are provided election forms, it is the employees’ responsibility to have the completed and signed forms returned to their station Administration Manager, or designee, witt in prescribed time limits, or lose their right to have their bumping choices considered.
7.	Using the election forms described in paragraph 6, the employee with the most seniority among the Excess Employees in a classification has first choice to fill an existing vacancy or bump one of file Least Senior Employees at any station of the selecting employee's choosing. A Least Senior Employee may only be bumped if he
a)	actually has less seniority than the employee who is bumpin g; and
b)	is not one of the employees already declared excess.
Before a Least Senior Employee is bumped from his station, the mo d senior Transfer Volunteer at that station will first fill an existing vacancy in that classification at the station selected by the Transfer Volunteer and Least Senior Employee.
8.	This selection process will continue in seniority order among the Excess Employees until the employee cannot meet the conditions set forth in Paragraph 7.

9.	A Unit Operator (“UO”) who elects not to (or is unable to) exercise his bumping rights in the UO classification may choose, instead, to bump the Equipment Operator (“EO”) with the least seniority at the UO’s current station, if that EO is not already an Excess Employee, but only if the UO has more operator seniority than that EO, which includes the time spent as a UO, UO1, EO, Boiler, Turbine or Switchboard Operator (“Total Operator Seniority”). Any EO bumped under this process will be added to the list of Excess EOs at that station and will participate in the process set forth in Paragraphs 6-8.
10.	At the time an Excess Employee or Least Senior Employee is making his bumping selections, the employee may, instead, elect to
a)	move directly to the process for bumping into the Laborer classification; or
b)	elect to go on lay off status.
II.	Upon conclusion of the first round of bumping within Affected Classifications, only those employees who
a)	were not able to fill a vacancy, or bump an employee in accordance with Paragraphs 6 — 9 ; or
b)	elected to move directly to the Laborer bumping process; or
c)	were bumped out of their classification as a result of the bumping process may participate in the Laborer bumping process (“Laborer Participants”).
12.	Only those Laborers with less service, on a combined service list, in a number equal to the total number of Laborer Participants, are subject to being bumped.
13.	Using the election forms described in paragraph 6, the employee with the most service among the Labor Participants has first choice to fill an existing vacancy, or bump any Laborer with less service at any station of the selecting employee’s choosing. A Laborer with less service may only be bumped if he
a)	actually has less service than the employee who is bumping; and
b)	is not one of the employees already declared excess.
However, before a Laborer with less service is bumped from his station, the Transfer Volunteer with the most service at that station will first fill an existing vacancy in the Laborer classification at the station selected by the Transfer Volunteer and Laborer Participant.
14.	This selection process will continue in service order until the employee cannot meet the conditions set forth in Paragraph 13.
15.	At the time a Laborer Participant is making his bumping selections the employee may, instead, elect to go on layoff status.
16.	An Excess Employee, Least Senior Employee, Transfer Volunteer, or Laborer Participant who elects to bump or transfer to a different job and/or station will have 45 days from the effective date of any job change or relocation (“Scat Date”) Scat Date to demonstrate his qualifications to fully perform in that position in a satisfactory manner or be placed on layoff status.
17.	An Excess Employee, Least Senior Employee, Transfer Volunteer, or Laborer Participant who is on extended disability under the terms of the Comprehensive Disability Plan, and is required to participate in the RIF, will go on layoff status if, at the time his election
28
form is reviewed, it is determined the employee will be unable to return to work at his selected job and/or location on the Scat Date and demonstrate his qualifications to fully perform that job in a satisfactory manner within 45 days.
18.	All job changes, relocations and layoffs normally will take place on the first day of the workweek following completion of the final round of the bumping process, with the entire process anticipated to be completed in less than 30 days.
