ARTICLE 1 ACCESS/UNION RIGHTS
A.	GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.	The parties acknowledge that it is in the union's interest that it be granted access to University facilities for the purposes of ascertaining whether the terms of this Agreement are being met; engaging in the investigation, preparation, and adjustment of grievances; conducting union meetings; explaining to bargaining unit members their rights and responsibilities under the Agreement; and informing CUE employees of union activities. In the interest of facilitating these purposes, and in accordance with local campus/Laboratory/hospital procedures, the parties agree to this Article.
2.	The University has the right to enforce reasonable access rules and regulations as promulgated at each campus/Laboratory/hospital.
B.	ACCESS BY THE UNION/UNION REPRESENTATIVES - GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.	Designated union representatives who are not University employees, or who are not employed at the facility visited, may visit the facility at reasonable times and upon notice to discuss with the University or bargaining unit members matters pertaining to this Agreement. In the case of visits for the purpose of conducting unscheduled meetings with bargaining unit members, the union representative shall give notice upon arrival in accordance with local campus/Laboratory/hospital procedures.
2.	CUE will furnish the University with a written list of all CUE representatives, CUE designated employee representatives and officers who are authorized by the union to conduct union business. This list shall be maintained in a timely manner by CUE and any changes, additions or deletions to the list must be made in writing to the University.
3.	Such internal union business as membership recruitment, campaigning for union office, handbilling or other distribution of literature, and all other union activities shall take place during non-work time. Employee rest and meal periods are non-work time for the purposes of this Article.
C.	EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES
1.	The University shall recognize CUE designated employee representatives who are members of the bargaining unit. The function of the CUE designated employee representative shall be to inform employees of their rights under this Agreement, to ascertain that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are being observed, and to investigate and assist in the processing of grievances.
2.	For the purposes of receiving paid release time as provided in this section, CUE may designate four University employees as CUE designated employee representatives at each campus/Laboratory/hospital. Additionally, in the event the campus/hospital/ laboratory has more than 200 employees, CUE may designate one additional CUE-designated employee representative for each additional 100 bargaining unit members thereafter, up to a maximum of thirty (30) CUE-designated employee representatives. CUE shall not designate more than one CUE designated employee representative per department unless the department has more than 200 employees in which case there can be up to 1 per 100 CX employees. The department CUE reps may not be from the same smaller unit (4 or less CX employees) of such a large department.
a.	The total cumulative use of paid release time for the CUE designated employee representative shall be limited to 10 hours in any one month. University convened meetings pursuant to Article 7 - Grievance Procedure, shall not be deducted from this block of time.
b.	The use of the maximum of 10 hours shall be for grievance-related activity such as:
1)	The initial hand-delivered filing of a grievance and the retrieval of University documents provided pursuant to a written request for information related to a grievance;
2)	One-on-one meetings with a grievant concerning a filed grievance, or an alleged violation of this Agreement which is at the Informal Review stage of Article 7 - Grievance Procedure;
- 130 -
3)	Meetings with the University representative to whom written grievances are presented or to whom documents related to filed grievance are presented/signed or with whom time limit agreements are achieved;
4)	Informal Review meetings held pursuant to §E. of Article 7 - Grievance Procedure.
c.	A request for release time will be made to the CUE designated employee representative's supervisor prior to the activity. Such approval shall be granted solely on the basis of operational needs and shall not be denied unreasonably.
d.	At its sole discretion, the University may authorize use of release time for more than 10 hours in a month per department. The exercise of this discretion and/or the enforcement by the University of the 10-hour maximum shall under no circumstances establish a precedent for the CUE designated employee representative or department involved nor shall the allowance of greater than 10 hours in a month for a CUE designated employee representative have any effect or bearing on the ability of the University to enforce the 10-hour maximum on any other CUE designated employee representative.
e.	Should a question of possible abuse of these release time provisions arise, the University will so notify CUE, and the parties will attempt to resolve the matter. If a question remains, the University may take corrective action when warranted.
D.	MEETING ROOMS AND BULLETIN BOARDS
1.	CUE shall be granted use of general purpose meeting rooms. Such use shall be arranged in advance with the designated campus/Laboratory/hospital office and will not be unreasonably denied. Room reservations shall not be canceled by the University except where unforeseen circumstances require the room to be used for purposes such as teaching, or patient care-related purposes or staff conferences. If a reserved room is canceled, the University will attempt to provide a comparable alternative.
2.	CUE shall have access to general-purpose bulletin boards and shall have the use of those bulletin boards. Any materials posted must be dated and initialed by the union representative responsible for the posting and a copy of all materials posted must be provided to the appropriate University representative at the location at the time of posting.

E.	MAIL DELIVERY
United States mail which is received by the University bearing an employee name and accurate address will be placed in the employee mailboxes in the normal manner. In departments where employee mailboxes exist, the union shall have reasonable use of them. In departments where individual mailboxes are in a restricted work area, CUE may make arrangements with the responsible University official in the restricted work area to have the CUE mail placed in the employee mailboxes. Where mailboxes do not exist for employees, the University will distribute CUE mail to employees by the normal method.
F.	EMPLOYEE LISTS
On a monthly basis, the University shall provide CUE with an alphabetized list by campus/Laboratory/hospital of all employees at each campus/Laboratory/hospital. This list will be in electronic format and will contain the following, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties: the name, title, campus mailing address, appointment type, last date of hire with continuous employment, pay rate, and department to which the employee is assigned. Home address will be provided unless the employee requests that the home address be withheld. The list will be provided by the File Transfer Program (FTP) unless otherwise designated and noticed to CUE by the University. The list will include the most accurate and complete information available to the University.
G.	PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION OF AGREEMENT
1.	A copy of this Agreement shall be given by the University to each employee in the Bargaining Unit. The University and CUE shall split the cost of printing contracts for unit members.

Upon receipt of full payment from CUE, each location shall distribute the agreement to members of the unit within 90 calendar days.
H.	TELEPHONE
Employee representatives may use University telephones for the purpose of conducting union business which is specifically authorized by Article 7 - Grievance Procedure. Employees are responsible for paying any costs associated with such telephone usage in accordance with the departmental procedures in effect at the time. The frequency and duration of permitted phone calls shall not be such as to interfere with or disrupt the employee’s completion of work assignments, nor impair the efficiency of University operations. The University may audit employee representatives’ use of the telephone system to the same extent as it may audit other employee’s use of such equipment.
I.	E-MAIL USE
CUE designated employee representatives may use their University e-mail account for the purpose of conducting union business which is specifically authorized by Article 7 - Grievance Procedure. Such use shall also conform to and be in accordance with applicable University policy regarding electronic mail/electronic communications.
J.	NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATIONS
1.	The University shall notify CUE in advance of scheduled new employee orientations, if any, upon request of the local CUE representative.
2.	At the University’s new employee orientation, if any, packets of information supplied by CUE shall be made available.

5.	The University and CUE agree to meet and discuss over arrangements to accomplish the goals of this section.
K.	LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR UNION BUSINESS
1.	General Conditions
a.	Long Term Leave Of Absence Without Pay

The union/employee shall specify the duration of the extended leave of absence at the time the employee requests the leave. No such leave shall be granted unless the written request specifies the duration of the leave.
2)	Long-term leaves of absence shall be for a period of not less than one (1) year. In no situations shall the University grant a long-term leave of absence for a period of more than three (3) years.
- 3 -

The employee may purchase benefits in accordance with plan regulations.
4)	The University, due to operational requirements, may postpone the date a long-term leave of absence without pay is scheduled to begin.
b.	Short Term Leave
1)	Subject to operational considerations, upon at least thirty (30) calendar days written request from CUE and the employee, the University will grant a short-term or part time leaves of absence without pay for union business to one (1) employee or one FTE equivalent per hospital/campus/Laboratory (one rep per campus/hospital location) per calendar year.

b.	Upon return, the employee shall be placed in the same position from which s/he took the leave of absence and at the rate of pay which would place the employee at the same relative position in the range for the position as that range exists when the employee returns. Placement of the employee in her/his previous position shall be consistent with staffing reductions and/or layoffs, which may have occurred during the period of the leave of absence without pay.

The granting of such approval to local employee representatives and officers shall be subject to the operational needs of the University and may be granted to one (1) or more but not necessarily all such employees on the same shift in the same operational area. Such approval shall not be unreasonably denied.
L.	RELEASED TIME FOR BARGAINING
1.	The University will provide release time for not more than one (1) active status University Clerical Unit employee per campus (including LBNL), for a total of eleven (11) bargaining team members from the Clerical Unit. CUE is expected to designate in writing permanent and alternate team members who are members of the bargaining unit and in active employment status at least 30 calendar days prior to the first bargaining session.
Nothing in this section shall preclude CUE’s appointment of a permanent bargaining team member during the course of negotiations from a location where a permanent team member had not been selected previously.

3.	Such released time in without-loss-of-straight-time-pay status shall be provided only for scheduled negotiation sessions and only for days on which the team member would have been scheduled to work. Such hours shall not exceed the bargaining team member’s actual scheduled work hours for any one day of a scheduled bargaining session, not to exceed 40 hours per week. Such released time shall not count in the calculation of overtime or other ancillary pay/premiums.
4.	Bargaining sessions are defined as scheduled face-to-face meetings and related caucuses during meeting days for the purpose of negotiating wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. The travel time included in the released time without loss of straight-time pay status is the reasonable amount of time for direct travel to and from the bargaining team member’s place of employment.
5.	It is expected that employee bargaining team members shall provide their supervisors with written notice of all bargaining sessions as soon as practicable following the scheduling of bargaining sessions. A bargaining team member may be denied released time for bargaining, either in paid or unpaid status, if written notice is not provided at least 14 calendar days prior to the scheduled bargaining, unless the parties agree otherwise. In the event a bargaining session is scheduled with less than 14 calendar days advance notice, the University will ensure released time for primary and /or permanent alternate members of CUE’s bargaining team is granted.
ARTICLE 2 AGREEMENT
A.	This Agreement is made and entered into on May 12, 2003 at Oakland, California, pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1 through 11 of the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA) by and between The Regents of the University of California, a corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "University" or "management" or "employer") represented by the Office of the President of the University of California system, and the Coalition of University Employees (hereinafter referred to as “CUE” or “Union”).
B.	PURPOSE OF AGREEMENT
1.	It is the intent and purpose of the parties hereto that this Agreement constitutes an implementation of the provisions of HEERA and provides for orderly and constructive employment relations in the public interest, in the interests of the University, and the interests of the employees represented by CUE.
2.	The parties hereby acknowledge that this Agreement represents an amicable understanding reached by the parties as a result of the unlimited right and opportunity of the parties to make any and all demands with respect to the employer-employee relationship which exists between them relative to the scope of bargaining.
3.	This Agreement recognizes one certified bargaining unit. Each provision of this Agreement applies to that bargaining unit unless specified otherwise.
C.	RECOGNITION
1.	Pursuant to and in conformity with the certifications issued by the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) of the State of California in case number SF-HR-12, the University recognizes CUE as the sole and exclusive representative for the purposes of collective bargaining with respect to wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment for all employees, excluding employees designated as managerial, supervisory and/or confidential by the University as of November 21, 1997 and all student employees whose employment is contingent upon their status as students, in the following described bargaining unit:
a. Unit #12 - Clerical and Allied Services (SF-HR-12)
2.	The term "employee" as used in this Agreement shall refer to employees of the University of California including the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory ("Laboratory") in the above-mentioned unit except for those excluded pursuant to C.1. above.
3.	The classes and title codes included in Unit 12 are listed in Appendices A and B.
D.	WAIVER OF UNIT MODIFICATION AND RECLASSIFICATION OF EXCLUDED POSITIONS
- 5 -
The job titles and positions excluded from the unit by the parties' stipulations of July 22, 1997 and by PERB's Consent Election Order of May 20, 1997 shall be conclusively deemed to be managerial, supervisory, or confidential, or any indicated combination thereof, as shown on the list appended to said stipulation, and CUE expressly waives for the duration of this Agreement any right it may have to seek to include any such title or stipulation by unit modification. CUE recognizes that the University has the exclusive right to establish new title codes and titles for any such excluded position or title. The University shall advise CUE of any such new title. In the event the University elects not to establish a new title for some or all excluded positions currently classified in included titles, the University shall, during the term of this Agreement, provide the Union with a list, by bargaining unit and by campus/hospital/Laboratory location, of the excluded positions which remain within included titles and the incumbents at that time, if any. The failure to include an excluded position on any such list shall not be evidence that the position should be included in any unit.
E.	RECLASSIFICATION FROM UNIT TO NON-UNIT POSITIONS
In the event the University determines that a position or title should be reclassified or designated for exclusion from the unit, or the University intends to replace a major portion of a bargaining unit position with a position in a classification outside of the unit, the University shall notify CUE in writing at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the proposed implementation. If CUE determines to challenge the University’s proposed action, it shall notify the University in writing within thirty (30) calendar days from the date on which the University’s notice was mailed, and the proposed effective date will be extended by thirty (30) calendar days. During such an extension, the parties will meet and discuss the University’s proposed action. If the parties are unable to reach agreement regarding the University’s proposed action, the University may commence, PERB unit modification procedures, as outlined under PERB regulations.
Until the bargaining unit assignment is either agreed to by the parties or finally resolved through the PERB unit modification procedures, (1) the affected position(s) or title(s) shall remain in the unit and shall remain covered by all provisions of this agreement, (2) the University may, in compliance with Article 45 - Wages, Section D, Other Increases, of this Agreement, increase compensation for the affected position(s) or title(s), and (3) the duties associated with the proposed reclassification may be assigned to the affected employee(s).
F.	NEW CLASSES
1.	When the University creates a new class and title within the occupational subgroups (OSG) included in the bargaining unit, the University shall mail a notice to the Union of the bargaining unit assignment, if any, of such class at least 60 calendar days before the proposed date of implementation. The notice to the Union shall include a statement or reason(s) for the creation of the new class. The Union shall have 45 calendar days from the date of such notice to contest the University's assignment. If the Union contests the assignment, the University and the Union shall meet and confer in an effort to reach agreement on the bargaining unit assignment for the class. If the parties are unable to reach agreement, the dispute shall be submitted to PERB pursuant to Regulation 32781(a)(2) for resolution. If the Union does not contest the bargaining unit assignment within the 45 calendar day notice period, the unit assignment of the new class shall be deemed agreeable to the parties and PERB shall be so advised. Bargaining unit assignments made by the University which are contested by the Union shall remain as originally assigned by the University until such time as the parties are in mutual agreement as to a different assignment or, if such assignment is referred to PERB within the appeal period stated above, until resolution of the matter by the PERB process.
2.	If the inclusion of a new class within the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement is agreed to by the parties or found appropriate by PERB, the University shall assign a pay rate to the class.
3.	Assignment by the University of the pay rate to a new class as indicated above shall be consistent with the existing compensation and classification methodologies utilized by the University at the time of the assignment.
4.	If the new classification is in the bargaining unit in accordance with the provisions of Section F.1-3 above, the University shall notify CUE of the proposed range and ancillary pay practice to be implemented.
- 6 -
If CUE notifies UC within 15 days of receipt of the notice it wishes to bargain the change(s), the parties shall meet and confer regarding the salary range and ancillary pay practices for the classification. Meet and confer shall commence no later than 30 calendar days following the Union’s request, unless the parties agree otherwise.
G.	ABOLITION OF CLASSES
The University will provide CUE with 60 calendar days notice of its intent to abolish a classification. The notice to the Union shall include a statement of the reason(s) for the abolition. Upon written request from CUE, the parties will meet and confer over the effects at least 30 days before the intended date of implementation unless the parties agree otherwise. The University shall not abolish the class unless the parties have reached agreement through the meet and confer process over effects of the decision, or conclusion of the impasse process.
ARTICLE 3
ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
A.	GENERAL CONDITIONS
1.	An appeal to arbitration may be made only by the union and only after the timely exhaustion of Article 7 - Grievance Procedure. The appeal to arbitration must be signed by the President of CUE, or designee, and filed with the Office of Labor Relations, Office of the President.
a.	When hand delivered, proof of service must accompany the appeal to arbitration. The date of receipt will be used to determine the date of the appeal for hand-delivered appeals.
b.	When mailed, the appeal must arrive in an envelope with a U.S. Postal Service Postmark. The U.S. Postal Service Postmark will be used to determine the date of the appeal for mailed appeals.
2.	For the purposes of this Article, time limits are calculated in calendar days, unless otherwise stated and deadlines which fall on a day which is not a location business day will automatically be extended to the next business day. All time limits may be extended by written agreement of the parties in advance of the expiration of the time limit. The union's failure to meet any time limit, or extension to a time limit, will render the Appeal to Arbitration ineligible for further processing and the University’s preceding written answer will be considered final.
3.	If the appeal to arbitration is withdrawn, the last preceding University written response will be considered final.
4.	The decision of the arbitrator on any issue properly before him or her shall be final and binding.
5.	An appeal to arbitration shall not prohibit efforts by the University and CUE to resolve the grievance during the time the appeal is pending and until such time that an arbitrator has rendered his or her decision.
6.	CUE shall have full authority to settle, withdraw or otherwise dispose of any grievance brought on behalf of the union and/or on the behalf of employees. An agreement by the parties to settle, withdraw, or otherwise dispose of a grievance appealed to arbitration shall be binding upon the grievant(s).
7.	Where two or more grievances are appealed to arbitration, all grievances by or related to the same employee(s), or grievances which relate to the same incident, issue or course of action, may be consolidated by agreement of the parties.
8.	An appeal of an expedited grievance to arbitration may be made only by CUE in accordance with this section. Requests for arbitration under the expedited grievance, §F.2.e. of Article 7 - Grievance Procedure must include a copy of the completed grievance form.
9.	Time Limits
a.	Initial filing - An appeal to arbitration must be filed within 30 calendar days of the issuance of the University's Step 3 decision to the union or Step 2 decision in the case of an expedited grievance appealed to arbitration.
- 7 -
b.	University Acknowledgment of Receipt - Within 15 calendar days of the postmark or, in the case of hand delivery the date of receipt of the union's appeal to arbitration, the University shall mail to the union an acknowledgment of the receipt of the appeal and the identity of the location to which all relevant correspondence should be directed.
c.	Selecting the Arbitrator and Scheduling the Hearing Date
1)	Within 45 calendar days from the date the grievance was originally appealed to arbitration, CUE shall contact the University to select an arbitrator according to Section C of this Article. The scheduling of the arbitration hearing date must be accomplished no later than 90 calendar days from the date the grievance was originally appealed to arbitration, except as provided below in c.3). Should the parties be unable to agree to a hearing date, the authority to schedule the hearing rests with the arbitrator. The parties may extend the 90-day limit for scheduling the arbitration by mutual written agreement in advance of the expiration of the time limit.
2)	In such cases the arbitrator shall be provided with a copy of the written agreement. Failure to select the arbitrator and schedule the hearing according to this section will render the grievance ineligible for arbitration and the last preceding University written answer shall become final.
3)	If CUE initiates the selection process in writing to the University with a preferred arbitrator from the arbitration panel and there is no written University response by the deadline for selection of the arbitrator (45 days from CUE’s appeal to arbitration), then the CUE choice shall be final unless CUE initiates the selection process within 15 business days of the deadline for selection of the arbitrator. In such case, the University shall have 15 business days to respond to CUE’s choice of an arbitrator and the period for scheduling the arbitration hearing shall be extended by 10 business days.
d.	Should the Union make a request that the grievance which has been appealed to arbitration be placed in abeyance for any reason, the period of abeyance shall not exceed 90 days. The Union further agrees that grievances placed in abeyance shall have the time limits tolled during this period. Failure by the Union to reactivate the grievance within the 90-day limit following request that it be held in abeyance will render the grievance ineligible for arbitration and the last preceding University written answer shall become final. If CUE requests selection of the arbitrator, it shall be according to the arbitration selection process in this section, including A.9.c.
B.	EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION
Union representation at the arbitration hearing may consist of two representatives, with only one representative eligible for without-loss-of-straight-time-pay status. Released time shall not be unreasonably denied. If a second representative requests released time for the hearing, it shall not be unreasonably denied and it shall be without pay. Only one representative may be designated as the employee advocate for the course of the hearing.
C.	SELECTION OF ARBITRATOR
Within 45 calendar days of the date of the appeal to arbitration, the arbitrator shall be selected using the following procedures:
1.	Until a permanent panel is selected by the parties, on a case-by-case basis, the parties may agree to the selection of any qualified and available person to serve as an arbitrator. Absent such agreement, the parties may agree to the selection of an arbitrator from a list provided by the American Arbitration Association.
2.	Once the permanent panel is in place, the parties may mutually agree to an arbitrator. In the event the parties cannot agree to an arbitrator, the parties shall then alternately strike one name each from the 15 names. The first strike will be determined by a flip of a coin, and the last name remaining shall be the arbitrator.
3.	If both parties disagree with the arbitrator who has been selected, the process shall be repeated once in its entirety.
4.	A separate arbitrator shall be selected for each grievance appealed to arbitration, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing.
- 8 -
5.	Except as provided in Section A.9.c.3) of this Article, the parties may agree in writing to extend the 45-day limit for selecting the arbitrator. Failure to select the arbitrator within 45 calendar days, or to mutually agree to a written extension of the time period, will render the appeal to arbitration ineligible for further processing and the University's preceding written answer will be considered final.
D.	SCOPE OF ARBITRATION
1.	Unless there is an agreement by both parties to modify the scope of the hearing, the issue(s) to be heard by the arbitrator shall solely and in its entirety be restricted to the issue(s) stated by Step 3. Issues or allegations which were known or should have been known to either party but not introduced by the Step 3 process shall not be introduced by either party at the arbitration hearing, except as provided in Section D.2., below.
2.	When practicable, the University shall inform CUE in writing of its intent to assert the issue of arbitrability prior to the selection of the arbitrator in its Acknowledgment of Receipt, according to A.9.b.above. The issue(s) of arbitrability shall be resolved in a hearing prior to and separate from the hearing (if any) about the substantive facts and/or allegations in dispute, except as provided in Section D.3., below. In such a case, the parties shall use the selection process described in Sections A.9 and C above to select two arbitrators. The first arbitrator will be selected to hear the issues of arbitrability and the second arbitrator will be selected to decide the merits of the case if the issues are determined to be arbitrable. Unless either party requests a full and complete arbitration proceeding on the arbitrability issue, the first arbitrator shall issue either a bench decision, or upon either party’s request, a written decision within 7 calendar days of the completion of the arbitrability hearing. In the event that the first arbitrator, as a result of the arbitrability hearing referenced above determines a matter to be arbitrable, the first arbitrator shall have no authority to decide the issues pursuant to the merits of the case. A hearing on the merits of the case will be scheduled with the second arbitrator, unless the parties agree otherwise.
3.	If, following the issuance of the University Acknowledgement of the appeal, the University raises for the first time issue(s) of arbitrability, a single hearing on the issue of arbitrability and the substantive facts will be held, unless the parties agree otherwise. If the arbitrator finds the grievance ineligible for arbitration, the substantive facts of the case need not be heard and the grievance shall be denied. If the arbitrator finds in favor of arbitrability, the hearing shall proceed to the substantive issues raised.
4.	Section D.1. and Section D.2. above, shall not prevent the parties from agreeing in writing to combine the arbitrability hearing with the hearing on the merits of the case or from agreeing to separate hearings on arbitrability and the merits of the case before a single arbitrator.
E.	ARBITRATION PROCEEDING
1.	The parties will attempt to agree on a location for the arbitration hearing.
2.	The arbitration hearing shall be closed to anyone other than the participants in the arbitration hearing, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing.
3.	The arbitration hearing shall provide an opportunity for CUE and the University to examine and cross-examine witnesses under oath or affirmation, and to submit relevant evidence.
4.	Settlement offers made any time during the Grievance and/or Arbitration Procedures shall not be introduced as evidence in the arbitration hearing.
5.	Either or both parties may, at their discretion, file briefs with the arbitrator. The order and time limits of briefing shall, on a case-by-case basis, be as agreed upon by the parties or as specified by the arbitrator. Briefing time limits shall be extended by the Arbitrator upon the agreement of both parties.
6.	The arbitrator shall consider the evidence presented and render a written decision within 30 calendar days of the close of the record of the hearing.
7.	In all cases appealed to arbitration pursuant to the terms of this Article and this Agreement, CUE has the burden of initiating the steps in the procedure.
- 9 -
With the exception of those cases in which the issue is that of actions taken by the University pursuant to Article 5 - Corrective Action/Discipline and Dismissal, CUE shall have the burden of proof. The burden of proof in cases in which the issue is that of actions taken by the University pursuant to Article 5 - Corrective Action/Discipline and Dismissal, shall be the University's.
8.	Prior to the hearing, the parties shall endeavor to exchange the names of all known witnesses and relevant materials to be introduced at the hearing.
F.	AUTHORITY OF THE ARBITRATOR
1.	The arbitrator's authority shall be limited to determining whether the University has violated the provision(s) of this Agreement as set forth in the Union’s Step 3 appeal or Step 2 appeal if expedited. If such a violation is found, the arbitrator shall specify the remedy in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
2.	The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, amend, modify, nullify or ignore in any way the provisions of this Agreement and shall not make any award that would, in effect, grant CUE or the employee(s) any terms which were not obtained in the negotiation process.
3.	The arbitrator shall have the authority to subpoena documents and to require the attendance of witnesses upon the reasonable request of either party but not upon his or her own motion.
4.	The expense of service and appearance fees, if any, shall be borne entirely by the party requesting the subpoena of witnesses and each party shall, in advance of the hearing date, inform the other party of the identity of witnesses it subpoenaed.
5.	The arbitrator shall be the sole judge of the relevancy and materiality of the evidence and testimony offered. The arbitrator may receive and consider evidence but shall give appropriate weight to any objections made. All documents to be considered by the arbitrator shall be filed at the hearing, or within the post-hearing time lines agreed to by the parties during the hearing.
G.	ARBITRATION REMEDIES
1.	No remedy by an arbitrator shall be made retroactive to a date earlier than 30 calendar days prior to the filing of the Step 1 grievance, except for the correction of an error in implementation in payment of wages or the correction of mathematical, calculation, recording or accounting errors relating to the payment of wages. For grievances involving the correction of an error in implementation of payment of wages or the correction of mathematical, calculation, recording or accounting errors relating to the payment of wages, an award of an arbitrator shall not in any case be made retroactive to a date earlier than three years prior to the initiation of the written grievance in Step 1 of the Grievance Procedure. Additionally, no remedy shall be provided for any period of time during the grievance and/or arbitration procedure for which an extension of time limits has been granted at the request of CUE or any time an employee was on strike.
2.	In any decision of a grievance appealed to arbitration involving retroactive payments, the appropriate University and CUE representatives shall expeditiously determine the identity of the payees and the specific amount owed each payee. Such amount of payment shall be final and no employee or group of employees may subsequently grieve the amounts owed.
3.	Remedies involving monetary payment and/or benefits shall be limited in their calculation to the utilization of the employee's actual and appropriate wage or benefit amount at the time of the violation and shall not include the awarding of interest or any other payment/credit unrelated to a University benefit amount or the employee's hourly wage.
4.	Upon the motion of either party, or at his or her own discretion, an arbitrator may retain jurisdiction in cases involving an award of retroactive monetary payment (and/or benefits).
5.	If the grievance is sustained in whole or in part, the remedy shall not exceed restoring to the employee the pay, benefits or rights lost less any compensation from any source, including but not limited to Workers' Compensation, Unemployment Compensation or other employment.
H.	COST OF ARBITRATION
- 10 -
1.	The cost of the arbitrator’s fees and expenses of the hearing will be shared equally by the University and CUE. If either party requests that a stenographic record of the hearing be made and/or transcripts of the stenographic record or a taped record be provided, the parties shall equally share the entire cost of such service and the cost of the provision of a transcript to each party and the arbitrator.
2.	In the event either party requests the cancellation or postponement of a scheduled arbitration proceeding which causes an arbitrator to impose a cancellation or postponement fee, the party requesting such cancellation or postponement shall bear the full cost of the cancellation/postponement fee.

3.	Total release time for the grievant, employee representative and witness(es) for travel to/from the hearing and for participation in the hearing shall not exceed either their normally scheduled hours of work for the day(s) of the hearing or their actual participation in the hearing.

J.	EXPEDITED ARBITRATION
The parties may agree to use an expedited form of arbitration to be agreed to by the parties and the arbitrator. Expedited arbitrations may be used in discipline cases involving suspensions of five (5) days or less, written warnings, minor pay claims or in any other case the parties stipulate to do so, provided it is by mutual agreement in advance of the scheduling of the arbitration.
K.	ARBITRATION PANEL
1.	The parties will make an attempt to agree on the panel of 30 arbitrators, with 15 on a Northern Panel and 15 on a Southern Panel. Nothing shall preclude the parties from including an arbitrator on both the northern and southern lists. If agreement cannot be reached on the names of the arbitrators on each list, the remaining number of arbitrators needed to complete a panel will be selected alternately by the parties. The party selecting first shall be determined by a flip of a coin.
2.	After one year from the date the panel members were initially selected, and annually thereafter, each party shall have the right to eliminate up to one arbitrator from the panel. A party exercising this right shall notify the other party in writing of the name of the arbitrator to be stricken from the panel.

- 11 -
4.	In the event one vacancy in the panel of arbitrators occurs, other than the elimination of an Arbitrator by the parties pursuant to Section K.2. above, such vacancy may be filled by the parties within 30 calendar days, using the procedures in Section K.1. above, if the parties agree that a replacement is necessary. In the event more than one vacancy in the panel of arbitrators occurs, such vacancy shall be filled by the parties within 30 calendar days by using the procedures in Section K.1. above, unless both parties agree that no replacement is necessary prior to the annual panel review.
5.	The northern list of arbitrators shall be used for arbitrations arising at the Davis, the Office of the President, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, San Francisco, and Santa Cruz locations, unless the parties agree to use an arbitrator from the southern panel.
The southern list of arbitrators shall be used for arbitrations arising at the Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Merced, Irvine, Riverside, and San Diego locations, unless the parties agree to use an arbitrator from the northern panel.

3)	For the initial filing of a grievance, the date filed shall be the date received. However, if the grievance is mailed, the date of the US Postal Service postmark shall be considered the date filed. For grievance appeals and responses, the date of issuance shall be the date hand-delivered, or the date of the US Postal Service postmark, if mailed, provided the address used is the non-work address on the grievance form. The date of hand delivery shall be the date of the stamp or handwritten acknowledgement of receipt as noted by the Labor Relations office. The University shall acknowledge receipt by dating the form, and providing a copy of the dated form to the grievant or his/her representative.

- 15 -
C.	TIME LIMITS
1.	Other than the time limits for the initial Step 1 filing of a grievance, the time limits as specified in this Article may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. Extensions must be in writing and must be signed by the parties in advance. The parties may mutually agree to skip any steps of the grievance procedure. Such an agreement must be in writing and must be signed by the parties.

4.	If the University has not responded by the designated time limit in this Article, the grievance will be advanced to the next step in the grievance process if it is confirmed by CUE in writing by the deadline date for appeal to that step. If CUE does not confirm the advance to the next step, the grievance shall be considered withdrawn and ineligible for further processing.
D.	GRIEVANTS WHO HAVE RESIGNED
Grievants who voluntarily resign their employment with the University, unless they retire, shall have their pending grievances immediately withdrawn and will not benefit by any subsequent settlement or disposition of any individual, union, or group grievance.

E.	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE - INFORMAL REVIEW
Before commencing the formal grievance procedure, an individual employee, or group of employees, with or without their representative, may first attempt to resolve the alleged grievance informally. When an employee or representative requests such a meeting, an Informal Review meeting shall be held with the immediate supervisor within 15 calendar days of the request. Informal resolution of grievances at the lowest possible level is an objective shared by the University and CUE. Informal attempts of settlement to resolve the grievance shall not extend time limits including the initial 30-day filing deadline.
F.	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE - FORMAL REVIEW
1.	Step 1
a.	All grievances (individual, group, or union) must be filed either by U.S. mail or hand delivery, and received by the Labor Relations Office at the campus/hospital/Laboratory which employs the grievant(s) within 30 calendar days after the date on which the employee or CUE knew or could be expected to know of the event or action giving rise to the grievance. If hand delivered after business hours, the date of receipt shall be the next business day.
b.	Grievances received after the filing deadline will be processed solely for the purposes of determining whether the grievance was untimely.
c.	Resolution of grievances at the lowest possible level is an objective shared by the University and CUE. If no Informal Review meeting took place, and either party requests it, there shall be a meeting held at Step 1 that includes the supervisor and the grievant.
d.	University Review:
The University's written response will be issued to the grievant and the representative, if any, within 15 calendar days after the meeting is held or, if no meeting is held, 15 days after the formal grievance is filed.

- 16 -
e.	Sexual Harassment Complaint Resolution Procedures:
1)	An employee alleging sexual harassment may elect to substitute a campus/hospital/laboratory Sexual Harassment Complaint Resolution Procedure for Step 1 of the Grievance Procedure.

An employee who elects to resume the regular grievance procedure in place of the Sexual Harassment Complaint Resolution Procedure shall do so by sending written notice to the University. The University's Step 1 Grievance response will be issued within 15 calendar days after the notice is received by the designated University official.
2)	Grievances that allege a violation involving sexual harassment may, at the grievant’s option, enter the grievance procedure at Step 2.
2.	Step 2
a.	If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the grievant or the Union may proceed to Step 2 by filing a written appeal with the Labor Relations Office within 15 calendar days of the date the written response is issued.
b.	Unless the parties agree otherwise, the designated University local official shall convene a meeting with the grievant(s) and the grievant's representative, if any, to attempt to resolve the grievance. The meeting shall be convened no later than 15 calendar days following receipt of the appeal to Step 2. During the Step 2 meeting, the parties shall discuss information and contentions relative to the grievance.
c.	During the Step 2 process, the parties may agree in writing to amend the alleged violations stated in the original grievance.
d.	If requested by the grievant, a second CUE representative may participate in the Step 2 meeting. In the event a second CUE representative attends, only one representative may actively participate in the grievance meeting, and the University shall pay release time for only one representative.
e.	If a grievance that alleges a violation of Article 5 - Corrective Action/Discipline and Dismissal only is not satisfactorily resolved at Step 2, CUE may appeal directly to arbitration in accordance with Article 3 - Arbitration Procedure.
f.	A written decision shall be issued within 15 calendar days following the Step 2 meeting, or receipt of the Step 2 appeal if it is agreed that no meeting will be held. If the University does not respond within the time limit, the procedures in C.4 will apply.
g.	A grievance appealed by the Union to the next step in the Grievance Procedure upon expiration of the time limits within which the University was to conduct a meeting and/or provide an answer shall not be remanded to the parties for completion of the meeting/provision of answer process unless there is mutual agreement of the parties to so remand.
3.	Step 3
a.	All grievances that are not satisfactorily resolved at Step 2 may be appealed to Step 3. The appeal must be filed with the Director of Labor Relations in the Office of the President within 15 calendar days of the date the University’s Step 2 written answer was issued. If the University has not issued its written decision to the Step 2 appeal by the deadline, the grievance shall be advanced to Step 3 if it is confirmed by CUE in writing by the deadline to appeal to Step 3. If CUE does not confirm the advance to the next step, the grievance shall be considered withdrawn and ineligible for further processing.
b.	The Step 3 appeal shall identify all unresolved issues, alleged violations proposed remedies and shall be signed and dated by the grievant(s) or their representative. The subject of the grievance as stated at Step 2 shall constitute the sole and entire subject matter of the appeal to Step 3.
- 17 -
c.	The Director of Labor Relations or designee shall issue the University's written answer to a Step 3 appeal within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the appeal. The answer will be issued to the grievant when self-represented, or to the employee’s representative.
G.	UNION GRIEVANCES
CUE shall have the right to present grievances under this procedure on behalf of an individual employee, on behalf of a group of employees, or on behalf of itself. It shall be the Union’s responsibility to inform an employee that it is bringing a grievance.
H.	GROUP GRIEVANCE
A group grievance is defined as a grievance that covers more than one employee, and that involves like circumstances and facts. A group grievance must be so identified on the grievance form at Step 1.
If an employee wishes to withdraw from a group grievance represented by CUE, the employee shall notify CUE. CUE shall in turn notify the University in writing if the employee is to be withdrawn.
I.	CONSOLIDATION OF GRIEVANCES
Grievances of two or more employees, as well as multiple grievances by or related to the same employee, or which relate to the same incident, issue, alleged violation, facts, or course of conduct, may be consolidated. Consolidation or severance of grievances shall occur by mutual, written agreement of the parties.
J.	OFFERS OF SETTLEMENT
Settlement offers made during attempts at informal resolution or during the steps of the Grievance Procedure shall not be introduced as evidence in subsequent steps of the Procedure.
K.	RETROACTIVITY
Settlement of grievances may or may not be retroactive as equities of a particular case may demand. In any case where it is determined that the settlement shall be applied retroactively, except for the correction of an error in implementation in payment of wages, or the correction of mathematical, calculation, recording or accounting errors relating to the payment of wages, the maximum period of retroactivity allowed shall not in any case be made retroactive to a date earlier than 30 calendar days prior to the initiation of the written grievance in Step 1.

ARTICLE 13
LAYOFF AND REDUCTION IN TIME
A.	DETERMINATION
The University shall determine when temporary or indefinite layoffs or reductions in time are necessary. This determination is non-grievable and non-arbitrable.
B.	DEFINITIONS
1.	A layoff is an involuntary separation from employment or an involuntary transfer to a limited appointment of a career employee. For the purposes of this Article, layoff shall include involuntary reductions in regularly scheduled hours of work. Layoffs may be temporary or indefinite.
2.	A temporary layoff is a layoff in which the University specifies a date for return to work of not more than four months.
3.	An indefinite layoff is a layoff for which no date for return to work is specified, or no date of restoration to the former appointment rate is specified.
4.	For the purposes of this Article, seniority shall be calculated by full-time-equivalent months (or hours) of University service. Employment prior to a break in service shall not be counted. When employees have the same number of full-time-equivalent months (or hours), the employee with the most recent date of appointment is the "junior" employee.
C.	SELECTION FOR LAYOFF
1.	If, in the judgment of the University, budgetary or operational considerations make it necessary to curtail operations, reorganize, reduce the hours of the workforce and/or reduce the workforce, staffing levels will be reduced in accordance with this Article. The selection of classes for layoff shall be at the determination of the University.
2.	With regard to indefinite layoff only, the order of indefinite layoff of employees in the same class within a layoff unit shall be in inverse order of seniority except that:
a.	The University may retain, at its discretion, employees irrespective of seniority who possess special skills, knowledge or abilities which are not possessed by other employees in the same class, which cannot be learned in less than 6 months, and which are necessary to perform the ongoing functions of the department/division.
b.	Regardless of seniority, the department may elect to invite all clerical unit employees in the same class within a layoff unit to volunteer for layoff. In that case, the union shall be notified of the invitation at the same time the invitation is transmitted to employees. The union shall also be informed of the identities of volunteers before the layoff occurs.
c.	Upon notification to the more senior employee of reassignment to the least senior employee’s position (or equivalent) he/she will be provided a copy of the job description, if the employee’s duties will change. The employee may request to be laid off out of inverse seniority order. The University shall not solicit volunteers to be laid off out of seniority order. If the University proposes to grant the request, it shall provide notice to CUE. The University will not approve waivers of seniority rights without CUE’s agreement. CUE and the University must agree to the waiver no later than 15 (fifteen) calendar days after the notice to CUE. Upon agreement the University shall provide 45 (forty-five) calendar days notice to the employee, if feasible. In no case will the employee receive less than 30 (thirty) calendar days notice, or pay in lieu of notice.
3.	The department head shall select employees for layoff, but shall minimize indefinite layoffs from career positions by first reviewing the necessity for existing limited appointment and casual/restricted positions within the department.
- 30 -
D.
NOTICE
1.	When the University determines that a layoff is imminent within the unit, it shall give CUE notice at the same time it notifies employees that they are to be laid off. The notice shall describe the general areas which may be affected and describe the reasons for the layoff.
2.	When the University selects particular members of the unit for layoff, it shall give individual notice to each employee of the effective date of the layoff and whether the layoff is temporary or indefinite. Except in cases of emergencies (including, but not limited to natural disasters and acts of war), advance notice of a layoff will be provided as follows:
a.	For temporary layoff expected to last 120 calendar days or less, the University shall give 15 calendar days notice of the expected beginning and ending dates of the layoff.
b.	For indefinite layoff, the University shall give 60 calendar days notice, if feasible. The University may pay up to 30 days of the 60-day notice period in lieu of notice. In no event shall an employee receive less than 30 days notice of indefinite layoff. For conversion from temporary layoff to indefinite layoff, the University shall give 30 calendar days notice.
c.	In the event of an anticipated indefinite layoff of five or more full-time equivalent (FTE) employees on the same effective date in the same layoff unit, the University will give 45 calendar days notice to CUE. When such notice is provided regarding the layoff of five or more FTE, the campus/hospital/Laboratory will, upon receipt of a timely written request from CUE, meet with CUE to discuss the layoff. During the meeting the parties may discuss alternatives to layoff.
3.	The University shall notify CUE at the same time it notifies employees that they are to be laid off.
4.	When the University determines that there is to be a change in a layoff unit within the bargaining unit, it shall give CUE advance notice of at least 30 days and upon request shall meet and discuss such proposed changes. Changes to a layoff unit shall not occur more frequently than each 120-calendar days.
E.	PREFERENTIAL REHIRE
1.	A non-probationary career employee who is indefinitely laid off shall have preferential rehire status for an active vacant career position. An active career position is a position which the University, in its sole discretion, determines to fill. First consideration for preferential rehire shall be given to employees who are on layoff status (not currently employed by the University) and who were laid off from the same department where the vacant position exists. In order to be placed in such a position, the employee must, as determined at the sole, non-grievable discretion of the University, be fully qualified to perform the duties of the position. Such employees are rehired provided:
a.	The active, vacant career position is in the same bargaining unit and at the same campus/hospital/Laboratory as the position from which the employee was laid off; and
b.	The active, vacant career position is in a class with the same or lower salary range maximum as the class from which the employee was laid off; and
c.	The active, vacant career position is at the same or lesser percentage of time as the position from which the employee was laid off.
2.	Employees who are eligible for preferential rehire status with less than five years of seniority at the time the layoff occurs shall retain preferential rehire status eligibility for one year.
Employees who are eligible for preferential rehire status with five years, but less than 10 years seniority at the time the layoff occurs shall retain preferential rehire status eligibility for two years. Employees who are eligible for preferential rehire status with 10 years or more seniority shall retain preferential rehire status eligibility for three years.
3.	An employee may exercise his or her rights to preferential rehire immediately after the employee receives written notification of layoff and meets with the campus
- 31 -
representative designated in the layoff notice. An employee who exercises preferential rehire rights and is not selected for the position will, upon request, be informed in writing of the reasons for the non-selection.
4.	Employees preferentially rehired from layoff status who fail to perform satisfactorily may, at any time during the six months following such return, be returned to layoff status with restoration of full preferential rehire status. In addition, an employee, at his or her option, may request to be returned to layoff status within 60 calendar days of rehire. The time on job status will not be counted as part of preferential rehire eligibility time.
5.	Preferential Rehire Termination
The preferential consideration described above shall terminate at the end of the period of eligibility described in §E.2. above, or if an employee:
a.	Refuses an offer to return, at the same or greater percentage of time, to that department/division and class from which laid off; or
b.	Accepts any career position; or
c.	Refuses two offers of employment for a career position at the same or higher salary level and the same percentage of time as the position held by the employee at the time of layoff; or
d.	Fails to respond to a written notice of a career employment opportunity within 15 calendar days. The 15-calendar day response period shall begin immediately upon personal notice of the career employment opportunity or 10 calendar days from the date written notice is postmarked.
6.	If an employee voluntarily reduces his or her time for a reason listed in §C.1. above, within one year prior to a layoff, the employee is entitled to recall/rehire rights at a percentage of time equal to that from which the employee voluntarily reduced his or her time. The request for the voluntary reduction must be submitted by the employee in writing and approved by the supervisor and must state the effective date and the percentage of the reduction in time.
F.	RECALL
1.	A non-probationary career employee who is indefinitely laid off shall be recalled in order of seniority to an active, vacant career position, provided:
a.	The active, vacant career position is in the same class and department at the same or lesser percentage of time as the position from which the employee was laid off.
b.	The employee is qualified to perform the duties of the active, vacant career position.
2.	Employees who are eligible for recall shall retain recall eligibility for three years from the date of layoff. An employee who accepts a limited appointment or a position in a lower class or at a lesser percentage of time shall remain eligible for recall rights during the period of recall.
3.	Employees recalled from layoff status to a new position who fail to perform satisfactorily may, at any time during the six months following such return, be returned to layoff status with restoration of full recall rights. The time on job status will not be counted as part of recall eligibility time.
4.	Recall Termination
The right to recall terminates at the end of the period of eligibility or if an employee:
a.	Refuses a recall to work; or
b.	Refuses two offers of reemployment in career positions at the same or greater percentage of time and at the same or higher salary level; or
c.	Accepts a career position at the same or higher salary level within the University.
- 32 -
G.	SEVERANCE - EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2003 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 OR, IF DURATION OF AGREEMENT IS EXTENDED, THROUGH AN EXTENSION PERIOD NOT TO EXCEED JUNE 30, 2005.
1.	A career employee who has received a notice of indefinite layoff may elect in writing, severance pay in lieu of preferential rehire and recall rights within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of the notice of layoff. Election is irrevocable. Each campus department shall, in each instance of layoff, not reduction in time, offer severance in lieu of preferential rehire and recall rights to all employees in the department affected by the layoff. Severance pay shall be in accordance with the following.
a.	Employees with less than five years of service receive two weeks or 10 workdays of severance.
b.	Employees with five or more years of service receive five weeks or 25 workday’s severance, plus one-week severance for each additional full year of service up to a maximum of 15 weeks severance.
c.	Employees who are laid off following a reduction in time that occurred within 60 calendar days of the layoff notice shall be eligible for severance on the basis of their percentage of appointment just prior to their reduction in time.
d.	This section shall not apply to temporary layoff or reduction in time except as provided in section G.1.c. above.
2.	Should an employee be returned to work as a result of a grievance, arbitration, or settlement agreement related to the layoff, any severance pay received will be deducted from the back pay award. An employee cannot be returned to work without first repaying the severance or signing a severance repayment agreement.
H.	CONTINUITY OF SERVICE UPON REEMPLOYMENT
1.	A temporary layoff does not create a break in service. Reemployment in a career position within the period of right to recall provides continuity of service and continuation of previously accrued seniority and, therefore, no break in service. However, seniority and benefits accrue only when an employee is on pay status.
2.	An employee who has been laid off and is rehired at another University location within the employee's period of recall will be eligible for the following as a result of no break in service:
a.	Reinstatement of all sick leave accumulated from prior service,
b.	Reinstatement of vacation accrual rate,
c.	Calculation of University service based on full-time equivalent months (or hours) of University service, and
d.	Buy-back of UCRP service credit according to the University Benefit Regulations.
I.	EFFECT ON BENEFIT COVERAGE
See Article 42 - University Benefits, §C.1.
J.	LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY
Policies, procedures, definitions, qualifications and calculations in effect at PERB’s certification of CUE on November 21, 1997, relative to severance pay that are in conflict with the Agreement shall remain in effect for employees at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Except in the case of minor and non-substantive changes, the University will, 60 calendar days prior to implementing a new performance evaluation form or written performance standard, provide a copy of the proposed form or written standard to CUE. If CUE provides a written request to meet and discuss within 30 days of the notice date, the University shall meet and discuss with CUE regarding the change. In addition, if CUE requests in writing to meet about any alleged significant change in performance standards or performance evaluation form, the University shall meet and discuss within 30 days of CUE’s request regarding the change, if any.
3.	Performance evaluation is not in and of itself a disciplinary procedure.
4.	Clerical Unit employees who receive an overall “needs improvement” rating shall have been informed of any deficiencies, including information about how to correct such deficiencies prior to receiving such an overall evaluation.
5.	The performance of each non-probationary career employee shall be evaluated at least annually, in accordance with a process established by the University. The University will inform each new, non-probationary, career employee or each employee transferred or rehired to a different department, when they should expect a performance evaluation. In the event a non-probationary career employee does not receive the written evaluation, the employee may take the following action:
a)	Within 15 calendar days of the date the written evaluation was due but not received, the employee shall make a written request for the evaluation to the employee’s immediate supervisor. When an employee makes such a request, an evaluation shall be completed within 15 calendar days of the request, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.
- 53 -

4.	Employees in limited appointments are at will, except that the University will not terminate limited appointment employees for the sole purpose of denying them career status, except that an allegation that a limited appointment employee is terminated for the sole purpose of denying career status is grievable and arbitrable.

E.	TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT POOLS & FLOATER APPOINTMENTS
1.	Definition
Temporary employment pools or programs (TEP) are operated by Human Resource Departments to serve campus/hospital/laboratory staffing needs.
a.	The primary goal of the Temporary Employment Program (TEP) is to provide immediate administrative and technical support services to the University departments. Departments utilize TEP employees to complete special projects, to respond to workload fluctuations that are unusual or episodic in nature, to fill in for employees who are on leave, or to fill in during a recruitment period.
b.	A second goal is to provide the campus/laboratory/hospital with a viable source of candidates for its career and limited appointments.
2.	Individuals employed in temporary employment pools shall be appointed to a floater appointment.
a.	A “Floater Appointment” is an appointment reserved for use in temporary employment pools, established at any percent of full time up to twenty-four (24) months in duration.
b.	A Floater Appointee is not a Career, Casual-Restricted, Academic, Limited Appointment, or Per Diem employee.
c.	A Floater Appointee is “at will” and may be released from a Temporary Employment Pool for any reason and without just cause. Receiving a Floater Appointment is not a guarantee of work. Floater Appointees may be scheduled or not scheduled, or released from any assignment at the University’s non-grievable discretion.
d.	Upon the commencement of a Floater Appointment, the Floater Appointee will receive a letter advising him/her that, although a Floater Appointment may be terminated at any time, floater appointments may not be extended beyond twenty-four (24) months. The letter will further inform the Floater Appointee that if he/she chooses not to be available for work for a period of 120 days or more, he/she can notify the University in advance, ending his/her appointment and taking a break in service. The letter also will inform the Floater Appointee that he/she must reapply in order to be readmitted to the TEP.
e.	The parties agree that the utilization of Floater Appointees in accordance with paragraph E.1.a above is a permissible use of TEP employees. The parties further agree that it is a misuse of the TEP program to utilize a Floater Appointee in the same assignment in the same department doing the same work for more than 1,500 hours in twenty-four months. Further, the use of successive floaters in the same assignment in the same department doing the same work shall create an inference that the University’s use of floaters is not consistent with paragraph E.1.a. The following exclusions apply:
1)	Exclusion One: Floater Appointees may serve for more than 1,500 hours in one floater assignment if the Floater Appointee is assigned to
- 57 -
replace an employee on leave that exceeds 1,500 hours. If the employee on leave does not return from leave, the Floater Appointee shall be converted to career retroactive to the first of the month following attainment of 1,500 hours, except that nothing in this subparagraph precludes the University from releasing the Floater Appointee from the assignment prior to the anticipated return date of the employee on leave.
2)	Exclusion Two: Floater Appointees may serve for more than 1,500 hours in one floater assignment if the position into which the Floater Appointee is assigned is not an “ongoing” position, in that the position is established and funded for eighteen months or less at any percent of time. In the event the position is funded beyond eighteen months, the Floater Appointee shall be converted to career retroactive to the first of the month following attainment of 1,500 hours; except that nothing in this subparagraph precludes the University from releasing the Floater Appointee from the assignment prior to the effective date of the funding extension.
3)	A Floater Appointee does not work 1,500 hours or more in any one assignment within the meaning of this Article (even if the Floater Appointee accrues a total of 1,500 or more hours during his/her Floater Appointment), if the 1,500 hours is accrued as a result of working in several short-term assignments.
3.	Conversion to Career
a.	If a Floater Appointee is allowed to serve in his/her Floater Appointment for a period of more than twenty-four (24) months without a break in University service of one hundred twenty (120) consecutive calendar days, the Floater Appointee shall be converted to a career appointment on the first day of the month following completion of the 24-month Floater Appointment.
b.	If a Floater Appointee has a break in University service for a period of 120 consecutive calendar days, that individual may be re-hired into a new Floater Appointment.
c.	If during his/her 24-month Floater Appointment, a Floater Appointee serves in one floater assignment in the same department doing the same work for more than 1,500 hours, s/he shall be converted to a career appointment on the first day of the month following completion of 1,500 hours in one assignment, unless one or both of the exclusions enumerated in paragraphs E.2.e.1) or E.2.e.2) of this Article are applicable.
d.	Nothing in this Article shall otherwise prevent a Floater Appointee from attaining a career, limited appointment or other position through the recruitment process or other processes.
4.	Benefits
Employees in floater appointments will receive Health and Welfare benefits in accordance with University Benefit Eligibility rules. DCP contributions shall be required.
5.	Contract Coverage
When Floater Appointees are assigned to title codes covered by this contract, they are covered by the following Articles of this Agreement: Access, Agreement, Duration of Agreement, Health and Safety, Holidays, Hours of Work, Management Rights, Military Leave, Nondiscrimination in Employment, No Strikes, Parking, Payroll Deduction, Personnel Files, Positions, Rehabilitation, Severability, Shift Differential, Sick Leave, Uniforms, Vacation, appropriate sections of Wages, Waiver, Work-Incurred Injury or Illness, and Work Rules.
- 58 -
With regard to the above-referenced Articles (with the exception of the Positions Article), Floater Appointees may use the grievance and arbitration procedures of this Agreement only to the extent provided in the applicable portions of the Articles identified in this Section. An allegation that a Floater Appointee has been utilized in a manner inconsistent with paragraph E.1.a, paragraph E.2.e and/or paragraph 3 of this Positions Article shall be grievable and arbitrable. CUE shall have the burden of proof to show floater use that is inconsistent with paragraph E.1.a., paragraph E.2.e, and/or paragraph 3.
6.	The University shall notify CUE at least 45 calendar days prior to establishing a Temporary Employment Pool (TEP) operated by the Human Resources Department at a campus/laboratory/hospital that does not have an existing TEP as of January 1, 2001. Upon receipt of a timely written request from CUE, the campus/laboratory shall meet and discuss the establishment of the Temporary Employment Pool prior to implementation.
7.	Employment Information Lists:
a.	The University shall continue to post on its FTP site, information for all Floater Appointees. The information shall include, but not be limited to, the type of information posted as of the date of the execution of this Agreement.

The University shall pay the reasonable costs of any such medical examination and, when practical, shall send the employee to a physician of its choosing on the employee's work time.
7.

When possible, an employee granted a work-incurred injury or illness leave must provide the University with 10 calendar days notice of his or her ability to return to work. If a return to work specifies restrictions, the University will consider what accommodation, if any, will reasonably be made.
2.	If the position held has been abolished during the leave, the employee shall be afforded the same considerations which would have been afforded had that employee been on pay status when the position was abolished.
D.	SUPPLEMENTAL SICK LEAVE AND VACATION
1.	An employee who accrues sick leave and vacation shall be permitted to use accrued sick leave and vacation to supplement temporary disability payments received under the California Workers’ Compensation Act.
2.	Sick leave and vacation payments shall be the difference between the amount payable to the employee under the Workers’ Compensation Act and the employee’s regular salary.
- 80 -
The additional payment made to an employee to provide the employee with full salary prior to receipt of disability payments shall be deemed an advance temporary disability payment within the Workers’ Compensation Act.
3.	An employee who receives advance temporary disability payment shall reimburse the University for such payment. The reimbursement is used to restore proportionate sick leave and vacation credit as appropriate.
E.	EXTENDED SICK LEAVE
1.	An employee who is receiving temporary disability payments and who has exhausted all accrued sick leave shall receive extended sick leave payments from the University in an amount equal to the difference between the payments from Workers’ Compensation and 80% of the basic salary plus any shift differential which the employee would have received. If such an employee returns to part-time University duties, the earnings plus any temporary disability payments, if less than 80% of basic salary plus shift differential, shall be supplemented to 80% by extended sick leave payments, provided the employee continues to be medically authorized for Worker’s Compensation temporary disability. Total extended sick leave payments shall not exceed 26 weeks for any one injury or illness.
2.	An eligible employee who does not have sufficient accrued sick leave to cover the three calendar days waiting period for receiving Workers’ Compensation payments shall receive extended sick leave payments to cover any part of the waiting period not covered by sick leave. Payment shall be made only after determination that the injury or illness is compensable under Workers’ Compensation.
3.	An employee who elects not to use all sick leave is not eligible for extended sick leave benefits.
F.	EFFECT ON PAY STATUS
1.	Supplemental Leave
An employee who is receiving temporary disability payments and supplemental sick leave or vacation as described in Section D. above is considered on regular pay status for purposes of application of provisions of this Agreement, except completion of the probationary period. Sick leave and vacation accrued during this period may be used as soon as they accrue.
2.	Extended Sick Leave
An employee who is receiving temporary disability payments and extended sick leave benefits as described in Section E. above is considered to be on regular pay status for purposes of application of provisions of this Agreement, except completion of the probationary period. Sick leave and vacation accrued during this period is credited to the employee only upon return to work. However, if an employee separates without returning to work, the employee shall be paid for vacation accrued during the period the employee received extended sick leave payment.
3.	Leave Without Pay
An employee on leave without pay and receiving temporary disability payments accrues sick leave and vacation on the same basis as if regularly employed, but such accrual is credited to the employee only upon return to work. If an employee separates without returning to work, no payment shall be made for such vacation credit.
G.	SEPARATION
An employee shall not use vacation, sick leave, or extended sick leave to supplement Workers' Compensation payments beyond a predetermined date of separation or leave without pay. Any vacation credit remaining on the date of separation shall be paid on a lump-sum basis.
H.	LIGHT DUTY
Subject to operational considerations and budgetary constraints, the University may, on a case-by-case basis, place an employee in a temporary assignment consistent with documented medical restrictions when the employee has experienced work related injuries. This section shall not be construed as a guarantee of a specific form of accommodation nor shall accommodation in one case establish a precedent for similar or dissimilar circumstances.
ARTICLE 48
- 81 -
WORK RULES
A.	GENERAL PROVISIONS
For the purpose of general definition under this article, work rules shall be understood to mean rules governing work determined by the University to be required for the purpose of ensuring the orderly and efficient operation of the University and for ensuring the health and safety of employees and others.

Work rules may be implemented only for reasons of bona-fide business and/or health and safety necessity.
B.	BACKGROUND CHECKS
Background checks shall be subject to the provisions of this article. In addition:
1.	No incumbent employee shall be required to disclose nor shall any University Background check investigate an arrest, detention or report of abuse that did not result in a conviction as part of a background check unless such information is permitted or required by law.
2.	Appointment to a critical position is contingent upon the University’s determination that a background check is complete and sufficient.
3.	With the exception of employees who have contact with children under 18 or dependent adults or have direct responsibility for care, safety or security of patients in medical facilities, no background check shall be conducted on information pre-dating the report by more than seven years.
4.	An incumbent in a position shall not be subject to a background check unless:
a.	The University changes the duties of the position such that the position is designated critical or
b.	Applicable laws or regulations require a background check.
5.	Background checks are limited to:
a.	Criminal conviction records, if any,
b.	Credit checks for positions that require POST certification, bonding or equivalent for self-insurance purposes, or where required by law or external regulations. Absence of a credit history shall not be taken into consideration as evidence of an unsatisfactory credit check.

d.	Verification of license, certificate or degree required for position.
C.	CONFIDENTIALITY AND ACCESS TO BACKGROUND CHECK INFORMATION

Such files, both paper and electronic, shall be maintained in a confidential manner by the Campus Police Department and/or the Human Resources Department. Once the position has been filled the University agrees to destroy all such background records within one year except the record relied upon to deny appointment to the position; the record relied upon to deny appointment is to be kept for two years or until the conclusion of any related grievance/litigation.
2.	With regard to promotions and transfers, if any employee is selected as a final candidate for a critical position, and the University determines that the background check information prevents the employee’s selection, the employee may request and receive a copy of his/her background check results and a copy of this section of the contract.
3.	The campus/hospital/Laboratory shall provide the employee prior to making the final decision, a free copy of the report relied upon for the initial non-selection and a written description of the employee rights to challenge the veracity of the report.

D.	POSTING OF OPEN CRITICAL POSITIONS FOR PROMOTION AND/OR TRANSFER
- 82 -
1.
Posting of an open critical position shall identify that a background check is required to successfully complete the application process.
2.	A separate disclosure form with a summary of the employee rights shall be issued to the employee at the time he or she is asked to sign the disclosure form. The form shall contain the purpose for requesting the information, the consequences, if any, of not providing the information, and the employee’s right of access to the records.
E.	RECLASSIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES TO CRITICAL POSITIONS
1.	If a campus/hospital/Laboratory determines any incumbent employee positions(s) is to be designated as critical, or that an incumbent employee is proposed to be reclassified to a critical bargaining unit position, the employee(s) and CUE shall be notified.

The University shall provide responses to alternatives suggested by CUE. Such responses shall be in writing if requested by CUE.
H.	APPLICATION AND GRIEVABILITY
1.	The University will reasonably enforce its work rules as to employees who are on pay status.
2.	In the event the University’s enforcement/application of its work rules is inconsistent with any portion of this Article, a grievance may be filed in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 - Grievance Procedure, and appealed to Arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 - Arbitration Procedure of this Agreement.
3.	In the event the application of a work rule is appealed to arbitration, the Arbitrator shall have no authority to newly fashion or to modify the work rule.

APPENDIX E
LBNL Wages Side Letter Compensation Agreement
This is an agreement between the Coalition of University Employees (CUE) and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) on the issue of compensation for clerical employees at the Lab represented for purposes of collective bargaining by CUE.
It is recognized by the LBNL and by CUE that this agreement on compensation has been made as a result of "local" negotiations between representatives of CUE and LBNL. The parties recognize that this agreement is made in the context of the "system wide" negotiations between the University of California, of which LBNL is a part, and CUE. This agreement, however, is a final and binding agreement regarding compensation for Lab clerical employees for FY 2002 and FY 2003.
The agreement is as follows:
1.	For FY 2002
A)	There will be a range movement of 5.0%.
B)	There will be a merit pool of 5.0% of the total LBNL Clerical unit salaries as of September 30, 2001. Employees who receive an overall FY 2001 P2R rating of meets ("M") will receive a merit increase of no less than 4.0%. Employees who receive an overall FY 2001 P2R rating of exceeds ("E") will receive a merit increase of no less than 4.5%. Employees who receive an overall FY 2001 performance evaluation of outstanding ("0") will receive a merit increase of no less than 5.0%.
C)	After the amounts set forth in B) above have been calculated, the difference between this amount and 5.0% will be used to supplement the increases set forth in B) using the same or similar methodology that was used in the FY2001 wage distribution.
An additional amount of up to 1.5% of the total LBNL Clerical unit salaries as of September 30, 2001 will be made available for posted promotions and reclassifications in the bargaining unit.
An additional amount of up to 0.25% of the total LBNL Clerical unit salaries as of September 30, 2001 will be made available for mid-year alignment and equity adjustments.
It is the intention of LBNL to distribute the entire merit pool, and the pools set aside for reclassifications, promotions, alignment and equity adjustments.
Employees who are "red-circled," i.e., who are paid higher than the range for their classification, are eligible to receive increases as specified in B), above. These will take the form of a non-basebuilding lump sum payment for FY 2002.
In order to be eligible for the FY2002 wage increase, the employee must have been eligible for a FY2001 performance evaluation, be in the CX bargaining unit on October 1, 2001, and be in the CX bargaining unit on the date payroll for the distribution is run.
2.	For FY 2003
A)	There will be a range movement of 4.5%.
B)	There will be a merit pool of 4.5% of the total LBNL Clerical unit salaries as of September 30, 2002. Employees who receive an overall FY 2002 P2R rating of meets ("M") will receive a merit increase of no less than 3.5%. Employees who receive an overall FY 2002 P2R rating of exceeds ("E") will receive a merit increase of no less than 4.0%. Employees who receive an overall FY 2002 performance evaluation of outstanding ("0") will receive a merit increase of no less than 4.5%.
C)	After the amounts set forth in B) above have been calculated, the difference between this amount and 4.5% will be used to supplement the increases set forth in B) using the same or similar methodology that was used in the FY2001 wage distribution.
An additional amount of up to 1.0% of the total LBNL Clerical unit salaries as of September 30, 2002 will be made available for posted promotions and reclassifications in the bargaining unit.

APPENDIX E - cont.
LBNL Wages Side Letter Compensation Agreement
An additional amount of up to 0.25% of the total LBNL Clerical unit salaries as of September 30, 2002 will be made available for mid-year alignment and equity adjustments.
It is the intention of LBNL to distribute the entire merit pool, and the pools set aside for reclassifications, promotions, alignment and equity adjustments.
Employees who are "red-circled," i.e., who are paid higher than the range for their classification, are eligible to receive increases as specified in B), above. These will take the form of a non-base-building lump sum payment for FY 2003.
In order to be eligible for the FY2003 wage increase, the employee must have been eligible for a FY2002 performance evaluation, be in the CX bargaining unit on October 1, 2002, and be in the CX bargaining unit on the date payroll for the distribution is run.
3.	If more than one salary adjustment for an employee takes place on the same date, the order of salary actions will be in accordance with the LBNL usual method for accomplishing such adjustments.
4.	The compensation increases for FY 2002 in this agreement will be implemented within 120 days from the implementation date of the statewide agreement. The compensation increases for FY 2003 will be implemented at the beginning of the FY2003 fiscal year cycle. In each year, within 30 days of payout, the Lab will provide an accounting of the total allocated for CX salary increases and the methodology used to CUE representatives and will meet with CUE representatives upon their request to resolve any issues or problems with the implementation of this compensation agreement.
5.	The compensation increases of this Wage Agreement will not be subject to Article 7, (Grievance) or 3, (Arbitration).

I authorize the Regents of the University of California to withhold monthly or cease withholding from my earnings as an employee, membership dues, initiation fees and general assessments as indicated above. I understand and agree to the arrangement whereby one total monthly deduction will be made by the University based upon the current rate of dues, initiation fees, and general assessments. I also understand that changes in the rate of dues, initiation fees and general assessments may be made after notice to that effect is given to the university by the organization to which such authorized deductions are assigned and I hereby expressly agree that pursuant to such notice the university may withhold from my earnings amounts either greater than or less than those shown above without obligation to inform me before doing so or to seek additional authorization from me for such withholdings. The University will remit the amount deducted to the official designated by the organization. This authorization shall remain in effect until revoked by me—allowing up to 30 days’ time to change the payroll records in order to make effective this assignment or revocation thereof—or until another employee organization becomes my exclusive representative. It is understood that this authorization shall become void in the event the employee organization’s eligibility for payroll deduction terminates for any reason. Upon termination of my employment with the University, this authorization will no longer be in effect. This authorization does not include dues, initiation fees and general assessments to cover any time prior to the payroll period in which the initial deduction is made. Payroll deductions, including those legally required and those authorized by an employee are assigned priorities. In the event there are insufficient earnings to cover all required and authorized deductions, it is understood that deductions will be taken in the order assigned by the University and no adjustment will be made in a subsequent pay period for membership dues, initiation fees and general assessments.

Compensation of Overtime
Clerical employees who work in departments that offer compensatory time off will have the opportunity to elect whether to be compensated for overtime work by pay or by compensatory time off The parties agree that if an employee does not elect compensatory time off, she/he will receive overtime pay for overtime hours worked. Employees who work in departments which offer compensatory time off will be afforded the opportunity to elect to be compensated for overtime hours worked upon hire and during the month of either June or July, 2002, and subsequently in that department according to the applicable UC/CUE Agreement, Hours of Work article. The election to receive compensatory time off in lieu of pay is to be effective until the next election period designated in the applicable UC/CUE Agreement. If an employee who has elected to receive compensatory time off wishes to continue to receive compensatory time off in subsequent years, the employee must renew the election according to the applicable UC/CUE Agreement. If the employee does not renew the election, the employee will receive pay for overtime hours worked.
A one-time special election period will be held in either June or July, 2002. Management of each campus, or medical center will choose whether to have the special period be either June or July, 2002. During the June or July election period, employees who work in departments which offer CTO will have the opportunity to select whether to be compensated for overtime work by pay or by compensatory time off, until the next election identified in the applicable UC/CUE Agreement, Hours of Work article, when a regular election period will be open. If an employee does not elect CTO in June or July 2002, the employee will receive pay for overtime worked.
The election will be allowed for new employees and transferred or returning employees if the department offers CTO.
Until the June or July 2002 election, employees in the CX unit will receive either monetary payments or CTO for overtime worked according to the preference which they elected in December, 2001.
