ARTICLE IV
SCHEDULES AND HOURS OF WORK
Office hours are intended to provide the best possible support and/or access for our customers. Due to changing business requirements, there may be specific cases where the hours or schedules being worked do not meet the needs of our business. Because of this, it may be necessary at times to modify an Employee’s hours of work or work schedule to address our business needs. Employees and their managers will work together to address coverage issues to meet the demonstrated needs of the business.
SECTION 1-	SCHEDULES
For purposes of this Article, hours are defined as the times during which an Employee is working. Schedules are defined as the arrangement of hours, including but not limited to the days worked and shift worked by an Employee during a pay period. Managers will make reasonable efforts to accommodate Employees’ needs, subject to the following guidelines:
A.	When it is determined that business needs are not being addressed, the following steps will be taken:
1.	The manager will explain the coverage needs to the affected Employees.
2.	Employees will be asked to volunteer for the new hours or work schedule, or to work out among themselves a way to manage the coverage needs.
3.	In the event there are no volunteers, Management reserves the right to assign the hours, or work schedules based upon the business needs of the
6
department. Where all other factors are equal, such assignment will be made on an inverse seniority basis.
4.	If management assigns schedules and/or hours of work, Employees will have up to fifteen (15) working days to adjust their schedule and/or hours to accommodate the new schedule and/or hours.
5.	Written copies of the hours changes will be provided for the Employee, Manager, Labor Relations and the Union.
6.	If the Employee can demonstrate that the change will cause a financial hardship, the company will address the issue and make reasonable efforts to reduce the financial hardship.
7.	No Employee will be given a 15 working day notice of intent to unilaterally change his/her work schedule more than once in a rolling nine (9) month period.
B.	In the event an Employee demonstrates a need to modify his/her work schedule, and/or hours, managers will make a reasonable attempt to accommodate the request subject to business needs.
C.	Work schedules which may be agreed to, include but are not limited to the following models:
1.	The normal work week for pay purposes shall be thirty-seven and one-half (37.5) hours (no paid breaks), Monday through Friday. Part time non exempt Employees will have their schedules adjusted proportionately to reflect a work week based upon 37.5 hours (no paid breaks). Exempt Employees will work the number of hours necessary to complete their assignments.
2.	Exempt Employees - Absences. An exempt Employee’s salary is predetermined and will not vary depending on the number of hours worked. However, if an exempt Employee is absent for an entire day, the Employee will have to use a full day of vacation, personal leave, or sick leave (if the reason for the absence is one for which sick leave can be used).
3.	Summer/Winter Hours:
Summer Hours: Begin the last scheduled working Monday in the month of April and end the last scheduled working Friday in the month of October.
Winter Hours: Begin the first Monday after the end of Summer Hours and end the last scheduled working Friday before Summer Hours begin.
7
4.	Nine Day/Biweekly:
Week A:	5 work days
Week B:	4 work days
5.	Four Day Work Week: Any variation of four (4) days of work, not including Saturday and Sunday and not exceeding thirty-seven and one-half (37.5) hours (no paid breaks) per week. All benefits shall be earned as though the Employee working this schedule had worked 37.5 hours (no paid breaks), unless otherwise agreed upon. The 4-day week will be balanced between Monday - Thursday and Tuesday - Friday to maximize staffing on Friday afternoons while minimizing Monday shortages.
6.	Fixed Hours Positions are those with specific and fixed starting and ending times.
7.	For purposes of shift differential calculation only, shift hours shall be as set forth in Article XVII, Section 6.
D.	Positions will be posted indicating that the schedule that may be required (9-day, 4-day, Summer/Winter, Fixed hours, preferred hours or flextime), or that the hours will be discussed at the interview.
E.	When an Employee leaves a position and creates a vacancy that is budget authorized to be filled, the manager determines the appropriate hours and schedule and offers those hours and schedule to current Employees, by seniority within the same job title, prior to posting any vacancy.
SECTION 2	- OVERTIME COMPENSATION
The Fair Labor Standards Act divides Employees into those who are entitled to overtime (non-exempt) and those who are not (exempt).
A.	Exempt Employees are paid a predetermined salary regardless of the number of hours they work each week.
B.	Non-Exempt Employees. The Employer shall have the right to schedule overtime, with the consent of the Employee involved, provided that:
1.	Full-Time - All hours worked in excess of regularly scheduled hours for full-time Employees in any one day shall be paid for at the rate of time and one-half (1 ^).
2.	Part Time - Overtime pay will not be paid to part-time Employees unless their time exceeds the greater of:
a. Seven and one-half (7.5) hours (no paid breaks) per day, or,
8
b.
The number of hours the Employee is normally scheduled to work that particular day.
3.	Overtime will be paid to part-time Employees in accordance with Article IV, Section 2 of this agreement.
C.	Non-Exempt Employees. Weekly overtime for working a sixth (6th) or seventh (7th) day during a week shall be counted as set forth below:
1.	Employees who are not required to work Saturday and/or Sunday as part of their normal workweek shall be paid the applicable overtime rate of time and one-half (1 Y) for any Saturday or sixth (6th) day hours worked and double time (2) for any Sunday or seventh (7th) day hours worked, regardless of the number of hours worked within that workweek.
2.	Employees who are required to work Saturday and/or Sunday as a part of their normal workweek shall not receive overtime for working on Saturday or Sunday as such. However, when an Employee who is required to work Saturday and/or Sunday as part of his or her normal workweek works a sixth (6th) or seventh (7th) day during the workweek, the Employee shall be paid the applicable overtime rate of time and one-half (1 Y) for any sixth (6th) day hours worked and double time (2) for any seventh (7th) day hours worked, regardless of the number of hours worked within that week.
D.	Non-Exempt Employees. Employees determined to be non-exempt will be paid overtime in accordance with this Article IV unless, prior to working overtime, the Employee requests, and the manager agrees, to the use of compensatory time off in lieu of paid overtime.
If compensatory time off is requested and approved, the Employee shall be granted hour-for-hour compensatory time off for such overtime hours, which when added to the Employee’s non-overtime hours, do not exceed forty (40) hours in the workweek in which the overtime hours were worked. To the extent the overtime hours when added to the Employee’s non-overtime hours exceed forty (40) hours in the workweek, the Employee will be granted one and one-half hours of compensatory time off for each hour of overtime worked. Compensatory time off for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek must be used during the pay period in which it was earned. Compensatory time off granted for hours which do not exceed forty (40) hours in a work week may be accumulated, by the Employee, up to thirty-seven and one-half (37.5) hours, and used as scheduled with the Employee’s manager.
Non-exempt Employees shall be paid overtime for all business travel outside regularly scheduled hours. Compensatory time is time off granted to an Employee in lieu of cash payment for overtime worked. Compensatory time is used for purposes of computing overtime compensation. In case of death or
9
voluntary separation of employment, any accumulated compensatory time will be paid at that time.
E.	Other overtime earned by non-exempt Employees may be taken as Compensatory Time. (See D above).
1.	Call-In Compensation. If a non-exempt Employee is called in for overtime work, the Employee shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours overtime compensation. The Employee may be required to work the two (2) hours to complete the call-in.
2.	Phone Call Compensation. If a non-exempt Employee is paged or receives a work-related phone call and is not required to come in or dial in, the Employee shall receive one-half hour of appropriate compensation time for each unrelated work phone call.
3.	Dial-In Compensation. If a non-exempt Employee is required to dial-in for overtime work, the Employee shall receive a minimum of one-half hour of appropriate compensation. If the call which initiates the dial-in occurs between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., the Employee shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours of appropriate compensation. This time is in addition to any previous unrelated phone calls initiated by a representative of the company.
F.	Holidays, Vacation, Sick Leave, Compensatory Time and Personal Leave shall be considered as hours worked when computing overtime.
G.	There shall be no pyramiding of overtime.
SECTION 3	- EXEMPT EMPLOYEE DISCRETIONARY BONUS
In recognition of exempt Employees whose jobs routinely require them to work well beyond the normal schedule and/or on the 6th or 7th days, or to reward for outstanding performance, managers may consider providing the Employee with an appropriate monetary discretionary bonus.
In providing a discretionary bonus, managers must consider, as a material factor, among others, the extent to which an exempt Employee is required to work beyond his/her normal schedule and/or a 6th or 7th day. In applying this factor, Employees who are assigned to work in the category of “on call primary/secondary support” work or “time critical support” work will be treated relatively equally within the applicable category based upon frequency of being on call, duration or number of hours, and number and duration of responses.
SECTION 4	- BREAKS

The manager will determine the appropriate day off, after consideration of the Employee’s preference, and communicate the decision to the Employee by the end of November. If the manager is unable to communicate the appropriate day by the end of November, the day off will default to the workday immediately preceding the holiday.
The schedule for non-exempt, full-time Employees working the Summer Hours Schedule all year and for the “summer” portion for non-exempt, full-time Employees working the Summer/Winter Hours Schedule will be adjusted for those weeks in which a holiday falls on a Friday (or other “short day” if the Employee’s short day is other than a Friday).

SECTION 2	- HOLIDAY PAY
All Employees who work on a Holiday shall receive holiday pay plus time-and-one-half for hours worked or time-off equal to one-and-one half the hours worked.
ARTICLE VI
VACATIONS
SECTION 1	- ACCRUAL SCHEDULE
Employees accrue vacation based on their hire or adjusted hire date according to the schedule below. Each Employee’s ePaystub or payroll check stub will reflect the vacation accrued as determined by this schedule.
Employees hired after March 31, 2008 will accrue vacation according to the schedule below, however, they will have a maximum annual accrual of 4 weeks (150 hours).
ACCRUAL SCHEDULE:
Length of Employment	Annual Accrual
0 through 8th Year	3 Weeks
9th through 18th Year	4 Weeks
During and after the 19th Year	5 Weeks
Employees in the 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th years of employment as of January 1, 2006 will maintain their existing vacation accrual schedule (see table below) until they reach the 19th year of employment. During the 19th year, they will accrue vacation as indicated in the table above:
During 14th Year	4 Weeks
During 15th Year	4 Weeks, 1 Day
During 16th Year	4 Weeks, 2 Days
During 17th Year	4 Weeks, 3 Days
During 18th Year	4 Weeks, 4 Days
Part-time Employees shall be entitled to a proportionate number of vacation hours compared to those in the above schedule for full-time Employees in the ratio that the number of hours worked bears to the number of hours scheduled per year for full-time Employees.
Vacation is accrued only when the Employee is actively at work or on a paid leave. Employees do not accrue vacation for absences or leave without pay. Therefore, taking time off without pay will reduce the amount of vacation accrued in a year.
SECTION 2	- USAGE
A.	All Employees may use vacation as soon as it is accrued subject to business needs and manager approval. All Employees may save a portion of their accrued
13
vacation for use in another calendar year. When entering a new calendar year, any vacation hours remaining from the old calendar year, not exceeding twenty (20) days, will automatically be carried over to the new calendar year. The maximum carry over is twenty (20) days. Employees will lose any vacation that is over the twenty (20) day maximum carry over.
B.	Employees may not be required to take more vacation hours off per day than what they are normally scheduled to work. A full-time Employee is encouraged to take a minimum of one (1) week vacation in one block during the calendar year.
C.	The minimum amount of vacation which may be taken is one-half (1/2) day except a maximum of ten (10) hours in any one calendar year may be taken in any time segment desired. Employees may take up to ten (10) one-half days of vacation provided such half-days are taken Monday through Thursday. The balance of vacations must be taken in full days.
D.	During the Summer Hours schedule, each Employee on the Winter/Summer schedule is allowed to take one Friday off for each week of vacation accrued that calendar year. A full week of vacation taken during the summer would not affect this allotment.
E.	Vacation usage rules pertaining to part-time Employees are based on the proration language addressed in Section 1 of this Article and Exhibit F.
F.	Full-time Employees who transfer to part-time positions will be paid for any banked vacation in excess of their prorated maximum unused carryover hours. This payment will be based on their previous salary rate.
G.	Vacation Planner - The initial scheduling of Employees’ vacation will be completed by November 30th of each year, and will be done by work area as determined by first level supervisor on an Employer-wide seniority basis.
The planner will be sent initially to the most senior Employee who will have the right to schedule up to two (2) weeks of her/his vacation. It will proceed down the seniority list with each Employee having the ability to also schedule up to two (2) weeks of vacation. After all Employees have scheduled their initial two (2) weeks vacation, the planner will be approved by the manager.
The planner will then be returned to the most senior Employee for the scheduling of her/his remaining vacation. Each Employee will schedule their remaining vacation according to their seniority. Upon completion of all scheduling, the manager will review and approve vacation schedules by January 31st.
After the vacation planner is approved, all subsequent requests for vacation will be on a first come first serve basis.
1 4
H.	Vacation requests require notice to the supervisor. ‘Reasonable notice’ is defined as no more notice than the amount of time being requested. The Employer reserves the right to reschedule vacations in the event there is inadequate coverage or Employees cannot reconcile their vacation schedule differences. Seniority will be the determining factor if prior approval has not been given by the supervisor.
I.	Vacation may be borrowed before accruing it, but an Employee may not take more than they will accrue by the end of the year. (Example, an Employee carries over 20 days into January and will accrue 20 days in that calendar year. The Employee will be able to schedule and use all 40 days as of January 1st).
SECTION 3	- TERMINATION PAYOUT
In case of death or separation of employment, any accumulated and accrued hours of vacation would be paid as vacation due at that time.
SECTION 4	- PRIOR SERVICE CREDIT
See Exhibit N.
SECTION 5	- ILLNESS DURING VACATION
An Employee, who is confined because of personal injury or illness while on vacation, will terminate vacation leave on the day of confinement and resume it on a later date agreed to by the Employer and the Employee. The Employer may require the Employee involved to supply medical verification of the time of illness or injury and the degree and period of time for which the Employee was incapacitated.
ARTICLE VII
SICK LEAVE
STATEMENT OF INTENT
Sick Leave is provided to recognize the mutual needs of the Employee and the Employer. Sick Leave is a contractual benefit which provides for a leave from scheduled work to attend to the health problems of the Employee or members of the Employee’s immediate family as defined in Article IX, Section 8.

A.	Part-time Employees shall be entitled to a proportionate number of hours for Sick Leave compared to those for full-time Employees in the ratio that the number of hours worked bears to the number of hours scheduled per year for full-time Employees.
B.	Sick leave may be borrowed before accruing it, but an Employee may not take more than they will accrue by the end of the calendar year.
C.	Sick leave is accrued only when the Employee is actively at work or on a paid leave. Employees do not accrue sick leave for absences or leave without pay. Therefore, taking time off without pay will reduce the amount of sick leave accrued in a year.

A.	Sick Leave - Any absence coded to Sick Leave.
B.	Absent Without Pay - An absence without pay after all Sick Leave is used.

The Sick Leave Usage Review Process is intended to apply to Employees who are out of sick leave, both accrued and available to borrow or are approaching absence without pay, and have not established an on-going medical reason for future absences charged.
A.	Sick Leave Usage Review - When an Employee is absent without pay or is approaching an absence without pay, the manager and the Employee may:
1.	Review the amount of Sick Time used.
2.	Review when Sick Leave will be renewed.
3.	Review the possibility of absences without pay.
4.	Review the fact that medical validation may be required for future absences.
16
If medical validation is required then management may require the Employee to provide medical validation of sick leave absence from a certified/licensed health care provider. Medical validation is required on the day the Employee returns to work.
B.	Discipline - A questionable Sick Leave Absence without medical validation may subject the Employee to Disciplinary Probation without the benefit of progressive discipline.
If there is a second questionable absence without the requested verification within twelve (12) months of the first action, the prior disciplinary documentation may be used in a progressive disciplinary action up to and including termination.
C.	Bidding - Refer to Article XI, Section 3B.
SECTION 5	- HOLIDAY DURING SICK LEAVE
In the event a Holiday, as listed in Article V, occurs during any effective period of Sick Leave, for which leave benefits are payable, the Employee shall be paid for this Holiday, and this day shall not be deducted from the Sick Leave benefits accumulated by the Employee.
SECTION 6	- SICK LEAVE MAKE UP
The Intent of Sick Leave Make Up time is to recognize the mutual needs of the Employee and the Employer.
Employees may, with their manager’s approval, make up time used for medical appointments, including those for immediate family members as defined in Article IX, Section 8, within the following guidelines:
1.	Time must be made up within the same pay period Sick Leave was taken.
2.	The date and time for the make up must be mutually agreed to by the Employee and Manager. It will not be considered time worked for the payment of overtime even if the hours fall on the sixth or seventh consecutive work day.
SECTION 7	- TERMINATION PAYOUT
A. All Employees hired on or after Apri1 1, 1983 and all Employees hired prior to April 1, 1983 who have made such election, shall upon qualified retirement, convert seventy percent (70%) of their unused accumulated Sick Leave into a non-cash account for payment of future group health premiums except sick leave accrued after December 31, 2005 will not be eligible for retiree health.
The amount of sick leave that may be used for retiree medical is the balance the Employee has at termination but not greater than the balance on 12/31/2005.
17
B.
Employees hired prior to April 1, 1983 who have so elected, shall be paid for unused accumulated Sick Leave upon termination subject to the five (5) year continuous service requirement as follows:
•	Employees commencing with the sixth (6th) year through the tenth (10th) year shall be paid unused accumulated Sick Leave in an amount that shall not exceed sixty (60) days upon termination of employment.
•	Employees with continuous service commencing with the eleventh (11th) through the nineteenth (19th) year shall be paid unused accumulated Sick Leave in an amount that shall not exceed eighty (80) days upon termination of employment.

Upon termination, payment for unused accumulated Sick Leave will be on an accrued basis at the rate of 5 hours per month. All Sick Leave payments shall be paid on the base salary of the Employee exclusive of shift differential or overtime. If an Employee terminates and has used unaccrued Sick Leave, that amount will be deductible from the Employee’s final paycheck or be collectible from the Employee. Employees on Extended Leave of Absence shall not use unaccrued Sick Leave.
ARTICLE VIII
PERSONAL LEAVE
SECTION 1	- USAGE AND NOTIFICATION

18
Personal leave is accrued only while the Employee is actively at work or on a paid leave. Employees do not accrue personal leave for absences or leave without pay. Therefore, taking time off without pay will reduce the amount of personal days accrued in a year.

The midpoint salary of the Employee’s former grade will be compared to the midpoints of the job classification salary structure to which the Employee is moving. The midpoint in the new structure that is closest to the midpoint of the former grade will become the base for determining the number of steps to the grade of the new position. The number of steps will then determine the applicable percentages shown below. If there are no steps, there will be no change in salary.

D.	If a position is reevaluated into a different job classification resulting in a one or more step increase, the Employee’s salary will be increased according to Section 3-C. If the reevaluation results in a step decrease, then Section 3-C will apply. If there is no step change there will be no change in salary.
E.	If a position is reevaluated and lowered within a classification, the salary of the Employee will not be reduced. However, if the salary exceeds the maximum for the new grade, there will be no further increase except for the negotiated increases concerning Employees over maximum.
F.	No Employee shall be paid more than the maximum wage of the grade in which the position is classified unless:
The Employee is being paid over the maximum as a result of a decrease in the maximum of the salary range of the job grade in which the Employee is working.

Thirty-nine (39) or Fewer Affected Employees by Business Unit:
In the event the Employer decides to subcontract, transfer, or outsource work and the subcontract, transfer, or outsource decision will result in a reduction in force of thirty-nine (39) or fewer bargaining unit Employees, the Employer shall give four (4) weeks notice to the Union. There will be no restrictions or obligation to bargain over the decision to subcontract, transfer, or outsource work or the effects of such subcontracting, transfer of work, or outsourcing.

SECTION 1	- PROCEDURE
If the Employer exercises its prerogative to implement a major reduction (40 or more Bargaining Unit Employees within a business unit), the parties will meet to discuss a transition plan aimed at placement of the displaced Employees. Employees who are not placed into jobs or are otherwise severed as a result of these efforts may be laid off following the procedures outlined below.
If the Employer exercises its prerogative to implement a lesser reduction (39 or fewer Bargaining Unit Employees within a business unit), the following procedure shall be adopted:
The Union and the Employer may agree to allow Employees within one or more of the affected Job Titles to volunteer to be laid off. Unless such agreement is reached and a sufficient number of Employees volunteer to be laid off, the Employee or Employees who will be laid off will be determined in accordance with the provisions of this section.
The Employee with the least amount of seniority in any Job Title, within a business unit, will be the first laid off from that job, subject to any State or Federal law. The Employee, in turn, may replace any Employee with lesser seniority within their current business unit within the bargaining unit (or non-bargaining unit Temporary, Limited Term or Student Employees), providing the Employee has the qualifications to satisfactorily perform the
54
job. Employees who are displaced from their jobs as a result of such bump back procedure may themselves bump back and replace any Employee with less seniority within their current business unit, providing such Employee has the necessary qualifications. (Displaced is defined as any Employee who has been bumped off a job, who has not been returned to a job in the same, higher or lower wage classification.) Employees shall retain full seniority irrespective of the bumping process. Employees who are laid off will retain full seniority for the two year recall period.
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, any Employee with five (5) or more years of Continuous Service who would otherwise be laid off as a result of subcontracting, transferring work, or outsourcing, shall be entitled to replace any Employee with less than five (5) years of Continuous Service within the bargaining unit, providing the more senior Employee has the qualifications to satisfactorily perform the job.
When there are multiple incumbents within a specific job, the laid off Employee will bump the least senior incumbent, (full-time to full-time; part-time to part-time).
SECTION 2	- NOTICE OF IMPENDING LAYOFF
An Employee targeted for layoff shall receive written notice of impending layoff as soon as the determination is made. A copy of this notice shall be given to the Chief Steward.

The following salary schedule for Call Marketing Center Representatives applies as indicated:
Min	Max

Depending upon the fund family there are break points, which can affect the amount of Dealer Concession. For example, a deposit over $100,000 the Dealer Concession may be only 3.0%. The EA calculation is 80% of the Dealer Concession for both the initial and all subsequent deposits.
C)	Outbound “Verified” TARP is calculated by waiting for 1 month after the actual or expected effective date of the upgrade, then checking for a period of 2 months to determine if changes have occurred. The change in Net Annualized Premium will be credited to the rep.
D)	The Net Annualized Premium or Deposited Dollars depending upon the product sold will be multiplied by the appropriate EAs (or Expense Allowances) for each product, then added together for all the products sold to determine the Total Rep EAs for the reporting period.

B)	Percentage of Target attained is calculated by dividing the Total EAs by the Total Goal for the quarter.

EXHIBIT H
CUNA MUTUAL GROUP VDT GUIDELINES
The CUNA Mutual Group has adopted the following guidelines for the use of VDTs. These guidelines should be implemented by department managers within their respective area. Consideration must be given to these guidelines with proper concern for expense control.
Lighting
1.	Departments using VDTs will have room lighting in the range of 30 to 50 foot candles to reduce eye fatigue. Light fixtures in A, G, and H wings with parabolic diffusing louver and light intensity adaptability need no change. VDT users in these wings will be advised to use one or two tube lumination.
2.	Overhead lighting in B, C and D wings will eventually be reduced to 30 to 50 foot candles.
3.	Lighting considerations will be assessed before moving Employees and/or departments to new locations.
4.	Whenever possible, VDTs will be positioned perpendicular to windows.
Equipment
1.	Older VDTs will be replaced by attrition through lease arrangements with newer models having both title and rotational flexibility and movable keyboards. Ideally, VDTs should be perpendicular with the desk surface. However, ten (10) to twenty (20) degrees of backward tilt of the screen is acceptable providing the angle doesn’t cause additional glare.
2.	VDT screens should be even or no more than fifteen (15) degrees below visual level.
3.	Screen surfaces will have neutral density or similar glare reducing coatings.
4.	Anti-glare screens will be provided on an “as needed” basis.
Furniture
1.	Task lights will be provided on an “as needed” basis. They will be both adjustable, movable, and louvered to reduce potential reflective glare.
2.	Seat height should allow elbows, wrists and keyboard to be parallel with the floor. After adjusting the seat height, feet should be flat on the floor and upper legs parallel to the floor. Back support should be present with support focused on belt
72
line.
3.	Employees transferring information from written materials to VDTs should be encouraged to use vertical holders placed the same level as the VDT screen.
4.	Chairs for VDT operators will meet corporate ergonomic standards and have adjustable features for height, tilt, swivel, and back height support. Chairs with arms are not recommended for Employees who key more than 2 hours per day. Employees will be instructed in proper positioning and adjusting of chairs by their department managers.
5.	All new furniture will be site tested prior to purchase.
Eye Examinations
1.	Initial and yearly eye exams will be conducted for all users on VDTs more than 30 percent of the workday. Facilities in the Medical Department are adequate for yearly screenings on a scheduled basis (block times).
2.	Eye examinations done outside CUNA Mutual Group will be scheduled on the Employee’s own time.
Break Periods
1.	Periodic eye rest breaks are desirable. Flexible interval breaks will be available under the discretionary control of the Employee’s supervisor. Breaks periods for eye rest are not convertible into longer exercise periods.
2.	Periodic overtime work for users of VDTs is a recognized necessity, but should be limited to two (2) hours a day or ten (10) hours a week with the exception of emergency situations. Excess hours will contribute to fatigue factors resulting in decreased productivity.
Miscellaneous
1.	Reflected glare will effectively be reduced by using darker hued carpeting, louvered diffusers, and matte surfaces of keyboards and desk tops. Use of vertical window blinds is less effective than current drapes, but will diffuse light and allow distant vision relaxation.
2.	Hard copy printers will be placed in areas not proximal to VDTs to reduce noise distraction or hearing injury with concern for space limitations.

EXHIBIT L
CUNA MUTUAL GROUP VOLUNTARY SEVERANCE PLAN
The purpose of the CUNA Mutual Group Voluntary Severance Plan is to provide a severance option for Employees employed by CUNA Mutual Insurance Society who are being laid off as a result of the reduction of bargaining unit staff.
1.	Eligible Employee. An “Eligible Employee” is an Employee as defined in Article II, Section 2, Subsection A. of the parties’ 2008 collective bargaining agreement who:
(a)	(i) Is employed by CUNA Mutual and receives a notice of lay off from
CUNA Mutual; or (ii) was on a medical leave of absence, had his or her position eliminated or was bumped while out on the medical leave of absence, and was released by his or her treating health care provider to return to work within one year of the date on which the medical leave began; and
(b)	Submits (i) a resignation which is irrevocable unless it is subsequently determined by CUNA Mutual that the Employee is not eligible for a severance benefit under this Plan and (ii) a written application for severance to the Labor Relations Consultant in CUNA Mutual’s Human Resources Division by the date which is four (4) weeks after he or she receives written notice of lay off. A person described in section 1(a)(ii) above must submit his or her resignation and application for severance within four (4) weeks after being released by his or her health care provider to return to work and receiving notification that his or her position is filled or eliminated.
(c)	In any event, an Employee who is or who might otherwise be an Eligible Employee shall cease to be an Eligible Employee at the time he or she successfully bumps another Employee.
2.	Severance Pay. An Eligible Employee who files an application for a severance benefit and provides CUNA Mutual a waiver and release, will receive severance payments in an amount equal to two (2) weeks salary multiplied by the Eligible Employee’s number of full years of Continuous Service; provided, however, that the minimum amount of severance pay shall be eight (8) weeks if the Eligible Employee has at least one full year of Continuous Service; seven (7) weeks if the Eligible Employee has at least ten (10) full months of Continuous Service; five (5) weeks if the Eligible Employee has at least seven (7) full months of Continuous Service; and three (3) weeks if the Eligible Employee has less than seven (7) full months of Continuous Service. The maximum amount of severance pay shall be equal to fifty-two (52) weeks of salary. The period of time for which severance pay is
80
payable shall be known as the Severance Period. For purposes of calculating an Eligible Employee’s severance pay, the term “salary” shall include only base compensation, and shall not include overtime, shift differential, bonuses, incentive compensation, fringe benefits, or any other compensation or payments to the Eligible Employee. The salary of part-time Employees will be determined by hours reflected in CUNA Mutual’s records. If a dispute arises concerning a part-time Employee’s salary or work hours, it will be resolved by examining actual hours worked during the 13 week period immediately prior to the Employee’s termination. The term “Continuous Service” shall be calculated in accordance with Article X, Sections 3 and 4 of the collective bargaining agreement, except that employment with any company within the CUNA Mutual Group shall be treated as employment with the Employer. The severance pay will be subject to deductions which are either required by law or authorized by the Employee.
The severance pay will be paid in bi-weekly installments, with each installment being in an amount equal to the Eligible Employee’s bi-weekly salary at the time the Eligible Employee terminated employment with CUNA Mutual; provided, that if an Eligible Employee is entitled to an odd number of weeks of salary (3, 5 or 7), either the first or the final severance pay installment will be in an amount equal to one-half of the Eligible Employee’s bi-weekly salary at the time the Employee terminated employment with CUNA Mutual. The first installment of severance pay will be paid within thirty (30) days after the later of (a) the date the Eligible Employee delivers a properly-executed waiver and release to CUNA Mutual; or (b) the Eligible Employee’s last day of work at CUNA Mutual. However, CUNA Mutual has the right to combine two or more installment payments. In the event an Eligible Employee dies before receiving all the severance pay installments due the Eligible Employee, the remaining installments will be paid to the Eligible Employee’s estate, with CUNA Mutual retaining the right to pay the remaining installments in a lump sum.
In the event the Eligible Employee becomes re-employed by CUNA Mutual prior to receiving all of the severance pay installments to which he or she would otherwise be entitled, no further severance pay installments will be due or paid to the Eligible Employee.
3.	Health Benefits. If an Eligible Employee who provides a waiver and release has group medical, dental and/or vision coverage in effect at the time the Eligible Employee terminates employment with CUNA Mutual, CUNA Mutual will continue, for the duration of the Severance Period, the medical, dental and/or vision coverage that the Eligible Employee had in place at the time his or her employment terminated, subject to the Eligible Employee paying the premium for such coverage to the same extent as is required of similarly-situated, actively employed Employees. The amount of the required contribution will change as the amount required of similarly-situated, actively
81
employed Employees changes. In the event that at some point during the Severance Period, the medical, dental or vision coverage that the Eligible Employee had in place at the time of termination is no longer available to Employees, the Eligible Employee will be offered coverage which is the same as or substantially similar to the coverage then being offered to similarly-situated, actively employed Employees, at a cost equal to the cost required of similarly-situated, actively employed Employees. In the event the medical, dental or vision provider requires that coverage for terminated employees be continued under COBRA, then if the Eligible Employee wishes to continue the medical, dental or vision coverage, such coverage will have to be continued pursuant to COBRA; the Eligible Employee will have to complete the appropriate COBRA continuation form(s); and the Eligible Employee will have to pay the premium for the COBRA-continued coverage to the same extent as is required of similarly-situated, actively employed Employees who are enrolled in the program covering active employees.
All compensation paid to an Eligible Employee for waiving coverage for group medical, dental or vision will cease to accrue and no further payments will be paid after the date the Employee terminates employment.
4.	Life Insurance. For an Eligible Employee who provides a waiver and release, CUNA Mutual will continue, subject to the terms, conditions and provisions of the applicable plans, the Eligible Employee’s life insurance coverage which was in place at the time of the Eligible Employee’s termination of employment for the duration of the Severance Period. As a condition to continued coverage under this Section 4, an Eligible Employee must make such premium contributions as are required to be made from time to time by similarly-situated, actively-employed Employees. For purposes of this Section 4, the coverages which continue, subject to an Eligible Employee’s paying the applicable premium therefor, include basic life insurance, optional Group Term Life Insurance, Spouse/Dependent Term Life Insurance, and Voluntary Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance. When the extended coverage period under this Section 4 terminates, the Eligible Employee will have such continuation or conversion rights as may be provided by law or CUNA Mutual’s plan(s).
5.	Other Benefits.
(a)	Time-Off Benefits. An Eligible Employee’s right (if any) to receive payment for any accumulated time off benefits and an Eligible Employee’s right (if any) to use accumulated sick leave to pay for a portion of the Eligible Employee’s retiree medical coverage will be governed by the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement in effect at the time the Eligible Employee terminates his or her employment, and will not be affected by an Eligible Employee’s decision to take a severance benefit.
82
(b)	Outplacement. An Eligible Employee who provides a waiver and
release will be eligible to receive the basic level of outplacement assistance from an outplacement firm or consultant selected by CUNA Mutual. If the Eligible Employee wishes to use the outplacement assistance, the Eligible Employee must utilize the benefit within one month after his or her employment terminates.
6.	Bridging to Qualified Retirement Events. If an Eligible Employee who provides CUNA Mutual with a waiver and release has a “Qualified Retirement Event” that occurs within the Severance Period, CUNA Mutual will place the Eligible Employee on paid leave of absence for such period of time (the “Leave Period”) as may be necessary for the Eligible Employee to reach his or her Qualified Retirement Event. The sole purpose of the Leave Period is to enable the Eligible Employee to attain his or her Qualified Retirement Event. The Eligible Employee will not be required to (and shall not) perform any labor or service for CUNA Mutual during the Leave Period. Once the Eligible Employee has attained his or her Qualified Retirement Event, the Eligible Employee will be taken off of paid leave status and his or her employment will officially be terminated; however, the Eligible Employee will continue to be eligible for the benefits outlined in Paragraph 2, 3, 4 and 5 for the balance of the Severance Period.
During the Leave Period segment of the Severance Period, in addition to the benefits outlined in Paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5, the Eligible Employee will also continue to participate in CUNA Mutual’s retirement plans for Represented Employees and will also continue to accrue vacation, sick leave and personal leave. Other than as described above, the Eligible Employee will not participate in any CUNA Mutual benefit plans nor will he or she be eligible to receive any bonuses (Longevity, CSSP, Holiday, other) that might otherwise be payable within the Leave Period.
For purposes of this Paragraph 6, a Qualified Retirement Event is defined as, and limited to, one of the following: the date on which an Eligible Employee first (a) attains Magic 85 under the Defined Benefit Pension Plan; (b) becomes eligible for an Early Retirement benefit under the Defined Benefit Pension Plan; (c) attains “Qualified Retirement” for retiree medical purposes; or (d) becomes vested under the Defined Benefit Pension Plan.
Example of Bridging: An Eligible Employee with 24-1/2 years of Continuous Service would become eligible for Magic 85 twenty weeks after her employment would terminate in the absence of the special bridging feature. If the Eligible Employee opts for a severance, the first 20 weeks of the Severance Period will be treated as a Leave Period. At the end of the Leave Period, the Eligible Employee would have 28 weeks remaining in the
83
Severance Period.
7.	Seniority on Rehire. This is a voluntary severance program. Persons who receive benefits under this Plan have voluntarily resigned from CUNA Mutual. Should such persons become rehired by CUNA Mutual, they will be treated as persons who had previously voluntarily resigned their employment.
8.	Waiver of Rights. The parties agree that Eligible Employees who elect this severance have voluntarily resigned their employment with CUNA Mutual. Therefore, severing Employees do not have contractual rights afforded under the collective bargaining agreement to Employees who are involuntarily laid off. This includes, but is not limited to, loss of bumping, notice and recall rights. Further, Eligible Employees who elect a severance are not Employees of CUNA Mutual after the last day they are actively at work even though they may be receiving severance pay or other benefits under this Plan.
As a condition precedent to receiving any benefits under this Plan, an Eligible Employee is required to sign the waiver and release in a form determined by and provided by CUNA Mutual.
9.	Term of Agreement. This Severance Plan shall be in full force and effect for the term of the collective bargaining agreement.

Education is “job-related” if it:
•	Maintains or improves skills required for your current job position or
87
•	Meets the express requirements of CUNA Mutual Group or requirements of applicable law for retention of your job status or rate of compensation.
Tuition reimbursement for graduate-level classes - education assistance cannot be excluded from your taxable income if the reimbursement was provided so that you can meet the minimum educational requirements for employment or if the education was preparing you for a new job position. You must have each graduate-level course evaluated to determine if the course is job-related. Your supervisor/department manager will make the determination as to whether the course is or isn’t “related.” HR will follow up with the manager prior to reimbursing any tuition. You are encouraged to meet with your supervisors and department managers to discuss the content of graduate-level courses before registration so that this determination can be made on a fully informed basis.

EMPLOYEE TRANSFERS OR REHIRES
The following describes the procedure governing the employment and benefits provisions applicable to Employees transferring within or being rehired to CUNA Mutual Group Companies from a position outside of the bargaining unit to a position in the bargaining unit. Such transfer or rehire will include being covered under the standard benefit programs of CUNA Mutual Insurance Society. For certain plans, credit will be given for prior service with CUNA Mutual Group Companies.
Prior Service Credit is defined as the amount of time the Employee has been employed by the previous employer within the CUNA Mutual Group Companies and all companies herein, as determined by the previous employer at the time of transfer or rehire. The following is a summary of how benefits will be maintained as a result of such a transfer or rehire:

CUNA Mutual Insurance Society non-represented Employees who had a grandfathered sick leave balance on December 31, 2001, and CUNA Mutual Insurance Society represented Employees who had a grandfathered sick leave balance on December 31, 2005 will retain that balance for purposes of retiree health. An Employee will begin to accrue sick leave under the CUNA Mutual Collective Bargaining schedule upon transfer or rehire. Accrual is unlimited.
Vacation: An Employee’s accrued vacation as of the transfer date will be carried over and placed in your account with CUNA Mutual Insurance Society and can be used upon transfer subject to management approval. The Employee will begin to accrue vacation under the CUNA Mutual Collective Bargaining Agreement schedule upon transfer or rehire.

The Employee will receive Prior Service Credit for purposes of your vacation accrual schedule, but not for purposes of the vacation planner.

Pension Plan: The Employee will be given Prior Service Credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and eligibility for early retirement including “Magic 85” under the CUNA Mutual Pension Plan for Represented Employees. Prior Service Credit is not given for purposes of benefit accrual, except for the accrued benefit for grandfathered participants under the CUNA Mutual Insurance Society plan as of December 31, 2001 or under the CUNA Mutual Pension Plan for Represented Employees as of August 31, 2005.
89
Service Recognition: Prior Service Credit is given for purposes of the Corporate Service Recognition Program.

EXHIBIT Q
RETIREMENT & INVESTMENT SERVICES CENTER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
I)	All Provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement apply to participating Employees in the RISC department unless otherwise modified by this exhibit.
II)	The annual across the board increase in Article XVII will be calculated by including incentive compensation with base salary to determine the amount of the increase, which will then be applied to the base salary.
III)	Gross Dealer Concessions (GDC) will be earned according to the Product Rate Schedule - GDC, which will be made available to all participating Employees.
IV)	Beginning at the completion of the second quarter of 2008, participating employees will be eligible for a GDC incentive, at the GDC Incentive Rate shown in the table below, based upon the representative’s Calendar Year to Date GDC after the threshold amount is met. At the end of each quarterly calendar period the representative’s GDC incentive will be determined by applying the GDC Incentive Rate to the current Year to Date GDC produced by the representative after threshold is met. The GDC dollars that have already been applied to pay incentive compensation to the Employee will be subtracted from the Year to Date GDC in order to determine the amount now payable to the Employee. On an annual basis, during subsequent years of this agreement, management will determine the threshold for commission and GDC Incentive Rate.
V)	Threshold must be met to start receiving commission. For 2008, the threshold will be 50,000.00 GDC dollars and commission will start at 50,000.01. For every GDC earned beginning at 50,000.01 through 300,000.00 the participating Employee will receive a flat 10% payout. For every GDC beginning with and over 300,000.01 the participating Employee will receive a flat 7% payout.
Example - The Employee earns the following GDCs: 1st Quarter = 60,000 GDCs, 2nd Quarter = 30,000 GDCs, 3rd Quarter = 40,000 GDCs, 4th Quarter = 35,000 GDCs, total 165,000 GDCs. The Employee would receive $1,000 for the 1st Quarter, $3,000 for the 2nd Quarter, $4,000 for the 3rd Quarter and $3,500 for the 4th Quarter.
Year to Date GDC	Max for Range	
0.00 - 50,000.00	0%	Base Salary
50,000.01 - 300,000.00	10%	Base + 10%
300,000.01 - over	7%	Base + 7%
94
VI)	Plan Participation
A)	If a participating Employee moves into another position within CUNA Mutual during the quarter and has earned enough GDCs at the time of their position change to qualify for a payment, they will receive a payment for that quarter for the GDCs they had earned prior to leaving the RISC department.
B)	If a participating Employee terminates employment with CUNA Mutual, either voluntarily or involuntarily, during the quarter they will not be eligible to receive a payment.
VII)	Employees will be provided time to make the necessary contacts to ensure compliance with any guidelines set by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), Financial Industry Regulatory Agency (FINRA) or any other regulatory agency with oversight over their transactions.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN
CUNA MUTUAL INSURANCE SOCIETY
AND
OFFICE & PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION LOCAL 39
(Employee Buy Out)
April 1, 2008
CUNA Mutual Insurance Society (Company) and Office & Professional Employees International Union, Local 39 (Union) enter into this Agreement for an Employee Buy Out. The provisions of such Employee Buy Out are as follows.
The Company will provide two (2) voluntary termination options to eligible Employees under the provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding. Eligible Employees are defined as those Employees who are eligible for Longevity payments as of December 31, 2008.
Eligible Employees will be provided the opportunity to choose a voluntary termination and receive a buy out payment under one of the following two options:
•	Option 1 - One (1) week of pay for every full year of service, with a maximum eligibility of fifty-two (52) weeks. Payments will be made on a bi-weekly basis and Health Benefits and Life Insurance Benefits will be provided on the same basis as in Exhibit L for the duration of buy out payments.
•	Option 2 - One (1) week and one (1) day of pay for every full year of service, with a maximum eligibility of fifty-two (52) weeks. Payment will be made in a lump sum and no benefits will be provided.
There will be three (3) selection windows and three (3) corresponding termination windows as follows:
Selection Window
April 28, 2008 - June 7, 2008
July 28, 2008 - August 23, 2008
November 3, 2008 - December 6, 2008
Termination Window
June 9, 2008 - August 15, 2008
October 20, 2008 - December 20, 2008
January 5, 2009 - March 31, 2009
Employees can self nominate to the Union during any selection window on a first come basis. The Company reserves the right to limit the number of nominations to 75 per window and to 165 in total. The Company may choose to allow participation above either number. The Company reserves the right to determine the date an employee will terminate within the termination window.
Employees who terminate under this Employee Buy Out provision will receive the same CSSP treatment as a laid off employee, per the terms of the Agreement.
Employees eligible to receive a Longevity payment whose Longevity anniversary falls within the timeframe of the selected termination window will be paid a Longevity payment on the Employee’s anniversary date, regardless of the date the Employee’s work assignment ends.
97
If an Employee who elects Option 1 becomes eligible for Magic 85, as defined in the Pension Plan, within the period of time that buy-out payments are being made to the Employee, the Employee will be bridged to the date the Employee first becomes eligible for Magic 85 provided the Employee selects Option 1 and also selects a Termination Window during which the Employee will become eligible to be bridged to Magic 85.
Example of Bridging: An Eligible Employee with 24-1/2 years of Continuous Service would become eligible for Magic 85 twenty (20) weeks after her employment would terminate in the absence of the special bridging feature. If the Eligible Employee opts for a buy-out under Option 1, the first twenty (20) weeks of the period during which buy-out payments are made will be treated as a Leave Period. At the end of the Leave Period, the Eligible Employee would have four (4) weeks of buy-out payments remaining.
If an Employee elects Option 1 and also selects a Termination Window during which the Employee would have become eligible to be bridged to Magic 85, but the Employer selects a termination date prior to the date on which the Employee would have become eligible for bridging to Magic 85, the Employee can elect to use the Employee’s paid time off balances to fill the gap between the end of the buy-out period and the date on which the Employee would become eligible for bridging to Magic 85. Available paid time off balances will be used in the following order:
•	Vacation
•	Personal
•	Sick
Example of Bridging using paid time off balance: Employee selects the June - August termination window knowing that a termination date of August 1 in addition to the duration of buy-out payments would bridge the Employee to Magic 85 eligibility. Company decides to end the Employee’s work assignment two weeks prior to August 1. Employee would use paid time off balances in the appropriate order to bridge the period from the end of buy-out payments to the date eligibility for Magic 85 eligibility is reached.
This Agreement represents the entire agreement of the parties. Subjects not specifically referred to herein are not part of this Agreement. There are no oral understandings, statements, promises, or inducements contrary to the terms of this Agreement. In addition, this Agreement shall not set a precedent.
