An employee must make such request to his or her supervisor or designated alternate for approval no later than the day before in which the vacation is requested. In the event of a denial, the employee may also seek approval from the next level of management.

Section 4.	LIMITATION TO ROLLOVER OF SICK LEAVE PAY: As noted herein above, an employee will be entitled to rollover any unused allocated sick leave pay into his/her STD bank. The STD bank, however, is limited to 120 hours and may not be increased over and above such amount.
Section 5.	Upon separation from employment by termination, resignation, retirement or death, the employee or the employee’s estate will be eligible to receive a maximum of 40 hours of the unused sick leave pay or prior sick leave hours in an employee’s STD bank. In regard to payment of unused sick leave, payment is limited to 10 hours for each quarter worked.

(a)	Subject to the other terms of the Plan, as it is amended for the freezing of the Plan, any Participant under the Plan on the Freeze Date will be eligible to continue participation after the Freeze Date and will continue to accrue Service or “continuous service” solely for vesting purposes (i.e. determining Years of Vesting Service) as per the terms of the Plan.
(b)	No Participant will accrue after the Freeze Date any additional Accrued Benefit or any additional full or partial Years of Credited Service or other additional or increased benefits (including pre-retirement death benefits) attributable to any service (including, without limitation, “Service,” as defined under the Plan) and/or age or other status that would otherwise arise or accrue after the Freeze Date, and no “applicable benefit rate,” “benefit credit rate” or “benefit rate” under the Plan (including, without limitation, any such rate set forth in any Appendix to the Plan) will be recognized for any period of service or reemployment after the Freeze Date regardless of the bargaining unit or other group of employees, if any, to which any such rate may be assigned under or pursuant to the Plan. The statutory dollar maximum limitation on benefits and compensation imposed by Code Sections 415 and 401(a)(17) under the Plan shall be governed solely by such dollar limitations as in effect on the Freeze Date, and they shall not be adjusted for any reason thereafter.
Crafts - 40
(c)	All prior freezing of benefits, cessations and/or voluntary waivers of participation, in the Plan for any or all categories of Participants will remain in effect. If a Participant rejoins the Plan following a reemployment occurring after the Freeze Date, the Participant will participate in the Plan, but only under the terms of the Plan as it is amended including the freezing of the Plan that is effective as of the Freeze Date.
All capitalized terms in this Paragraph 25 will have the meaning given to them in the Plan unless the context requires otherwise.
Section 2.	The Company will continue to provide a 401(k) Plan with the Company match as set forth in the plan for all active employees and as amended effective January 1, 2017. Details of the plan are available in the plan booklet.

Section 2.	Intermittent Leave/Reduced - Employees on intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule may be transferred temporarily to an available alternative position for which the employee is qualified and that better accommodates recurring leave periods than the employee’s regular position. The alternate position must have equivalent pay and benefits.

Affirmative Action Plan - The parties recognize the requirement that the Company, as a Federal government contractor, adopt an affirmative action plan which includes goals, objectives, and timetables for the recruitment, employment, training, and upgrading of minority employees, female employees, handicapped employees, disabled veterans, and veterans of the Vietnam Era employees. The contracting Union(s) agree to support the Company's Affirmative Action Plan and will assist in the achievement of established goals and objectives within the bargaining unit(s) covered by this Agreement. The contracting Union(s) will be advised of applicable goals, objectives, and timetables.
Section 5.	Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) - The Union and the Company will comply with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Crafts - 42
Section 6.	Special Provision - The provisions of this Article will not operate to invalidate any other term or condition of this Agreement.
Section 7.	Posting of Policy Statements - Copies of the Company's nondiscrimination policy shall be posted by the Company in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment.
ARTICLE 26	- APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM
Section 1. The Company may conduct an apprenticeship program which, if installed, will be consistent with the standards set by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Apprenticeship. The initial establishment and continuance of an apprenticeship program will be at the Company's discretion.
ARTICLE 27	- MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS
Section 1.	Post-Employment Offer of Employment Examinations - A satisfactory medical examination, according to the Standards set by the Company, shall be a condition of employment, with the cost of such examination borne by the Company. No compensation will be made to the potential employee for time consumed in undergoing an examination under this section.
Section 2.	Periodic Examinations - The Company will provide, at its expense, a qualified designated medical advisor who will examine employees at intervals during the term of their employment. Employees will submit to the examination as a condition of continuance of employment.
The Company will provide a drug-free workplace to all employees, and Company Administrative Practice & Procedure (AP&P) 49 provides the guidelines for ensuring we remain a drug-free workplace. If a current employee tests positive for alcohol or marijuana, and if rehabilitation is agreed upon by the employee, and if the employee has not previously violated the Company’s policy on drug-
Crafts - 43
free workplace or previously tested positive for alcohol or marijuana; the Company will agree to the employee’s request to enter treatment subject to the provisions of AP&P 49.
Excluding alcohol and marijuana, if the confirmed positive test is for any illegal/illicit drug or substance, including abuse of legal prescriptions, the Company will immediately suspend without pay until the employee exercises or fails to exercise their right to have a second confirmatory test conducted. Upon learning that the second confirmatory test is positive or if the employee refuses to request the second test, employment will be terminated.
Section 3.	Termination Examinations - Employees will
submit to physical examinations, including chest X-rays, at the Company's expense, immediately prior to termination of employment when required by the Company. Further, the Company agrees that an employee may request and receive an exit physical examination, including X-rays, if appropriate and necessary, at the Company's expense and be given a copy of the Company's physical classification rating as a result of such examination.
Section 4.	Work-Related Examination
A.	If an examination reveals an employee has sustained an injury or disease that is related to his work, the Company will provide remedies required by law.
B.	If an examination reveals an employee has developed susceptibility to injurious effects from material with which he works, the employee will immediately be removed from the job involving exposure to the materials for a period as determined by the Medical Director. If such a job is available in the Unit, the employee will be assigned a job involving no exposure to similar materials. Such assignment, if made, will be subject to the seniority provisions of this Agreement and subject to the condition that the rate established for that job will be applicable during the prescribed period. Should another physical examination reveal continued susceptibility to injurious effects from exposure to those materials, the employee will
Crafts - 44
be removed permanently from the job requiring such exposure and given an appropriate physical classification rating. The affected employee will replace another similar employee having less seniority in the same job classification. If there are no other such employees in the same job classification with less seniority, the Company will endeavor to assign the affected employee to other work in another job classification in the same seniority group not involving exposure.
Section 5.	Contested Examination - In addition to the specific provisions of Section 4 above, the Company's Medical Director shall in other cases determine whether or not an employee is physically able to perform the duties of an assigned job. However, any employee may, if in his opinion an injustice has been done him arising out of an examination performed by a Company physician, or a determination by the Medical Director, have himself re-examined at his expense by another physician of his choice, who after being properly informed as to the exact nature of the duties to be performed by the employee, will render a written statement as to the employee's ability to perform the assigned jobs. If no agreement can be reached between the Company's physician and the employee's physician, the question will be referred to a third physician, mutually satisfactory to the Company and the employee, who, after being properly informed as to the exact nature of the work involved and the physical condition of the employee, including a further physical examination of the employee by himself or specialist(s) selected by him, will decide the medical questions involved. Expenses incurred in connection with the services of the third physician, including fees, travel, and all other associated costs, will be shared equally by the Company and the Union. If, after settlement of all medical questions by the above procedure, the parties cannot agree as to other aspects of the case, the employee may resort to the grievance procedure, including arbitration, as provided in Article 29 of this Agreement, for final disposition.
Crafts - 45
ARTICLE 28	- SENIORITY
Section 1.	Purpose - The purpose of seniority is to provide an objective and mutually agreeable standard by which certain interactions between employer and employee may be governed. Seniority provides management with a useful vehicle to objectively determine which employee has priority over other members of his seniority group when circumstances as discussed herein require his selection. Through seniority each employee has a vested right accruing as a result of his tenure within the seniority group which may be exercised to his benefit as the occasion arises.
Section 2.	Scope - Seniority will be calculated as the length of continuous service with the Company in a designated seniority group. Seniority shows the relationship of one employee to all others in the same seniority group with respect to the application of this Article. The employee in the seniority group who has the longest cumulative period of service in that seniority group, no part of which has been forfeited under any terms of this Agreement or any prior Agreement, shall have the highest seniority in that seniority group.
Section 3.	Seniority Accrual and Records
A.	Seniority Within a Group
1.	During the first 90 calendar days that an employee is employed in a seniority group, such employee shall have no seniority or seniority rights in that group. Upon completion of this period, seniority will then have accrued from the first day the individual was employed in that job classification. After an employee has performed such work as has been assigned to him for as long as 90 calendar days, he will be considered as having the ability to perform the work of the job classification he holds. However, such a determination is not considered irrevocable; and continued employment is dependent upon continued satisfactory job performance. Any contention by the Company that an employee’s service is unsatisfactory
Crafts - 46
may, at the employee’s option, be reviewed through the established grievance procedure, except that which is determined during his first 90 calendar days in a given seniority group. Intermittent periods of employment which are separated by a termination from the Company for any reason, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, shall not entitle an employee to accrue time toward the qualifying period of calendar days referred to in this Section.
2.	Upon completion of an apprenticeship program, the individual will not be required to complete the probationary period stated above.
B.	Seniority Groups - An employee will be credited with seniority in the seniority group within which his particular job classification falls. The seniority group within which an individual’s seniority is maintained is based on job classifications required related skills.
C.	Seniority Lists - Seniority lists covering present employees who have been in the Company’s employ 90 calendar days or longer, will be provided by the Company, posted on the bulletin boards, and copies furnished to the Union. Revised lists will be prepared at intervals of six months. It will be the responsibility of the employee, directly or through the appropriate union representative, to protest his status with respect to any seniority list posted by the Company. However, a protest shall have no validity whatsoever if made after an employee has been terminated from the Company’s payroll records unless the protest is made within the time limitations specified in the Complaint and Grievance Procedure Article of this Agreement.
D.	Termination of Seniority - Any of the following causes will terminate the seniority of an employee or former employee: 1.	Voluntary quitting.
2.	Discharge for just cause.
3.	Failure to accept re-employment	in accordance with
the provisions of this Article.
Crafts - 47
4.	Permanent total disability on account of occupational injury or illness.
5.	Failure to resume active work with the Company within two weeks after being released from a physician's care in case of disability on account of occupational or nonoccupational injury or illness.
6.	Failure to report to work for three consecutive working days without an explanation satisfactory to the Company.
7.	Expiration of 30 months since date of reduction-in-force.
8.	Retirement under the Pension Agreement.
9.	Being on a leave of absence, STD or LTD for six (6) months. (An employee is eligible for reinstatement pursuant to the six month termination MOU attached hereto.)
E.	Seniority Accounting
1.	Any employee accepting an assignment outside the Unit or seniority group, including a supervisory job, but remaining in the employ of the Company at this Plant, shall retain that seniority he has accumulated in the Unit, and shall assume whatever job his seniority entitles him should he later return to the bargaining unit and/or seniority group.
2.	However, in the event an employee working in a job covered by this Agreement is promoted to a supervisory mechanical position with the Company, he will retain and continue to accrue seniority in his seniority group(s).
Section 4.	Layoff and Recall
A.	Layoff
1.	If a layoff (temporary layoff or furlough or a reductionin-force layoff) is expected by the Company to last for no more than fourteen (14) calendar days, those employees whose work is reduced or stopped will be placed on temporary layoff (or furlough). If such
Crafts - 48
reduction or stoppage of work should extend for more than fourteen (14) calendar days, the employees temporarily laid off will be controlled by paragraph (2) below.
2.	If a layoff (temporary layoff or furlough or reduction-in-force layoff) is for more than fourteen (14) calendar days, the least senior employee will be laid off, provided the remaining employees are fully qualified and are able to perform the essential functions of the remaining jobs. In some cases, an employee may not be fully qualified if the employee has not been certified to perform the job.
3.	If the retention of a less senior employee is necessary for there to be sufficient employees who are fully qualified for the remaining jobs, the employee or employees placed on layoff will be the least senior of the employees who are not fully qualified to perform the remaining jobs.
4.	The Company may, at its discretion, allow a more senior employee to accept layoff, but such employee must return to work in the event of a recall or forfeit seniority.
B.	Recall
1.	Recall of laid off employees will be in order of seniority provided the more senior employee or employees are qualified to perform the essential functions of the available job or jobs.
2.	Recall will be by telephone, but if personal contact is not made, the Company will forward written notice of recall to an eligible former employee via certified mail to the address furnished to the Company by the employee. A period of three calendar days from the date of receipt of such written notice will be allowed for the former employee to reply to the Company and indicate whether or not he will accept employment. If he refuses the offer of employment, his seniority will be terminated. If he accepts the offer of employment,
Crafts - 49
he shall report to work on the date specified by the Company or within seven calendar days from the date the recall notice is mailed, whichever is later. If he fails to report for work within the limits specified above, his seniority will be terminated.
3.	If an individual is ill (including pregnancy) or injured at the time of recall to the degree that he is unable to accept employment and such condition is supported by a written statement from a physician, he will not forfeit recall rights but will be continued in an eligible status for the remainder of the period set forth in this Article. An individual affected by this provision may return to work at any time prior to the expiration of the aforementioned period, provided he obtains permission of the Company's Medical Director, furnishes at least ten days' notice to the Company, and has sufficient seniority to displace a junior employee.
4.	If the duration of the available work assignment is for fourteen (14) calendar days or less, the Company is not required to go through recall procedures.
C.	Work Assignments - An employee may exercise seniority in his seniority group to determine a choice of shift, provided that a vacancy exists on the selected shift. Notice of shift vacancies will be posted on appropriate bulletin boards. Positions will be filled with the intent to maximize production efficiency and employee welfare.
D.	Temporary Employees
1.	The Company may retain temporary employees from a temporary employment agency to perform necessary work under the following circumstances: a. When additional Craft Unit work is needed and
an opening is not available, the Company may contact a temporary employment agency and have the agency contact individuals on the AO RIF and active recall list of that Craft Unit for purposes of working at the plant as a temporary
Crafts - 50
employee. The use of temporary employees will not cause a layoff or impede the recall of any bargaining unit employee when an opening exists as determined by the Company. The use of temporary employees will not be used for the elimination of any bargaining unit position or classification.
b.	In the event the employee accepts the temporary position, his 30 month recall right period shall be frozen while working in temporary status. The individual shall not be considered an employee of the Company and shall receive his compensation and benefits from the temporary employment agency.
c.	In the event the employee elects not to accept the temporary position, his 30 month recall right period shall continue to run.
ARTICLE 29	- COMPLAINT AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Grievances will be settled exclusively by the following procedure:
Section 1.	Steps in Procedure - Consisting of three steps, the first and second steps of this procedure will be good faith efforts by both parties to settle the dispute promptly and earnestly by open discussion and negotiation. The third step will be binding arbitration.
Section 2.	Initiation of Complaint - A grievance is initiated as a complaint, which may be raised by any employee or by the Union.
Section 3.	Employee Initiated Complaint - A complaint initiated by an employee will be processed as follows:
A.	Preliminary Step - Any employee having a complaint relating to the administration of the Labor Agreement shall discuss the matter with his department head or an appropriately designated Company representative within
Crafts - 51
five working days from the date of the incident. He may request the assistance of a steward if he wishes.
B.	Step One - If a satisfactory disposition of the complaint is not reached within three working days through the preliminary discussion step, the employee shall reduce his complaint to writing, using the form provided by the Company for this purpose. The form shall be signed by the employee and by the steward if applicable. The employee and/or steward will forward one copy to the Personnel Department immediately upon initiation of the written complaint. The department head or designated Company representative will then have two working days to submit his answer to the employee's complaint and state his position on the matter. If the answer is accepted, the employee and steward, if applicable, shall sign the form indicating acceptance. If it is not accepted, the department head or designated Company representative shall, within two additional working days, sign the form and enter it in Step Two.
C.	Step Two - If the complaint is not satisfactorily disposed of in Step One, the forms will be forwarded to the Personnel Department. At a meeting to be held within 30 days of receipt of the grievance for the purpose of discussing such complaints, the matter will be reviewed by the Business Representative and appropriate steward and the Human Resources Manager or designated representative, with such other parties in attendance as are called by the principal participants. The Company and the Union shall earnestly strive to resolve the complaint in Step Two during the meeting. If the parties fail to reach agreement in Step Two and determine that the subject of the complaint is a proper subject for a grievance as that term is defined in Article 5, then the complaint shall at that time be recorded as a grievance. If the Company does not respond within seven (7) working days, the grievance is considered settled in favor of the Union provided the Union first serves on the Human Resources Manager or designated representative a
Crafts - 52
written statement that the Union intends to claim that the grievance is settled in favor of the Union and a statement of just what such settlement in favor of the Union will be and allows the Company two (2) workdays to respond in writing to the Union either accepting or rejecting the Union’s proposed settlement. If the position of the Company is unacceptable to the Union, a period of seven days from the next membership meeting following the Company’s response will be allowed for referral to Step Three.
D.	Step Three - A dispute not resolved in Step Two may be referred to arbitration by the Union or the employee within seven working days as provided above. Notice of intent to arbitrate shall be forwarded by the originating party to the Company via registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. The time of delivery of the aforementioned notice shall govern with respect to compliance with the time limitation involved. If no notice of intent to arbitrate is forwarded within the specified time limit, further processing of the grievances shall be barred.
Section 4.	Union Initiated Grievance - Complaints originated by the Union will be handled as outlined in Section 3 of this Article, except that Step One will be omitted and the matter discussed initially in Step Two. The Business Representative, any officer, or properly designated steward may originate a grievance on behalf of the Union.
Section 5.	Arbitration - The procedure for binding arbitration will be as follows:
A.	It shall be the responsibility of the Union to secure from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service a panel of arbitrators uneven in number and listing not less than five candidates. This request to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service shall be made in the form of a letter not later than 90 calendar days from the date of the notice of intent to arbitrate, with a copy of such letter furnished to the Company. In the event no such request has been
Crafts - 53
made at the expiration of the 90-day period specified above, further processing of the grievance will be barred.
B.	Within five calendar days from the date the panel of arbitrators is received by the Union, representatives for the Company and the Union will meet for the purpose of selecting a sole arbitrator. At the meeting the Company and the Union shall strike from the panel alternately until only one name remains and he shall be the sole arbitrator.
C.	The arbitrator shall have no right to change, modify, or amend any part of this Agreement. The decision and award of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall be final and binding upon the parties thereto, including any award with regard to compensation for lost time. In cases of grievances involving lost time or money in connection therewith, the parties may agree to, or the arbitrator may order, reinstatement and/or back pay, but in no event shall back pay be awarded for any period of time prior to the date the grievance occurred.
D.	Fees and necessary expense of travel, food, and lodging incurred by the arbitrator will be paid by the losing party. In the event there is not a prevailing party in the arbitration cost will be shared jointly and equally by the Union, Company, and all intervening parties who become participants in the grievance.
E.	The parties may agree to employ the services of a reporter to record the proceedings of the arbitration hearing. If such is a mutual agreement, the fees and necessary expense of travel, food and lodging shall be paid jointly and equally by the Union and the Company. If only one of the parties desires the services of a reporter, this will be permitted; however, in such event, the fees and other expenses will be the sole responsibility of the party engaging the reporter. Further, in such instance, all recorded data produced in this manner will become the sole property of the party bearing the cost of the service. An arbitrator may not order the services of a reporter.
Crafts - 54
F.	Deliberations in arbitration will not exceed two calendar days. During this period, each party will be limited to eight hours for the presentation of evidence.
G.	The parties shall have seven working days to implement the arbitrator’s decision or to request clarification from the arbitrator. Clarification information must be submitted to the arbitrator within 20 days of the receipt of the decision.
Section 6.	Investigation of Grievance - One Union steward will be allowed up to one hour off during normal working hours without loss of normal pay to investigate a single grievance subject, with the aggrieved, but prior consent must be obtained from his immediate supervisor. For purposes of this Section, the time will be granted consistent with operating conditions, but not later than one hour prior to the end of the shift during which the request is made.
Section 7.	Compensation of Witnesses - Compensation of any witness called by either party for participating in any step of a grievance, including arbitration, shall be the responsibility of the party calling that witness except that an aggrieved employee and/or his steward may attend meetings held during their normal working hours without loss of pay.
Section 8.	Independent Grievance Action -
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, any employee, at any time and in any step of this procedure, may personally present his grievance and have such grievance adjusted in a manner consistent with this Agreement without intervention of, or expense to the representing Union; but the Union will be given an opportunity to have a representative present at such adjustment.
ARTICLE 30	- SEPARABILITY OF PROVISIONS

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Six Month Termination
The Company may remove an employee from the active payroll (termination) after six months absence for medical reasons; subject to reinstatement as set out hereinbelow:
An employee on extended medical absence will continue to accrue seniority for 30 months following the last day of active work.
An employee separated from the active payroll must apply for reinstatement within two weeks after being released to return to work; otherwise the employee waives reinstatement rights. The employee must, within that period, present a physician’s release to work certification to the Company. The physician’s certification must set out any limitations or accommodations requested. The employee must be released to perform the full duties of the job or, if the employee meets the definition of an ADA “person with a disability,’’ the employee must be able to perform the essential elements of the job, with a reasonable accommodation if necessary. An employee requesting an ADA accommodation has the obligation of making that request known, in writing, to the Company.
The employee may, at the Company’s option, be required to pass a drug test and a physical examination by a Company selected physician.
The employee will be restored to the active payroll recognizing his or her seniority in accordance with established practice.
The employee must successfully complete updating and recurrency training and demonstrate his or her ability to perform the full duties of the job or, alternatively, be approved for an ADA reasonable accommodation.
An employee reinstated under this agreement who, within six months after return to work, again becomes medically unable to work due the same condition, will continue where they left off in the previously established 30 month seniority accrual period that began the last day of active work.
A restored employee will be awarded vacation time in accordance with Article 17of the contract. The amount of vacation will be pro rated for the year, based on the return to work date. The vacation calculation will recognize up to 30 months seniority accrual after the last day of active work.
Seniority and reinstatement rights terminate upon an award of social security benefits or a statement from the employee’s physician that the employee is permanently unable to work.
This settlement is retroactive to January 1,2000, and will be applied to all long term medical disability cases arising since that date. This settlement shall have no applicability or precedent in any case other than medical disability.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Labor-Management Cooperation Agreement For Outside Contract Work
The parties recognize the Government and the Company utilize various contractors to perform work projects at IAAAP. To assist certain companies who employ individuals associated with the Union ("a Unionized Company”) be able to bid on the work projects at IAAAP, the Company will do the following:
1.	The Company will provide a workshop at a mutually convenient time for the Union Business Representatives to attend and learn how to navigate the government’s website FEDBIZOPS, such website containing vast information about work projects being put out for bid at IAAAP and elsewhere. The Business Representative can then share such information with a Unionized Company.
2	The Company maintains a website at www.aollc.biz which provides an opportunity for a Unionized Company to fill out a New Supplier Request Form and submit it to the Company. When filling out the form, the Unionized Company should identify areas of expertise, recent projects, references, list of equipment, a POC, and other pertinent information. A copy of the form is attached and the Unionized Company needs to sell itself on its accomplishments and abilities. Once the Unionized Company applies and is qualified by the Company, the Purchasing Department will place the Unionized Company on its list of companies to review for future work projects for which the Unionized Company has expressed an interest and expertise. (Normally, a company will receive a general scope of work concerning a particular project and be requested to attend an on-site meeting regarding an upcoming project. If the company remains interested, AO will provide a bid package at the on-site meeting which will then be filled out and returned to the Company for assessment.)
3.	The Company must retain the discretion to determine who will be eligible to bid on a particular project and the number of contractors eligible to bid. However, the Company will make a good faith effort to involve the Unionized Companies.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
License/Certification/Security Clearance
The parties acknowledge that certain bargaining unit work may require an employee to have a State or Federal government license/certification or security clearance to perform certain work. In the event the terms and conditions of this agreement negate the Company from having the necessary personnel to perform the work because certain employees fail to have a license and/or security clearance, the Union will meet expeditiously with the Company to find a way to have appropriate personnel with a license or security clearance to perform the work until other arrangements can be made.
In the event a State or Federal government requires an employee to have a particular license/certification in order to perform certain work in his job classification, and an employee fails to obtain a license within a mutually agreeable period of time not to exceed that extended by law and is not protected by a "grandfather clause," the Company and Union will meet to discuss what can be done to prevent the employee from being laid-off. If a resolution can not be reached and the employee is eventually laid-off, the employee can exercise bumping rights back into his job classification once he becomes licensed provided his seniority can hold the position. The Company will reimburse an employee for successfully obtaining a State or Federal certification or licensing fee as required by the Company, not to exceed paying the employee $275 during the term of the CBA.
