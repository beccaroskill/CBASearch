responsibilities, but who, regardless of such schooling, is performing all requirements of a classification in the Technical bargaining unit, will not be considered a student, and, therefore, will not be covered by this Agreement.
This Section is limited strictly to recognition of the Union as a bargaining agent as required by the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act and shall not be interpreted or expanded in any other manner or for any other purpose.

Section 2.2.	Employee — Full-time: Employee(s) who is in a position budgeted for at least thirty-six (36) hours per week shall be classified as a full-time employee. Employee(s) who is in a position budgeted for seventy-two (72) hours in a two-week pay period shall be considered a full-time employee for both weeks.
For operational reasons, the Employer may determine, for purposes of fringe benefit eligibility, to consider a group of employees as full-time even though they are regularly scheduled to work less than thirty-six (36) hours.
Section 2.3.	Employee — Part-time: Employee(s) who is in a position budgeted for at least sixteen (16) hours per week, but less than thirty-six (36) hours per week, shall be classified as part-time employee(s) unless covered by the second paragraph of Section 2.2.

In the event a full-time employee goes on a leave of absence and the Employer determines to fill his position during the leave, the Employer shall determine, prior to such leave commencing, if possible, whether a part-time, supplemental, contingent or per diem employee in the affected classification and cost center wishes to fill such full-time employee’s position on a temporary basis. The senior part-time, supplemental, contingent or per diem employee in the classification and cost center who indicates such interest in response to a cost center posting shall be given preference.

Subject to sub Sections (b) and (c), bargaining unit work being performed by bargaining unit employees on the effective date of this Agreement will generally be performed by members of the bargaining unit.

21
ir ' i ' t
Section 5.4(b). Subcontracting - Duration of Less Than One Month or During Emergency. The Employer may subcontract any work which is less than one (1) month’s duration or results from an emergency. However, with respect to subcontracting of less than one (1) month and subcontracting due to an emergency, if possible, the Employer will notify the Union’s Chairperson of the Bargaining Unit of the subcontracting and the reasons and length prior to the commencement of the subcontracting.
For purposes of this Section, “emergency” shall mean those situations which occur as a result of unforeseen circumstances and require the commencement of the subcontracting within a time frame which precludes the Employer from giving the advance notices and meeting with the Union as provided in this Article.
Section 5.4(c). Subcontracting - Future Work in General. The Employer may also subcontract bargaining unit work whenever such subcontracting does not result in the actual layoff from work, or the actual reduction of straight time hours of bargaining unit employees. In addition the Employer may subcontract bargaining unit work which may result in such layoff or reduction of hours provided (1) It has given the Union notice at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date of such subcontracting, and, (2) at the Union’s request, negotiate with the Union about alternatives to such subcontracting. In addition the Employer agrees that it will not subcontract work to discriminate against the Union or employees covered by this Agreement because of their Union affiliation, and will not subcontract work if it has available equipment and employees with the required expertise, and, on an economic basis, and/or efficiency basis the performance of such work by employees will be as economically advantageous as performing the work on a subcontract basis.
22

This provision is not applicable to the Employer subcontracting its own work or services to a contractor. Subcontracting is covered by Article 5, Section 5.4.
| Section 5.6(a). Job Redesign/Merger of Jobs. The Employer and the Union recognize that the ultimate responsibility of determining job content and job responsibilities rest with the Employer. To the extent that, in determining such job content and responsibilities, the
Employer determines to redesign the essential job content and responsibilities of a job or to merge job classifications it will notify the Chairperson of the bargaining unit of its intent, as provided in Section 5.9.
In redesigning job content and responsibilities, the Employer subscribes to the principle, as provided in Section 5.9, that seeking employee input is valuable, provided that nothing in subscribing to this principle in any way erodes the Employer's responsibility of making the final determination, nor requires employee input if circumstances make seeking such input impractical for morale, technical, or strategic reasons.
! Section 5.6(b). Job Elimination Due to Redesign or Merger. In the event an employee's job is eliminated as a result of a job redesign or merger and they are permanently laid off from their classification, they shall exercise their seniority as provided under Article! 1, Section 11.2 to bid for open or posted jobs, or under Article 11, Section 11.4 to

displace another employee. In either event, the employee exercising their seniority shall receive a trial period as if they had bid for a vacancy under Article 11, Section 11.2.
Section 5.7.	Job Redesign/Merger/New Job Classification - Pay Rate. In the event the Employer determines to establish a new classification or to redesign a classification by materially changing the essential job responsibilities or qualifications of that classification, or to merge classifications, the Chairperson of the Bargaining Unit will be notified at least fourteen (14) days in advance of the effective date of such classification redesign or merger, and the Employer will negotiate with the Union concerning the applicable rate of pay. In the event the Employer and the Union are unable to reach agreement on such wage rate within such fourteen (14) days, the Employer may implement the classification and wage rate, subject to the Union grieving such wage rate. Such grievance shall proceed directly to Step Four of the Grievance Procedure. In reviewing such wage rate, the arbitrator must base their determination on the comparative relationship between the qualifications and responsibilities for the new job or redesigned or merged job classification and existing job classifications in the bargaining unit and may select only the last offer of the Employer or the Union.
Section 5.8.	Relocation Of Service/Unit/Operation. In the event a service or unit or operation or sub-division thereof is physically transferred from the Employer to a related entity within a radius of thirty miles of the Employer's main campus on Cherry Street of Toledo, Ohio, the Employer will notify the Union thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date of such transfer and review with the Union the reasons for such transfer. The Employer agrees that such transfer will be for sound and compelling business reasons, and will not be for discriminating against the Union or the employees covered by this Agreement because of their representation by the Union.
24
For purposes of this Section, a related entity is defined as St. Charles Mercy Hospital, St. Anne Mercy Hospital, Mercy College of Northwest Ohio, or other similar entities of corporations formed after the ratification date of this Agreement, in which the Employer is a partial owner of the entity and involved in the management of the operation.
! Employees affected by the decision will be offered the following options: (a) to transfer to the other entity, provided there are available jobs; or (b) to exercise their seniority as provided in this Agreement.
If an employee accepts a transfer to another entity related to the Employer, the employee shall not suffer any reduction in their wage rate; if, after the transfer, a staffing reduction occurs at the other entity which affects such employee, the employee’s continuous service with the Employer and the other entity will be recognized.
Although an employee accepting transfer to a related entity will not be covered by this Agreement, an employee electing a transfer will retain seniority within the bargaining unit which was accrued as of the date of transfer. As a result, such an employee may elect to use their seniority to bid for open positions in the bargaining unit, or to exercise their seniority within the bargaining unit, if laid off as a result of a reduction in force at the related entity to which :hey were transferred.
ll
Section 5.9.	Job Security Committee. The Union is committed to the success of St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center and recognizes that the job security of its employees depends upon SVMMC’s success in providing quality patient service in a cost effective manner.
j Therefore, consistent with Section 5.6(a), prior to making a final determination regarding the redesign of a classification’s essential content and responsibilities, or the
25
merger of classifications or departments, or the transfer of essential job responsibilities from one classification or bargaining unit to another classification or bargaining unit (“change”), the Employer will give the Union Chairperson(s) 30 days notice prior to the implementation of such proposed change if the change will result in the layoff of employees, or reduction of straight time hours, or have a major adverse impact on employees in the classification(s), such as requiring all employees in the classification(s) in the applicable unit/department/cost center to re-bid jobs.
The Union Chairperson(s) and the Chief Human Resources Officer will convene the Job Security Committee, consisting of the Union Chairpersons and the remainder of the Bargaining Committee members representing the affected bargaining units, and one representative of the Union’s choosing from each of the affected cost center up to an equal number of Employer representatives.
The Committee will meet within (10) days after the notice is given to discuss alternatives or modifications, and identify any possible negative financial impact to employees.
While the ultimate goal of the Committee is to seek mutual endorsement of any change and to encourage to the fullest degree friendly and cooperative relations between the respective representative at all levels, nothing in stating that goal in any way erodes the Employer’s right to make the final decision(s) as provided in Section 5.1 and 5.6 of this Agreement.
Every six to twelve (6 to 12) months, and ongoing, following a change as provided above, mutually agreed upon quality assessment evaluations of the determination will be conducted by this Committee.
Section 5.10.	Work Rules Changes. Regarding the Employer’s right to change its work rules, the Employer
26
.1
shall give the Union at least sixty (60) days notice of any changes in such rules, and during such sixty (60) day period at,the Union’s request meet and review with the Union, the c iange(s), and the reasons for such changes(s).
! Within seven (7) days after its implementation, the Union may grieve at Step Three of the Grievance Procedure, the appropriateness and reasonableness of such rule change and whether it meets the just cause standard for discipline, provided in Article 5, Section 5.3.
For purposes of this section, “change” means additions, deletions from or modifications of any rule.
Negotiations - Waiver of Right to
Section 5.11.
I ------
Bargain. The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each had the
unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and that the understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of the right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. Therefore, the Employer and the Union for the life of this Agreement each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right, and agrees that the other shall not be obliged, to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter referred to or covered in this Agreement, or with respect to any subject or matter not specifically referred to or covered by this Agreement, even though such subject or matter may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either or both parties at the time that they negotiated or signed this Agreement.

j Section 5.12. Entirety of Agreement. Subject to the Management Rights provisions of this Agreement, the Employer and the Union agree that this Agreement sets forth the entire Agreement between the parties as to terms and
27
conditions governing employment of employees in the bargaining unit.

The Union's Chairperson of the Bargaining Unit shall receive a notice of permanent layoff at least ten (10) days before the effective date of layoff.
Unless an employee is being displaced by another employee, an employee will be given seven (7) days notice of a permanent layoff. An employee who has an option(s) to fill a vacancy or to displace another employee(s) may not be given such seven (7) days notice. If an employee has no options exercisable under Section 11.4(c) and as a result will be unemployed due to the layoff, the Employer will give such employee at least seven (7) days notice. An employee affected by such layoff must exercise his seniority within twenty-four (24) hours of such notice.
The seven (7) day notice of permanent layoff shall not be required when layoffs occur because of acts of God or other circumstances beyond the Employer's control.
The Chairperson, or designee; will attend the meeting at which an employee is notified of layoff.
Section 11.4(b). Permanent Layoff - Involuntary Process. In the event of a permanent layoff in a cost center the following procedure shall be followed:
62
(1)	a full time seniority employee laid oft shall till an available vacancy within their job classification, status and shift;
(2)	if such a vacancy is not available, they shall exercise their seniority by any of the following options:

(4)	Subject to paragraph 11.4(b) (6). If a full time seniority employee laid off is unable to exercise seniority as provided in either, (1), (2)(a), (2)(b) or (3), then the full time employee may fill, an available vacancy in a different status within their job classification and shift, or if such vacancy is not available displacing the least senior employee in their job classification in a different status on their shift, or displacing the least senior employee in their job classification, in a different status, on a shift of their choice.
(5)	Subject to paragraph 11.4(b) (6). If unable to fill a vacancy or displace another employee, as provided in
63

(6) If a full time employee laid off is unable to displace an employee in their classification as provided in 2 above, they may exercise their seniority:
(a)	by first displacing the least senior employee in their status, and shift in up to two classifications, which they previously held and remain qualified for, as defined below in this sub Section, and then
(b)	by displacing the least senior employee in such two classifications, in the same manner as provided in Sections 11.4 (2)(b) through 11.4(2)(d) for displacing the least senior employee in their classification.
In order to displace an employee in up to two classifications different than the employee’s classification at the time of layoff, the employee must
(a)	have previously completed the probationary or trial period under Article 11, Section 11.1(b) or Section 11.2 (i) for such two classifications.
(b)	have the Department Manager approved their competency to work in such cost center. Once an employee’s competency has been approved, the employee must maintain the competency and the Department Manager must re-affirrn that competency every twelve (12) months when the employee updates his qualifications for such two classifications.
64
In January of each calendar year, an employee may update their pre-qualification in the additional two classifications. If an employee does not have a current updated pre-qualification list for such two classifications, he may exercise his seniority only within their classification at the time of permanent layoff.
The procedure provided in paragraph (6) will exercised before an employee exercise seniority under paragraphs (3), (4) and (5).
In the event a part time or supplemental employee is laid off or displaced, the part time or supplemental employee sha'l follow the same steps in Section 11.4(b), (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6).
In exercising their seniority as provided above, an employee may exercise their seniority to displace the least senior employee at the location where employed at the time of layoff.

Section 11.4(	c). Contingent Employee Scheduling During Layoff. Employees in contingent and per diem status will continue to be scheduled during a permanent layoff in the same manner that contingent and per diem employees were scheduled before the permanent layoff.
Section 11.5.	Permanent Layoff - Voluntary Process. When the Employer notifies the Union of a permanent layoff, it will canvas employees in the affected classification, cost center, status, and shift to determine if there are any volunteers for such layoffs. Any employee who wishes to volunteer for a layoff must notify Human Resources within
65
twelve (12) hours of the notice being posted. An employee electing a voluntary layoff will be eligible to bid for open positions, and is eligible for recall consistent with their seniority. Additionally within ninety (90) days prior to the anniversary date of their layoff and to the loss of their seniority under Section 11.12(d), the employee may notify the Employer whether they wish to exercise their seniority to fill a vacancy which has not been filled through the job bidding procedure provided in Section 11.2, or to displace the least senior employee in their classification, and cost center, and status, provided they are qualified to fill such position because they have maintained their competency, and there is a least senior employee within their classification, cost center and status to displace.

Upon recall to their classification they were originally laid off from, the employee’s rate will be increased by 5% provided the wage rate cannot exceed the maximum nor be less than the minimum wage rate of the classification.
Section 11,6.	Recall From Layoff. Irrespective of statuSj the Employer shall recall employees in a classification by seniority for available positions within their classification. An employee recalled has the option of declining a position in a status different than the status held at the time of layoff, and, in such event, will remain on layoff, subject to Section 11.12(h).
The Employer will provide notice of recall to laid off employees by registered mail, telegram or telephone call at their last known address and/or number. Recall rights are
66
provide the Employer with their most recent address. If the employee is to be on vacation or otherwise not immediately available to receive a telephone call, telegram, or registered mail, they must notify the Employer of where they can receive the recall notice.
Once the Employer contacts an employee for recall, that employee would be required to notify the Employer of their intent to accept or reject a position within twenty four (24) hours of that notification. At the time of layoff, anyone who will be on the recall list will be asked for an alternate telephone number and will also be asked if they would like to be called for any status that becomes available in their classification, or whether they only want to be called for specific statuses. After this designation, employees on recall will only be notified of vacancies within such status until such time that the Employer is notified, in writing, of their desire to change such designation.
An employee will be placed on the recall list upon either the loss of classification and/or status in the voluntary layoff process or if lost involuntarily (i.e. an employee will be placed on recall if they accept a voluntary layoff under the applicable “voluntary layoff provisions” of the applicable CBA). Consistent with Section 11.2, of the CBA’s, employees who are on the recall list may bid for positions in the unit where the layoff occurred. Employees submitting bids for unit posted positions will be given the same consideration as employees actively employed in the unit where the position is posted (applying the criteria set forth at Section 11.2.)
Employees on the recall list may bid on positions that have been posted “bargaining unit wide.” Such employees will be given the same consideration as employees actively
employed in the bargaining unit (applying the criteria set forth at Section 11.2.)
Employees in cost centers where positions are posted and for which they are qualified will be given preference over employees on the recall list. Likewise, employees on the recall list will be given preference over employees being laid off and reviewing options under the layoff provision of the CBA. Finally, employees reviewing such options will be given preference over employees in the bargaining unit, who are not in the cost centers where the vacancy exists.
The six (6) month prohibition against bidding on posted positions is waived for any employee who is laid off and exercises his/her open position and/or displacement options under Sections 11.4 of CBA. In other words, the six (6) month prohibition found in CBA will only apply to positions that are filled under Section 11.2.

For purposes of layoffs and recalls, members of the Bargaining Committee for the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement shall be given top seniority within such bargaining unit, but shall be superceded by the employees covered by the provisions of Section 11.7(a).
Section 11.7(	c). Steward Seniority at Time of Layoff and Recall. For purposes of layoff and recalls, a steward (including alternate stewards) shall be given top seniority within their classification within their area of jurisdiction as
68
provided in Article 10, but shall be superceded by the provisions of Sections 11.7(a) and 11.7(b).
Section 11.8(a	). Transfer to Non-Bargaining Unit Position. An employee who transfers outside of the bargaining unit shall lose all seniority within the bargaining unit as soon as they complete ninety (90) days of em aloyment outside the bargaining unit.
During the ninety (90) day period, an employee may return to an open position in their classification in their former bargaining unit with accrued seniority, including the tim e spent outside of the bargaining unit during such ninety (90) day period.
If after losing seniority within the bargaining unit, an employee returns to a job within the bargaining unit, they shell return with their accrued seniority at the time such seniority was terminated.
Section 11.8(b	). Seniority During Transfer to a Position in a Different Bargaining Unit Represented by the Union. If an employee transfers to a position which is outside of the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement, but which is within a different bargaining unit represented by the Union, they shall transfer to such position with their accrued seniority and continuous service for all purposes, except for bidding for jobs within such different bargaining unit. For purposes of bidding, the employee’s seniority shall be based on their hire date into the different bargaining unit.
Upon transferring to the different bargaining unit, such employee shall be subject to the trial and return provisions under the agreement applicable to such different bargaining unit.
Section 11.9.	Bidding For Jobs While On Leave Of Absence. Employees on a leave of absence cannot bid for a
69
vacancy unless it is determined that such employee will be available and physically qualified to perform the essential responsibilities of the job they wish to bid as of the date the Employer determines such job shall be filled.
Section 11.10.	Relationship Between Layoff-Leave of Absence Status. An employee on layoff status is not eligible for a leave of absence.
An employee on a leave of absence who returns from the leave during a layoff in their classification shall exercise their seniority consistent with the provisions of Article 11, Section 11.4.
Section 11.11.	Seniority - Effect on Job Assignment and Supervisor Instructions. An employee shall not, because of their seniority, be able to select or to have or to retain any particular job or assignment or station or routine within their classification. Assignment of jobs, station, or routine within a classification shall be made by the supervisor of the employees. An employee must follow such assignments as directed or be subject to discipline. Any such discipline shall be subject to the Grievance Procedure.
Section 11.12.	Loss of Seniority. An employee shall lose seniority and be considered not employed by the Employer for the following reasons:
1.	Employee quits for any reason, including retirement.

Nothing in this Section prohibits posting of positions which have schedules with consecutive weekends worked.
For purposes of this Section, employees working regular schedules with consecutive weekends on the effective date of this Agreement are considered to have bid for, transferred to or bumped to such schedules, and shall, therefore, continue on such schedules unless they transfer to, bid for, or bump to another position.
Nothing in this Section will prohibit employees from switching days or volunteering for shifts with the result that they will work consecutive weekends.
Section 15.9(	a). Work Schedule Posting. Subject to the provisions of this Section, the Employer will post a work schedule at least four (4) weeks in advance of the first day of the schedule.

HEALTH/PRESCRIPTION/DENTAL COVERAGE
Termination or Reduction in Hours:
Mercy Health Partners (MHP) facilities have “church plan” status ad, therefore, are not required to offer COBRA benefits to employees. However, MHP does allow qualified employees and their qualified dependents that lose coverage due to a qualifying event to continue on the hospital’s insurance under the Continuation of Benefits program (COB). The employee can continue the (health/prescription and dental) benefits that you have at the time of loss of coverage. The employee would be responsible for paying 102% of the cost of the insurance (subject to change based on the hospital’s cost). The following is an outline of the process and the timeframes involved:
1.	The employee is responsible for notifying their supervisor of their termination. The employee is also responsible for notifying the Benefits Specialist of any change in employment status or life/family situation which would affect their (or their qualified beneficiary’s) eligibility for insurance benefits. Insurance benefits will automatically end the first of the month following the last day of work (or change in status where they would no longer be eligible for insurance) unless the employee completes the needed paperwork in order to continue their benefits under COB in a timely manner.
2.	The Benefits Specialist will send out paperwork to the employee generally within 14 days of notification of the final date of work or loss of coverage as long as the office has received proper notification.
3.	You have sixty (60) days from the loss of coverage or qualifying event in which to return the forms to the Human Resources Department (Benefits Area). Forms must be received and date stamped by Human Resources no later than 5:00 p.m. on the 60th calendar day in order for you or your dependent to be eligible for COB. Forms and benefit elections will not be accepted after this time frame.
4.	You then have forty-five (45) calendar days in which to make payment for the insurance retroactive back to the date your insurance would have normally stopped. Failure to make full payment on the insurance at this time will result in loss of coverage retroactive to the date insurance normally would have stopped. You (nor your dependent) would not be eligible to pick up the insurance at any time in the future.
Example: You terminate employment on 6/15/07. Your insurance would automatically be cancelled 7/1/07. You have until 5:00 p.m. on 8/14/07 to return the signed COB papers in order to continue your insurance. You have 45 days from the date Human Resource receives your form to make payment retroactive to 7/1/07.
Qualified Covered Dependents:
Qualified dependents eligible for continuation of their current benefits are covered spouses, covered dependents and a child bom to, or adopted by the covered employee.
Qualifying Events:
Covered employees and their qualified dependents can continue their insurance for up to 18 consecutive months if the following event occurs as long as they have properly notified the hospital:
182
. ^oluntary termination
. Involuntary termination (except for gross misconduct such as theft, violence, etc.)
. Reduction in hours
! 1
Example: Employee terms on 7/15/07. Their insurance j would end 8/1/07. They can stay on COB until 2/1/09.
The covered spouse or covered dependents can continue their insurance for up to 36 consecutive months (includes all months since the original qualifying event if this is a secondary event) in the event of the following as long as they have properly notified the hospital (within 30 days of the event):
. Death of the employee
I . Employee’s Medicare Entitlement
! . Divorce or Legal Separation (documentation will be required)
; . Dependent child who ceases to be a dependent of the r working employee (ex: child reached age 19 and is ' not a full time student)
| Example: Employee terms on 7/15/07 and then dies on j 01/01/08. The dependents could continue their insurance until 8/1/10.
I i
Disability' Extension:
J । If a qualified beneficiary becomes totally disabled (as defined by the Social Security Administration) within the first 60 calendar days of being on the COB benefit they can extend their benefit for an additional 11 months (total of 29) as (long as they have provided proper written proof of disability to the Benefits Specialist within the 60 calendar day window. It is the Qualified Beneficiary’s responsibility
183
k I
in' tmnii । ■	i ii ■ i ■■	i
to notify the Benefits Specialist. If one member of the family qualifies for the 29 months, the entire family qualifies for the 29 months.
Open Enrollment:
During Open Enrollment, Qualified Beneficiaries currently covered under COB have the same opportunity to change their elections for health/prescription and dental as active employees. They must return the election forms in the same designated timeframe as active employees.
Payment of Premium:
The payment for the insurance coverage is due the 1st of the month for the following month. (Example: The payment for January would be due January 1.) After the initial agreement forms are processed, no additional statements will be sent. It is the Qualified Beneficiary’s responsibility to pay the premiums in a timely manner. Notices regarding any cost changes will be sent to the last known address. If payment is not received in full within 30 calendar days of the 1st of the month, the insurance will automatically be cancelled and cannot be reinstated at any later time.
Conversion Coverage:
At the end of the COB time frame, you may have conversion privileges with the insurance company that you have coverage with. You will need to contact the insurance company directly to determine possible coverage options and cost. Generally you must make a conversion to an individual policy within 30 days of the loss of coverage.
184
It is the Qualified Beneficiaries responsibility to keep the Benefits Specialist notified of any changes in address or family status. All statements and notices will be sent to the “last address” in the employment records and no time extensions will be made because the Qualified Beneficiary did not receive the statement or notice.
Termination or COB Benefit Eligibility:
COB eligibility for benefits will cease the first of the month following any of the following events:
. End of the coverage eligibility period (you need to keep track of the coverage time as no additional notice will be sent to notify you when coverage will end).
• Failure to make timely insurance payments
. The date on which the Qualified Beneficiary first becomes, after the date of the election, covered under another group health plan that does not contain any exclusion or limitation with respect to any pre-existing condition of the beneficiary other than an exclusion or limitation which does not apply to, or has been satisfied under, H1PAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996).
. The date on which the Qualified Beneficiary first becomes, after the date of the election, entitled to Medicare.
. The date the employer ceases to maintain any group health plan.
. In the case of individuals receiving the 11 month disability
disabled by Social Security Administration, coverage may terminate the month that begins more than 30 days after the date of the final determination that the Qualified Beneficiary is no longer disabled.
Life and Disability Insurance:
Life insurance and disability insurance are not covered through the COB program. There may be conversion privileges under these programs as long as you follow the appropriate process and timeframes. Please refer to the appropriate section of this booklet or your certificate for additional information.

Department: Human Resources	Revision Date:	9/05
Regional Vice President Human Resources
Date of Review:	9/05
Authorized by:_______________________________
Date of Next Review: 9/07
Applies to: Hourly and Salaried (SVMMC, SCMH, SAMH, MHP - Regional, MCH) Full-Time and Part-Time Employees
PURPOSE:
To provide salary continuation for employees who have exhausted all of their benefit hours and who have a medical emergency for themselves or immediate family that is for a medical illness/injury causing the employee a prolonged absence from their position and results in a substantial loss of income to the employee.
A medical illness/injury is one that poses a threat to life and requires inpatient, hospice or residential health care, such as cancer, major surgery, serious accident, heart attack, etc. Normal pregnancy, elective surgeries, and common illnesses are excluded. Any leave sharing that is granted to the employee (recipient), will be counted concurrently against any family/medical leave entitlement.
POLICY:
A full-time or part-time employee with a minimum of 90 days is eligible to apply for use of leave sharing program. Application may be made for personal or immediate family members only. A family member is defined as a child,
198
all of their benefit hours (CTO/PTO, sick bank, holiday bank, disability, workers compensation). The medical illness/injury must result in the employee being out on an unpaid leave exceeding 7 consecutive calendar days of an approved leave. Contributions will then be applied retroactive back to the first day missed. Only those hourly contributions in the amount needed to cover the unpaid leave will be approved.
The leave sharing program is established through voluntary donations of CTO/PTO from an employee to another employee. Any employee may donate (minimum of 1 hour), providing they have CTO/PTO available regardless of their status.

St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center (“SVMMC”) has advised the UAW (“Union”) that SVMMC employs persons, within the bargaining units represented by the Union, who work pursuant to a grant issued to SVMMC by a governmental agency, foundation, or similar entity (“grant employee”).
SVMMC and the Union recognize that the funding for such grant programs and the duration of the programs are regulated by the governmental agency, foundation, or similar entity issuing the grant. Because of these restrictions, SVMMC and the Union recognize that the wage rate, effective date of the wage rate, the benefits provided for these grant employees, job duties, and work location may be different than the wage rate, effective date of the wage rate, benefits, job duties and work locations that are provided in the labor agreements between SVMMC and the Union. SVMMC will notify the Union when it receives a grant which will involve employees who will be within a bargaining unit covered by their labor agreement, and advise the Union of the terms of the grant as it affects such employees.
In the event of any change after the issuance of the grant, SVMMC and the Union recognize that the funding governmental agency, foundation, or similar entity retains and may make unilateral changes in the terms of the grant. SVMMC will advise the Union of any changes which occur in the grant during its team.
Subject to the following provisions, SVMMC and the Union agree that the terms and conditions of employment for grant employees in the bargaining units represented by the Union, will be governed by the terms of the grant, and not by
the applicable labor agreement, except the following terms and conditions of employment shall apply:
•	Employees covered by the grant who are performing work within a bargaining unit represented by the Union will, as a condition of employment, be subject to the Union Security and Check Off provisions of the labor agreement applicable to such bargaining unit.
•	SVMMC will post grant positions on a bargaining unit wide basis within the applicable bargaining unit and at the same time, it posts grant positions, SVMMC may seek outside applicants. Any employee selected for such position will be subject to the trial period or the applicable probationary period provided in the applicable labor agreement.
•	SVMMC shall have discretion as to whom to select to fill a grant position, provided that it will not discriminate against any person because of their inclusion in a bargaining unit represented by the Union.
•	In the event of a layoff in the bargaining unit, while a grant is in effect, the grant employees will not be subject to displacement as provided in the respective labor agreement.
•	A grant employee will acquire and accumulate seniority in the bargaining unit which can be used at the time of the of the grant’s termination in the following manner:
(i) the grant employee may fill any open position within their classification and status, or (ii) bid for a posted position; such bidding
204
shall be under the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement.
o At the conclusion of the grant, the grant employee will be considered terminated and will lose all seniority unless within thirty (30) days after the grant’s conclusion they fill an open position or successfully bid for a position as provided in the preceding paragraph.
o During the term of the grant, grant employees can not bid for open or posted positions but are to continue to work in the grant program.
o A grant employee will accrue service for benefit purposes while employed in the grant program, which service will transfer with them in the event they transfer to a non-grant position.
o For discipline purposes, a grant employee will be terminated only for just cause, and may file a grievance under the Grievance Procedure in the applicable labor agreement.
Except as provided in this Letter of Agreement, the terms and conditions of employment for such grant employees are governed by the applicable labor agreement only to the extend that the Employer elects to apply them.
Following is a listing of Grant Programs in effect on the ratification date of the initial SVMMC and UAW labor agreements.

St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center (SVMMC) and the UAW (Union) agree that employees employed in SVMMC’s Life Flight and Mobile Life are included within the respective bargaining unit applicable to their classification.
However, SVMMC and the Union recognize that services provided by such employees are unique, and that such employees are ambassadors for SVMMC in the community/area serviced by SVMMC, and provide volunteer services to the community which are beneficial to SVMMC and help extend SVMMC’s services, which ultimately provides job security for bargaining unit employees. SVMMC and the Union recognize that, because of these factors, generally, there are other considerations in addition to service and prior work experience, which are necessary for evaluation when filling a position in Life Flight and Mobile Life, and are necessary for consideration in other situations.
Because of these factors, while SVMMC and the Union agree that generally the terms of the SVMMC/Union labor agreement will apply to Life Flight and Mobile Life employees, they agree that, after posting the applicable job in the applicable bargaining unit and seeking outside applicants, SVMMC may select the candidate, whether internal or external to SVMMC, whom SVMMC determines best meets the qualifications and qualities SVMMC determines are necessary. The Seniority provisions of the applicable contract regarding temporary and permanent layoffs, as well as the Hours provisions regarding the number of hours worked or on call, scheduling, including weekend scheduling, and changing of shifts, and the premium for working at multiple sites will not be applicable to Life Flight or Mobile Life employees. The wages for a
calculated as they were prior to the date of this Letter Agreement, except that they are eligible for the changes made for overtime computation as provided in Article 15, Section 15.5, and on call provided in Article 15, Section 15.7 and will receive the negotiated wage increases and benefits.
SVMMC and the Union agree that this Agreement may be modified by mutual agreement.

St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center and the Union have reviewed the minimum standards for determining the presence of unlawful drugs or alcohol in an employee's system, and agreed to all minimum standards published and being administered by the Employer's Occupational Medicine Department on September 1, 2000, provided that as to alcohol, the Employer and the Union agree that the minimum standard for discipline purposes shall be .04 alcohol concentration. The Union recognizes that if an employee is tested between .02 and .04, he will be retested so as to make the Breathalyzer used by the Employer's Occupational Medicine Department operable.
In non-alcohol related situations the attending physician in Occupational Health or the Emergency Department will determine whether the employee tested is fit to return to duty on the applicable shift. If such attending physician determines that the employee is not fit to return to duty, the employee will be sent home and (1) if the results indicate that the employee tested at the minimum standards or above, the employee will be subject to discipline and not be paid or allowed to use CTO for the balance of the shift on which sent home; (2) if the employee tests below the minimum standard, the employee will not be subject to discipline, and may elect to use CTO for the balance of the shift on which he was sent home.
In alcohol related situations, if the employee tests at the minimum standard or above, the employee will be sent home without pay for the balance of the shift, may not use CTO, and be subject to discipline. In alcohol related situations, if the employee tests below the minimum standard, but has an odor of alcohol as determined by the attending physician, the Employer reserves the right to send the employee home for
the balance of the shift and said employee may elect to use CTO for the balance of the shift.

ABSENCE
St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center (“Employer”) and the International Union, United Automobile Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America and its Local 12 (“Union”) agree that the following Sections of their collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) will be applied as provided in this Letter of Agreement:
1. Section 12.1(1). Reinstatement Following Leaves of Absence. Section 12.1(1) provides that an employee on a leave of absence, other than a Scholastic Leave, will be reinstated to their classification, status, shift, unit and regular schedule provided they return within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the first day of such leave. The Employer and the Union agree that the one hundred twenty (120) day period shall be an accumulation of all leaves (except Union Leave under the collective bargaining agreement) taken during a “rolling” twelve month period commencing with the first leave, subject to the provisions of the Family Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”) for an employee who takes multiple leaves during the “rolling” twelve month period, the last of which is covered by the FMLA.
Following are examples of the application of this provision:
Example 1.	An employee takes a personal medical leave for seventy (70) days commencing on March 1. On September 1 during the same “rolling” twelve (12) month period, the employee takes a forty-five (45) day leave. In this situation,
to their regular position as provided in Section 12.1(1). If such employee’s second leave during the “rolling” twelve (12) month period was for sixty (60) days, then after the second leave the employee would not be reinstated to their regular position, unless such position remained open, since they would have been on leave for one hundred and thirty (130) days during the “rolling” twelve (12) month period, but would be reinstated to an open position or displace the least senior employee in their classification unit and status as provided in Section 12.1(1).
Example 2.	An employee takes a Scholastic Leave for ninety (90) days on March 1, and thereafter within the “rolling” twelve (12) month period of March 1 takes a FMLA leave for twelve (12) weeks. Under the provisions of the FMLA, such an employee would be reinstated “to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced or an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment.”
The Employer may initiate the above provision in place of the provisions in the collective bargaining agreement. If so implemented, the Union will be given thirty (30) days advance notice, and the above provision will be applied prospectively to leaves of absence taken after the provision’s implementation.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT NO. 5 RETURN FROM CHAIR POSITON
SVMMC and the Union agree that at the conclusion of holding union office, Chairpersons at St. Vincent will maintain their current classification, status, and shift and will return to working all budgeted hours in their home department, unit, or cost center. This agreement is premised on the fact that the Chairpersons do not, upon accepting their elected posts, vacate their regular position with the Employer. Therefore, throughout their term in office, Chairpersons are still employees of their respective departments (units or cost centers), subject to the same terms and conditions of employment as all other bargaining unit employees of such departments (units or cost centers). A Chairperson or Vice Chairperson will be given up to a ninety (90) days orientation upon return to their home department, cost center, or unit.
It being understood and agreed by the parties that in the event the Employer decided to fill the Chairpersons’ budgeted hours during their appointment to such elected office, that the Employer may effect a layoff, consistent with Section 11.4 of the collective bargaining agreements, to accommodate the Chairpersons’ return to their regular positions.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT NO. 6 EXTENDED SICK BANK
St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center (“SVMMC”) and UAW, Local 12 (“Union”) agree that any employee whose employment is terminated with SVMMC or who transfers from a full or part time position will have their accumulated extended sick bank frozen for a period of one (1) year from the effective date of such termination or transfer. If within that one (1) year period the employee is rehired into a full or part time position or if the employee transfers back into a full or part time position, then their sick bank that was frozen shall be credited back to their active extended sick leave bank. If the employee does not return to a full or part time position within one (1) year from the date of termination or transfer, then their frozen sick bank shall be eliminated as if it was never accumulated.
Upon any employee’s rehire into a full or part time position (within one (1) year of termination) or once an employee returns from a contingent, supplemental or per diem position to a full or part time position (and once the sick bank is re-credited), the employee must remain full or part time for the period of at least one (1) year from the date of re-hire or transfer back to full or part time status in order for the extended sick bank to be paid out simultaneously with retirement. In other words, such employees (those who are eligible for retirement under SVMMC’s pension plan) may only receive payment of accrued extended sick leave benefits if they remain full or part time for at least one (1) year from going back to a full or part time position.

During the 2003 negotiations, the UAW, Local 12 representatives expressed concern about the number of hours of on call and the number of on call hours being worked by some employees. While recognizing this concern, SVMMC expressed concern about the number of call offs in particular situations which might be impacting the need for on call. As a result of these discussions, UAW, Local 12 and SVMMC agreed that they would jointly evaluate in the Operational Improvement/Quality Enhancement Committee meeting provided in Article IX, the on call concerns on a unit/department/cost center basis, and jointly seek solutions for significant on call.
Additionally, in such meetings, they would evaluate call off to seek solutions for employees to meet their responsibilities for reporting to work as scheduled.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT NO. 11 TEMPORARY TRANSFER AND PRECEPTOR PAY
SVMMC and UAW, Local 12 agreed that Temporary Transfer (Section 21.8) and Preceptor Pay (Section 21.15) would be paid for an entire shift if the transferred employee worked in a classification with a higher maximum wage rate or as a Preceptor for a majority of the shift hours.
During negotiations, the Union’s bargaining team expressed concern that supervisors would repeatedly work employees up to the majority of shift hours in such different classification or as a Preceptor, and then re-assign the employee or remove Preceptor responsibilities to avoid paying Temporary Transfer or Preceptor pay. In these discussions, SVMMC indicated to the Union that if Union representatives believed such intentional avoidance was occurring, the Union’s Chairperson would notify Human Resources. In such event, SVMMC and the Union would jointly review the facts involved to assure that such avoidance if occurring is remedied.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT NO. 13 SMOKE FREE ENVIRONMENT
During the negotiations of the 2006 - 2009 CBA, St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center (“SVMMC”) proposed that the St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center, including the facilities in Attachment B of the CBA, (“Center”) be a “smoke free facility.”
During those negotiations, SVMMC and the Union recognized that there were two pending ballot proposals requiring “smoke free environments”. They further recognized that passage of either, or both ballot proposals, may require the Center to be a “smoke free facility.”
To facilitate the parties’ ability to reach a new CBA, SVMMC withdrew its “smoke free facility” proposal pending the outcome of the ballot proposals. If either or both of the ballot proposals passes, SVMMC and the Union agree that they will negotiate the implementation and effects of the ballot proposal(s) for the Center.
If both ballot proposals fail, the Union recognizes that SVMMC reserves the right to bargain with the Union about the implementation of a “smoke free environment” for the Center.
The Union agrees to the conditions upon which SVMMC withdrew its “smoke free facility” proposal.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT NO. 14 RELEASE TIME FOR CHAIRPERSONS
Article 10, Section 10.8 of the St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center/UAW labor agreements provides paid release time for the Chairpersons of the respective bargaining units.
The release time provided in Section 10.8 is based on full time status. All of the Chairpersons on October 24, 2006 were full time employees, but worked varying hours.
If a part time, contingent, supplemental or per diem employee replaces a Chairperson with full time status*, the part time, contingent, supplemental or per diem will be transferred to full time status with hours equivalent to the person they replace. If, thereafter, such employee leaves the Chairperson position, they will return to their status prior to assuming the Chairperson.
All Chairpersons and Vice Chairpersons will be assigned to the day shift when they are fulfilling their Chairperson’s and Vice Chairperson’s responsibilities.

During the negotiations for the 2006 - 2009 collective bargaining agreement, UAW, Local 12 expressed concern about the potential escalation in the use of per diem employees. After discussions regarding advantages and disadvantages of the use of per diem employees, St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center agreed that, in the event of a significant increase in the total hours worked by per diem employees as compared to the hours worked by per diem employees for calendar year 2005, on request of UAW, Local 12, it will meet with the Chairperson(s) of the bargaining unit(s) in which such increase hours occurred, and the UAW, International Representative to review the reasons for such increase and explore alternatives to such escalation.
Unless otherwise agreed, such meeting will occur within fourteen days of the request.

Article 15, Section 15.9(a) of the St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center (“SVMMC”)/UAW collective bargaining agreements provide that requests for days off (CTO) must be presented eight (8) weeks in advance of the first day of the schedule. Section 15.9(a) further provides that SVMMC is to post a tentative schedule six (6) weeks in advance of the first day of the schedule.
During the period prior to the posting of the tentative schedule, SVMMC and UAW, Local 12 agree that it is the responsibility of SVMMC managers, supervisors, and schedulers to accommodate the requests for days off. During the 8 and 6 week periods provided in Section 15.9(a), an employee will not be required to find their own weekend replacement for a CTO request.
SVMMC and the UAW, Local 12 recognize, however, that all requests for days off may not be granted due to the lack of available coverage. When that occurs, SVMMC on the tentative schedule will indicate those requests which can be accommodated because there is available coverage. Accommodation for days off will be made consistent with unit/department guidelines modified to be consistent with this Letter of Agreement.
If an employee’s request is not accommodated on the tentative schedule the employee has the option to find a replacement consistent with department/unit guidelines.
