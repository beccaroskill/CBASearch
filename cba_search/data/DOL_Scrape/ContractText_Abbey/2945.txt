- 10-
3.	Notwithstanding any provision of this MOU to the contrary and excluding the provisions of paragraph 6 below, the provisions of this article shall be subject to advisory arbitration only.
4.	In lieu of the meet-and-confer process prescribed by the Employee Relations Ordinance (ERO), the parties agree to meet and discuss, in accordance with the provisions outlined below, all contracts to perform unit work except for contracts required by bona fide emergencies.
5.	The parties agree that the following expedited procedure shall replace the impasse resolution provisions of the ERO for disputes arising out of the meet-and-discuss process specified above:

b.	Local 347 may request to meet and discuss such proposed contracts within five (5) working days following notice as indicated in "a." above. Failure by the union to request such meeting(s) within the prescribed five days shall constitute a waiver of the union's right to continue this process.

d.	If the parties cannot reach agreement through the meet-and-discuss process, the union may request expedited advisory arbitration within five (5) working days following the last meet-and-discuss session. Failure by the union to request arbitration within the specified five days shall constitute a waiver of the union's right to continue in this process. The parties will attempt to establish a mutually agreeable, expedited process for selecting arbitrators. Absent any such agreement, arbitrators will be selected in accordance with Rules 11.03 and 11.04 of the Employee Relations Board.
e.	The parties agree that for contracts with a value of less than $ 1 million the hearing and issuance of the advisory decision by the arbitrator shall be concluded within thirty (30) calendar days following request for arbitration; and within (90) calendar days for contracts of $ 1 million or more.
-11 -
f.	The arbitrators advisory decision and recommendation shall be transmitted to the appropriate determining body simultaneously with the proposed contract.
g.	The time limits in this process may be extended only by the mutual, written agreement of the parties.
h.	The expedited arbitration process herein shall be informal. Court reporters shall not be used; rules of evidence shall be informal; the production of witnesses and documentary evidence shall be at the discretion of each party; the arbitrator's notes, exhibits (if any), and the written advisory decision and recommendation shall constitute the record of the proceedings; post hearing briefs shall not be required or submitted.
I.	Arbitration fees shall be shared equally by the union and the City.
6.	Disputes over the practical consequences of the contracting of unit work, other than those occurring under paragraphs 4 and 5 above, shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the Grievance Procedure, Article 3.1 of the MOU, and shall not delay the implementation of the contract if all other provisions of this article have been met.
The parties agree that the review of "practical consequence" grievances shall begin with the first formal level of review of the grievance procedure and that said grievances shall be subject to advisory arbitration, except as provided in the Arbitration step (Step 6) of the Grievance Procedure.
ARTICLE 2.11	JOB SECURITY
Effective March 1,1994, a total of 6,237 full-time positions were filled in Council-controlled units represented by Local 347. The parties agree that if at any time, during the term of this MOU, this number falls to 90% of the March 1 total (5,613) for any reason, the City shall refrain from awarding any new contract for work currently being performed by Local 347 until such time as the number of the subject positions reaches at least the prescribed 90% level. Contracts in effect on March 1,1994 may be renewed at the City's discretion. The parties agree, however, that the scope of work or services covered by said contracts shall not exceed that which was in effect on March 1, 1994.
This language explicitly refers to contracting decisions and does not diminish the City's discretion in staffing decisions relative to basic departmental organization or level of service.
-12-
3.0 GRIEVANCE
ARTICLE 3.1 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section I	- Definitions
A grievance is defined as any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of this written MOU or departmental rules and regulations governing personnel practices or working conditions applicable to employees covered by this MOU. An impasse in meeting and conferring upon the terms of a proposed MOU is not a grievance.
Section II	- Responsibilities and Rights
A.	Nothing in this grievance procedure shall be construed to apply to matters for which an administrative remedy is provided before the Civil Service Commission. Where a matter within the scope of this grievance procedure is alleged to be both a grievance and an unfair labor practice under the jurisdiction of ERB, the employee may elect to pursue the matter under either the grievance procedure herein provided, or by action before ERB. The employee's election of either procedure shall constitute a binding election of the remedy chosen and a waiver of the alternative remedy.
B.	No grievant shall lose his/her right to process his/her grievance because of Management-imposed limitations in scheduling meetings.
C.	The grievant has the responsibility to discuss his/her grievance informally with his/her immediate supervisor. The immediate supervisor will, upon request of a grievant, discuss the grievance with him/her at a mutually satisfactory time. The grievant may be represented by a representative of his/her choice in the informal discussion with his/her immediate supervisor, and in all formal review levels, and in arbitration; provided, however, that such representative may not be an employee or officer of another qualified organization except with the written consent of the organization granted exclusive representation.
D.	The time limits between steps of the grievance procedure provided herein may be extended by mutual agreement, or by mutual agreement, the grievant and Management may waive one or more levels of review from this grievance procedure.
E.	Management shall notify the Union of any formal grievance filed that involves the interpretation and/or application of the provisions of this MOU, and a full-time Union
- 13-
Staff Representative shall have the right to be present at any formal grievance meeting concerning such a grievance. If the full-time Union Staff Representative elects to attend said grievance meeting, he/she shall inform the head of the department, office or bureau of his/her intention. The Union will be notified of the resolution of all other formal grievances.
Section III	- Procedure
The grievance procedure for employees covered by this MOU shall be as follows:
Step 1 - Informal Discussion
The grievant shall discuss his/her grievance with his/her immediate supervisor on an informal basis in an effort to resolve the grievance and said grievance shall be considered waived if not so presented to the immediate supervisor within ten (10) calendar days following the day when the event upon which the grievant is based occurred. Said ten (10) calendar days may be waived by mutual consent of the parties involved.
The immediate supervisor shall respond within five (5) calendar days following his/her meeting with the grievant. Failure of the immediate supervisor to respond within such time limit shall entitle the grievant to process his/her grievance at the next step.
Step 2 - First Level of Review
If the grievance is not settled at Step 1, the grievant may serve written notice of the grievance on a form provided by Management upon the person designated to review the grievance at Step 2 within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the grievance response at Step 1. Failure of the grievant to serve such written notice shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.
If such written notice is served, said person shall meet with the grievant, and a written decision or statement of the facts and issues shall be rendered to the grievant and his/her representative, if any, within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of service. Failure of Management to respond within such time limit shall entitle the grievant to process his/her grievance at the next level of review.
Step 3 - Second Level of Review
If the grievance is not settled at Step 2, the grievant may serve written notice of the grievance on said form upon the person designated to review the grievance at Step 3 within
- 14-
seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the Step 2 grievance response. Failure of the grievant to serve such written notice shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.
If such written notice is served, said person shall meet with the grievant, and a written decision or statement of the facts and issues shall be rendered to the grievant and his/her representative, if any, within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of service. Failure of Management to respond within such time limit shall entitle the grievant to process his/her grievance at the next level of review.
Step 4 - General Manager/Commission Review (Third Level of Review)
If the grievance is not settled at Step 3, the grievant may serve written notice of the grievance on said form upon his/her General Manager or designee within seven (7) calendar days following receipt of the grievance response at Step 3.
Failure of the grievant to serve such notice shall constitute a waiver of the grievance. If such notice is served, the grievance shall be heard by the General Manager or his/her designee, or in the case of departments under the administrative control of a board of commissioners, by the Commission or the General Manager or their designee, and a written decision shall be rendered within 120 calendar days of such notice being served.
Step 5 - Mediation (optional)
If the grievance is not resolved at Step 4, the Union representative may, within ten (10) calendar days following receipt of Management's response at Step 4, request that the grievance be submitted to mediator prior to proceeding to arbitration. This step is optional and requires the concurrence of Management and the Union.
A request for mediation must be in writing and must be submitted to the affected department's personnel officer or the Employee Relations Administrator in the Police Department within the above-prescribed time limits. The personnel officer or Employee Relations Administrator shall, within ten (10) calendar days following receipt of the mediation request, return the request to the Union representative with a denial or an agreement that the parties jointly request the Employee Relations Board (ERB) a to appoint a mediator.
The Executive Director of the Employee Relations Board shall attempt to obtain the services of a mediator from the State Mediation and Conciliation Service. If a State mediator is unavailable, Union and Management may jointly agree to a mediator selected by the Executive Director of the Employee Relations Board. The fees for mediation shall be shared equally by Union and Management.
- 15-
The mediation procedure shall be informal. The primary effort will be to assist the parties in settling the grievance. Court reporters shall not be used, the rules of evidence shall not apply, and no record shall be made. The mediator shall determine whether witnesses are necessary.
If the grievance is resolved through mediation, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.865 of the Employee Relations Ordinance, the parties may agree to accept the results of mediation as binding.
If the grievance is not resolved in mediation, the mediator may be requested to provide an immediate oral opinion as to how the grievance would be decided if it went to arbitration. Such opinion shall be advisory only. However upon mutual agreement of the parties, the mediator may be requested to furnish such opinion in writing, including a brief statement of the reasons for the opinion. Such opinion, as well as confidential discussions by the parties in mediation, shall not be used during any subsequent arbitration.
Step 6 - Arbitration
If the written decision at Step 4 does not settle the grievance; or if no written decision is rendered within the time limits set forth at Step 4 and if mediation, as provided in Step 5, is not requested; or if mediation is not agreed to; or if mediation does not resolve the grievance; the Union may serve upon the head of the department, office or bureau a request for arbitration at the same time that such request is filed with ERB. The request for arbitration must be filed within ten (10) calendar days following the date of any of the above qualifying events. Failure of the Union to serve such written request within said period shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.
If such written notice is served, the parties shall meet for the purpose of selecting an arbitrator from a list of seven arbitrators furnished by ERB, within seven (7) calendar days following receipt of said list:
a.	Arbitration of a grievance hereunder shall be limited to the formal grievance as originally filed by the employee to the extent that said grievance has not been satisfactorily resolved. The proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with applicable rules and procedures adopted or specified by ERB, unless the parties hereto agree to other rules or procedures for the conduct of such arbitration. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties involved, it being mutually agreed that all other expenses including, but not limited to, fees for witnesses, transcripts, and similar costs incurred during such arbitration will be the responsibility of the parties incurring them.
- 16-
b.	Notwithstanding Section 4.865 a.(4) of the Employee Relations Ordinance, the decision of an arbitrator resulting from any arbitration of a grievance hereunder shall be binding upon the parties(*); provided, however, that grievances arising from the practical consequences of the contracting of unit work shall be subject to advisory arbitration unless said grievances involve 1) claims of loss of basic compensation (herein defined as base salary and regularly assigned bonus compensation) or 2) claims that the grievant has suffered capricious, arbitrary or discriminatory treatment as a result of the contracting decision. (* Binding arbitration of grievances as herein provided shall be applicable in each of the following proprietary departments at such time as the head of each said department submits its written concurrence with said provision to the Mayor and Council: Airports, Harbor, Library, Recreation and Parks, Pensions and the City Employees' Retirement System.)
Disputes as to whether a grievance involving the practical consequences of a contracting decision is subject to advisory or binding arbitration shall be referred to an arbitrator for a binding decision on this threshold question prior to proceeding to arbitration on the merits of the claim.
c.	The decision of an arbitrator resulting from any arbitration of grievances hereunder shall not add to, subtract from, or otherwise modify the terms and conditions of this MOU.
ARTICLE 3.2 UNION STEWARDS
The Union may designate a reasonable number of Union Stewards who must be members of the Unit, and shall provide all departments, offices, or bureaus with a written list of employees who have been so designated. Management will accept on a quarterly basis any changes to the list. A steward may represent a grievant in the presentation of a grievance at all levels of the grievance procedure. A steward may represent an employee in pre-disciplinary hearings (Skelly) or pre-disciplinary interviews where there is a reasonable expectation that disciplinary action will follow.
An employee and his/her steward may have a reasonable amount of paid time off for the above-listed activities. However, a steward will receive paid time off only if he/she is the representative of record; is a member of the same Unit and the same Union as the employee; is employed by the same department, office or bureau; and, is employed within a reasonable distance from the work location of the employee.
If a steward must leave his/her work location to represent an employee, he/she shall first obtain permission from his/her supervisor on a form provided for such purpose. Permission to leave will be granted unless such absence would cause an undue interruption of work.
- 17-
If such permission cannot be granted promptly, the steward will be informed when time can be made available. Such time will not be more than forty-eight (48) hours, excluding scheduled days off and/or legal holidays, after the time of the steward’s request unless otherwise mutually agreed to. Denial of permission to leave at the time requested will automatically constitute an extension of time limits provided in the grievance procedure herein, equal to the amount of the delay.
Before leaving his/her work location, the steward shall call the requesting employee’s supervisor to determine when the employee can be made available. Upon arrival, the steward will report to the employee’s supervisor who will make arrangements for the meeting requested.
Time spent on grievances, or the pre-disciplinary representation activities described above, outside of regular working hours of the employee or his/her steward shall not be counted as work time for any purpose. Whenever these activities occur during the working hours of the employee and/or the steward, only that amount of time necessary to bring about a prompt disposition of the matter will be allowed. City time, as herein provided, is limited to the actual representation of employees and does not include time for investigation, preparation or any other preliminary activity.

Such review shall not interfere with the normal business of the department, office or bureau.
B.	No disciplinary document shall be placed in an employee's official departmental personnel file without providing said employee with a copy; however, the Police Department may decide in lieu thereof to notify the employee that such a document has been placed in the employee's file and that it is available for review.

ARTICLE 4.3	REST PERIODS
Section I
Each employee shall be granted a minimum of fifteen (15) minutes rest period in each four (4) hour period; provided, however, that no such rest period shall be taken during the first or last hour of any employee's working day nor in excess of fifteen (15) minutes without the express consent of the designated supervisor.

2.	The employee's department will provide confirmation of such performance on a form titled "Verification of Work Experience" (Personnel Department form PD 21R #11 -74), so that it may be utilized by the employee whenever such verification is required to establish eligibility to take an examination.
ARTICLE 4.6	PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.110 of the Los Angeles Administrative Code (LAAC), the following provisions shall apply to part-time employees covered by this Memorandum of Understanding.
1.	Except as provided in Section 4.117 of the LAAC and/or any Departmental Personnel Ordinance to the contrary, a work schedule of less than the number of hours of fulltime employment shall be considered part-time employment. The following categories of part-time employment are hereby defined and shall be controlling for purposes of this Article:
a.	Half-time: Half-time employees are those who are regularly assigned to a work schedule of one thousand and forty (1040) hours or more in a calendar year, but less than full-time. Compensation shall be prorated on the basis of the total number of scheduled hours of work in relation to the total number of hours required for full-time employment. Benefits provided in this MOU for half-time employees also shall apply on a prorated basis, as defined.
b.	Intermittent: Intermittent employees are those who are assigned to a regular or on-call work schedule of less than the number of working hours required for half-time employment (less than 1040 hours) in a calendar year. The hourly rates provided in the Appendices to this MOU shall be considered full compensation for intermittent employees. Employees who concurrently hold more than one intermittent position still shall be considered intermittent, as herein defined, irrespective of the total number of hours scheduled.
- 21 -
2.	Part-time employees hired into classifications covered by this MOU after the effective
date of the MOU shall be notified of their status as half-time or intermittent at the time of hire. Half-time employees shall be notified of their eligibility for prorated benefits. Intermittent employees shall be notified that they are not entitled to benefits except as provided in paragraph 3 below.
3a. Intermittent employees shall be eligible to accrue compensated personal time off at the rate of 2.75 minutes for every hour compensated. Employees must complete a period of six consecutive months of City service and must have been compensated for at least 500 hours before qualifying to use the compensated personal time off. This benefit may be used in no less than one hour increments for the following:
1.	Sick leave;
2.	Urgent personal business, subject to approval of the supervisor;
3.	Holidays, upon the request of the employee. The holiday must fall on the
employees’ regularly assigned schedule, and the employees must not be required to work on that holiday. If the qualifying employees choose not to use compensated personal time off for the holiday, the employees may be allowed, subject to approval of the supervisor, to adjust theirwork schedules and make up the time in full not later than the next succeeding payroll period.
Compensated personal time off may be accumulated for up to a maximum of 48 hours. Any time accumulated in excess of such amount shall be deemed waived and lost.
There shall be no payment of any form for unused personal time upon separation from City service for any reason.
Employees who hold more than one intermittent position concurrently shall be eligible to accrue compensated personal time off in only one position.
3b. Notwithstanding paragraph 2 above, an employee hired on an intermittent basis who, following two consecutive years of City service, has been compensated for 1000 or more hours during each of the two years shall be considered a half-time employee and become entitled to qualify for prorated benefits provided to half-time employees. Upon designation as half-time under these circumstances, such employees shall be allowed to carry over into the 100% sick leave bank up to a maximum of 16 hours of unused compensated personal time. Any unused personal time in excess of 16 hours shall be deemed waived and lost. Such employees shall immediately begin accruing vacation
- 22-
and sick leave, and become eligible to use vacation, sick leave and holiday benefits at the appropriate prorated rate. Their anniversary date shall be based upon the date they are designated as half-time employees. No such benefits shall be provided retroactively. This paragraph shall not preclude an appointing authority from changing an intermittent employee’s status to half-time anytime following appointment.
3c. Half-time employees who immediately prior to such appointment were on intermittent status, and who completed six consecutive months of City service and were compensated for less than 2,000 hours during the preceding two years, shall be allowed to carry over into the 100% sick leave bank up to a maximum of 16 hours of unused compensated personal time. Any unused personal time in excess of 16 hours shall be deemed waived and lost. Such employees shall immediately begin accruing vacation and sick leave, and become eligible to use sick leave and holiday benefits at the appropriate prorated rate. Employees shall not be eligible to use vacation benefits until one year from their anniversary date. Their anniversary date shall be based upon the date they were designated as half-time employees. No such benefits shall be provided retroactively. This paragraph shall not preclude an appointing authority from changing an intermittent employee’s status to half-time anytime following appointment.
4.	The part-time benefits provided herein shall apply prospectively from the effective date of the MOU. However, part-time employees who were receiving benefits at the level provided herein prior to said effective date shall continue to receive such benefits as long as they retain their qualifying status without a break in service.
5.0 COMPENSATION
ARTICLE 5.1	OVERTIME
Distribution of Overtime
Management will attempt to assign overtime work as equitably as possible among all qualified employees in the same classification, in the same organizational unit and work location. However, Management may consider special skills required to perform particular work.
Nothing herein is intended to abridge or limit the right of city management to determine the means and methods for the delivery of public services, including but not limited to decisions regarding staffing requirements and the use of overtime.
- 23-
Non-emergencv Overtime
Whenever Management deems it necessary to perform non-emergency work on an overtime basis, employees required to work will be given at least forty-eight (48) hours notice.
Work Schedules
Pursuant to FLSA, employees shall have a fixed workweek that consists of a regular recurring period of 168 consecutive hours (seven 24-hour periods) which can begin and end on any day of the week and at any time of the day. The designated workweek for an employee may be changed only if the change is intended to be permanent and not designed to evade overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Management may assign employees to work a five/forty, four/ten, nine/eighty, or other work schedule. Management shall have the right to refuse an employee’s request to work a four/ten, nine/eighty, or other modified work schedule, and to require the reversion to a five/forty work schedule, providing that the exercise of such right is not arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory. The parties further agree that management may require employees to change their work schedules (change days off, except the split day, or working hours) within the same FLSA workweek.
Employees on a nine/eighty modified work schedule shall have designated a regular day off (also known as the 9/80 day off) which shall remain fixed. Temporary changes to the designated 9/80 day off at the request of management or the employee is prohibited unless it is intended for the employee to work additional hours (overtime.)
Assignment of Overtime
Management will attempt to assign overtime work as equitably as possible among all qualified employees in the same classification, in the same organizational unit and work location. However, Management may consider special skills required to perform particular work. The parties understand that no employee shall work overtime without prior approval from his or her supervisor and that unofficial overtime “white time” is absolutely prohibited. FLSA non-exempt employees may not work outside of scheduled working hours, or during unpaid meal periods, without the written approval of a supervisor consistent with department policy. Failure to secure prior approval may result in discipline.
Rate and Method of Overtime Compensation - (FLSA) Non-Exempt Employees
Compensation for overtime shall be for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek including all absences with pay authorized by law. Compensation for employees
- 24-
in this unit who are employed in a class or paygrade with a fifth step regular biweekly rate, without bonuses, at or below the fifth step regular biweekly rate for the class of Senior Electrical Tester, Code 7516 in Council-controlled departments shall be in time off at the rate of one and one-half hours for each hour of overtime worked or in cash at one and one-half times the employee’s regular rate of pay, at the discretion of management.
Compensated Time Off
Employees shall be permitted to accumulate up to 80 hours of compensated time and take such accumulated time off for overtime worked upon request unless granting of such time would “unduly disrupt” the operations of the City department. This standard does not apply to non-FLSA overtime (i.e. overtime earned pursuant to this agreement that does not meet the FLSA definition of overtime). On occasion, employees may accumulate hours in excess of 80 hours for a temporary period of time. If an employee does not schedule and take time off over 80 hours for overtime prior to the end of the fiscal year in which the overtime was worked, management may require employees to use accumulated overtime that exceeds 80 hours prior to the end of the fiscal year; require employees to use such time in lieu of vacation or other leave time; or authorize cash payment. In the event sufficient funds are not available to provide cash compensation for all or a portion of the hours in excess of 80, management may extend the time limit fora period not to exceed one year. In accordance with FLSA, no employee shall lose accumulated time off.
Under no circumstances shall compensated time off in excess of 240 hours be accumulated.
1040/2080 Plan
Management reserves the right to develop 26 Week/1040 or 52 Week/2080 hours work periods under FLSA Section 7(b) [29 USC §207(b)(1) and (2)] during the term of this MOU for the purpose of increasing scheduling flexibility. Implementation of this work schedule is subject to agreement by the parties and certification of the Union as bona fide by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB),
Rate and Method of Compensation
Operative the effective date of the Ordinance implementing this MOU, compensation for overtime worked by employees in classifications listed in the Appendices herein shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4.113 through 4.116 of the Los Angeles Administrative Code (LAAC) which pertain thereto. However, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.113(d) of the LAAC, compensation for all overtime worked shall, unless specific authorization for cash payment exists, be in time off at the rate of one and one-half (1 %)
- 25-
hours for each hour of overtime worked. If authorization for cash payment exists, the rate of compensation shall be one and one-half (1-1/2) the employee's regular rate of pay.
Fair Labor Standards Act Provisions
Notwithstanding the provisions of LAAC Section 4.113 concerning the accumulation of compensated time off for overtime worked, employees deemed non-exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, shall not lose any accumulated overtime.
ARTICLE 5.2	CALL BACK PAY
Whenever Management orders an employee to return to duty following the termination of his/her work shift and departure from his/her work location, the employee shall receive a minimum payment equivalent to four hours of work at the rate of time and one-half (1-1/2) the employee's regular rate of pay.
ARTICLE 5.3	ACTING PAY ASSIGNMENT
A.	For the term of this MOU, whenever Management assigns a non-supervisory employee as an acting on-site supervisor in the temporary absence of a full-time supervisor, such employee shall become eligible for additional compensation upon completion of a qualifying period of five (5) consecutive working days in such assignment at his/her regular rate of compensation. Paid or unpaid absences of more than three days during the qualifying period shall extend the qualifying period by the length of the absence.
B.	Starting with the first working day following completion of a qualifying period, the employee shall receive the second premium level rate above the appropriate step rate of the salary range prescribed for his/her class, for each day on duty as an acting on-site supervisor. However, the maximum pay rate for such duty shall be limited to the top step of the salary range, or the hourly wage rate which has been established as compensation for the position to which the employee has been assigned.
C.	Any Management determination or decision pertaining to the implementation, interpretation, application, administration or cancellation of any or all of the provisions of this Article shall be final and conclusive and shall not be subject to the grievance procedure herein. Nothing in this Section, however, is intended to deny the premium payment specified herein to an employee who has been assigned, has qualified and has performed the acting assignment in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
- 26-
ARTICLE 5.4
TRAVEL ALLOWANCE
A.	Notwithstanding Section 4.222 of the LAAC, whenever an employee is required to travel directly between his/her home and place of temporary assignment, as provided in Section 4.221 of the LAAC, he/she shall receive payment at the rate of two dollars ($2.00) for each day that such travel occurs. All other provisions of Sec. 4.220 -4.226 of the LAAC which relate to payment for travel of certain employees from their homes to temporary job locations remain unchanged.
B.	Notwithstanding Section 4.221.1 of the LAAC, whenever an employee is required to travel from one job site to another within a work day, he/she shall receive payment at the rate of two dollars ($2.00) for each day that such travel occurs.
C.	Where an employee qualifies under both sections A and B above, such employee shall be entitled to receive three dollars ($3.00) per day.
ARTICLE 5.5	EARLY REPORT PAY
A regularly assigned employee who is required to report earlier than his/her regularly-scheduled starting time for the convenience of his/her department, office or bureau, said employee shall receive time and one-half his/her regular hourly rate of pay for each hour of work performed prior to his/her regularly-scheduled starting time. Such compensation may be made in either cash or compensatory time off at the discretion of management.
Management maintains its authority to retain employees who are called in before the start of their regular starting time for their full, regularly scheduled shift. Hours worked prior to an employees regularly scheduled starting time qualify the employee to receive Early Report Pay. Consistent with any department procedures which may exist, employees may or may not be retained beyond eight hours, subject to operational needs.
In the event an employee receives Early Report Pay and is required to work his/her full regularly scheduled shift in addition to the Early Report Pay hours, the employee shall not receive overtime for working his/her full, regular shift. Prescheduled shift adjustments with at least 48 hours notice do not qualify for Early Report Pay.
ARTICLE 5.6	STAND-BY PAY
Notwithstanding any provisions of the LAAC or Departmental Personnel Ordinances to the contrary, employees assigned stand-by duty shall receive one dollar ($1.00) per hour for each hour on such assignment.
- 27-
ARTICLE 5.7

The designation, redesignation or removal of a lead assignment shall be a management prerogative and may occur any time management deems it appropriate. Such management decisions shall be final and conclusive and shall not be subject to the grievance procedure herein.

10.0 CONTINUATION OF MERIT PRINCIPLES
ARTICLE 10.1 CONTINUATION OF MERIT PRINCIPLES
1.	Statement of Intent At the time of execution of this MOU, applications for special reorganization of the City of Los Angeles have been filed in regard to the San Fernando Valley and Harbor Area and are being processed by the Los Angeles
-49-
County Local Agency Formation Commission (“LAFCO”). The completion of these proceedings could result in bargaining unit employees being transferred to another public entity during the term of this MOU (hereinafter referred to as “Transferred Employees”). Former California Government Code § 56844.2 provides:
Status of public employees under special reorganization; Collective bargaining agreement; Retiree benefits; Representation
(a)	This section shall only apply to a special reorganization.
(b)	All public employees to which Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 3500) of Division 4 of Title 1 applies shall continue to be deemed public employees of the original local agency or of the newly incorporated local agency for all the purposes of that chapter, including, but not limited to, the continuation and application of any collective bargaining agreement that applies to these employees, and all representational and collective bargaining rights under that chapter.
(c)	Any existing collective bargaining agreement shall remain in effect and be fully binding on the original local agency or on the newly incorporated local agency, and on the employee organizations that are parties to the agreement for the balance of the term of the agreement, and until a subsequent agreement has been established.
(d)	Any existing retiree benefits, including, but not limited to, health, dental, and vision care benefits, shall not be diminished.
(e)	Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an employee organization that has been recognized as the exclusive representative of local agency public employees affected by a special reorganization shall retain exclusive representation of the unit employees of the original local agency, or of the newly incorporated local agency.
In consideration of this provision of law, it is the intent of the parties to this MOU to provide in this article, to the extent permitted by law, that Transferred Employees will enjoy certain substantially similar civil service and other protections for the term
- 50-
of the MOU, as described in paragraph 2 below, as they would have enjoyed if they had not been transferred, without unduly constraining the operations of the new jurisdiction. In the event that this article, or any part of this article is found invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that event shall not affect the validity of enforceability of the other articles of this MOU. However, if any provision of this article is judicially determined to be invalid, said provision or part shall be deemed invalid and unenforceable but the remainder shall not be affected thereby.
2.	Merit Principles. If a new jurisdiction that has become subject to this MOU pursuant
to former California Government Code § 56844.2 fails to adopt or enforce laws which provide, in substance for the employment principles listed below, or those laws do not remain in effect for Transferred Employees during the entire term of this MOU, the following provisions shall apply to Transferred Employees:
A.	Examinations: All appointments shall be based on merit. All candidates taking a competitive examination shall be given a score and placed in a rank based on the whole score. The appointing authority shall select from the top three ranks. Applicants who receive a passing score on the examination shall be given a 5% credit added to their whole score for military service, if such persons have served in the armed forces of the United States during time of war or armed insurrection, or during any time when the United States engaged in active military operations against any foreign power, provided such person has been honorably discharged from active service during the five years preceding the examination. All candidates taking a competitive examination for promotion shall receive a credit for past service, the amount of which may be determined by the new jurisdiction prior to the examination.
B.	Probation: The probationary period for persons appointed in the class of Police Officer shall be eighteen months, measured from the commencement of recruit training. The probationary period for persons appointed in management classes shall be twelve months. The probationary period for persons appointed to entry level positions shall be 6 months, except that the the new jurisdiction may establish a longer period, not to exceed 12 months, if the period is set in advance of the examination and after public hearing. The probationary period for all other non-entry level positions shall be six months, except that the new jurisdiction may establish a shorter period, if the period is set in advance of the examination and after public hearing.
C.	Transfer: An employee shall be allowed to transfer into an equal or lower paying class without further examination, provided he or she possesses the
- 51 -
minimum qualificationsand the capability of performing the required duties, in the following situations: (a) the employee is incapable of performing his or her duties because of injury, sickness, or disability; or (b) the employee has completed a probationary period.
D.	Layoffs: Any layoff shall be based on seniority in that the employee with the least amount of seniority within the class-group shall be laid off first. Seniority shall be calculated as including all service within the class-group plus any service in a higher class. Any employee laid off shall have the right to revert to a vacant position or displace (“bump”) a person in a lower class-group if there are no vacant positions, provided the displacing employee has (a) prior service in the lower class-group and (b) greater seniority than the employee being displaced.
E.	Discipline: An appointing authority may suspend or discharge an employee but only for cause.
F.	Military Leave: An employee who leaves his or her position to serve in the armed forces of the United States shall be entitled to a leave of absence and, upon returning from military service, restoration to his or her position, subject to applicable state and federal law and as further provided by ordinance.
G.	Non-discrimination in benefits: There shall be no discrimination in the provision of employee benefits between employees with spouses and employees with domestic partners.
These provisions (A-G) shall be deemed to be modified to conform to Los Angeles City law in effect on the effective date of the special reorganization.
3.	Disputes. The grievance procedure shall not apply to disputes concerning the interpretation or application of this article, unless any such dispute would be grievable by a Los Angeles City employee as a matter of law. The Union waives its right to meet and confer in the event that the new City proposes to incorporate the limitation in the proceeding sentence into its Employee Relations Ordinance or Resolution.
4.	No Waiver. Except as provided in fl 3, this article shall not be construed as a waiver by the Union of any right it might have under law to meet and confer over the impact
- 52-
that any transfer of employees to another public entity may have on wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.
