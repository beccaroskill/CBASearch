ARTICLE VIII - HOURS OF WORK
Normal hours of work for Tour and Day workers shall be 40 according to schedules prepared by the Company and agreed to
12

by the Unions concerned.
The Company will endeavor to so arrange the work of Day workers that they will work five (5) consecutive days of eight (8) consecutive hours, lunch period excluded.
Qualified senior Mechanics and qualified senior Instrument Technicians will be given preference for Shift work or Day work when permanent vacancies occur, or for temporary vacancies in excess of three (3) days.

Each worker shall be in his/her place ready to begin work at designated starting time and shall not stop work before the designated quitting time. Employees will not be allowed to report earlier than thirty (30) minutes and to relieve earlier than fifteen (15) minutes prior to the start of their shift unless otherwise directed to do so. When an employee reports for work late and arrangements have been made to cover the job, the late employee may or may not be permitted to work, but in either case will be subject to the disciplinary procedure.
The employee reporting for work late will not be eligible for reporting pay if not permitted to work.
At the end of a shift, no Tour worker shall leave his/her place to wash up and dress until his/her mate has changed clothes and reported to take on the responsibility of the position. If a Tour worker does not report for his/her regular shift, his/her mate shall notify the Department Superintendent or Supervisor. The employee shall then remain at his/her post until a substitute is secured and, if necessary, shall work an extra shift. However, if overtime would be involved, the employee who is not relieved will be offered the overtime work. It will be the practice to setup on shift.
13
In the event of a vacancy of which supervision had prior notice, and where overtime would be involved to fill said vacancy, the employee in the same classification on the preceding shift will be offered the overtime shift on the first day. If the vacancy 5 extends more than one day, the subsequent overtime shifts shall be offered to an employee in that classification involved.
PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW TO FILL TEMPORARY VACANCIES OF LESS THAN A WEEK S DURATION:
10	1. It will be the practice to setup on shift if overtime is not
involved.
*2. If overtime is involved on the first shift, ask the employee who worked the preceding shift if he/she wants to double-over.
3,	Ask the off-employee in the same job classification to 15 come in and fill the vacancy.
4.	Ask the remaining employee in the same job classification to come in and fill the vacancy.
5.	If you still cannot get anyone to work, then you can fill the job any way you can, consistent with good management principles.
20	(a) Ask a trained employee from the next lower job
classification to work.
(b) Double the employee for which you have no relief.
On the second shift and thereafter, Item #2 should come after Item #4.
25 *Subsequent days of absence without at least four hours notice will be filled as first day of absence.
Tour workers and Day workers may, with the consent of the supervisor over them, swap shifts, if they so desire, provided, however, no overtime payments are thereby incurred. No Tour or 30 Day workers shall be required to swap shifts without their consent, except in emergencies beyond the control of the Company.
If the supervisor refuses a request for a swap as outlined in this Article, he/she must give reason in writing for the refusal without unnecessary delay. If the worker is not satisfied that the 35 reasons given are just and sufficient he/she has right of immediate appeal to the next higher step in supervision.
It is the duty of each worker to report for his/her designated shift unless they have already arranged for a leave of absence. If unavoidably prevented from reporting, employees shall give their 40 supervisor or the supervisor on duty (who will fill out an absence
14
5

20
25
30
35
40
slip in triplicate) at least four (4) hours notice before his/her designated starting time except in case of sickness or other legitimate causes that prevented giving notice. After a Tour worker has been absent from work for less than seven (7) calendar days, he/she shall give the supervisor at least eight (8) hours notice previous to the beginning of the period in which he/she intends to resume duty. Sixteen (16) hours notice must be given for an absence of seven (7) calendar days or more,
When a Maintenance employee who is assigned to a rotating shift is absent from work because of illness or other reasons when the time of return is not predetermined, he/she will be returned to their regular shift by the following Monday.
Any employee absent for four (4) days or less due to illness shall not be required to have a doctor’s release in order to return to work.
ARTICLE IX - SENIORITY
Employees laid off because of lack of work shall lose their seniority if they do not notify the Company of their intention to return to work within seven (7) days, and to actually report for work within fourteen (14) days after receipt of such notification by registered mail to their last Personnel address unless an extension of time is mutually agreed upon.
Employees who enter Armed Services will be returned to their job upon their return from Service in accordance with applicable State and Federal Regulations then pertaining.
Any employee promoted to a supervisory job in his/her own department will accumulate seniority in that department for a period of six (6) months. During that period he/she may return to his/her former position at his/her option. Other employees affected as a result of this return, may assume their former position. The six (6) month period does not apply when an employee is filling a supervisory vacancy due to illness, vacations, or military leave. The six (6) month period may be extended by mutual agreement. An hourly paid employee filling a supervisory position will fill this position on a twenty-four (24) hour basis or seven (7) day week basis except an employee may return to his/her scheduled shift within a twenty-four (24) hour period when moving from one work week to another.
An employee promoted to a nonbargaining unit job outside
15
his/her department on a permanent basis in the Plymouth Complex will accumulate seniority in his/her own department from which promoted for a period of ninety (90) days and shall not be called upon to fill the same job again within a six (6) month period.
5 Permanent employees laid off or placed on the Extra Board through no fault of their own shall have preference for any work on permanent jobs according to their department, bargaining unit and plant seniority. For temporary jobs covering a full work week, these employees may exercise their seniority rights as stated 10 above. The full work week vacancy requirement may be waived to avoid layoff. Department seniority shall govern in all cases.
The Union and the Company will cooperate to achieve the most efficient utilization of manpower and in equal degree, the fullest protection of employee’s seniority rights. The parties will 15 develop such methods of handling problems arising from the above policies as may be most effective, subject, if necessary, to recourse to the grievance procedure.
In cases of promotion or transfers where seniority is not the determining factor, the Shop Committee shall, whenever feasible, 20 be notified in advance. When not feasible, the promotion will be considered temporary for one week following such notification to the Shop Committee, during which time the Shop Committee shall have the opportunity to discuss the matter with the supervisory personnel invplved.
25 An employee temporarily transferred to a lower rated job for the convenience of the Company shall continue to receive his/her regular job rate.
Production employees who work with the Maintenance crew in lieu of layoff will be paid at the rate of $13,945 per hour, 30 provided the rate of their regular job rate is $13,945 per hour or over. If their job rate is less than $13,945 per hour, they shall receive their regular rate. (The $13,945 rate will increase to $14.365.effective August 1,1998, and $14.725 effective August 1, 1999, and $15,165 effective August 1,2000, and $15.62 effective 35 August 1, 2001).
An employee transferred to a higher rated job will be paid the rate which has been established for the higher rated job, it being understood that in cases where the employees are breaking in, only one (1) shall be paid the higher rate.
40 In case of partial, temporary plant shutdown, senior employees
16
5
10
15
20
25
30
35
40
affected may at their option exercise their seniority rights, and will be placed within thirty-two (32) hours. Employees exercising their option, will receive the rate of the job to which they transfer, and will not be entitled to daily overtime provision due to such transfer.
Employees who are working on a temporary rate will be compensated for overtime, call-out and holidays on the same basis as if the temporary rate were permanent. Employees who are scheduled to work at a setup rate for the work day(s) immediately prior to the holiday(s) and the work day(s) immediately following the holiday(s), will be paid the setup rate for the holiday(s). Employees who are not available for work during the holiday period shall have their pay computed at their permanent straight time rate. Holiday pay, eight (8) hours, shall be at the employee’s permanent or temporary rate, whichever is greater.
The Company and the Unions recognize their joint responsibility to keep each department of the plant operating efficiently and fully manned. To this end, the Union agrees that employees should make every reasonable effort to keep their department staffed, and in emergency conditions, to assist in other departments that are temporarily understaffed. The Union reserves the right to make an issue out of any case in which any abuse of this section is claimed to exist.
Temporary and permanent vacancies will be filled by employees with the greatest seniority first by department, second by bargaining unit, and third by plant seniority. Any modifications of this policy in individual cases will be by mutual agreement of the Company and the signatory Union or Unions concerned.
Permanent vacancies in the line of progression will be filled promptly. Temporary vacancies will be discussed with the Union concerned.
Past practices in filling vacancies within the Laboratory Department will be continued.
It is understood and agreed that in case of promotion and transfer for employees covered by this Agreement to jobs within the bargaining unit, the senior qualified employee will be promoted or transferred. Should a question arise as to whether or not the senior employee is qualified, (and it cannot be resolved by agreement between the Union and Management), the senior employee will be given a ninety (90) day trial period on the job in
17
question. After a fifteen (15) day trial period and prior to ninety (90) days, it will be the employee’s option to return to his/her former job. Such job assignments shall be considered permanent after ninety (90) days. If during the trial period, the Union and the 5 Company agree that the employee is not performing satisfactory the functions of the job, the following steps will be taken.

15 The Performance Share Plan is a company profit-sharing plan that:

The Performance Share Plan contribution is based on:
•	The Company’s prior year’s earnings.
•	How well Weyerhaeuser compares with industry competitors. 25
Each year, the company’s Board of Directors decides how much will be contributed to the plan, based on the company’s overall performance. All employees receive the same percentage of contribution ranging from 0 to 3.5 percent of base pay during 30 the previous year (as described in the plan).
The contribution is used to buy Weyerhaeuser stock, which is held in an account for you. Dividends are reinvested in stock until you leave the company. You get a yearly statement (usually in June) that shows how your account is doing. Your PSP contribution and 35 earnings are not taxed until you receive payment from the plan.
The balance of your PSP account is available to you when you retire or leave the company. How much you can take when you leave depends on your years of service with the company. This is called “vesting.” Generally, you are 100 percent vested in 40 your account after seven years of company service.

10	ARTICLE XXI - SHOP PROCEDURE
The Company and the Union each recognizing the desirability of finding a solution to the problem of confining construction work to construction crews and maintenance work to maintenance crews agree to the following:
15 No Maintenance work shall be performed by Construction employees.
When a difference of opinion occurs concerning Maintenance versus Construction work, between the Company and the Union, Management will give a clear answer setting forth their position 20 on the matter within twenty-four (24) hours, or sooner if feasible, from the time the dispute was called to their attention.
The Company agrees to consult with the Union Committee on any planned project that would fall in the category of Construction or Maintenance Construction work prior to the actual beginning of 25 work on such projects.
The Company realizes the Union’s desire to have the mill Maintenance work performed by Maintenance employees. The Company will make every effort to see that this is done, and to prevent misunderstandings on work which should in any way lead 30 to a grievance, discuss same with Union involved before a decision is made.
The Company will not contract Maintenance work except such work for which it does not have equipment or skills and/or work which would require the use of its own personnel to the extent that 35 normal and necessary Maintenance work be curtailed or delayed.
Prior to contracting out Maintenance work, the Company will meet with the local Union to explain the nature of the work and the reasons for contracting it out.
The Company agrees there will not be any reduction of 40 Maintenance crews caused by contracting out work under this article.

ARTICLE XXII ■ ADJUSTMENT OF GRIEVANCES
Should any cause for grievance arise during the term of this Agreement between the Company and the Unions, the following procedure shall be used in the settlement of such grievances, allowing five (5) days maximum between each step, excluding Saturday, Sunday, and holidays. Should the answer not be forthcoming within the specified time limit, the grievance will go the next higher step, provided the original grievance was personally presented to the person responsible for handling it.
No grievances shall be recognized by either the Company or the Union unless brought up within seven (7) days or one hundred sixty-eight (168) hours.
The Shop Committee shall not consist of more than four (4) members at any one meeting with the Management.
In cases where the 'Company has a grievance against the Union or any employee or employees covered by this Agreement, it shall be understood that in the first step the Company shall take the matter up with the Shop Committee; in the second step the Company shall discuss the matter with the International Representative of the Union; and finally the matter shall be handled under the arbitration clause set forth in Step 5 of this section.
Employee'grievances shall be handled under the following procedure:
Step 1 - Should an employee feel aggrieved, the employee and Shop Steward shall first discuss the grievance with the department supervisor.
Step 2 - In case a satisfactory agreement is not reached in Step 1, the grievance shall then be stated in writing, in duplicate, on Grievance Forms, dated, signed by the employee involved, and the Shop Steward, and given to the supervisor. Such grievance shall then be discussed by the supervisor with the employee and the Shop Steward, in an attempt to adjust this matter. The supervisor will insert in the proper place his/her disposition of the matter and will sign and date it, returning one copy to the employee. A local Union has the right to process a grievance on behalf of an employee or a group of employees represented by it.
Step 3 - If no agreement is reached in Step 2 above, the case shall be presented to the Shop Committee. If the Shop Committee believes a justified grievance exists, they shall meet with the
35
superintendent for the purpose of settling the grievance. Their disposition shall be recorded on both copies of the grievance form the Union retaining one copy, the superintendent the other. Unless otherwise agreed upon, grievance not appealed (within 5 thirty (30) days after the date of which the decision in any one of the three (3) steps specified above) in writing shall be considered settled on the basis of the decision last made and shall not be eligible for further appeal.
Step 4 - Grievance not settled in Steps 1, 2, or 3 and 10 appealed in writing shall be referred to the Mill Manager or his/her designated representative, and an International Representative of the Union. Should this Committee be unable to reach a satisfactory settlement, the matter shall then be referred to “Arbitration”, as hereinafter provided:
15 Step 5 - Arbitration
Grievance not settled in Step 4 will be referred to an impartial umpire appointed by the American Arbitration Association or the Federal Medication & Conciliation Service. Service used will be alternated for each local Union covered by this Agreement. The 20 Arbitrator shall report his/her decision within five (5) days for a discharge case, thirty (30) days for all other cases. The parties agree to abide by the award. The parties further agree that there shall be no suspension of work when any such arbitrable dispute arises and while it is in the process of adjustment or 25 arbitration.
Any decision reached in any of the foregoing steps shall be complied with within seven (7) days.
All expenses of arbitration shall be borne equally by the Company and the Union involved.
30 No arbitrator will hear more than one grievance at this plant at one time, except if cases from the same bargaining unit and of a similar nature; by mutual agreement if cases are dissimilar.
The Arbitrator’s authority shall be limited to applying and interpreting the expressed terms and conditions of this 35 agreement. The arbitrators shall not have authority to deal with wage rates, or to add to, subtract from or otherwise amend or modify the terms of the agreement except at the mutual consent of the parties or where the agreement is in conflict with a State or Federal Law provided, however, that the arbitrator may find that 40 an employee is not receiving the established rate for the work to
36
which he/she is assigned.
ARTICLE XXII(A) GRIEVANCE REMEDY
In the event it is determined that work has been improperly 5 assigned for any reason, the grievance remedy will be that the employee will be allowed equivalent work time to make up for the improper work assignment. If the employee does not want to work the equivalent time then no other monetary payments will be made as a resolution to the grievance.
10 If the Company fails to notify the union per the existing Labor Agreement about contracting out work, then this language does not apply as a form of grievance resolution.

PACE 2-1356
The Fiberline Operation Implementation Plan dated September 23, 1992 is hereby recognized as part of the Labor Agreement.
PACE 2-1356
The following is the Flexible Maintenance and Facilities Services Program at Plymouth Paper Company.
Maintenance employees possess skills in more than one craft. The intent of this program is to utilize these skills and to provide training to develop skills in other skill areas.
The program is designed to utilize an employee’s skill in a primary craft and not restrict employees from .performing or assisting in other crafts.
PROGRAM SCOPE
A Maintenance Committee will be formed with Union and Management representatives upon acceptance of the program. Their functions will be :
(1)	Participate in the selection of the materials to be used in the training program.
(2)	Evaluate Training Program effectiveness and make recommendations for change.
(3)	Evaluate appeals from unsuccessful participation in Apprenticeship Program.
(4)	Evaluate appeals from employees for retest.
Employees requesting a retest must demonstrate to the Maintenance Committee a correction of previously identified deficiencies.
Incumbents will retain their present seniority system for vacation scheduling, curtailments, and layoffs. Oilers, track repair, and equipment handlers shall be identified as departments for the purpose of layoff and curtailment. If this situation arises, the Company and Union(s) will meet and develop a procedure.
Incumbents occupying a shift position will remain on this assignment. Future vacancies, permanent or temporary, will be
63
filled by the senior Senior Mechanic certified in the required skills.
Incumbents occupying classification of Preventative Maintenance Inspector will remain in their present assignment. Should these tasks remain intact, vacancies will be filled as in the 5 past.
On the date of ratification, the Company will determine the ratio of bargaining unit affiliation. Each bargaining unit will retain this ratio.
Each job assignment will be made on the basis of what is the 10 most efficient and safe manner to get the job done, not to make extensive use of Maintenance employees outside their recognized skills. Mechanics will generally be assigned to jobs requiring expertise in their own recognized skills. When more than one Mechanic is on the job, they are expected to help each other.
15 No employee will be held accountable or responsible for errors in judgment or legitimate mistakes while working outside the employee’s recognized skills.
Reductions in workforce due to implementation of Flex Craft Program will be made through attrition (i.e., resignations, 20 terminations, retirements, death, and transfers). However, this does not apply to curtailment, department shutdowns, or modifications of existing production units.

The Flexible Maintenance Program covers the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Instrument Department employees in the International Union of Operating Engineers at Weyerhaeuser Company. We believe that many of our Maintenance employees presently have ability in more than one skill. The intent of this program is to utilize this ability and to provide training to develop these skills. The program is designed to effectively utilize an employee’s primary skill and not restrict employees from performing/assisting in other skills.
Reductions in workforce due to implementation of Flex Craft Program will be made through attrition (i.e., resignations, termination, retirements, death, and transfers). However, this does not apply to curtailments, department shutdowns, or modifications of existing production units.
An Evaluation Committee will be formed with Union and Management representatives upon acceptance of the program. Their function will be:
(1)	Evaluate training program effectiveness and make recommendations for change.
(2)	Evaluate appeals from unsuccessful participants in Apprenticeship Program.
(3)	Evaluate appeals from employees for retest.
Employees requesting a retest must demonstrate to the Evaluation Committee a correction of previously identified deficiencies.
The present department seniority system will be used for vacation scheduling, curtailments, and layoffs.
Incumbents occupying a shift position will remain on this assignment. Future vacancies, permanent or temporary, will be filled by the Senior Journeyman/Technician certified in the required skills based on department seniority.
Incumbents occupying classifications of Preventative Maintenance Inspector, Head Armature Winder and Instrument Shop Clerk will remain in their present assignment. Should these tasks remain intact, vacancies will be filled as in the past.
Percentages between Electrical and Instrument employees will be identified prior to implementation. These percentages will be used as the guideline for proportionate representation by the respective Unions. Should the proportionate percentage
67
representation change because of attrition, opening vacancies will be allocated to the Union which is disproportioned.
No employee represented by a bargaining unit will be required to perform the work (as identified in Exhibit A) of 5 another bargaining unit when those employees are out on a strike sanctioned by the International Union.
Each job assignment will be made on the basis of what is the most efficient and safe manner to get the job done. The purpose of these assignments will be to accomplish the work in the most 10 efficient and safe manner, not to make extensive use of employees outside their certified skills. Journeymen/Technicians will generally be assigned to jobs requiring expertise in their own primary skills. When more than one Journeyman/Technician is on the job, they are expected to help each other. No employee will 15 be held accountable or responsible for errors in judgment or legitimate mistakes while working outside the employee’s certified primary skills.
Initially, the present tag-out - lock-out procedure will remain intact. The procedure may be revised as employees progress in 20 the Flexible Maintenance Program. Changes in the tag-out - lockout procedure will be discussed prior to implementation.
INCUMBENTS
All affected present Class A and Journeymen will be 25 reclassified as Senior Electrical Journeymen or Senior AC Journeymen or Senior Instrument Technician and will receive the specified increase for acceptance of the program. Once incumbents become “certified” as a Senior, they will receive the Senior rate of pay.
30 All Instrument Class B and C and all Electrical Apprentices A and B will be reclassified as Junior Electrical Journeyman or Junior AC Journeyman or Junior Instrument Technician.
All Instrument Apprentices, A, B, and C and all Electrical Apprentices C and D will be reclassified as Advanced 35 Apprentices.
All Instrument Apprentices D, E, and F and Electrical Apprentices E, F, and G will be reclassified as Beginning Apprentices.
Recognizing that all employees will not be proficient in all skill 40 areas immediately, a transition period will be necessary.
