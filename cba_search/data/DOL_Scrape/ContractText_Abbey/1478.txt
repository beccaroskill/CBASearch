(6)	The Union has requested recognition as the Section 9(a) representative of each Employer's bargaining unit employees. The Union having demonstrated to each Employer’s satisfaction that a majority of the bargaining unit employees covered by this collective bargaining agreement have designated the Union to serve as their collective bargaining representative, and are desirous of maintaining such representation, the Employer hereby agrees voluntarily to recognize the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative of all such employees pursuant to Section 9 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, for all purposes even as if the Union had been certified by the National Labor Relations Board as the exclusive bargaining representative pursuant to a representation election conducted among employees in the bargaining unit, as that unit is defined elsewhere in this collective bargaining agreement.
(7)	The Employer further agrees to waive any rights it may have to repudiate the Agreement upon its expiration.

For the purposes of this Agreement, a day shall be considered as beginning at 7:30 a.m. starting time and ending on the following morning at the same hour, and the wage rate to be paid shall depend on the clock hours during which the time worked falls, notwithstanding the fact that this may result in two (2) rates of pay being paid for
9
one (1) shift. However, this paragraph shall not be construed as a guaranteed work day or week. The choice of starting times may be varied by mutual consent of the Employer and the Union business representative.
(24)	The six recognized Holidays for the purpose of this agreement shall be:

(26)	In the event a jobsite is shutdown due to weather conditions or one of the designated holidays fall during the week and the job is currently working 5 eight (8) hour days, the employer may work four (10) hour days without overtime provisions provided the employee can work 4 eight (8) hour days and not be penalized. At no time shall Saturday be worked as a make-up day for straight time.
(27)	Employees shall receive eight (8) hours pay (base rate) for a death in the immediate family (spouse or child).
(28)	Annual time off for vacation for each employee shall be at their own discretion, provided however, that the employee give the Employer two (2) weeks notice and there is manpower available.
10
(29)	Overtime shall consist of time working in excess of eight (8) hours on any regular work day, or forty (40) hours in any regular work week, or on any Saturday, Sunday, or on any of the holidays hereinafter provided, with the exceptions hereinafter stated.

11
report. Any employee who reports for work and for whom work is provided shall receive not less than four (4) hours pay. If more than four (4) hours are worked in any one day, he shall receive not less than eight (8) hours pay. However, when strike conditions make it impractical for an Employer to put such an employee to work, or where stoppage of work is occasioned thereby, or when an employee leaves work of his own accord, the provisions of this Article shall not apply and wages shall be paid only for hours actually worked.
(33)	Any employee reporting for employment on his first day of hire shall receive pay for eight (8) hours work if he reports before 9:00 a.m., except where the request for the employee's referral was made not less than thirty-six (36) hours in advance, excluding Saturday, Sunday and holidays.

(37)	After the first four (4) consecutive hours of labor, employees shall be entitled to a thirty (30) minute lunch period for which they shall not be compensated.
38)	When an employee is requested to work in excess of ten (10) hours on any day on which overtime hours have not been scheduled by the Employer with the employee no later than the preceding day, then the employee shall receive a thirty (30) minute lunch period, after the tenth (10th) hour of work, for which he shall be paid at this proper overtime rate.

Article IX Referral Procedure
(67)	In the interest of maintaining an efficient system of production in the Industry, providing for an orderly procedure of referral of applicants for employment, preserving the legitimate interest of the employees in their employment status within the area, and preventing discrimination in employment because of membership or nonmembership in the union, the Union hereby
20
adopts the following procedures for referral of applicants for employment:
(68)	The Employer shall request applicants for employment by calling the Union. The Employer is free to hire whomever it sees fit, but, upon request of the Employer, the Union shall use its best efforts to refer applicants. When the Union is requested but unable to furnish the required employees within forty-eight (48) hours from the time of receiving the Employer's request, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excepted, the Union shall contact the Employer within the fortyeight (48) hour period to discuss means of manning the Employer's job. The Employer may reject any applicant referred.
