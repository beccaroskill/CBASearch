8A. REUSE OF PORTIONS OF THE MUSIC SOUND TRACK FROM A MOTION PICTURE
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 8 and except as provided in subparagraph (e) below, no additional compensation shall be payable for the reuse of any portion of the music sound track of a motion picture in the following circumstances:
(a)	When used for promotional, trailer, news or review purposes.

As used in this subparagraph (a), the term "news" means regularly-scheduled news programs and special news programs which are not pre-planned and which are broadcast within twenty-four (24) hours after the event which gave rise to the program. It is understood that obituary programs are deemed to be "special news programs" even if pre-planned.
Upon learning of any unauthorized use of either "the making of..." or "behind-the-scenes’’-type promotional programs, the parties will jointly discuss appropriate steps to be taken to collect monies for such unauthorized use.
(b)	When used as a so-called "stock shot," as that term is customarily understood in the industry — (j.e., shots excluding dialogue or identifiable characters).
(c)	When used for purposes of recapping the story to date in the context of a serial, multi-part program, episodic series, unit series or anthology.
(d)	When used as a flashback in a context of a serial, multi-part program, episodic series, unit series, one-time show or anthology, except that this shall not apply to programs comprised primarily of flashbacks.

accompanying footage from a motion picture, or for the use of up to two (2)

BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
14.	SUPPLEMENTAL MARKETS
(a)	The provisions of this Article 14 relate and apply only to television motion pictures produced by Producer during the term hereof and subject to this Agreement:
(i)	The principal photography of which commenced on or after July 1, 1971, which motion pictures are, either during the term hereof or at any time thereafter, released in supplemental markets (as defined below); and
(ii)	In which there is music sound track containing recorded music made by participating musicians (as such term is hereinafter defined) or scenes or shots containing pictures of participating musicians performing on musical instruments or conducting.
(iii)	Definition
The term "Supplemental Markets," as used in this Agreement, means only: The exhibition of television motion pictures by means of cassettes (to the limited extent provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (iii), or Pay Television, as those terms are hereafter defined in this paragraph (2), and the exhibition of television motion pictures on any commercial carrier such as commercial airlines, trains, ships and buses (referred to herein as "in-flight").
(1)	Cassettes
For the purposes of this Article 14, a cassette is any audio-visual device, including without limitation, cassette, cartridge, phonogram or other similar audio-visual device now known or hereafter devised, containing a television motion picture (recorded on film, disc, tapes or other material) and designed for replay on a home-type television screen. The sale or rental of cassettes for replay through a television receiver or comparable device in the home or in closed-circuit use, such as in hotel rooms, constitutes "Supplemental Markets" for the purposes of this provision insofar as cassettes are concerned. The foregoing definition does not include the exhibition of a television motion picture by cassette over a television broadcast station or in theatrical exhibition.
(2)	Pay Television
The term "pay television," as used in this Article, shall mean exhibition of television motion pictures on a television screen by means of
- 19-
BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
telecast, cable, closed-circuit, satellite to home or CATV, where substantially all systems to which the program is licensed meet the following tests:
(A)	a separate channel is provided for which the subscriber pays a separate fee (which fee is a major charge relative to other charges made to the subscriber) for that channel;
and/or
(B)	the subscriber pays for the motion picture or motion pictures selected (except that a motion picture or motion pictures selected for which only a token charge is made shall not be considered pay television);
and/or
(C)	the subscriber pays a fee for an encoded telecast, which fee is a major charge relative to other fees paid for encoded telecasts.
The foregoing tests cover those types of services and systems which exist in the industry today and are commonly understood in the industry today to be pay television services or systems.
Exhibitions in theatres or comparable places by means of telecast or cable is theatrical exhibition and shall not be considered Pay Television.
Whenever reference is made in this Article to pay television, such reference shall be deemed to include only those uses of motion pictures as to which a charge is actually made to the subscriber for the program viewed, or when the subscriber has the option, by additional payment, to receive special programming over one or more special channels. When no program charge or special channel charge is made to the subscriber in addition to the general charge, the transmission of television motion pictures by the CATV facility, including programming originated by the CATV facility, is free television exhibition for the purposes of this Agreement, and such exhibition shall not be considered Supplemental Markets exhibition.
The Producers have agreed to the inclusion of pay television in the ’’Supplemental Markets" because, under the present pattern of distribution of television motion pictures, pay television is supplemental to the primary market. The Producers reserve the right in future negotiations to contend
-20-
BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
that the pattern of release has changed so that pay television is no longer a Supplemental Market, but constitutes or is a part of the primary market of distribution of television motion pictures, and that therefore no additional payment pursuant to this Article 14 should be made with respect to the release of television motion pictures (including those covered by this Agreement) in said markets. Nothing herein shall limit the scope of negotiations on said subject.
(b)	As to each such television motion picture, the Producer will pay:
(i)	To the Administrator of the Film Musicians Secondary Markets Fund (previously known as the Theatrical and Television Motion Picture Special Payments Fund) (hereinafter referred to as the "Secondary Markets Fund"), pursuant to the terms of this Article 14 and the Film Musicians Secondary Markets Fund Agreement attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit "A," one percent (1%) (hereinafter referred to as the "percentage payment") of the "Producer's gross" derived from the distribution of such motion picture in Supplemental Markets, computed as hereinafter provided and subject to the following conditions:
(1)	Producer's Gross
(A)	(i) For purposes of calculating Supplemental
Market fees due under this Article 14 arising from the distribution of television motion pictures to "pay television," as defined above, the term "Producer’s gross" shall mean the worldwide total gross receipts derived by the distributor of such motion picture (who may be the Producer or a distributor licensed by the Producer) from licensing the right to exhibit the television motion picture on "pay television," as defined above, and including, in the case of a "foreign territorial sale" by the Producer, the income received from such sale by Producer, but not the income received by "purchaser" or the "licensee."
If the distributor of such picture does not distribute such picture directly to pay television, but employs a subdistributor to so distribute such picture, then the "Producer's gross" shall be the worldwide total gross receipts derived by such subdistributor from licensing the right to exhibit such picture on pay television. In case of an outright sale of the pay television distribution rights for the entire world, or any territory or country, the income derived by the seller from such sale, but not the income realized by the purchaser or licensee of such rights, shall be the "Producer's gross." If any such outright sale shall include pay television exhibition rights and other rights, then (but only for the purpose of the computation required hereunder) the Producer shall allocate to the
-21 -
BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
• pay television exhibition rights a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price which shall, for the purpose hereof, be the ’’Producer’s gross." In reaching this determination, Producer may consider the current market value bf pay television exhibition rights in comparable motion pictures.
(ii)	For purposes of calculating Supplemental Markets fees due under this Article 14 arising from the distribution of television motion pictures on "cassettes," as defined above, the term "Producer’s gross" is defined as follows:
(1)	If the Producer is the Distributor or the Distributor is owned by or affiliated with the Producer, the "Producer’s gross" derived from the distribution of such picture by "cassettes" shall be twenty percent (20%) of the worldwide wholesale receipts derived by the Distributor. In such cases, if the Distributor is also the retailer, a reasonable allocation of the retail gross receipts shall be made as between the Distributor as distributor and the Distributor as retailer, and twenty percent (20%) of the former only shall be deemed to be "Producer's gross." The reasonableness of such allocation shall be subject to arbitration and, in such arbitration, generally prevailing trade practices in the cassette industry with respect to dealings between non-related companies shall be relevant evidence.
(2)	If the Distributor is not the Producer and is not owned by or affiliated with the Producer, the "Producer’s gross" shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the fees received by the Producer from licensing the right to distribute such picture by cassette.
(B)	The "Producer’s gross" shall not include:
(i)	Sums realized or held by way of deposit as security, until and unless earned, other than such sums as are non-returnable;
(ii)	Rebates, credits or repayments for cassettes returned (and, in this connection, the Producer shall have the right to set up a reasonable reserve for returns);
(iii)	Sums required to be paid or withheld as taxes, in the nature of turnover taxes, sales taxes or similar taxes based on the actual receipts of such motion picture or on any monies to be remitted to or by the Producer, but there shall not be excluded from Producer's gross any net income tax,
-22-
BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
franchise tax or excess profit tax or similar tax payable by the Producer or such Distributor on its net income or for the privilege of doing business;
(iv)	Frozen foreign currency until the Producer shall either have the right to freely use such foreign currency, or Producer has the right to transmit to the United States to Producer such foreign currency from the country or territory where it is frozen. If such currency may be utilized or transmitted as aforesaid, it shall be deemed to have been converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which such currency was actually transmitted to the United States as aforesaid or, if not actually transmitted, then at the prevailing free market rate of exchange at the time such right to use or to transmit occurs. Frozen foreign currency shall be deemed to be unblocked on the basis of "first in, first out," unless otherwise allocated by local foreign fiscal authorities. Allocation of such unblocked funds as between revenue which serves as the basis of determining payments hereunder and other revenue shall be on a proportional basis, subject to different earmarking by local foreign fiscal authorities;
(v)	Sums paid to any advertising agency in connection with any exhibition of a motion picture in Supplemental Markets.
(C)	Such gross income realized in foreign currency in any reporting period required hereunder shall be deemed to be converted to United States dollars at the prevailing market rate of exchange at the close of such reporting period, except that when such gross income has actually been transmitted to the United States, it shall be deemed converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which such foreign currency was actually so transmitted.
(D)	Allocation of Producer’s Gross
If any agreement for distribution in Supplemental Markets includes more than one television motion picture, or includes both Supplemental Market rights and other rights, the Producer shall make a reasonable allocation for the purpose of determining payments due hereunder. If the Federation contends that such allocation is not reasonable, then such claim shall be submitted to arbitration.
(2) Producer’s obligation shall accrue hereunder only after Producer’s gross is received by the Producer. Payments of amounts accruing hereunder shall be made annually on the basis of annual statements, as hereinafter provided. Should any discounts, taxes, duties or charges be imposed in connection with the receipt or remittance of foreign funds, only so much of such funds as
-23-
BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
remain thereafter shall be included in Producer's gross. Producer shall not be responsible for loss or diminution of foreign receipts as a result of any matter or thing not reasonably within the control of the Producer. The Federation, the Employers' Pension Fund or the Secondary Markets Fund, as the case may be, and the musicians shall be bound by any arrangements made in good faith by the Producer, or for its account, with respect to the deposit or remittance of foreign revenue. Frozen foreign receipts shall not be considered trust funds and the Producer may freely commingle the same with other funds of the Producer.
A "non-returnable advance" is to be included in "Producer's gross" when the picture is "available" and "identifiable" and the amount of the advance payment is "ascertainable."
The picture is "available" when the first of the following occurs:
(A)	The product first may be exhibited or otherwise exploited by a specified method of distribution and in a territory under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement, or
(B)	It first may be sold or rented by a retailer under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement.
The picture is "identifiable" when the Producer first knows or reasonably should have known that a given motion picture is covered by a particular license or distribution agreement for its exploitation in the applicable market.
The amount of the advance payment is "ascertainable" if:
(A)	the advance is for one (1) motion picture, means of exhibition, and territory, or
(B)	the total amount of the advance is for more than one motion picture, means of exhibition and/or territory, in which case the Producer shall fairly and reasonably allocate such advance among the licensed motion pictures, exhibition markets and/or territorial markets. As each of these pictures becomes identifiable and available, the allocated portion of the non-returnable advance is to be included in "Producer's gross" for that quarter. The Producer shall notify the Secondary Markets Fund of its allocation when the report of "Producer's gross," which includes the advance, is to be filed.
-24-
BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
If the picture is available in any territory or by any means of exhibition and is identifiable and the amount of the advance is ascertainable, but the Producer does not provide the Secondary Markets Fund with the information required by this Agreement and applicable law, then the advance shall be deemed includable in "accountable receipts" no later than six (6) months after the Producer receives it.
An advance received by a Producer's parent, subsidiary or any other related or affiliated entity or successor-in-interest, or by any other entity to which the advance payment is directed by the Producer or license or distribution agreement, shall be considered as an advance payment received by the Producer.
(3)	If any license or outright sale of exhibition rights to the motion picture in Supplemental Markets includes as a part thereof any filmed commercial or advertising material, the Producer shall be permitted to allocate a reasonable amount (in accordance with then current standard charges in the industry) to such commercial or advertising material, and the amount so allocated shall not be included in Producer's gross hereunder.
(4)	The term "participating musician," as used herein, means a musician who, while in the employ of the Producer (to which employment the provisions of this Agreement apply), participated in the preparation for or the recording of the music sound track for such motion picture or who was photographed in such motion picture as performing on musical instruments or conducting. If payments hereunder are made to the Employers' Pension Fund, the "pro rata share" credited to each participating musician shall be that proportion of the percentage payment that the total compensation theretofore paid to such musician for his/her said services in the motion picture in an employment capacity bears to the aggregate total compensation theretofore paid to all participating musicians for their services in recording or being photographed in the motion picture in an employment capacity. If payments hereunder are made to the Secondary Markets Fund, there shall be payable to each participating musician that portion of the part of the musicians' share of the Secondary Markets Fund which is allocable to such motion picture that the total compensation theretofore paid to such musician for his/her said services in the motion picture in an employment capacity bears to the aggregate total compensation theretofore paid to all participating musicians for their services in recording or being photographed in the motion picture in an employment capacity. The term "total compensation," as used herein, means all monies paid to a participating musician for his/her said services, or his/her heirs, executors, administrators or assigns as of a time

immediately preceding the close of the annual period covered by the Producer's annual statement involved. The cost of transportation or living expenses paid to or on behalf of musicians shall not be included in "total compensation."
(5)	When "participating musicians" have been utilized in creating the music sound track for a motion picture which is scored partially in the United States or Canada and partially outside of the United States and Canada, the percentage payment into the Secondary Markets Fund shall be as follows: the payment shall be prorated by multiplying such percentage payment by a fraction whose numerator consists of the total salaries paid to the musicians employed under the terms of this Agreement and the denominator of which consists of the total salaries paid to all musicians employed in connection with the scoring of such motion picture. The foregoing proration formula shall be subject to the following exceptions: (1) in any instance in which the total salaries paid to musicians employed under this Agreement is less than thirty percent (30%) of the total salaries paid to all musicians employed in connection with the scoring of the motion picture, the Producer shall nevertheless be required to pay thirty percent (30%) of the percentage payment due; and (2) in any instance in which the total salaries paid to musicians employed under this Agreement totals seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the total salaries paid to all musicians employed in connection with the scoring of the motion picture, then the Producer shall be required to make a contribution to the Secondary Markets Fund equal to what the contribution would have been if one hundred percent (100%) of the scoring had taken place in the United States or Canada. The Producer shall provide to the auditors the information necessary to determine the correct pro rata payment.* The Producer will identify a motion picture as subject to this subparagraph (5) at the time of the first payment to the Fund for that motion picture.
(6)	Such payments made hereunder to the Employers' Pension Fund are not and shall not in any manner be construed to be wages due to any individual employee, nor in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities or torts of any employee.
(7)	The Administrator of the Secondary Markets Fund shall make ail deductions and withholdings required by law and shall timely make all such reports and payments to governmental agencies as may be required by law.

Checks shall be made payable to the order of the "American Federation of Musicians and Employers' Pension Fund," and sent to P.O. Box 19155, Newark, NJ 07195-0155 (or to the local union to be forwarded to the Pension Fund, if the local union and Producer have so agreed).

During'the course of bargaining, the Federation expressed concern that the contribution report forms presently being utilized by signatory Producers may not contain all of the relevant information necessary to enable proper identification and/or effective auditing of Pension Fund contributions. After considering these concerns, the parties jointly recommend to the Trustees of the American Federation of Musicians’ and Employers' Pension Fund that appropriate steps be taken to assure that contributing Employers provide the Pension Fund with sufficient information for the proper administration of the Fund.
(e)	The Federation and said trustees, or either of them, may enforce the provisions contained in this clause.
4.	HEALTH PLAN
The parties hereto are parties to and bound by the provisions of the "Agreement and Declaration of Trust Establishing the I.A.T.S.E.-Basic Crafts-Guilds-Hollywood Producers-Health and Welfare Fund for the Employees of the Motion Picture and Allied Industries," dated as of October 20, 1952 (hereinafter referred to as the "Health Plan"), with respect to the musicians’ classifications of this agreement.
In accordance with Article V, Sections 1 and 2, of such Health Plan, the rate of contribution to the Health Plan by Producer for each such employee employed by it hereunder shall be as follows:
During the term of this Agreement, Producer shall pay into the Plan one dollar, five and eight-tenths cents ($.1.058) until August 3, 2003 (one dollar, twenty-five and eight-tenths cents ($1.258) effective August 3, 2003) for each hour guaranteed a musician by Producer or each hour worked by a musician for Producer on or after February 16, 2002 under the terms of this Agreement, including "straight time" and "overtime" hours on any day worked. Should subsequent increases be negotiated by the I.A.T.S.E. during the term of this Agreement, the same will apply. Minimum calls shall constitute time worked. Weekly schedules shall be considered as a minimum of forty-three and two-tenths (43.2) hours for a full workweek. With respect only to recording and rehearsal musicians employed for less than twelve (12)
-39-
BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16,2002 — February 15,2005
hours on a daily basis, whether for a single or double session, the contributions to the Fund shall be based on minimum credit of twelve (12) hours for any such day, at the rate of one dollar, five and eight-tenths cents ($1.058) until August 3,2003 (one dollar, twenty-five and eight-tenths cents (1.258) effective August 3, 2003). Contributions for musicians employed by Producer at a page rate shall be computed on the basis of one and one-half hours for each $18.55 effective February 17, 2002 ($19.01 effective February 16, 2003; and $19.68 effective February 15, 2004) earned with Producer at a page rate as a copyist; for each $29.66 effective February 17, 2002 ($30.40 effective February 16, 2003; and $31.46 effective February 15, 2004) earned with Producer at a page rate as an orchestrator or an arranger.
For a dental plan, the Producer shall pay into the Health Plan an additional eighteen and seven-tenths cents (18.70) per hour contribution.
For a vision care plan, the Producer shall pay into the Health Plan a five cent (50) per hour contribution.
The above contributions are in accordance with the present pattern of contributions by Employers required under the Health Plan. In the event this present pattern of contributions under the Health Plan should be changed during the term of this Agreement, then the rate of contributions as provided herein shall automatically be changed to conform to such new pattern and rate of Employer's contribution established under such Health Plan.
When a single session is held in which scoring for more than one series is intermixed as provided in Paragraph 15(a)(9) hereof, then if a second separate single session is held for the same Producer on the same day for any other episode of any of the series scored during the first session, then those recording musicians who performed in both such sessions shall receive a credit of an additional twelve (12) hours over and above the minimum credit of twelve (12) hours set forth above.
The parties recognize that a problem exists in the present formula for determining the basis of credited hours for Health Plan contributions for recording musicians, production musicians and musicians employed on a page rate. Therefore, the parties agree to immediately undertake a joint study to evaluate the problems and to recommend changes in the method of determining credited hours which will not result in any increase in the total hours for all musicians. If, during
-40-
BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16,2002— February 15, 2005
the term of this Agreement, the parties agree upon a change in the current method of contributions, this Agreement shall be amended to reflect such changes.
With respect to the employment of musicians outside of Los Angeles County, California for which such payments into such Health Plan are not permissible under the provisions of such Health Plan, Producer, in lieu, thereof, will pay to the applicable local health plan, if any, and if permissible under an acceptable Letter of Adherence satisfactory to the Producer, the normal contribution for the appropriate category provided for under such local health plan but not to exceed the amount of contribution payable into the Health Plan as above provided.
If the musician is not a participant in any Health Plan of any AFM Local Union, the Producer shall pay the above-described contributions directly to the musician, irrespective of the location outside Los Angeles County in which the services were performed.

7.	SUBCONTRACTING
In the event Producer subcontracts out any work that would otherwise be subject to this Agreement, Producer shall have the option either: (i) to obtain from the subcontractor an agreement to comply with the minimum compensation provisions in this Agreement, and cause such subcontractor to comply with such provisions; or (ii) in the alternative, Producer shall make such payments.

12.	ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENT DEVICES
A person who, in exercising musical skills, utilizes a synthesizer or other electronic device to produce music is a musician within the meaning of this Agreement.

(b)	The foregoing late payment charges shall not be required when Producer's failure or delay in paying results from:
(1)	The employee's failure or delay in furnishing a W-4 form; or
(2)	The musician's failure to furnish appropriate documentation to enable the Producer to complete the 1-9 form (provided that a musician's failure to provide such documentation shall not excuse late payment to any other musician engaged for the same session);

-51 -
BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16,2002 — February 15, 2005
Each additional two and one-half (2!6) minutes of such recorded music scored in such session shall constitute an additional thirty (30) minutes of recording for those musicians recording such additional finished recorded music.
With respect to and in computing the liquidated damages provided for in subparagraph (a)(5)(iv)(B)(l) above, when the picture is scored solely with previously-recorded track as also provided in subparagraph (a)(5)(iv)(B)(l) above, the first fifteen (15) minutes or less of such previously-recorded track used in the new picture shall be deemed a single three (3) hour session and the first thirty (30) minutes of such previously-recorded track used in such new picture shall be deemed a double (z>., a six (6) hour) session. Each additional five (5) minutes, or fraction thereof, of such previously-recorded music so used shall be deemed to be an additional one (1) hour session. When previously-recorded track, as provided in subparagraph (a)(5)(iv)(B)(l) above, and live scoring are both used in the picture, then each five (5) minutes, or fraction thereof, of the previously-recorded track shall be deemed to be a one (1) hour session.
Previously-recorded track, when used as hereinabove provided, shall not apply against the scoring hour requirements.
(C)	With respect to a picture for which music has been scored live, previously-recorded cues from other pictures of the series, whether recorded in the same or any previous broadcast season, may be substituted for any deleted portion of the music which was scored live for that picture, when such substitution is due to creative, dramatic reasons in the good faith judgment of the Producer; it being understood that such substitutions shall not be used for the purpose of evading the intent of the above live scoring provisions.
(1)	In the event music cues from any previous broadcast season, specified in Paragraph (C) above, are utilized, the Producer shall be responsible for the timely remittance to the Federation of cue sheets setting forth the information necessary to identify such previously-recorded cues.
(2)	The Federation shall have the right to review annually, on an ongoing basis, the implementation of this provision on a Producer-by-Producer basis, under the auspices of the Joint Cooperative Committee.
(3)	If, in the Federation’s judgment, any Producer is failing to comply with the provisions with respect to music utilized
BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16,2002 — February 15,2005
from any previous broadcast season, the Federation shall meet with that Producer, as part of the Joint Cooperative Committee, to resolve the non-compliance issues. In the event that such compliance issues are not resolved, the Federation shall have the unilateral right to withhold, on a Producer-by-Producer basis, utilization of this provision with respect to music cues from previous broadcast seasons for the remainder of this Agreement. In the event the Federation takes such action, it shall notify the Producer in writing.
(D)	Format music once recorded live for a series may be reutilized in any picture of the series for that broadcast season and subsequent broadcast seasons and, in addition, identical cues need not be rescored for additional use in any given picture. "Format music" includes standard openings and closings, bumpers, billboards, lead-ins and lead-outs. In the event that format music for a series is reutilized in a subsequent broadcast season, Producer shall pay to the recording musicians who participated in the recording of the format music an additional fee equal to the minimum single session fee in effect at the beginning of such subsequent broadcast season in which the format music is reutilized. No more than one (1) such payment shall be required for each subsequent broadcast season in which the format music is utilized.
A session called for the scoring of a format or formats, including main and/or end titles and/or standard cues and/or "bumpers," may also be used for the scoring of music for a pilot or episode of that series, but may not be used to score music other than for the format or formats of such pilot or episode.
Except as specifically set forth herein, Producer may not record music sound track for general usage, (lc., no "library track") for use in such dramatic television pictures.
So-called "Specials of the Week" shall not be included in computing the required scoring hours above provided.
A recording session consisting of a single recording musician shall be included in computing the above scoring requirements only if such music is reported in the cue sheet.

The Producer shall have the burden of proof in establishing these facts.
BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
The scoring requirements for fewer than thirteen (13) pictures shall be pro rata of the hours required for thirteen (13) pictures. As used herein, the term "dramatic pictures" refers to pictures of a dramatic nature, specifically excluding situation comedies and documentaries.
(E)	In the event of any dispute as to whether a television film is a dramatic film for the above purposes, such dispute shall be determined as follows: It shall be referred to a joint committee composed of a representative of the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers and a representative of the Federation. In the event that the dispute is not determined in such step, the matter may then be referred to a Cooperative Committee to be composed of five (5) representatives selected by the Federation and five (5) representatives selected by the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers. A unanimous decision in such first step or a decision of six (6) or more members of the Committee in the second step shall be binding upon all the parties to the dispute.
(6)	The scoring requirements called for by the preceding paragraph may be cumulated, as therein provided, among all television motion pictures produced by the Producer during each production period. As used herein, the term "production period" shall refer to periods of one year each starting on February 17, 2002, February 16, 2003 and February 15, 2004.

(11)	The scoring requirements for documentaries shall be the same as for other television motion pictures except that Producer, if it desires, may use library music or historical music sound track (except musical film sound tracks recorded under this Agreement) in any documentary picture or pictures, provided that such picture or pictures shall have live scoring for the scoring hours called for in subparagraph (a)(5) above.
(12)	Producer shall not call token scoring sessions for the sole purpose of fulfilling the above total number of scoring hours required. All musical performances hereunder, other than by production musicians (non-recording), shall be recorded with the intent of using the sound track in said television pictures, subject to the Producer’s privilege to edit such track for artistic purposes.

If, in such session, he/she played the saxophone for the first hour and the flute for the second and third hours and the saxophone for the fourth, fifth and sixth hours, he/she would be entitled to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for the first three (3) hours, and the basic rate for the last three (3) hours.
In computing the compensation for doubling, all time from the start of the recording engagement shall be considered in three (3) hour sessions, regardless of the unequal division of a double session.
For example: If the Musician plays saxophone for the first and second hours and, after the break following the second hour, plays the flute for the third hour and the saxophone again for the fourth, fifth and sixth hours, he/she would be entitled to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for the first three (3) hours and the basic rate for the last three (3) hours.
In a double session, during which one (1) or more doubles occurs in the first three (3) hours and the Musician commences the fourth hour with a doubling instrument, such doubling instrument shall be considered as the first double for the second three (3) hour period.
For example: A Musician plays the saxophone for the first hour, the flute for the second hour and the oboe in the third, fourth, fifth and sixth hours. He/she would be entitled to one hundred seventy percent (170%)
-59-

(B)	Overtime'
If a double is begun in a three (3) hour session and such double is continued in an overtime period, the doubling rate shall apply for the three (3) hour session plus the overtime period.
For example: If a Musician plays a saxophone for the first and second hours and plays the flute for the third and fourth hours, he/she would be entitled to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for four (4) hours. If he/she played the saxophone for the first hour, the flute for the second hour and the oboe for the third and fourth hours, he/she would be paid one hundred seventy percent (170%) of the basic rate for the first three (3) hours and one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for the fourth hour.

For example: A Musician plays the saxophone for the first hour, the flute for the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh hours, he/she would be entitled to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for the seven (7) hours.
For example: A Musician plays the saxophone for the first three (3) hours, the flute for the fourth and fifth hours, and the saxophone for the sixth and seventh hours, he/she would be entitled to the basic rate for the first three (3) hours, one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for the second three (3) hours, and the basic rate for the overtime period.
If the musician commences doubling in an overtime period, he/she shall be paid a minimum of three (3) hours at the doubling rate.
For example: A Musician plays the saxophone for a three (3) hour session. He/she plays the flute for the fourth hour. He/she would
BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15,2005
be entitled to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the basic rate for three (3) hours and the basic rate for one (1) hour.
(C)	The first "double" rate of fifty percent (50%) of basic rate extra may only be paid when the basic rate is in effect. The second "double" rate of twenty percent (20%) of the basic rate extra shall only apply when the first doubling rate is in effect at the same time. The third "double" rate of twenty percent (20%) of the basic rate extra shall apply only when the second doubling rate is in effect at the same time; and the fourth "double" rate of twenty percent (20%) of the basic rate extra shall only apply when the third doubling rate is in effect at the same time.
For example: In a three (3) hour session, a Musician plays the saxophone for the first hour, plays the flute for the second hour and the oboe for the third hour.

In addition to the provisions of Paragraph 8, "Vacation Pay," above, the following additional vacation provisions shall apply to Librarians who meet the following necessary eligibility requirements:
(a)	Eligibility Requirements
Eligible employees shall be those employees who actually worked for Producer for twelve (12) consecutive "eligible" years, with an aggregate of not less than 2,400 "straight time" days worked with Producer in such twelve years.
As used in this provision, the term "year," shall mean the employee’s personal income tax earnings year (also hereinafter referred to as "tax year"); the term "eligible year" shall mean a tax year in which the employee worked one hundred (100) or more "straight time" days for Producer.
Any tax year in which the employee actually works less than one hundred (100) "straight time" days for Producer shall be excluded in computing the required twelve (12) "eligible" tax years, and the "straight time" days worked in such year shall not be counted in computing the required aggregate 2,400 "straight time" days to be worked in such twelve (12) tax years.
Employees who fail to work more than one hundred (100) "straight time" days for such employer in each of any two (2) consecutive tax years shall, at the end of such second year, be considered a new employee hereunder with no previous employment credit with Producer, for the purpose of establishing the above eligibility requirements. Provided, however, that in determining such two (2) consecutive years, no year shall be included (and the "straight time" days worked in such year shall not be counted for any eligibility purposes hereunder) in which the employee could not work one hundred (100) "straight time" days for Producer due to either or both of the following:
(1)	The period of recorded leaves of absence granted by Producer;
(2)	For the period during which the employee was absent and physically unable to work for Producer solely as a result of an "industrial accident" occurring to such employee while employed by Producer.

Commencing with November 1,1960, such employees who become eligible on or after such date, as above provided, shall, beginning with the date they so become eligible, earn with Producer fifty percent (50%) more in vacation time and money, based upon the applicable Weekly or Daily employee vacation schedule set forth above; any such employee shall be limited to earning a maximum of only fifteen (15) days vacation per year. Provided that for the remainder of any such tax year in which such an employee becomes eligible, he/she shall only earn additional vacation time and money, as above provided, based solely on the "straight time” days he/she worked for Producer after he/she so became eligible and within the remaining portion of such year, to be computed separate and apart at the rate of one-half of the vacation benefit specified under the above applicable daily or weekly vacation schedule.
(c)	Loss of Eligibility
Employees who become eligible, as above provided, but who thereafter either resign from employment with Producer or fail to work for Producer more than one hundred fifty (150) "straight time" days in any one (1) tax year shall, as of the last day of such tax year, or, in the case of resignation, the date of such resignation, lose such eligibility and right to earn the additional vacation days and pay above provided; in such event, they shall thereupon be considered new employees hereunder with no previous employment credit with Producer for the purpose of subsequently establishing the above eligibility requirements.
In determining whether any employee loses his/her eligibility for failure to work for Producer more than one hundred fifty (150) "straight time" days in a tax year, as above provided, no such year shall be counted for this purpose in which the employee could not work at least one hundred fifty-one (151) "straight time" days for Producer due to either or both of the following:
(1)	The period of recorded leaves of absence granted such employee by Producer;
(2)	The period during which such employee was absent and physically unable to work for Producer solely as a result of an "industrial accident" occurring to him/her while employed by Producer.

shall establish the proper administrative machinery and processes necessary for the performance of its duties hereunder.
The Administrator each year shall, as soon as practicable after the end of the Secondary Markets Fund's fiscal year (March 31st) distribute the musicians' share of the Secondary Markets Fund (as defined in the Operative Articles). Each participating musician shall receive such amounts as are designated as payable to him/her in the Operative Articles; and in determining said amount, the Administrator shall determine that part of the musicians' share of the Secondary Markets Fund allocable to each television motion picture covered by the Operative Articles.
In the event of the death of a musician entitled to a distributive share hereunder, the Administrator shall distribute such share to the beneficiary designated by such musician on a form provided by the Administrator for such purpose or, if no beneficiaiy be so designated, then to the surviving spouse of such musician; or if there be no such person, to the musician's estate.
(b)	The Producers, individually and collectively, hereby irrevocably designate the Administrator as their agent to pay from the Producers' share of the Secondary Markets Fund any Social Security tax, federal and/or state unemployment insurance tax, other employment taxes, disability insurance premiums, and/or worker's compensation premiums, which may be owing by the Producer individually and/or collectively, as employer or employers, with respect to the distribution of the musicians' share of the Secondary Markets Fund.
(c)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Administrator shall refund to each Producer that part of the Producer's
EXHIBIT "A

BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16,2002 — February 15, 2005
payment to the Secondary Markets Fund representing a part or all of said Producer's portion of the total employer taxes and insurance premiums which may be payable under the Operative Articles and this Agreement with respect to the distribution of the musicians' share of the Secondary Markets Fund, which the Producer, at the time it makes its annual payment to the Secondary Markets Fund, may request be refunded to it, or which must be paid by the Producer, and not the Secondary Markets Fund, to the relevant government agency or authority pursuant to any law, rule, regulation, ruling or other communication of any government agency or authority. Any such refund, and all reports, returns, information or other material, completed in proper form for reporting or filing, which is necessary for payment, and reporting or filing with respect thereto, of any such employer taxes or insurance premiums to the relevant government agency or authority by each Producer shall be transmitted to each Producer by the Administrator so as to enable the Producer to timely, accurately and completely make such payments and reports or filings. If a refund is made to a Producer under this Paragraph 2(c), the Administrator shall not be responsible for payment of said Producer's employer taxes or insurance premiums payable under the Operative Articles and this Agreement with regard to the distribution of the musicians1 share of the Secondary Markets Fund with respect to which the refund is made. Should any government agency or authority require information, returns, reports or other material in regard to employer taxes or insurance premiums payable with respect to any distribution of the musicians’ share of the Secondary Markets Fund to be filed or reported by any Producer, rather than the Secondary Markets Fund, (even though payment of such employer taxes or insurance premiums is made by the Secondary Markets Fund), or should any Producer request that it, rather than the Secondary Markets Fund, file or report such information, returns, reports or other material, the Administrator shall transmit to the Producer all such reports, returns, information or other material, completed in proper form for reporting or filing, so as to enable the Producer to make such filing or reporting timely, completely and accurately.
For purposes of this Paragraph 2(c), the term "Producer" shall
include any party which has undertaken, pursuant to the Operative Articles, a Producer’s obligation to make payments to the Secondary Markets Fund and any other party which has acted as agent on behalf of a Producer with respect to payment to the Secondary Markets Fund.
(d)	The Federation has agreed to furnish to the Administrator, and
to cause its local unions to furnish to the Administrator, all data in the possession or subject to the control thereof which is necessaiy and proper to assist in the orderly and accurate distribution to musicians as provided herein, and to request
EXHIBIT "A"
- 108-
BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
the Trustees of the American Federation of Musicians and Employers Pension Fund to do likewise upon reimbursement of all costs reasonably incurred thereby in so doing.
(e)	The Administrator shall indemnify and hold the Producers harmless out of the Secondary Markets Fund against any liability for making any of the payments to the musicians under Paragraph 2(a) hereof or any payments of employment taxes and insurance premiums which may be required to be made by the Administrator under Paragraph 2(c) hereof, it being the express intent of the parties that all such payments are to be made out of the Secondary Markets Fund with no further cost or expense of any kind whatsoever to the Producers. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Administrator also shall furnish a surety bond with a responsible surety company satisfactory to the Producers and to the Federation, to guarantee the full and faithful performance of its duties as herein described.
(f)	In making distribution to musicians hereunder, the Administrator shall clearly and legibly display the following legend on all checks, vouchers, letters or documents of transmittal: "This is a special payment to you by the Motion Picture and Television Producers who are operating under the AFM Basic Theatrical Motion Picture Agreement, as amended, negotiated by the American Federation of Musicians," and/or "This is a special payment to you by the Motion Picture and Television Producers who are operating under the AFM Basic Television Motion Picture Agreement negotiated by the American Federation of Musicians."
(g)	If a musician for whom a distributive share has been set apart
cannot be found or if payment under this Agreement has been tendered but is not completed after efforts which the Administrator deems reasonable, the Administrator shall add such share ("unclaimed share") to a reserve account and hold the same pending receipt of claim until the end of the third fiscal year after the date on which such share was first payable. Thereafter, the unclaimed share shall be redeposited in the musicians’ share of the Secondary Markets Fund as defined in the Operative Articles for distribution as provided in Paragraph 2(a). If, subsequent to the redeposit of such unclaimed share, the musician asserts a valid claim with respect to such unclaimed amount, the Administrator shall pay such claim ("Past-Year’s Claim") and such payment shall be deemed an expense of the Secondary Markets Fund.
(h)	Any payments otherwise due to musicians which shall be less than ten dollars ($10.00) shall be regarded as "de minimis" ("de minimis amounts")
EXHIBIT "A
- 109-
BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
and shall be added to a reserve account. Provided that, when the de minimis amount(s) so deposited to a musician's credit, when added to any current distribution due such musician, equals or exceeds the sum of ten dollars ($10.00), said de minimis amount(s) shall be added to such current distribution and paid to such musician.
3.	(a) In the event that any Producer shall default in the payment of
any sums to the Administrator when the same shall become due pursuant to this Agreement, the Administrator shall have the duty, right and power forthwith to commence action or to take any other proceedings as shall be necessary for the collection thereof, including the power and authority to compromise and settle with the Federation's consent. The Administrator's reasonable expenses, attorneys’ fees and other disbursements incurred in the collection of any overdue sums shall be paid to the Administrator by the Producers so defaulting and such payment shall be added to the Secondary Markets Fund.
(b)	Nothing contained herein shall create any cause of action in favor of any musician as defined in the Basic Theatrical Agreement or in the Basic Television Agreement against any Producer, but the Federation may enforce distribution of the musicians' share of the Secondary Markets Fund on behalf of the individual musicians.
(c)	The Administrator shall deposit all money and property received by it, with or without interest, with any bank or trust company, insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and having capital, surplus and undivided profits exceeding Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000); provided, however, that in the event that Canadian dollars are receivable by the Administrator and it is not feasible or desirable to convert such Canadian dollars into United States funds, such Canadian funds and any securities purchased therewith may be deposited in the Chartered Bank of the Dominion of Canada, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. Except as modified by the provisions of Paragraph 3(d) hereof, the Administrator shall have the right and power to invest and reinvest the said money and property only in short term investments (not to exceed one year in duration), in bonds and other direct obligations of the United States of America and of the Dominion of Canada, high grade commercial paper, insured bank certificates of deposit, and commingled investment funds managed by banks or trust companies for which the Administrator or some other party may be engaged as investment manager for a reasonable fee. Such investments may be made without regard to the proportion which any such investment
EXHIBIT "A
-110-
BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15, 2005
or investments may bear to the entire amount of the Secondary Markets Fund and to sell, exchange and otherwise deal with such investments as to the Administrator may seem desirable.
(d)	In connection with the collection of any sums due to it hereunder, the Administrator may consent to and participate in any composition of creditors, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceedings, and in the event that as a result thereof the Administrator shall become the holder of assets other than money, obligations to pay money conditioned only as to the time of payment, or property of the class specified in Paragraph 3(c) hereof (which assets are in this subsection (d) called "property"), the Administrator may consent to and participate in any plan of reorganization, consolidation, merger, combination, or other similar plan, and consent to any contract, lease, mortgage, purchase, sale or other action by any corporation pursuant to such plan and accept any property which might be received by the Administrator under any such plan, whether or not such property is of the class in which the Administrator, by Paragraph 3(c) hereof, is authorized to invest the Secondary Markets Fund; the Administrator may deposit any such property with any protective, reorganization or similar committee, delegate discretionary power thereto, and pay part of its expenses and compensation and any assessment levied with respect to such property; the Administrator may exercise all conversion, subscription, voting and other rights of whatsoever nature pertaining to any such property, and grant proxies, discretionary or otherwise, in respect thereof and accept any property which may be acquired by the Administrator by the exercise of any such rights, whether or not such property is of the class in which the Administrator, by Paragraph 3(c) hereof, is authorized to invest the Secondary Markets Fund. Anything to the contrary contained in this Paragraph 3(d) notwithstanding, the Administrator shall reasonably endeavor to dispose of any such property in order that the Secondary Markets Fund, to the fullest extent possible, at all times shall be comprised as specified in Paragraph 3(c) hereof.
(e)	Parties dealing with the Administrator shall not be required to look to the application of any monies paid to the Administrator.
(f)	Provided that the Administrator exercises due diligence and the highest standard of professional conduct in performing duties for the Secondary Markets Fund, the Administrator will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from anything done or omitted in good faith, nor shall the Administrator be subject to any personal liability for monies received and expended in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In addition to the surety bond required by Paragraph
EXHIBIT "A"
- Ill -

BASIC TELEVISION FILM AGREEMENT
February 16, 2002 — February 15,2005
2.(e) above, the Secondary Markets Fund will secure any insurance coverage which may be necessary or advisable by virtue of this subparagraph (f).
(g)	The fiscal year of the Secondary Markets Fund shall be the twelve month period from April 1 to the next March 31. Within ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year, the Administrator shall furnish a statement for such fiscal year of its operations to each Producer hereto making payments to the Administrator and to the Federation. Such statements shall set forth in detail the properties and monies on hand and the operations of the Administrator during the immediately preceding fiscal year, including without limiting the details of any compromise or settlement made by the Administrator with any Producer, and such other information and data as shall be appropriate to inform fully the recipients of such statements and shall be certified by an independent certified public accountant.
(h)	The Administrator, at all times without limitation to the duration of this Agreement, shall keep full and accurate records and accounts concerning all transactions involving the receipt and expenditure of monies hereunder and the investment and reinvestment thereof, all in convenient form and pursuant to approved and recognized accounting practices. Each Producer and the Federation shall have the right from time to time, without limitation to the duration of this Agreement, and at all reasonable times during business hours, to have their respective duly authorized agents examine and audit the Administrator's records and accounts for the purpose of verifying any statements and payments made by the Administrator pursuant to this Agreement, during a period not exceeding two (2) years preceding such examination. The Administrator shall afford all necessary facilities to such authorized agents to make such examination and audit and to make extracts and excerpts from said records and accounts as may be necessary or proper according to approved and recognized accounting practices.
(i)	No musician shall have any right to assign all or any portion of the payments to which such musician shall become entitled hereunder, and any attempted assignment of all or any portion of such payments shall be null and void and of no legal effect; provided, however, that the Administrator shall recognize and honor lawful assignments to the Federation of a portion of the payments to which any musician shall become entitled hereunder.
4.	(a) The Oversight Committee ("Committee") will consist of one (1)
or more Producer representatives (but not exceeding three (3) such representatives) appointed by the AMPTP., A representative or representatives of the AFM (but not

5.	(a) The annual budget for the costs associated with the operation of
the Secondary Markets Fund, including the compensation of the Administrator, shall be approved by the Committee after consultation with the AFM liaison(s).

(b) The manner in which the collection and audit program are
functioning will be reviewed by the Committee. Contribution and audit reports may be reviewed by the Oversight Committee and AFM liaison(s) upon their request solely for the purpose of evaluating the collection and audit program, subject to the following: (i) the members of the Committee shall be bound by any confidentiality agreements applicable to such contribution and audit reports; (ii) to the extent that such contribution and audit reports are subject to a confidentiality agreement, the Secondary Markets Fund shall make them available for review only

Re:	Due Dates for Payments to Musicians Pursuant to Sound
Track Records Released in Connection with Motion Pictures
Dear Steve:
The purpose of this letter is to confirm the agreements reached between the parties during the course of the Joint Industry-Federation Cooperative Committee meetings held April 21-22, 1992 and August 18-19, 1993. The parties have agreed that Article 8C.( 1) of the Basic Theatrical Motion Picture Agreement and Article 8C.(1) of the Television Film Agreement shall be interpreted and applied as follows:
If a Producer elects to compensate musicians who rendered services with respect to any sound track record released in connection with any theatrical motion picture and/or television film pursuant to the provisions of Article 8C.(1) through (3), then the phrase "(u]pon release of the record" in subparagraph (1) shall mean that the payment will be made no later than 45 days after the "street date" and, further, that the Producer will exert all reasonable efforts to cause the phonograph record companies to make payments to the musicians within thirty (30) days after "street date." Additionally, if the Federation obtains, in direct negotiations with the phonograph record companies, a commitment from those companies to make payments in less than thirty (30) days, that time limitation shall apply with respect to the payments due under subparagraph (1) referred to above.

Dear Mark:
During the 1993 negotiations between the AFM and the Employers represented by the AM PTP, the parties agreed that the report form to the Special Payments Fund would contain certain information. Among other things, the parties agreed that the production number of the motion picture and the name of the production entity would, if available, be included in the report form.
As to those Employers represented by the AMPTP, it is understood that such information shall be considered available only if it is contained in the system which generates the Special Payments Fund report.

Dear Mark:
Reference is made to Paragraph 4, "Health Plan," of the American Federation of Musicians Basic Theatrical Motion Picture Agreement of 1993 and the Basic Television Film Agreement of 1993, which provides in part:
"The parties hereto are parties to and bound by the provisions of the 'Agreement and Declaration of Trust establishing the LA.T.S.E.-Basic Crafts-Guilds-Hollywood Producers-Health and Welfare Fund for the Employees of the Motion Pictures and Allied Industries,' dated as of October 20, 1952 .. . with respect to the musicians' classifications of this agreement.
* * *
"The above contributions are in accordance with the present pattern of contributions by Employers required under the Health Plan. In the event this present pattern of contributions under the Health Plan should be changed during the term of this Agreement, then the rate of contributions as provided herein shall automatically be changed to conform to such new pattern and rate of Employer's contributions established under such Health Plan."
Consistent with the above provisions, the pattern and rate of contributions to the Health Plan on behalf of musicians and the benefits provided thereunder have for many years been in conformity with those provided under the I.A.T.S.E. & M.P.M.O. Basic Agreement. The parties further recognize that the upcoming negotiations between the IATSE and the Employers represented by the AM PTP for a new IATSE Basic Agreement may result in an agreed-upon reduction or modification of benefits and/or increases in the standards for eligibility, an increase in the rate of employer contributions to the Fund, or a new requirement for a cents-per-hour employee contribution.

During the course of the 1993 negotiations for the Basic Television and Basic Theatrical Motion Picture Agreements, the AFM expressed its concern that allowing documentary programs to fall under the "news" use provision of Article 8A.(a) of the Agreements may result in reuses of music sound track not intended by the parties.
To that extent, the Producers have agreed that, with respect to documentary programs, in order to meet the "news" use requirements of Article 8A.(a), the reuse of music from a motion picture sound track must accompany the footage for which such music was originally recorded.

Dear Steve:
This will confirm that the formula for determining percentage payments into the Special Payments Fund, as set forth in Article 14(b)(i)(5) of the AFM Basic Television Motion Picture Agreement of 1996, shall also apply in the following circumstances:
Supplemental Markets payments which were due for any motion picture prior to May 1, 1992 may be prorated in accordance with the formula set forth in the above-mentioned Articles, provided that such picture satisfies the criteria for prorating set forth therein and, provided further, that such payments had not, prior to the effective date of this letter agreement, been remitted to the Special Payments Fund at the full one percent (1%) rate. (Supplemental Markets payments which were due for a motion picture prior to May 1, 1992 may not be prorated, even if the picture satisfies the criteria for proration, if such payments had been remitted to the Special Payments Fund at the full one percent (1%) rate.)
The Producer may also prorate Supplemental Markets payments due after May 1, 1992 on any motion picture in accordance with the formula set forth in the above-mentioned Articles with respect to a motion picture which meets the criteria for proration set forth in the above-mentioned Articles.

Reference is made to the provisions of Paragraph 15(a)(5)(iv)(B) of the 1999 Basic Television Motion Picture Agreement. During the 1999 negotiations, the parties agreed to revise the last sentence of that clause to read as follows:
“As used herein, television shows produced for ‘network prime time’ , exhibition means shows produced for ABC, CBS, NBC or any other
entity which qualifies as a ‘network’ under Section 73.662(f) of the rules of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), unless the FCC determines that such entity is not a ‘network’ for the purposes of such Section, and aired during the hours of 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard or Daylight Time, Pacific Standard or Daylight Time), Monday through Saturday, or 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard or Daylight Time, Pacific Standard or Daylight Time) on Sunday.”
