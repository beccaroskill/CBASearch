SIDE LETTER REGARDING SECTION 4.02 - UNION STEWARDS
In an effort to. avoid problems for employees who also act in the capacity of Union Stewards, it is necessary to establish guidelines so those employees adhere to the Employer’s rules and policies, continue their work for the Employer without interruption,, and still have the ability to fulfill their obligations, as a Union Steward. The Union and the Employer therefore agree to the following guidelines.	'■ ;■•••- ../■ • ?> ..	•	;.
1.	Before any employee can be recognized or function as a. Union Steward, the Employer must receive from the Union an authorization letter appointing the.employee as a Union Steward for the department in which the employee works and stating whether such Union Steward is permitted:to engage in meetings/ Such authorization may be general for various issues^ meetings and/or grievancc(s) but in all cases shall specifically state the scope of that Union Steward’s authority (for example whether the Steward can sign off on a settlement of a grievance) and the effective date and termination date of such authority.
2.	There will normally;be'ohly/one (1) Union Steward ■appointed by the Union per shift per
department in which bargaining unit employees are employed, but if a .department is unusually large, the Union may select more than one (1). If the Employer asserts that there are too many Union Stewards, the parties agree to consult and discuss ways to limit the number.
3.	Employees acting as Union Stewards must obtain a proper photo ID badge, through the same procedure Union representatives obtain such badges, for off-duty use to enter the service areas of the Employer’s facilities. All procedures relating to badges for Union representatives shall apply equally to badges issued to Union Stewards.
4.	Employees acting as Union Stewards who conduct business while off-duty must sign in at a location designated by the Employer to provide evidence that the individual is on the property as an agent of the Union and not as an employee, and must sign out if the Steward leaves the Employer’s property after the business has concluded.
5.	Employees acting as Union Stewards may not engage in discussions of Union business with co-workers, including the subject matters referenced in Section 4.02, while either the Shop Steward or the co-worker is on work time, unless the Employer’s designated representative provides specific written authorization to the Union Steward. Such discussions may be conducted while both employees are not on work time, including while on authorized breaks or lunch periods. Under no circumstances shall an appointed Steward engage in his/her Steward’s activities with a coworker who is on work time.
6.	Employees acting as Union Stewards may become involved in investigatory meetings with the Employer only when such meetings may reasonably lead to discipline of a coworker and only if requested by the coworker.
7.	Employees acting as Union Stewards requesting copies of documents or information regarding a coworker must make such requests to the Executive Office.
73
Las Vegas Hotel & Casino
8.	Employees acting as Union Stewards: must provide the Executive Office with their regular work schedule and advise of any changes to their schedule, as well as all written authorization from the Union to conduct the business referenced in Section'4.02:
9.	Employees acting as Union Stewards must keep confidential any information obtained regarding coworker’s problems, including their health condition, medical information, and/or discipline and not discuss such information with other employees who are not involved.
10.	Employees acting as Union Stewards must attend and successfully complete the Union’s shop steward training program.
